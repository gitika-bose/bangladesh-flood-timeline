Combining the output of 19 different computer models, British and Swedish scientists showed that Britain and a swath of northern Europe from Germany through Finland and Russia were most likely to see extremely wet winters. The watersheds feeding the Brahmaputra and other nearby rivers that contribute to floods in Bangladesh were the likeliest to see extreme summer rains, according to the study, which was published in the journal Nature.",

    "lead_paragraph": " In the mind's eye, a one-way procession of flickering oil lamps sways along the muddy shanko between rice paddies and flooded ponds, and finally disappears into a distant wall of impenetrable jungle. Banks of fog rise from warmer waters, mingle with smoke from the cooking fires, and press in a dense sooty collar, a permeable gray wall that parts, then seals, igniting a winter chorus of retching coughs and loud spitting. Tuberculosis is everywhere. The air, the water, the soil are septic. Thirty-five years is a long life. Smog obscures the moon and dims the man-made light to faintness deeper than the stars'. In such darkness perspective disappears. It is a two-dimensional world impossible to penetrate. But for the intimacy of shared discomfort, it is difficult even to estimate the space separating each traveler. ",

Mr. Abdullah, the trumpeter, was an interesting figure in the late 1980's jazz scene: a free-jazz musician intrigued by rhythmic vamps that gave his work a cohesion. (He played briefly with the great drummer Ed Blackwell as well as with the tenor saxophonist David S. Ware.) He has been in charge of booking Sista's Place, a new storefront jazz spot, and here presents his own band. Tomorrow at 9 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $15 (Ben Ratliff).",

In the 1960's and 70's, aside from ski trips to Vermont, our family pretty much stayed home. For my parents, a trip to Bermuda was the height of adventure.    Then everything changed. Airline deregulation and a spike in disposable income; the raising of the Iron Curtain; global A.T.M.'s; the aptly named World Wide Web, conjuring vacation paradises at a keystroke: it all added up to a revolution in travel. A few years ago, when I was teaching a college writing class, one of my students requested a week's extension on a paper that was due during our winter break. He'd fax it to me, he said -- from Katmandu. Suddenly, everyone was going everywhere.  ",
