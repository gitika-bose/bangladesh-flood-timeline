As a sign of the current economic climate, the event, which was held at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan by a private job fair organizer called National Career Centers-USA Inc., offered a bleak snapshot of New York City's economic mood. Recent college graduates rubbed elbows with jaded longtime jobholders who had either been laid off or who feared the prospect was imminent. Along a line that snaked around four city blocks from Madison to Vanderbilt Avenues on East 45th and 46th Streets, well-dressed people carrying attache cases talked of recesssion, of months without income, of dreams scaled down. Billing the event as a minority professional recruiting center, advertisements said the focus would be on \"women, African-American, Asian, Hispanic, American Indian, over-40, veteran and disabled professionals,\" and indeed the crowd seemed diverse, although there seemed to be few people over 50 years old in attendance.",

Waiting for sanctions to work would strengthen Iraqi defenses and weaken the coalition facing Iraq, he said. Page A1    A peaceful solution worries Israel, several influential Government leaders said. They warned that Saddam Hussein should not be left with his army and weapons intact. A13    Hundreds of Iraqi children have died because of what Iraq said was a shortage of medicine caused by international sanctions, the Iraqi Health Minister said. A13    U.N. committee votes to condemn Iraqi rights violations A12    Turkey's military chief quits in dispute over the gulf crisis A13    Lebanon's Christian militia withdrew entirely from Beirut, leaving the Lebanese Army closer to its goal of reuniting Beirut for the first time in 15 years of civil war. A11 In Algiers, bananas are emblematic of economic troubles A9    A violent army mutiny in Argentina was put down by troops loyal to President Menem. About 300 rebels briefly held the Army headquarters. At least 13 people were reportedly killed, including five civilians. A1    Black Cubans say Castro fails to deliver equality A15 News analysis: The German election underscored the sense that the new Germany, reunited after 45 years, has finally returned to its place in the ranks of normal nations. A20    Economics Minister of Germany resigns unexpectedly A20    Russians would be able to own farms under a program approved by the Russian Parliament, but the plan stopped short of allowing the private sale of land between farmers. A20    Austria decides not to deport 1,200 Romanians A18    The leader of Bulgaria's main opposition party resigns A19    South Africa has imposed curfews on four black townships near Johannesburg after a new outbreak of factional violence that has claimed 71 lives since Sunday. A3    Liberia's capital is calm; workers prepare to distribute food A10    Afghanistan's provisional leaders have begun an election in areas controlled by guerrillas. The vote, which comes two years after they formed a government in exile, is being criticized as too restrictive.
