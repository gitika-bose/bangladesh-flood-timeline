    "abstract": "  LOS BANOS, THE PHILIPPINES    IN the shadow of verdant tropical mountains, scientists have developed a number of promising new   strains of rice in an effort to extend the Green   Revolution to the hundreds of millions of Asians it has thus far failed to reach.    The new varieties promise to give high yields without the costly irrigation required by the earlier ''miracle'' rice strains developed at the International Rice Research Institute here. The new strains have not yet been tested in farmers' fields, but one particularly promising variety has produced test yields more than twice as large as those from traditional varieties.   If this and other new varieties being developed are successful, the resulting increase in the production of rice in nonirrigated areas would benefit the diets and household incomes of many of the two billion people, mostly in the developing countries of Asia, who eat rice as their staple and sell any surplus in good years.   From 1960 to 1980, average yields in tropical Asia increased 40 percent, and the development of high-yielding varieties of rice was one of the main reasons for the improvement. But in the poorest nations that need it most - half the food energy consumed in developing nations comes from rice - the benefits of this Green Revolution have been limited, largely because these countries are least able to afford the irrigation and commercial fertilizer that make it possible.",

Norton & Company. $17.95.\n\n\n\n\nEVER on the periphery of Western consciousness and central to the global climate and economy, the forests of the earth's tropical zones are being destroyed at an alarming rate. If the destruction continues, one million species of plants and animals could become extinct by the turn of the century. Yet the authors of ''Tropical Nature'' and ''The Primary Source'' avoid the sentimentality for lost worlds that often characterizes such arguments, to the rage of developing nations and the frustration of conservationists. In both books, the emphasis falls on empirical data; and in terms accessible to the lay reader, the authors argue forcefully that we neglect tropical forests at our peril.",

By the time the sun rises above the far bank, casting an ocher band across the half-mile-wide expanse of water, Brahmans have installed themselves under shoreside umbrellas that look like giant mushrooms, ready to guide the pilgrims. From a nearby temple come the sounds of bells, a conch and a raga played on a sitar.    The sun turns gold, and thousands of pilgrims along the four miles of ghats flock to the water's edge to welcome and worship the source of all earthly existence. Fully dressed, they immerse themselves in the river, scooping it up in cupped hands or brass vessels to offer it to Surya, the sun god.",

    "abstract": "  Below, a sampling of views on population and its consequences from experts and leaders around the world.  Robert S. McNamara    Former President of the World Bank, in Foreign Affairs (Summer 1984)      After centuries of steady acceleration, overall growth rates during the last decade and a half have turned downward. This decline in the rate of population growth has led many observers to believe that the world in general, and most individual countries as well, no longer face serious population problems and, therefore, that efforts to deal with such problems can be relaxed. But this assessment is simply wrong. The fertility change which has occurred during the last decade or two has been very uneven. In particular, the statistical decline for the developing countries as a whole, and indeed for the world, is heavily skewed by the special experience of China. In many other parts of the developing world, including much of Africa, a large part of South Asia, and some countries of Latin America, no measurable or significant drop in fertility has occurred.",

There are also good supplies of edible local mushrooms for foragers who know where to look and what to pick to put in the pot. For those who feel timid about approaching such a potentially hazardous diversion the Queens Botanical Garden in Flushing is offering help.   On Oct. 7 members of the Long Island Mycological Society will be on hand at the Botanical Garden from 2 to 4 P.M. to identify mushrooms found by uncertain foragers and show how to distinguish the edible from the poisonous.",

In this posthumous collection of stories, fey mortals and all-too-mortal fairies abound. Of the 20 pieces - several of which appeared in The New Yorker over the past 40 years - most concern themselves with the real world; the rest take place in the imaginary, politically sensitive Kingdoms of Elfin. Whether writing naturalistically about village life in England, or fantastically about the destinies of elves, Sylvia Townsend Warner (who wrote in a wide variety of genres, including poetry) works her curious trick of showing how one thing does indeed lead to another, often in the most alarming way. ''Some Effects of a Hat'' is typical: an American tourist leaves his homburg behind in a chance encounter with an unmarried, unpopular woman living in Devonshire. Expecting him to come back for it and unwilling to let the expensive hat sink into the oblivion of daily neglect like ''the inexplicable key on the bathroom window sill, the dog-eared packet of wallflower seed behind the parlour clock,'' the woman keeps it spruced and ready on the table near her front door. Her hostile neighbors get suspicious of a man's hat (''It's been moved a good inch to the right since I saw it last Tuesday''), and she is eventually driven out of town, only to end up in Derbyshire and a new life. Warner's effects are especially delightful when characters appear in several stories.",

In Bangladesh, Mrs. Fenwick said in an interview, a group of 20 poor women were given a loan of $170 by the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The women used the money to buy cows to start a small dairy business and put themselves on the road to modest economic well-being.   ''I think that IFAD, bar none, is one of the most hopeful agencies that we have,'' Mrs. Fenwick, a former New Jersey member of Congress, said. ''What does IFAD do? It is not handouts to alleviate suffering, it is attention paid to the poor and the landless.''",

Gandhi, the most commanding figure in modern Indian history. She was often accused of trying to build an Indian dynasty by planning to have her son Sanjay succeed her, and after his death in a plane crash in 1980 she was said to be arranging for her other son, Rajiv, to fill her role. \n\nAs Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi presided over the world's most populous democracy, a nation of 700 million people. During her tenure the Government made limited headway against such age-old Indian problems as overpopulation, hunger, caste, inadequate sanitation and chronic religious strife among the majority Hindus, Moslems and other sects.",

India, with about 1.2 million men and women in the three armed services, ranks after China, the Soviet Union and the United States, in that order, in terms of the numbers of people under arms and in uniform.    Some units of the army, the oldest of the three services, are more than 200 years old. They saw action in the Indian Mutiny of 1857 and in both world wars, and have fought four wars since India became independent from Britain in 1947. Unlike those of other poor nations, the Indian armed forces have remained uninvolved in politics.",

An ''international Japan,'' the thinking goes, will obviously not be treated like the old Japan, which earned enemies by its insularity, its exclusive preoccupation with selling its products and its potential for military menace.    How much the country worries about its reputation was evident last week when Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's Cabinet adopted a $217 billion budget, which was the most austere in 29 years. Few agencies escaped the budget cutters and only two programs received sizable increases. Not coincidentally, both have international dimensions - defense and foreign economic aid.",

More than 30 Senators and 200 Representatives have co-sponsored a bill to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a measure that the Administration says would be disastrous to American interests.    But many of the co-sponsors, who signed the legislation out of principle or out a desire to win favor from pro- Israeli constituents, or both, are privately saying they have created a monster that they hope will be killed before it comes to a vote.   The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the leading pro-Israel lobby in Congress, is officially supporting the bill, but did not originate it. It was introduced by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who has been pushing the issue for four years, saying the bill should be passed as a sign of American support for Israel.",

Now, as somber oil ministers confer in Geneva at an emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, declining world demand for oil and rising production have changed the picture.   Their economies still reeling from the $5-a-barrel cut in oil prices in March 1983, the ministers will now try to agree on price cuts or lower production quotas. Either method will mean less revenue, which experts say will be painful for all and economically excruciating for a few.   Nine of the 13 OPEC members depend on oil for more than 90 percent of their export income, and for several the figure is 99 percent.",

    "abstract": "  TIPS FROM THE SOPHISTICATED TRAVELER SUMMER COOLERS    As Russian As Vodka     In Russia, summer's thirst- quencher is kvass. Mobile tanks of the frothy, fizzy, sour brew, each manned by a sturdy matron in a once- white smock, appear on street corners the day the fur hats are put away. Twelve kopecks (about 15 cents) buys a full liter, dispensed in a communal mug that gets sloshed out over a jet of water between customers. The lines move quickly - lingering over a drink is certain to draw comments from parched Russians waiting for a turn at the mug.   The brownish beverage, brewed from fermenting rye flour or rye bread, malt and sugar, is not particularly refined. Visitors tend to shy away at first from the brackish taste and the shared mugs. But the forewarned tourist can bring his own vessel, and the taste grows on you, particularly after a three-hour hike through the un-air-conditioned halls of the Tretyakov Art Gallery.",

Pranay Gupte, a former New York Times foreign correspondent, is the author of ''The Crowded Earth: People and the Politics of Population,'' from which this article is adapted.    ON AN ORDINARY afternoon at the bustling Turkish bazaar inside the old S-Bahnhof in West Berlin, Ehmet Tutkoli waited for customers at his shoeshine booth. Throughout the former train station on Bulowstrasse, the din of Oriental music rose from the dozen or so stores selling cassettes, and the aroma of strong coffee blended with that of fresh-baked baklava. Children darted about, occasionally chased by their mothers, wearing patterned scarves and large billowing dresses, or yelled at by their fathers, languidly playing chess or checkers in coffee stalls.",
