Largely as a result, renewable resources will become increasingly scarce. The total area of rich agricultural land will shrink, and many remaining virgin forests will be lost. Overuse and pollution of aquifers, rivers and other water supplies will continue, and the thinning of the ozone layer will probably worsen.",

That's the good news. The less happy report is that one wishes it were better. It's not just that the restaurant itself is so lackluster -- a large, characterless room in a freestanding building, with wood-veneer booths, low ceiling and tile flooring. None of that would matter if the food tasted fresher and had more zest and zip. It wasn't bad; in fact, a few dishes were actually delicious, but many others tasted as though the kitchen were just going through the motions.",

    "abstract": "  Abdul B. Khan took enough pride in the Afghan-Persian restaurant he opened in April to give it his own name. And he made sure the restaurant lived up to the name.   The pride is evident in the simple but neat 28-seat storefront dining room, with its rich red carpet and single red carnation on each small table. One long mirrored wall helps brighten the otherwise dim room. The other long wall is adorned with small, handsome Persian rugs. It is also evident in the sweetly attentive service, in which a waiter offers to go down the block in a cold rain to buy beer. (Khan has no liquor license.) And it is evident in Mr. Khan himself, who not only does all the cooking but also makes frequent trips to the dining room to make sure all is well.",

Midweek found many of them at the annual New Jersey Vegetable Growers' Association at the Taj Mahal casino, where the talk was about the annual gamble that absorbs them all: what will the grocery shoppers want this year?   Will it be the slender Oriental eggplant or the imposing white ghost buster, only two of the six eggplants and 75 varieties of vegetables that Robert J. Matarazzo is starting as greenhouse seedlings, to be transplanted to his fields in Belvidere in April. Should John Formisani put out more escarole or endive this year, or should it be radicchio or arugula, to make up for five and a half acres of romaine lettuce he plowed under last fall, when the price at the Vineland Produce Auction fell so low that it barely covered the cost of the carton? Will anise be this year's star herb, the next cilantro, which was the next basil?",

Egypt is cracking down on radical Islamic fundamentalists, and one reason officials give is that the terrorists' campaign is harming the country's $3 billion tourist industry, Egypt's largest source of foreign revenue.

A ruthless drought that had aid donors touting Mozambique as the next Somalia has been broken by quenching rains, and the country is carpeted with corn. Peace Plus Rain    Here in the fertile northwest, refugees who fled the insurgent Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo, are streaming home from border camps in Malawi and rebuilding the cane huts burned by the rebels.

    "abstract": "  \"I HOPE to go home someday,\" said the neatly dressed young man. \"The problems of this country are too great for me to stay. There is too much discrimination here.\"   Francel Aguirre, a slightly built 27-year-old Ecuadorean, spoke quietly about his life as a member of the village of Ossining's largest group of new immigrants. He was surrounded by the friendly faces of fellow members of his English-as-a-second-language class, in the Ossining School District Office on Croton Avenue.    The village of Ossining has one of the largest concentrations of Ecuadoreans in the county; there are also growing populations in Croton-on-Hudson and Peekskill.   The teachers of English as a second language had organized a lunchtime party to celebrate their students' progress and allow them to share native foods. The 20 people included a man from Mexico City, a woman from Korea, a woman from Japan and a man from Bangladesh.    Mr. Aguirre said: \"The different races cannot live together here. They must always stay apart. Ecuadoreans are victims of so many things, and we can say nothing. We don't do anything bad. We just work hard, and they give us a hard time.\" Census Figures Analyzed    Outside the shelter of such institutions as the English-as-a-second-language classroom, Mr. Aguirre and his fellow Ecuadoreans say they are often victims of crime and discrimination.    According to 1990 census figures, the white population in the village of Ossining grew at a rate of 2 percent between 1980 and 1990. The population of nonwhites, as the census report puts it, grew by 44 percent, and the Hispanic population (which can be of any race) increased by 113 percent. By 1990, there were 3,692 Hispanic people in the village, whose population at that time was 22,582. Many village residents estimate that there are at least several thousand Ecuadoreans living and working in Ossining, legally or illegally, making them the largest group of recent immigrants in the village. Of the village's 22,000 or so residents, 4,350 in 1990 were foreign born.   Ossining Union Free School District statistics show that, as of last March, Ecuadorean children represented the largest immigrant group, with 35 newly arrived students in a school population of 3,281. The next largest groups were from Jamaica, Colombia, Peru, Portugal and Haiti.  Students who have lived in this country for longer than three years are not counted in the yearly school district new-immigrant census, so the actual number of immigrant students is much higher.   Officials at St. Ann's School, one of two Roman Catholic schools in Ossining, also say that their largest group of new immigrants is from Ecuador, with 11 children out of a total of 285 in the last school year.    But many Ecuadorean men come to Ossining without their families, work at transitory jobs in landscaping and construction and are uncounted. As large as the Ecuadorean population seems, it is hard to gauge without census designations more specific than \"Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican and other Hispanic\" and without children to be counted in the school census. There were 2,312 \"other Hispanic\" residents in the village, according to the census.   Like many of them, Mr. Aguirre left his parents, two brothers and a sister at home in Ecuador and has lived with his uncle and brother in an apartment near the Sing Sing Correctional Facility for five years. A baker who works nights, he said he had been denied a green card (the common name for the alien registration card), but he said he would try again.   The card is obtained when either a close family member is a legal resident or an employer files a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service asking that the person be granted lawful permanent resident status. Some applications are processed quickly. Some are more complicated. Many illegal immigrants fall prey to fraudulent schemes promising a green card.    Mr. Aquirre said he was attacked while walking along Spring Street in the village. His attackers yelled, \"Speak English!\" before roughing him up, he said. He added that banks will not open accounts without Social Security numbers and that Ecuadoreans are frequently beaten and robbed for their savings, which they carry with them.    Anibal Gonzalez Jr., who is of Puerto Rican descent, is one of two Hispanic police officers in the village of Ossining who have tried to explain American life to the newest Spanish-speaking immigrants. He said, \"If they're going to get into trouble, it's because they're drinking and then driving, or sometimes they wander into certain areas and guys will hassle them.\"   Mr. Gonzalez added: \"We see them with their pockets torn and their faces bloody, or the victims of a car crash, and they refuse medical care. They think the hospitals won't treat their emergency needs.    \"Or they refuse to report a crime to us. They're afraid of being found out if they're here illegally and being deported. We try to straighten them out and tell them that they have to trust the system a little more.\"    Reacting to the Ecuadoreans' fear of authority, Dr. Emil Nigro, director of emergency medicine at the Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in neighboring North Tarrytown, said, \"We never, never turn anyone away.\" He said that not only does his emergency room evaluate everyone who comes to them and treat them if needed but that it also does not require identification or insurance. Only a few simple questions are asked at admission and, Dr. Nigro added, \"All records are confidential.\" He added that in most cases hospitals must absorb the cost of emergency room visits by illegal aliens.   Diego Santiago, a Colombian-born police officer who lives in Ossining, has visited St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church on Eastern Avenue to tell Hispanic men how to protect themselves. St. Ann's is known as the immigrants' church in the community.   \"Walk in groups, never alone,\" Officer Santiago said. \"Don't drink to drunkenness. Don't carry large amounts of cash. Don't be afraid of the police.\" The Rev. Frank Oliverio has told these groups that they may feel free to keep their strongboxes with their savings in his rectory, just across the street from St. Ann's. About 350 Hispanic families attend the Spanish Masses at St. Ann's, but the church also offers special Masses in Italian, Portuguese and Korean. St. Ann's also serves many second- and third-generation Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans.    Father Oliverio said he hopes to form a support group for Ecuadoreans and other Hispanic men in this country without their families.    Not all Hispanic men are disillusioned. Luis Pani, a 31-year-old laborer, said he has never been assaulted. \"Maybe that's why I'm so happy here,\" he said. Although he has been unsuccessful in obtaining a green card, Mr. Pani, a bachelor, has formed a network of friends and made a life for himself in Ossining.  He has become active in St. Ann's Church and has become a familiar and popular figure in his English-as-a-second-language classes.    \"America is a country of green fields, blue-eyed blond girls, wonderful summers and houses with green gardens and lawnmowers,\" he said. \"That is my dream, to have a house in the suburbs, a wife, a couple of kids and a lawnmower that can blow the leaves in the fall.\"   Marcia Siguenza, an Ecuadorean who recently moved to North Tarrytown after nine years in Ossining, worries about the social havoc caused by the mostly male migration from Ecuador. \"It is sad, very sad,\" she said. \"The men are coming to this country without their wives. Sometimes they remarry here, but it is not really a marriage. They do this because it helps them get a green card.    \"It is breaking up the families in Ecuador. In some places in southern Ecuador, there are no men, only women. And there are bad men who are selling visas for too much, $4,000, which takes many years to pay off with interest.\"    Ms. Siguenza, who has an Alien Registration Card, the so-called green card, is the supervisor of housekeeping at Kings College in Briarcliff. Her four grown children have done well in life, she said. But she said she failed to understand why so many young Ecuadorean men chose this country over their own. \"They have a nice, simple life in Ecuador,\" she said. \"Maybe not with TV or cars. But there's too much here. It's a big transformation for them, and they're not really ready for it. They come mostly from the farms, from the countryside.\"   Jose and Zoila Illescas have four children they left in Ecuador in the care of grandparents. The Illescases are both working, he in construction and she as a housecleaner. They have green cards and eagerly await the day they can afford to bring their children to the United States.  An Unofficial Protector    Carlos Castro, a constable and court officer, is a second-generation Colombian-American who has lived in Ossining for 25 years. He is an unofficial protector and adviser to the newest Hispanic immigrants who end up in the village courtroom. He said he is appalled by their living conditions. \"Many homes have them stacked up inside,\" Mr. Castro said.  \"But you wouldn't know it from the street.\"   Frank Vardy, an immigration authority from the New York City Department of City Planning, suggested that the Ecuadoreans are similar to the immigrant groups who preceded them. Those Ecuadoreans who choose to return to their native country are \"much like the Italian 'birds of passage' from the late 1800's and early 1900's,\" he said.   \"Those men came and lived cheaply and sent money home to the wife and children,\" Mr. Vardy said. \"Then, after 5 or 10 years, they went home with a bankroll and bought a farm or opened up a business.\"    Despite his steady job as a baker, Mr. Aguirre said he has been disillusioned and feels estranged. He added that he must continue working hard, living simply and watching his back if he is ever to be able to return home with anything to show for his time here.",

At the hotel, which is named for one of the world's most exquisite Buddhist temples, you will gently come awake each morning to the sound of chanting from the nearby Istiqlal mosque, said to be the second largest outside Mecca. Most likely, these haunting songs of devotion, so like a distant call to some part of yourself long forgotten, will pull you toward your balcony and out into the humid heat of the bustling Indonesian capital. There, as you peer at the perpetually busy street below -- crowded with Japanese cars, motorcycles and the bicycle rickshaws called becaks -- and at the gleaming skyscrapers that rise above the traffic's fumes, you will see yet another aspect of a dizzyingly diverse island.\n\nI had come to Java with my wife, Joan, for a two-week stay, in part to give a series of lectures on multiculturalism in American literature. But my interest in Java was more than academic; as a student of philosophy and the martial arts and as a Buddhist layman, I had for years wanted to experience the East at first hand. But nothing had prepared me for the sensory overload that we were to encounter daily, or for the rich history of an island where man had lived since the Pleistocene epoch -- some 500,000 years.",

Most likely, these haunting songs of devotion, so like a distant call to some part of yourself long forgotten, will pull you toward your balcony and out into the humid heat of the bustling Indonesian capital. There, as you peer at the perpetually busy street below -- crowded with Japanese cars, motorcycles and the bicycle rickshaws called becaks -- and at the gleaming skyscrapers that rise above the traffic's fumes, you will see yet another aspect of a dizzyingly diverse island.",

On a late morning, just before the start of fall classes, Brown undergraduates in backpacks and Birkenstocks flow past its steps, heading for the cappuccino bars and bookstores of Thayer Street, the main campus shopping avenue. But inside the international center, incoming students from more than 80 nations, some just hours off the plane, are being given the drill on basic survival tactics, learning what alumni and parents are rarely told, what many students discover too late: no American campus in the 1990's is as idyllic as it looks.   \"If threatened, do not -- how do you spell 'struggle' in English?\" mutters a doctoral candidate from South Korea. In the back row, an agitated hand. \"With 34 assaults near this campus last year, do you recommend that we equip ourselves with stun guns or Mace?\" (\"He's from Beirut,\" whispers a Danish student.)",
