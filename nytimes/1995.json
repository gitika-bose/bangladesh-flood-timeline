With great weight of snow,  The tight rope snaps back.     -- Itto Nishimoto, haiku poet, 1907-1991    WITH its neon lights and heated toilet seats and cellular faxes, the great trading city of Kobe a week ago seemed a citadel of modernity and affluence and internationalism, an antipodean New York with more sushi. Then the ground opened up Tuesday and unleashed an inferno that killed more than 4,000 people and returned part of western Japan to a primeval condition that would have been recognizable to the people who lived in Japan thousands of years ago.    The earthquake was a horrific reminder that prosperity and technology cannot insulate a country from its natural environment. The familiar pattern of Japanese history -- development, disaster and reconstruction -- is now being repeated in Kobe and the surrounding cities as residents search the smoldering rubble for the bodies of their friends and try to rebuild homes and businesses that took a lifetime to create.",

Almost since the time of the two Viking missions in 1976, planetary scientists have focused attention on the region of Antarctica known as the dry valleys -- a network of glacial gorges and valleys transecting the Royal Society mountain range and leading to the west coast of the Ross Sea. As a result of high winds that sweep away the snow and the mountain range that obstructs the downward flow of ice from the polar plateau, the valleys are almost bare of snow and ice.",

So I came to Haiti to ask U.S. soldiers in the peacekeeping mission here: What have you learned that might be helpful for your comrades in Bosnia? Here are the lessons they offered:         Define success as something you can achieve in a year. U.S. peacekeepers in Haiti defined success as giving Haiti a decent chance to develop into the Dominican Republic -- its poor Caribbean neighbor, which at least has some democracy, a functioning economy and stability. They're not building Sweden here. I witnessed a meeting President Aristide held with some visiting U.S. dignitaries. At the end, an American clergyman present asked all the guests to bow their heads and pray that they had begun to turn Haiti \"from misery into poverty.\" By that yardstick, the U.S. mission in Haiti could be judged a success.

    "abstract": "  MOST visitors do not come to New York for mild sensations. They want the big roller-coaster ride, with noise, lights and lots of shrieking. They're looking for the place encapsulated in the title of a recent British book about New York, \"Maximum City.\"   But just as yang must have its yin, so max must have its min. The mind can handle only so many powerful impressions before begging for mercy. Those of us who live here cherish certain little corners and byways that slow down the city's pulse rate and ease its tendency to hyperventilate. These quiet spots, usually off the beaten track, are just as much a part of New York as Rockefeller Center or Radio City. You just have to look a little harder for them.   A five-star New York day could begin with the riverside esplanade at the edge of Carl Schurz Park, on the Upper East Side. The park runs along East End Avenue from 84th Street to 90th Street, a long hike from the Lexington Avenue subway stop at 86th Street. It is best known as the site of Gracie Mansion, a dignified old clapboard affair that serves as the mayor's official residence. In truth, habitues of the park barely glance toward the old pile, most of it screened off by a gray wood fence. Anyone with a hankering for fresh air, sunshine and a river view heads right for the esplanade.  On a recent sunny day, sunbathers were scattered all over the park -- on little patches of grass, on green wooden benches, on the brick-and-concrete columns that set off the flower beds at the center of the broad promenade. On benches that had not been claimed by sunbathers, couples sat and chatted next to lone readers. Urban dogs, out for a brisk walk, panted with the happy expression of animals who knew they were on to a good thing.    This is a slice of the city that everyone should taste, a public space that lifts the spirits. New Yorkers tend to see the city as an arena of conflict and competition. It's remarkable to see the change in human behavior that a bit of green, open air and flowing water can accomplish. Dog walkers greet one another, people have been known to nod or say hello to strangers, and even homely babies get a full day's worth of admiration as they are pushed along in a stroller.   Walk toward the north end of the esplanade, and look at the Triborough Bridge and the appealing blue-green span of the footbridge to Wards Island. Walk south and take in the sight of the Queensboro Bridge. Look across the river at the red-and-white smokestacks of Con Edison's biggest generating station, in Long Island City (known as \"Big Allis,\" after Allis Chalmers, the company that made the generators), and at the cool aquamarine Citicorp skyscraper rearing up to the ridiculous height of 45 stories in a three-story borough. It would be nice to say that fat trout and largemouth bass can be seen leaping from the waters of the East River, but that would be an exaggeration. The occasional pleasure craft provides diversion for the eye, though. And the mere sight of the river makes a sizzling day seem 10 degrees cooler.    New York, as E. B. White famously remarked, is a city of neighborhoods. It still is, although the visitor to Manhattan can be forgiven for finding it hard to make out the outlines of one. It's a little easier in the so-called outer boroughs, which don't feel outer to the millions who live there. They feel like home, and anyone who wants to get the feel of New York should spend at least a half day exploring places like Cobble Hill and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, or Sunnyside and Ridgewood in Queens.   May I suggest Astoria, in Queens? It's close to Manhattan, just a jump across the East River. It is also the place I know best, after living there for 15 years. It's a lively, unpretentious sort of place, inhabited primarily by Greeks and Italians, but also offering an ethnic smorgasbord ranging from Brazilians to Ukrainians to Bangladeshis.   Take the N train from 59th Street and Lexington Avenue, making sure to look back at the Manhattan skyline as the train rises above ground and threads its way along the approach to the Queensboro Bridge. Proceed three stops to Broadway.    Broadway is one of the main arteries of the neighborhood, its Boulevard St. Germain, so to speak. Like Ditmars Boulevard and 30th Avenue a little farther north in Astoria, it has the restaurants and the night spots. It has the butcher, the baker and, if not the candlestick maker, certainly the finest selection of sculptured Greek deities you're likely to find outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art.    The neighborhood has a cultural ornament, the American Museum of the Moving Image, two blocks south of Broadway, on 35th Avenue at 36th Street in the Kaufman-Astoria film studio complex. The museum pre sents tasty film programs, like a Spike Lee retrospective beginning Saturday, and it has a permanent collection devoted to the art, history and technology of motion pictures, television and video. The enormous warehouses surrounding it are sound stages, where films like \"The Cocoanuts\" and \"The Front Page\" were made back in the 20's and 30's. Filming resumed here in the 1980's, and Hollywood stars slip in and out unobtrusively, unnoticed by Astorians. The operation is extremely low-key, and no studio tours are offered.   The neighborhood is the thing, anyway. Take a stroll eastward on Broadway and have a bite at Karyatis restaurant near 35th Street. The popular spot on the street is Uncle George's, a Greek restaurant that offers a lot of food for a little money in Spartan (surely the right word here) surroundings. Lines often spill out on the sidewalk. Karyatis offers a more refined interpretation of Greek cuisine in a fairly tony room. Before entering, look down the block and behold the melting pot. Broadway between 35th and 36th Streets has an Italian restaurant called the Bank, a fabulous Ukrainian meat store with garlicky sausages that hang overhead like horse collars, and an Italian deli, not to mention Walter's hardware and Quinn's funeral parlor. Look a little farther down the street, to the Atlantic Bank in the middle of the next block. One day about 10 years ago, a former cabdriver walked in, withdrew his life savings of $30,000, and threw the money up in the air outside the bank in a grand gesture of defiance, despair, jubilation, or some combination of the above. It made quite a stir. Some of it was even recovered.   Wander north down some of the side streets, like 35th, 36th or 37th, and continue as far as 30th Avenue. (Yes, this is confusing and, no, you have not gone out of your mind if you find yourself at the corner of 30th Street and 30th Avenue.) The walk will take you past six-flat apartment buildings whose cheap rents make them a point of entry for immigrants, and onward to attractive blocks with one- and two-family houses, the next step up the ladder to success.   Go back to Broadway between 33d and 32d Streets and stop in at El Greco Superette, a packed little deli with a large selection of olives (try the small green Cyprus olives marinating in lemon, garlic and coriander) and every variety of feta cheese known to man, including Bulgarian and, believe it or not, French. Step in next door and have a Greek coffee, a baklava and a Metaxa brandy in Omonia, a cafe, pastry shop and conversation pit. To take the memory with you, go into the Panellinion gift store on the corner, the one with the Greek gods and temples in the window, and ask for a tape of rebetika music, the kind Zorba danced to, by the great singer George Dalaras. Buy a piping-hot loaf of Italian bread from Parisi's on your way up the stairs to the elevated station.   Proceed to Greenwich Village. At first glance the neighborhood would seem to be the last place in New York that qualified as being off the beaten track. The human herd that throngs Sixth Avenue, Washington Square Park and Seventh Avenue South makes the Village a stirring spectacle but also a pedestrian nightmare. There are times, on weekend nights, when the entire Village seems to be rehearsing a new urban performance genre, the nonviolent riot. For those who fear sensory overload, the best advice is Horace Greeley's: Go West.   In the narrow, confusing streets west of Seventh Avenue, an entirely different Village unfolds, a curious 19th-century maze so quiet that it seems as though a giant door has closed on the rest of the city. There are no mandatory sights here, only exquisite, shady blocks with beautiful Federal and Italianate town houses rubbing shoulders with classic brownstones.    Walk along Barrow Street east of Hudson and follow Commerce Street as it loops south into the tranquil backwater where the Cherry Lane Theater is located. Follow Perry Street between Bleecker and West Fourth, or Grove Street west of Bleecker. Admire old cast-iron railings, fancy stonework or curious, inexplicable features like the protruding Tudor bay window at 73 Perry. By all means head to 75 1/2 Bedford (between Morton and Commerce), the narrowest house in the village, with its Dutch-style roof. Built in 1873, it is a mere nine and a half feet wide. Edna St. Vincent Millay lived there in the 1920's.    There is no official itinerary in these parts. Just follow your feet.   As the day wanes, spirits tend to flag, feet throb, and even the most energetic brain screams out for the kind of mental massage that only a tall pint of beer can provide. The setting matters, so head uptown and pay a visit to the Landmark Tavern, at 11th Avenue and 46th Street. Built in 1868, the Landmark is an old waterfront saloon that got left behind when landfill pushed the waterfront away from it. It's a classic, part of a grand old New York fraternity that includes P. J. Clarke's on Third Avenue at 55th Street, the Old Town on East 18th Street, and Walker's on North Moore Street in Tribeca. The floors are tile, the ceiling is tin and the bar is solid mahogany. The Landmark has Bass, Murphy's Stout, Saranac and McSorley's on tap, along with a long list of single-malt whiskies and single-barrel bourbons. It does not court a trendy crowd. It does not get one.

Hundreds of communities have wrestled with Wal-Mart coming to town as it raced across rural America to become the nation's biggest retailer. For years, the script has been familiar. Wal-Mart arrives in a city creating both excitement and trepidation, a sign of a community's stature but a threat to its local shopkeepers. Small stores often shut down, unable to match the big chain's prices. Across the country, town after town has struck the same bargain by embracing the retailing juggernaut: the downtown is Wal-Mart.",

    "abstract": "  Some 15,000 vials of a colorless, odorless, waterlike liquid are lined up in trays in a room so cold, so remorselessly quiet, you can't help thinking of it as a tomb. In a way, it is. Each vial contains a one-milliliter dose of a product known as gp120, which has cost its manufacturer, Genentech, $100 million and untold grief. Is gp120, as some scientists believe, a crucial first approximation of the desperately needed vaccine to prevent AIDS? Or is it, as others say, nothing more than expensive dishwater? No one knows. Neither Genentech's product nor a similar vaccine made by Chiron Biocine has yet been tested enough to tell. So far, no vials have passed through the enormous steel doors to the loading dock beyond and from there into syringes and into the arms of the 10,000 volunteers whose bodies alone can answer the question. Instead, the vials sit and wait, with nothing to interrupt their silence but a workman's boom box, which suddenly sings out from the loading dock: \"Who'll Stop the Rain?\" The Eureka Moment   \"I was in Nigeria for cholera in 1970,\" Don Francis says fondly, as if recalling a world's fair. \"The Sudan for Ebola virus, Phoenix for hepatitis B, just about everywhere for smallpox.\" The resume of his long career with the Centers for Disease Control reads like an itinerary of miracles. In Africa, India, Bangladesh, Francis helped eradicate terrible illnesses by the bold application of vaccine programs. But here in the United States, in his disheveled office at Genentech's headquarters on San Francisco Bay, miracles keep getting derailed. To Francis, the company's vaccine evangelist, gp120 represents the best hope yet of beating AIDS, and he is determined to test it and see. An equally determined army of opponents is arrayed against him. Perhaps that's why a ceramic figure of Sheetala Mata, the Indian goddess of smallpox, is sitting on his window ledge, embracing and supposedly blessing three vials of gp120. \"They'll need all the help they can get,\" he says.",
