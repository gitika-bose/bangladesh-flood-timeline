    "abstract": "  The very name of the country, Bangladesh, stirs images of misery and, in the minds of most Westerners, the perennial poverty here is the result of some inexorable Asian fate.   Cyclones, floods, war and, above all, overpopulation are blamed for the destitution and malnutrition in this fertile alluvial delta, one of the most crowded places in the world.   Some 90 million people are jammed into a country roughly the size of Wisconsin and, in the last six years alone, women in Bangladesh have produced 14 million more mouths to feed - more than the entire population of Australia.   Despite this Malthusian presence, however, Bangladesh is probably now producing enough food to provide an adequate diet for every man, woman and child in the country. And the agricultural potential of this lush green land is such that even the inevitable population growth of the next 20 years could be fed by the resources of Bangladesh alone.",

One response to this potential crisis was the ''green revolution,'' a term first used to herald the development, by American plant geneticists working in Mexico and the Philippines, of dwarf varieties of wheat and rice capable of doubling or tripling yields per acre in those regions. The new plants had shorter, stiffer stems and, if heavily fertilized and irrigated, could produce much larger heads of grain that did not fall over from their own weight.   In the late 1960's and early 1970's, the new grains spread rapidly over wide areas of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Previously unplanted lands were opened for cultivation while plant geneticists in many developing countries refined the dwarf varieties for better adaptation to local conditions.",

The fund cited that country's failure to cut Government spending and scale back food subsidy programs.

Five days after the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman, the country is at peace, following a constitutional and orderly transfer of power to a caretaker government. Civil war and a military takeover - either of which seemed a distinct possibility just a few days ago - have both been averted in this Bengali-speaking nation, at least for the present.   ''Bangladesh today is a proud nation,'' a member of Parliament said during a round of eulogies to President Zia yesterday. ''A griefstricken nation, to be sure, but a proud nation, too. We have lived up to the democratic ideals of our martyred leader.''",

The number of workers for each rice paddy was reduced. The time of harvesting was shortened.  The community structure changed.   So when a new rice - a sturdy, fast-growing, high-yielding variety called IR-8 - was introduced in 1966, it promised something called a Green Revolution in Asia. With its introduction came the promise of eventual self-sufficiency in rice and a new way of life. This hope was stirred despite some initial controversy. In some of the countries of the Indochinese peninsula, for example, the grains were considered ''American,'' and therefore subversive, and the seed was sometimes planted there surreptitiously.",

After the coup that gave him the presidency, the soft-spoken military man was described as hard-working and incorruptible in his personal life and able to make the tough decisions needed to lift the new nation, created when it broke away from Pakistan in 1971, to its feet.   Some critics called General Zia ruthless because of the manner in which he put down internal political and military opposition. After one attempt to oust him, his critics charged, 200 soldiers were secretly tried and executed.",

That is the kind of illustration prized by the legions of aid and development experts who for years have been drawn to this country because its demographic statistics are so appalling.   The life expectancy at birth is 47 years. Eighty percent of children below the age of five are undernourished. Seventy percent of the entire population is anemic. Only one person in five can read. And, despite improvements in agricultural efficiency and the enormous quantities of foreign aid, the average per capita consumption of rice, the dietary staple, is less today than it was 20 years ago.",

The fall meeting, which President Reagan plans to attend along with the heads of state or government of 21 other nations, aspires to break the protracted deadlock between rich and poor countries in what has become known as the North-South dialogue.   ''The time has come at last to launch a great crusade to defeat fear and death, hunger and injustice,'' Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda of Mexico said at today's opening session.   Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. said this afternoon that the conference had ''got off to an extremely auspicious and promising start,'' with concensus among the ministers on several key points. He added that ''the spirit of Cancun can be captured in a phrase that I coined: shared responsibility for mutual benefit.''",

Today, the General Assembly's new President is a moon-faced 52-year-old diplomat with a reputation for a suave manner in dress and politics. His victory was due not only to the luck of the draw.  The fact that he gained as many votes, 73, as his chief rival, Khwaja Mohammed Kaiser of Bangladesh, was a triumph of individual labor over long odds. Mr. Kittani had to overcome the handicap of representing a nation that last year invaded its neighbor Iran and still regards itself at war with Israel.",

There is little doubt that in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Reagan Administration's tough stance toward Moscow, India and the United States are looking at the world very differently. But the two countries retain considerable importance for each other. The United States is India's largest trading partner, with trade this year approaching $3 billion. The Indian Government is encouraging productivity in the private sector and joint ventures with American concerns are booming. Furthermore, virtually every family within the Indian elite has relatives in the United States, where 333,000 residents of Indian descent earn the highest per capita income of any ethnic group. More Indian students are studying in the United States than in any other foreign country.",

    "abstract": "  INTENTIONS By PAUL GOLDBERGER   It may well be that no large, elaborate and expensive institutional building put up in New York in recent times has proceeded as swiftly and smoothly as the headquarters of the Asia Society, which will be dedicated at noon Tuesday. The society broke ground 17 months ago at the corner of Park Avenue and East 70th Street, and the $16.6 million eight-story museum, office and conference building, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, is nearly complete. More unusual still in these trying times for construction, it has come in within its budget.   What the $16.6 million and rapid scheduling has bought is a more complex story. This is an ambitious building, full of civilized intentions, some of which succeed and others that do not. Curiously, the building is weakest where it tries the hardest - in its exterior of red Oklahoma granite, where it struggles to put on a graceful and proud public face and ends up looking more than a slight bit confused.",

President Reagan and the others gathering at this Caribbean resort have decided in advance that they will make no hard decisions to reshape the way the world conducts business. But the 14 countries grouped as the developing south and their northern industrial supporters, notably Canada and France, hope that the two-day gathering will end with an understanding to open negotiations under United Nations auspices. Their goal is to assign control of the array of measures sought by poorer nations to a body in which each country would have one vote.",

    "abstract": "  President Reagan today renewed a United States commitment to negotiations intended to narrow the gap between rich and poor nations.   But in a speech to the opening session of the meeting here of developing and industrialized nations, he spelled out conditions for United States participation in such talks that suggested there was no significant change in Washington's basic approach to third-world issues.   His insistence that the discussions remain within the framework of international agencies disappointed many third world delegates here who regard these agencies as being dominated by wealthy countries. Talks 'Without Purpose'   President Lopez Portillo of Mexico suggested that talks in such forums would be ''without purpose, without future.'' Brazil's representative said two of the forums suggested by Mr. Reagan, the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, had not done justice to the third world's problems before and would not now. Other delegates suggested that only the United Nations could. (Page A12.)",

A Senate-House conference on the $7.2-billion spending authorization bill for foreign aid during the current fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, will resume Tuesday, taking up work suspended after one session in September.   Senate staff sources said that the decision to resume the conference came after Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., the Tennessee Republican who will lead the Senate majority next year, obtained approval for moving ahead on the bill from Mr. Reagan's transition team and other Republican leaders in the Senate and House.   Consultations also were said to be under way among Republican leaders on giving consideration during the lame duck session to a $3.2-billion authorization bill providing new funds for the International Development Association, a World Bank affiliate that lends to the poorest developing countries.",

Comments by Western diplomats in Hanoi, as well as statements by Foreign Ministry officials, indicate that the Government's welcome to four visiting American veterans of the Indochina war represents an initial effort to stir public opinion in the United States.   Hanoi's aim, according to diplomats here, seems to be ''starting a process'' that would alter the Reagan Administration's stern resistance to normal relations with Vietnam because of the nation's occupation of Cambodia. Visits by Scientists Planned   ''Tell your people we are friends, we are not enemies,'' Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, told the veterans in agreeing to accept American doctors and scientists to assess the impact of the herbicide Agent Orange and to work with the Vietnam Veterans of America on the question of Americans missing in action.   Life is bleak in Vietnam today, a situation brought about by political isolation, malnutrition in the countryside and urban centers, inflation believed to run as high as 200 percent a year, a series of devastating typhoons that damaged crops, a textbook Marxist five-year plan that began in 1976 and ended in failure, and the damage wrought by the war. The exodus of ethnic Chinese tradesmen and skilled workers has further aggravated the problems.",

Clausen, is the future level of programs serving the poorest countries and poorest people in the developing world.   The expansion of lending under the retired president, Robert S.  McNamara -from $953.5 million in the first year of his presidency, 1968, to about $12.4 billion in the last fiscal year - was impressive. But the redirection of bank programs toward a more explicit concern with world poverty was even more so. Much of the bank's $3.8 billion lending for agriculture and rural development in the last fiscal year was for subsistence farmers previously ignored by the governing elite in most developing countries. Lending has also increased dramatically for low-cost housing and slum rehabilitation to meet the crushing problems of third-world urbanization. The bank, while still funding many traditional activities, was transformed into the world's largest antipoverty agency.",

    "abstract": "  WEST By ROBERT PALMER   ASIAN music still sounds exotic to many Americans who routinely sample Asian cuisines. But among the city's better Asian restaurants can be found some of the city's more intriguing Asian musicians. And while their playing is little more than a background drone to many diners, those who are interested can listen and enjoy - and learn.   The Asian musicians to be heard at Raga, the Indian restaurant at 57 West 48th Street, and in Pongsri, the Thai restaurant at 244 West 48th Street, are not the staunch traditionalists that Westerners might expect them to be. They are progressive players who mix old and new, East and West, classical and pop and jazz. To many diners, they will always be part of the decor. But their music, and their stories, can be exceptional.",

A service town, across the 200-foot bridge that links Cancun to the mainland, has also sprung up amid the coastal mangroves over the last 10 years. But in the town investment has fallen behind the growth rate, and half the population - some 30,000 people -live in rudimentary shacks.   The venue for this week's meeting of developing and industrialized nations that will be attended by 22 world leaders, including President Reagan, is therefore a microcosm of some of the problems affecting development in the third world. Visitors who consider this an unusual place for a conference on world poverty need only drive a few miles to see the other face of Cancun.",

In small and in significant ways, Mr. Thomas is setting a new style at the foundation. During his 13-year presidency, Mr. Bundy, a former White House adviser accustomed to shaping policy, reveled in using his position for public and often provocative pronouncements. Mr.  Thomas, by contrast, has been reticent - maddeningly so, in the opinion of Ford observers and some members of the staff, who have been waiting 18 months for clear signals of the new administration's direction.   In what has surely been one of the longest transition periods for any large institution, Mr. Thomas has been almost totally absorbed in a painstaking analysis of every activity of the foundation.  Meanwhile, the hiatus has baffled officials in the philanthropy circuit and, according to one foundation president, ''has caused disquiet among organizations which look to Ford for grants and worry which programs may be phased out.''",

    "abstract": "MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN By Salman Rushdie.  446 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $13.95.\n\nTHE literary map of India is about to be redrawn. The familiar outline -E.M. Forster's outline essentially -will always be there, because India will always offer the dualities essential for the Forsterian vision: the open sewer and the whispering glade, Mother Theresa and the Taj Mahal. Serious English-language novelists from India (often called Indo-Anglians), or those from abroad who use Indian material, have steered a steady course between these two vast, mutually obliterating realities; hence the vivid patches of local color provided by the timeless South India of R.K. Narayan's novels and the cool pastels added by the later fiction of Anita Desai. The Indian novels of Paul Scott and Ruth Jhabvala also fall comfortably between those two poles. For a long time it has seemed that novels from India write their own blurbs: poised, witty, delicate, sparkling.\n\nWhat this fiction has been missing is a different kind of ambition, something just a little coarse, a hunger to swallow India whole and spit it out. It needed a touch of Saul Bellow's Augie March brashness, Bombay rather than Chicago-born, and going at things in its own special Bombay way. Now, in ''Midnight's Children,'' Salman Rushdie has realized that ambition.",

The first result - and it must not be forgotten because it was surely the motive for the act - was the fall of the Bazargan Government in Teheran. An international crisis developed duly and immediately. But only slowly came widespread understanding that the arousal of emotional hostility to the United States was a crucial element of Iranian revolutionary politics, not merely an act of defiance or retribution and not at all the mindless, crazy gesture it seemed.",

McNamara, who will retire at the end of this month after 13 years as president of the World Bank, believes that United States economic and political interests will be seriously injured if this country retreats further from its earlier commitments to aid the poor people of the third world.   In an interview in his office in Washington last week, Mr.  McNamara said Congress was ''on the verge of repudiating'' agreements made by the Carter Administration, and endorsed by the Reagan Administration, to provide $658.3 million as the American contribution toward a general increase for the World Bank and $3.2 billion over a period of three years to the sixth replenishment of the International Development Association, the bank's ''soft loan'' affiliate that lends to the poorest countries. 'We Are Bankrupt Today'   ''With respect to I.D.A.,'' he said, ''essentially we are bankrupt today. At the end of next week, the end of our fiscal year, we will have about $1 billion of I.D.A. credits approved by our board, but for which we have no commitment authority, and hence no authority to sign.''   And, he added, ''those are for projects that are to deal with these very basic problems,'' of poverty and financial crisis, ''the solution to which will benefit not only the developing countries but the United States.''",

A few minutes later, a tall, angular man in his early 60's emerges, formal in a dark suit, head bent, face preoccupied, strung tight. United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim strides quickly downtown, full of energy, and the guard falls into step beside him. There isn't much conversation. ''Occasionally,'' the guard says, ''he'll talk about the new plan for the U.N. garden or the weather or how he wishes he could stay home some night.''   Amid others hurrying to work, somewhat to Mr. Waldheim's sorrow, no one recognizes him. Which is curious, since the work he does affects virtually every country in the world, and is not conducted in obscurity.   At United Nations headquarters, they take an elevator reserved exclusively for the Secretary General to the 38th floor of the Secretariat building. Mr. Waldheim says good morning to the receptionist, w ho is also an armed guard, enters his own suite of offices and, with his usual courtliness, shakes hands with each of his five secretaries (anyone still there when he leaves at 8 or 9 or 10 P.M. gets a good-night handshake as well).",

''The invasion of neutral Afghanistan and the violation of neutral Sweden's territory by a Soviet submarine should dispel the illusion that neutrality confers immunity.''   These and related concerns were discussed by a panel of specialists who met last month in the ornate Egmont Palace in Brussels under auspices of the Atlantic Institute, a 20-year-old private organization that promotes cooperation in the West.   In Paris meanwhile, another group of experts, including one from the Soviet Union who asked not to be identified, examined the economic consequences of weapons spending at a conference organized by the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues. The commission is headed by former Prime Minister Olof Palme of Sweden.  Excerpts from their presentations follow.
