It is a neighborhood of Asians - as they are called by the English, who are comfortable still with the old colonial term that did not distinguish among the many peoples east of Europe. There are thought to be 40,000 Asians in Brick Lane, mostly Muslims from Bengal, a region cleaved in 1947 when India was partitioned and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) created. They have come for many reasons - exiles, refugees, schemers - and they have not always been welcomed. ''Asian'' suggests not only the distance the immigrants have traveled but also the distance at which they remain. And something more troubling, a sense of unease and estrangement, is suggested by newer, post-colonial terms: quotas, fourth world, National Front, Paki-bashing.",
