Dani Don Pintabona, above right, returns to the Manhattan dining scene with this new place somewhat north of Tribeca Grill, where he was executive chef for 12 years before leaving for a brief cooking foray to Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The menu takes its cue from Sicily, with touches of North Africa and other Mediterranean areas, in dishes like tagine of black sea bass and chickpea-fried calamari: 333 Hudson Street (Charlton Street), (212) 633-9333.

    "abstract": "Just as the city always evolves, so does its restaurant scene. East Sixth Street between First and Second Avenues, for example, was once a unified front of mostly undistinguished Bangladeshi and Indian restaurants, but now it serves up everything from Peruvian to Cajun and Japanese, along with more interesting and authentic Indian fare.    ANGON ON THE SIXTH  (212) 260-8229; 320 East Sixth Street; $; $25 and Under: 9/1/04.       The familiar and conversational service at Angon means you will almost certainly discuss your order with the waiters, who can guide you to hidden gems like the fish curry or liver jhal fry: creamy chicken livers, a whisper past medium rare, in a sweet sauce dense with onions. Angon offers 10 vegetarian main courses, the standout being dhal fry, a luxuriously creamy dish of yellow lentils finished with mustard oil.    BRICK LANE CURRY HOUSE  (212) 979-2900; 306-308 East Sixth Street; $; $25 and Under: 7/31/02.       Brick Lane is not, in a strict sense, a regional Indian restaurant. It takes its name from a street in East London known for its curry, and along with a diverse menu of Indian kebabs and rolls, it serves the standard fare of modern England: chicken tikka masala, curries, lamb vindaloo.    CHIYONO  (212) 673-3984; 328 East Sixth Street; $; $25 and Under: 11/2/05.       Chiyono (pronounced chee-OH-no) is one of the restaurants that have broken curry's hold on the block. Its menu is representative of contemporary Japanese home cooking -- croquettes, potato salad and the like -- interspersed with dishes created by Chiyono Murano, the chatty chef and owner.    MANCORA  (212) 253-1011; 99 First Avenue (at Sixth Street); $; $25 and Under: 11/10/04.       Peruvian cooks have a way with rotisserie birds, thanks to the country's Chinese immigrants, who introduced exotic spice blends. At Mancora, the chicken is tongue-numbing, marinated in sticky-sweet dark beer, then rubbed with garlic, oregano and fennel, and roasted to a blackened crisp and juicy underneath.    MARA'S HOMEMADE  (212) 598-1110; 342 East Sixth Street; $; Article: 5/23/04.       Mara's specializes in Cajun and Southern comfort food like chicken-fried steak, fried chicken, fried catfish, macaroni and cheese and, on the Cajun side of the menu, live Louisiana crayfish cooked in a traditional spicy boil, jambalaya, shrimp creole and po' boy sandwiches.    ZERZA  (212) 529-8250; 304 East Sixth Street; $; $25 and Under: 8/13/03.       Although the menu and d\u00e9cor are distinctively Moroccan, Zerza offers a nod to the eastern end of the Mediterranean, with lemony hummus. Homey Moroccan dishes include braised chicken with apricot and pine nuts, lamb tangine with apricots, prunes and almonds, and spiced lentils with butternut squash.  ",

I have battled with the disease of alcoholism for all of my adult life and profoundly regret my horrific relapse.\" A breath test indicated Gibson's blood-alcohol level was 0.12 percent.

    "abstract": " INTERNATIONAL A3-17    Taliban and Allies Tighten Grip in Northern Pakistan  Islamic militants are using a recent peace deal with the government to consolidate their hold in northern Pakistan, vastly expanding their training of suicide bombers and other recruits and fortifying alliances with Al Qaeda and foreign fighters, diplomats and intelligence officials from several nations say.  A1    Iraq Fails to Spend Billions  Iraq is failing to spend billions of dollars of oil revenues that have been set aside to rebuild its damaged roads, schools and power stations and to repair refineries and pipelines. Iraqi ministries are spending as little as 15 percent of the 2006 capital budgets they received for the rebuilding, and some of the weakest spending is taking place at the Oil Ministry.  A1    President Jalal Talabani said the American program to train Iraq's security forces had failed and he denounced a plan to increase the number of American advisers working with the Iraqi Army. A12    The United States still does not understand the enemy that American soldiers are fighting in Iraq, according to a report by the Iraq Study Group. The report criticized United States intelligence officials for failing to answer basic questions about the Sunni insurgency or the increasingly powerful Shiite militias.  A14    Suspect Found in Poisoning  The German authorities announced they had begun a criminal investigation of a Russian businessman after finding traces of polonium 210 around Hamburg beginning on Oct. 28 -- four days before he met in London with the former Russian spy who died after ingesting the radioactive substance. A1    Group Urges China to End Curbs  Rules requiring Chinese lawyers to submit to government supervision when representing clients in politically delicate cases have dealt a serious blow to the country's legal system and should be rescinded, Human Rights Watch said in a report to be issued today.  A6    Pro-Hezbollah Protest Rages  Beirut has been packed with hundreds of thousands of pro-Hezbollah and allied demonstrators. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora's bewilderment at the protests seems to capture the spirit dividing the country of just four million people.  A3    Bangladesh Deploys Military  The government in Bangladesh, faced with mounting opposition party protests, has deployed the army in what appears to be an attempt to check pre-election violence.  A15    SCIENCE/HEALTH    African Gene for Milk Digestion  A recent instance of human evolution has been detected among the peoples of East Africa. It is the ability to digest milk in adulthood, conferred by genetic changes as recently as 3,000 years ago, a team of geneticists has found.  A15    NATIONAL A18-25    Latino Workers Transform Makeup of New Orleans  In the latest twist to the demographic transformation of New Orleans since it was swamped by Hurricane Katrina's floodwaters last year, hundreds of babies are being born to the Latino immigrant workers, both legal and illegal, who flocked to the city to toil on its reconstruction.  A1    Prison Overhaul Considered  Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and state lawmakers from both parties say the time is ripe for the first major overhaul of the California prison system, among the most troubled in the nation, since the 1970s.   A18    Stronger Rules for Produce  With processed produce like bagged salads and baby carrots growing in popularity, the Food and Drug Administration realized as long ago as 2000 that recommendations for safe handling of the products were needed. Now, with the recent outbreaks of E.coli, the F.D.A.'s oversight of produce is likely to be treated with new urgency. A23    Talks to Buy Travel Company  Sabre Holdings, the travel reservation company, is in advanced talks to be sold to a consortium of private equity firms for more than $4 billion, according to people involved in the negotiations.  A23    Prairie Dogs Shake Up Town  A confrontation over the fate of the largest prairie dog colony has turned everything upside down in a town in Kansas. The ranchers' defense of prairie dogs prompted bewilderment then anger in this county of about 3,100 people.   A22    Utah Arena in Nuclear Debate  Utah officials hope that the state's image can be best defined by its vast public lands and unspoiled forests, lakes and mountains. But some fear that a recent change in the name of the city's professional basketball arena, to the EnergySolutions Arena, may create for Utah new and far less savory associations with corruption and nuclear waste.   A24    Obama Visits New Hampshire  Senator Barack Obama went to New Hampshire for the first time in his life, selling a message of hope while proclaiming himself wary of the wave of hype that surrounded his visit.   A18    Re-election Cheered by City  There was no surprise at the re-election of Representative William J. Jefferson, only satisfaction among supporters in the crime-plagued Central City neighborhood in New Orleans.   A25    EDUCATION    Gallaudet Names Interim Head  Officials at Gallaudet University, the nation's premier institution for the deaf and hard of hearing, announced that a deaf educator who had spent years teaching there would become interim president.   A22    NEW YORK/REGION B1-5    Internet Expands Reach Of Times Square Ads  Advertisers traditionally drawn to Times Square for their marketing campaigns are getting consumers to do their jobs for them as a result of the growing popularity of consumer-generated pictures, videos and e-mail on Internet sites like YouTube and MySpace. A1    New Shooting Details Emerge  A 23-page document of compiled police accounts of the Sean Bell shooting provides more details and the best chronology made public to date of the shooting itself, the events that led up to it, and what people saw and heard. B1    Chefs Weigh Trans Fat Ban  Bakers and chefs are weighing their options after the city's new ban on all but tiny amounts of artificial trans fats in restaurant cooking. The measure has widely been applauded by health advocates, who point to an established link between trans fats and heart disease. But many in the restaurant industry say they fear that they will not be able to replicate dishes that now exceed the limit on trans fats. B1    McCain and Pataki in Town  Gov. George E. Pataki, left, said at ground zero that he would decide early next year whether to run for president, while Senator John McCain of Arizona gave a speech across town addressing Israel's security. B3    Neediest Cases   B5    BUSINESS DAY C1-10    Hard Year for Hedge Funds  For hedge fund investors, many fears are being realized in 2006. A $9 billion blue chip hedge fund collapsed in the space of a week and Goldman Sachs's woes revealed a painful truth: hedge fund investing is hard, and no one -- not even Goldman Sachs -- is infallible.  C1    Tallying Web Traffic  Pop-up windows are common on the Internet, usually used to pitch a product or service. But some Web sites are showing pop-ups with articles to visitors viewing other sites. Because people who get the pop-ups are hard to distinguish from real visitors, they can affect Web traffic counts and advertising revenue.  C1    New Measure of Pop Hits  As CD sales fade, record companies are finding other ways to measure success, including digital downloads of single album tracks and ring tones based on them.  C1    Break for Small Companies  The Securities and Exchange Commission will begin the process of easing auditing standards for thousands of smaller public companies when it proposes rules under the most contentious provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  C1    Business Digest C2    ARTS E1-8    Getty to Return Gold Wreath  After nearly a year of negotiations, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles has agreed in principle to return a rare fourth-century B.C. gold funerary wreath to Greece that cultural officials there contend was illegally removed from Greek soil, an expert briefed on the talks said. E1    OBITUARIES B6    Gen.

The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100.    'THE APPLE TREE' In previews; opens on Thursday. The Roundabout revives this 1966 Bock-Harnick musical, based on its City Center production.

The irreverent Theater Couture (''Doll'') takes you back to the bloody prom in Erik Jackson's spin on the Stephen King novel (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101.    'THE SCENE' Previews start on Tuesday; opens on Jan. 11. A buzz-maker at the Humana Festival, Theresa Rebeck's new play is about an out-of-work actor who doesn't solve his problems by having an affair. Tony Shalhoub (''Monk'') and Patricia Heaton star (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    'SPRING AWAKENING' In previews; opens on Sunday. The Atlantic Theater's acclaimed rock musical, based on an angst-ridden teenage drama from the 19th century, moves to Broadway (2:00). Eugene ONeill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.    ' 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE' Starts performances on Wednesday. An evening of short plays by Christopher Durang, Mac Wellman, Elizabeth Swados and others, using the famous poem '' 'Twas the Night Before Christmas'' (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101.    Broadway    'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first installment of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, this production pulses with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast, led by Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80s Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant (1:35). 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)    'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)    'THE ATHEIST' Chris Pine stars in Ronan Noone's generally compelling if not always credible one-man drama about a reporter who casually ruins lives trying to make his reputation with a big story (1:30). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). The Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, ( 212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)    *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)    'DARK MATTERS' Elizabeth Marvel plays a rural housewife who may be consorting with extraterrestrials in Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's risible new drama about space critters bent on beginning a new race. Pure hokum (2:00). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444). (Isherwood)    'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'KAOS'  Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani Brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (John Rockwell)    'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)    'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quip-meisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). The SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)    'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Moli\u00e8re's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Gates)    * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER'  As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'THE TIMEKEEPERS' Dan Clancy's play, which throws a Jewish artisan and a gay hustler together in a concentration camp, transcends standard Holocaust psychodrama on the strength of its characterizations and definitive performances by Seth Barrish and Eric Paeper (1:35). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, third floor, (212) 760-2615. (Rob Kendt)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'TWO TRAINS RUNNING'  Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. The detailed puppets are hard to read even in this small theater, and not all of the vignettes live up to the show's initial promise. Still, there's a lot to like, starting with the narrator: an alligator named Silas Leech, voiced in the plummy tones of the musician and actor Gavin Friday (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette)    'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    Spectacles    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing Cliff's Notes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A show that touches the heart and s well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'DURANGO'  In Julia Cho's tender-hearted comedy-drama, a Korean-American family takes to the road with a trunk full of emotional baggage in tow. The narrative mostly runs in familiar grooves, but Ms. Cho has a clear, honest voice, and Chay Yew's production sets it off elegantly (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)    'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE WHORE FROM OHIO' Hanoch Levin's black comedy about a 70-year-old beggar who hires a prostitute is vulgar but stylish, and at times an emotional revelation (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, who died in June. (A. O. Scott)    * 'BERGMAN ISLAND' (No rating, 101 minutes total running time, in Swedish and English) This documentary portrait of the great Swedish director, now 88 and living on the desolate Baltic Island of Faro, is extraordinarily revealing. In this extended interview, interwoven with fragments from his pictures, he recalls his life and loves and addresses his fear of death. The film underscores the intensely autobiographical nature of his art. (Stephen Holden)    'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)    * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis)    'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)    'COME EARLY MORNING' (R, 97 minutes) Ashley Judd returns to the Southern, working-class milieu of her first screen triumph, ''Ruby in Paradise,'' to deliver her most natural screen performance since that film pushed her toward stardom in 1993. Aside from pungent local color, there's not much surrounding this portrait of an embittered barfly floundering through a succession of one-night stands. (Holden)    * 'DAYS OF GLORY' (R, 120 minutes, in French) Rachid Bouchareb's tale of North African soldiers fighting to free their French colonial masters from German Occupation during World War II is a potent combat picture, and also a searching and complex political drama. (Scott)    'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)    'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the ''smartest and coolest thief alive,'' and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz)    * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)    * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)    'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer from a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)    * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)    'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)    'FOUR EYED MONSTERS' (No rating, 70 minutes) In this truly modern romance, a merging of reality and re-enacted scenes from reality, two young, creative Brooklynites who met online approach their developing relationship as an art project. (Laura Kern)    'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, except for the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)    'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)    'HERMANAS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Spanish) The ghost of 1970s Argentina haunts 1980s Texas in this perceptive and beautifully acted drama from the Argentine director Julia Solomonoff. After eight years of exile in Spain, Natalia (Ingrid Rubio) travels to Texas to visit her sister, Elena (Valeria Bertuccelli), a suburban wife and mother. Extensive flashbacks to the sisters' teenage years during the military dictatorship reveal a rich vein of familial guilt and long-suppressed resentment. But the movie is most successful in the rocky emotional spaces in which the women struggle to reconcile over a chasm of political discord and unanswered questions. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)    * 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserves to be called art. (Dargis)    'NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VAN WILDER 2: THE RISE OF TAJ' (R, 98 minutes) Britain and India face off in this strained attempt to transplant the American campus comedy to more uptight shores. Now graduated from college -- and sidekick status -- Taj Mahal Badalandabad (Kal Penn) heads to Camford University in England to pursue a Ph.D. and a bad reputation. While the screenplay dives into British history, and the camera dives into every cleavage in sight, the director, Mort Nathan, harnesses smut and silliness to an oddly innocent tale of true love. (Catsoulis)    'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earth-shaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)    * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)    * '10 ITEMS OR LESS' (R, 82 minutes) A sweet and modest film by Brad Silberling, in which a fading actor (Morgan Freeman) and a supermarket checkout worker (Paz Vega) spend a day together not doing much of anything. (Scott)    'TENACIOUS D IN THE PICK OF DESTINY' (R, 87 minutes) As it wobbles from one episode to the next, this rock 'n' roll comedy starring Jack Black is a garish mess, and some of it feels padded. But it has enough jokes to keep you smiling, and Mr. Black brings to it a fervent affection for the music he spoofs but obviously adores. (Holden)    'TURISTAS' (R, 89 minutes) If stupidity were a crime, the nitwits in this cheap horror flick would be doing time in Attica. (Dargis)    * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)    Film Series    'ASIAN CINEVISIONS' (Through tomorrow) The Museum of Modern Art's monthly series of Asian and Asian-American films concludes its fall-winter program this weekend. The closing feature is ''The Last Communist'' (2006), directed by Amir Muhammad, a combination travelogue, documentary and musical from Malaysia (where it was banned). (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Anita Gates)    'CZECH MODERNISM: THE 1920s THROUGH THE 1940s' (Through Sunday) Bamcin\u00e9matek's 12-film retrospective, covering two decades of filmmaking before the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948, winds up this weekend with half a dozen films. They include Martin Fric's ''Heave Ho!'' (1934), a slapstick comedy about socialism, and Alfred Radok's drama ''Distant Journey'' (1949), about Prague's Jews during the Nazi occupation. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10 (Gates)    'FOX BEFORE THE CODE' (Through Dec. 21) Film Forum's three-week retrospective of Fox Studios films that predate Hollywood's family-values-driven Production Code continues this weekend with seven movies. They include ''Born to Be Bad'' (1934), starring Loretta Young as a trampy and devious single mother; ''Now I'll Tell'' (1934), with Spencer Tracy and Helen Twelvetrees in the story of a gambler in trouble with the mob; and ''Call Her Savage'' (1932), in which Clara Bow demonstrates why she was called the It Girl. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $10. (Gates)    'MADE IN NY'  The Museum of Modern Art's three-month series of notable films made in the city rolls on. Next week's feature, to be shown on Monday and Wednesday, is Norman Jewison's ''Moonstruck'' (1987). Cher won an Oscar for her role as a Brooklyn widow who falls in love with her fianc\u00e9's brother. Locations include Grand Ticino (the Greenwich Village restaurant) and Lincoln Center at night. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates)    'SPANISH CINEMA NOW' (Through Dec. 26) The Film Society of Lincoln Center begins its 15th celebration of Spain's film industry this weekend with six films and considerable star power. Viggo Mortensen plays the noble 17th-century title character in Agustin D\u00edaz Yane's ''Alatriste'' (2006). Ariadna Gil appears both in that film and in David Trueba's ''Welcome Home'' (2006), a young photographer's coming-of-age story. The series will also include an Edgar Neville retrospective, beginning on Sunday with ''The Tower of the Seven Hunchbacks'' (1944), a fantasy about a secret city beneath the streets of Madrid. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.com; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    BACILOS (Tonight) Bacilos, from Miami, draw their rock en Espa\u00f1ol from across the Americas, switching gracefully and tunefully amid cumbia, salsa, bossa nova and pop ballads, and they have a Grammy Award and hit singles to show for it. This has been advertised as the band's last show in New York. At midnight, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $39. (Jon Pareles)    * CORINNE BAILEY RAE (Wednesday) Even when she is singing about heartbreak and desperation, and griping that love is ''a type of loan with no dividends,'' it is hard not to be seduced by Ms. Bailey Rae, a 27-year-old British singer and guitarist who is this year's breakout soul star. In a sweet, tissue-thin voice that can recall Macy Gray or Sade, she sings of sisterly rituals, loves lost and her ''choux pastry heart.'' At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $26.50. (Ben Sisario)    BOUND STEMS (Sunday and Wednesday) In this Chicago band's elliptical songs, meandering guitars and conversational, half-spoken vocals are woven together with a loose dream logic. Sunday at 9 p.m., with Rahim, at Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10. Wednesday at 8 p.m., with Ra Ra Riot, the Muggabears and Tall Hands, at Sin-\u00e9, 150 Attorney Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077, sin-e.com; $10. (Sisario)    CIARA (Sunday) This 21-year-old R&B singer had a big, flirty hit a few summers ago with ''Goodies,'' in which she turned away a suitor while teasingly declaring ''I'm no rookie'' over a steady synthesizer wolf whistle. She's back with a new album whose first single, ''Promise,'' has a less provocative message. ''I've been looking for somebody to talk to,'' she sings. ''Is that you?'' At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $35. (Sisario)    * DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL, BRAND NEW (Tonight) Reaching a tattooed arm out to every anxious teenage soul, Chris Carrabba, the 31-year-old singer-songwriter who performs as Dashboard Confessional, has become the elder of the emo scene with a repertory of yearning, histrionic melodies and just-hang-in-there themes. (He also reveals some maturity -- gasp! -- on slower, quieter songs.) Brand New pushes emo into the realm of Pink Floyd and U2, with tangles of explosive melody and rich, complex songs about spiritual crisis. At 7:30, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $26.50 to $34.50. (Sisario)    DONNA THE BUFFALO (Tonight) Donna the Buffalo is not named for its fiddler and singer, Tara Nevins. Its good-natured rock leans toward the Appalachian side of country music, though it also dips into reggae and Cajun music, with songs that ponder love and humanity's place in the universe. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18. (Pareles)    ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO (Tonight) Mr. Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. Here his ensemble includes two violinists, a cellist and a guitarist. At 8:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; $38 to $43. (Pareles)    * THE EX (Wednesday) Visits from this long-running Dutch band are too rare. Devoted to leftist political ideals, the group chocks its lyrics full of topical allusions and has been known to include 140-page books about the Spanish Revolution with its albums. Admirable, sure. But in concert the Ex is blessedly all about the beat: a brawny, anxious punk-funk that never releases its tension. The effect is unforgettably visceral. With Aloha and DJ/rupture. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12. (Sisario)    GOOD FOR THE JEWS (Thursday) The tree has been lighted in Rockefeller Center, and the department store window displays have gone up, which means that it's time for the annual ritual of comedians and rockers musing on the true meaning of being Jewish at Christmas. Among the witty reindeer joining the band Good for the Jews for this Hanukkah concert will be the singers Lisa Loeb, Tammy Faye Starlite and Julian Fleisher, and the comedians Todd Barry and Rachel Feinstein. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)    PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tomorrow and Sunday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive curriculum at his Philadelphia school, teaching youngsters the rock 'n' roll canon, as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. Here his students offer ''Best of the '90s.'' At 2:30 p.m., Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $10. (Sisario)    WANDA JACKSON (Tomorrow) Wild boys weren't the whole story of 1950s rockabilly. Ms. Jackson, from Oklahoma, was out on the road too, belting songs like ''Fujiyama Mama'' (a big hit in Japan) and ''Mean Mean Man.'' In the '70s she became a Christian and turned to singing church music. But in 1996 one of her fans, the honky-tonk singer Rosie Flores, sought her out for duets, and since then Ms. Jackson has been reclaiming her crown as queen of rockabilly. With the Lustre Kings. At 7 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $20. (Pareles)    LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO ELTON JOHN (Thursday) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring series, now 13 years old, both honors and skewers pop greats with clever but usually over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to Mr. John, in the first of five shows over three nights. At 9 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario)    LUPE FIASCO (Tuesday) A talented and proudly goofy rapper from Chicago, Lupe Fiasco occupies an unusual middle ground between the microcosmos of alternative hip-hop and the biggest of pop worlds: he made a guest appearance on a Kanye West single and his new album, ''Food & Liquor'' (Atlantic), lists none other than Jay-Z as an executive producer. At 10 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $26 in advance, $28 at the door. (Sisario)    AIMEE MANN (Tuesday and Thursday) Everybody does a Christmas show in New York, from sarcastic downtown Jewish comedians to Ms. Mann, a fixture of the Los Angeles independent music scene. Promoting a holiday album, ''One More Drifter in the Snow'' (SuperEgo), and looking to build an annual franchise, she performs at Town Hall. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $29.50 and $39.50; sold out on Thursday. (Sisario)    O'DEATH (Sunday and Wednesday) This New York band draws from the starkness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the noisemongering of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits. With quiet pluckings of banjo and angry, anarchic howls, its songs jumble sacred and profane. Sunday at 8 p.m., with Phosphorescent and Stars Like Fleas, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. Wednesday at 9 p.m., with Langhorne Slim, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10. (Sisario)    OLLABELLE (Tuesday) Worshiping blues, country and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes, this vocal quintet is best in a live setting, and keeps a busy schedule in the bars of New York. Here it plays at Union Hall, a newish place in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with a cozy music room downstairs. At 8 p.m., 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $15. (Sisario)    PERNICE BROTHERS, ELVIS PERKINS (Tonight) Call it Kleenex rock: the sound is delicate, the voices soft and whispery, the mood really, really sad. The Pernice Brothers surround tales of woe with careful pop artistry that draws a little from country. The plaintive and tuneful songs of Elvis Perkins, from Providence, R.I., have been tapped for mood music on ''The OC.'' At 8:30, with Sono Oto, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Sisario)    'POWER OF THE NEW JAPANESE WOMAN' (Tonight and tomorrow night) The latest installment of John Zorn's occasional series at the Japan Society celebrates women of the Japanese avant-garde, who are anything but demure. Tonight is Afrirampo, a duo that fits right in with the chaotic noise-rock of the Boredoms and Lightning Bolt, and a trio called ni-hao! Tomorrow features, in separate sets, Yuka Honda and Miho Hatori, of the whimsical '90s experimental pop group Cibo Matto. At 7:30, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $28; $20 for members (tomorrow's performance is sold out). (Sisario)    * LOU REED'S 'BERLIN' (Thursday) Mr. Reed performs his bleak and beautiful 1973 cabaret-rock album ''Berlin'' in full for the first time, with friends including Antony and Sharon Jones on backup vocals, and with sets and projections by Julian Schnabel and his daughter Lola. At 8 p.m., St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org; sold out. (Sisario)    SIZZLA (Monday) Like Buju Banton before him, Sizzla has figured out that idealism can be just as fearsome as nihilism. He's astonishingly prolific (he releases two or three albums a year) and versatile, equally at home with roots reggae grooves and digital dancehall beats. Whether he's singing an Afrocentric love song or screaming for revenge against ''Babylon,'' his fervent voice turns every lyric into a life-or-death struggle. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Kelefa Sanneh)    RONNIE SPECTOR (Tomorrow and Sunday) For her annual holiday show, Ms. Spector, forever the queen of big-haired rock 'n' roll girls, has a ready repertory: her group, the Ronettes, sang ''Frosty the Snowman,'' ''I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus'' and ''Sleigh Ride'' on Phil Spector's 1963 ensemble album, ''A Christmas Gift for You.'' She's been known to belt out a ''Be My Baby'' too. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Sunday at 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $30 in advance, $34 at the door. (Sisario)    TAJ MAHAL (Monday through Wednesday) In Taj Mahal's hands, the blues are no weighty downer but a repository of breezy, evocative sounds easily connected to Caribbean and Hawaiian music. His trio includes Billy Rich on bass and Kester Smith on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $45 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $35 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Sisario)    'THE WAINWRIGHT FAMILY AND FRIENDS CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS' (Wednesday) Come, all ye faithful: Rufus and Martha Wainwright play host for a seasonal concert that will also feature David Byrne, Laurie Anderson, Jimmy Fallon, Linda Thompson and her son Teddy Thompson. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $79. (Sisario)    * WE ARE SCIENTISTS, OXFORD COLLAPSE, THE GRATES (Tomorrow) We Are Scientists and Oxford Collapse, both from New York, revive postpunk in different ways. We Are Scientists sings about bohemia and boredom (''I'm sick of waking up on your floor/For the sixth or seventh night in a row'') over a spiky discopunk groove derived from Gang of Four, while Oxford Collapse looks to the tense jangle of Television and the Feelies. The Grates, from Australia, borrow their passionate, joyful amateurism from classic riot grrrl. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; sold out. (Sisario)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    RASHIED ALI QUINTET (Tomorrow) Rashied Ali has had a substantial career in the jazz avant-garde over the last 40 years, beginning with his percussive role in the late-period work of John Coltrane. Mr. Ali's drumming, still insistent and undulant, drives this ensemble, featuring the trumpeter Jumaane Smith and the tenor saxophonist Lawrence Clark. At 8 and 10 p.m. and midnight. Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)    * ANIMATION: MILES DAVIS'S BITCHES BREW (Tomorrow) The most influential fusion recording ever made receives a sequential but otherwise liberal interpretation at the hands of Bob Belden, who produced its essential reissue a few years ago. Mr. Belden will play soprano saxophone; his plugged-in band will feature the trumpeter Tim Hagans, the keyboardist Scott Kinsey, the bassist Matthew Garrison, the drummer Zach Danziger and a pair of D.J.'s, Kingsize and Logic. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $30 in advance, $35 tomorrow. (Chinen)    TIM BERNE AND SCOTT COLLEY (Tomorrow) Rhythmically rugged duos, improvised and composed, from Mr. Berne, an exploratory alto saxophonist, and Mr. Colley, a stalwart bassist. At 8:30 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12; $8 for students.

This week, as in the shows she recorded earlier this year for her album ''Live at the Blue Note'' (DRG), she leads a hushed band and uses the intimacy of the club to return to music she grew up on, particularly the bossa novas of Antonio Carlos Jobim: Brazilian classics sung with pure, knowing poise.

Opera    'LA BOH\u00c8ME' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown ''Boh\u00e8me'' returns to the Metropolitan Opera for its regular airing. Rolando Villaz\u00f3n, the talented Mexican tenor, is a convincing Rodolfo, although his voice and charisma are somewhat dwarfed by the massive sets. Mr. Villaz\u00f3n's mentor and idol, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, leads the orchestra tomorrow; Steven Crawford conducts on Wednesday. Mim\u00ec will be sung by Maija Kovalevska, the Latvian soprano who was one of the first-prize winners in the 2006 Operalia Competition, which Mr. Domingo runs for young singers.

(Anthony Tommasini)    'DON JUAN IN PRAGUE' (Wednesday and Thursday) To celebrate Mozart's 250th birthday this year, some have restaged Mozart's operas; others have reimagined them. Conceived by David Chambers, ''Don Juan in Prague,'' which had its premiere at Bard's SummerScape in 2003, is Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' run through a multimedia filter of digital sound enhancement and cutting-edge images, with the avant-garde vocalist Iva Bittova as a whole new kind of Donna Elvira.

If, on the other hand, you caught that concert and still want more, Mr. Koopman and company return to Carnegie on Tuesday to perform Bach's ''Musical Offering'' and ''Coffee'' Cantata.

(Allan Kozinn)    EFE BALTACIGIL (Tonight) This talented Turkish cellist has gained attention in a number of ways. He has won an Avery Fisher Career Grant and the Young Concert Artists auditions. But even more significant, for many, was his impromptu performance with Emanuel Ax when a snowstorm in 2004 prevented most of his fellow members of the Philadelphia Orchestra from getting to the concert on time. Tonight he appears as part of Carnegie Hall's Rising Stars series, with the pianist Anna Polonsky, in a program of Bach, Shostakovich, Ahmet Adnan Saygun and Franck.

(Kozinn)    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight and Sunday) The performance level has improved notably since the days when critics routinely referred to this ad hoc assembly of visiting musicians as the Sight-Reading Society, but even so, few New York institutions have so thoroughly outlived their usefulness. Now the society has a new creative team -- the cellist David Finckel and his wife, the pianist Wu Han -- and it tells you something about its creative vitality that a centerpiece of its programming this season is a Baroque festival, performed on modern instruments and devoted entirely to crowd-pleasers. The opening program, inventively called ''Baroque Collection,'' includes music by Telemann, Bach, Marais and Vivaldi. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $30 to $52 tonight, sold out on Sunday.

John Scott leads the church's choir of men and boys, accompanied by Concert Royal, a fine period-instrument orchestra. This year there is a twist: instead of performing one of several surviving Handel versions (he revised a lot), Mr. Scott is offering the work in Mozart's colorfully expansive orchestration. The soloists are Ava Pine, soprano; Kirsten Sollek, alto; Joseph Gaines, tenor; and Sumner Thompson, bass. At 7:30 p.m., Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, www.saintthomaschurch.org; $20 to $80.

And Bach cantatas are one of its happiest manifestations. In its second season of cantatas at the Metropolitan Museum, the group celebrates the holiday season by performing Nos. 40 and 133 in front of the famous Baroque Christmas tree in the Medieval Sculpture Hall. At 6:30 and 8:30 p.m., (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $60. (Midgette)    VASSILY PRIMAKOV (Sunday) This Russian pianist plays Schumann in Arium's updated salon ambience.

(Anderson)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday; Tuesday through Thursday) George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker'' continues until Dec. 30, with nine performances this week alone.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., Tuesday though Thursday at 6 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or (212) 721-6500, nycballet.com; $15 to $110.

(La Rocco)    PI DANCE THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Toni Taylor, the group's director, offers ''Remaining Vertical,'' which combines modern dance with shadow puppets, and ''Road to Through From,'' which considers how we move from one place to another in life.

(Dunning)    STREB SLAM (Tonight through Sunday) Elizabeth Streb and her fearless (we hope) high-flying, hard-crashing performers will present a new show, ''Streb SLAM 8: Extreme Action,'' complete with popcorn and cotton candy. (Through Dec. 17.) Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 3 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., SLAM, 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 352-3101, strebusa.org; $15; $10 for children 12 and under. (Dunning)    * SUNDAYS AT THREE: SOKOLOW THEATER DANCE ENSEMBLE (Sunday) Anna Sokolow, a choreographer known for her passionate social conscience, first danced at the Y in 1936, and her company appeared there many times before her death in 2000. This program reconstructs ''Ballad in a Popular Style'' (1936), pieces from the 1940s and ''Four Songs'' (1995), one of her final creations. There will also be new works by Jim May and Anabella Lenzu. At 3 p.m., Harkness Dance Center, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500 or www.92y.org/dance; $10. (Anderson)    * PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY (Tomorrow) Dance that is lyrically romantic, darkly comical and majestic in turn, performed by a company that dances as if there were no tomorrow. The program includes ''Company B,'' ''Prometheus Fire'' and ''Piece Period.'' At 8 p.m. Performing Arts Center, Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6200, www.artscenter.org; $45 to $65. (Dunning)    VANGELINE THEATER (Thursday) Vangeline pays tribute to Kazuo Ohno on his 100th birthday with a program of Butoh-influenced dance called ''Hanamichi: Flower Road.'' At 8 p.m., Galapagos Art Space, 70 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917) 749-9062, www.vangeline.com; $10. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, produced since the early '90s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images you merely sense that some horrible violence has occurred, or is about to happen. The moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. But this artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Benjamin Genocchio)    * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: ''SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,'' through March 4. A cartoonist-artist extraordinaire, Saul Steinberg (1914-99) was a veritable Leonardo of graphic drollery. His famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 Steinberg drawings, collages and constructions, arranged in chronological order, goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008. (Grace Glueck)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here in one incarnation, looming majestically over humble brownstones; in another, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951), portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these two shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Glueck)    * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'John Latham: Time Base and the Universe,' through Jan. 8. This retrospective of John Latham spans nearly 50 years of Mr. Latham's work, which is concerned with time, preservation and decay. Among the more idiosyncratic and interesting pieces are a series of ''Cluster'' sculptures from the early 1990s, orbs of plaster embedded with books and suspended from the ceiling, which suggest cultural detritus preserved in celestial rock or geological magma. ''The N-U Niddrie Heart'' (around 1990), in which ''The Pregnancy Survival Manual'' and ''Vanished Species'' are cut up and fitted into glass armatures, with sand scattered around their bases, explores human production (and reproduction) and the passage of time. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Martha Schwendener)    Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this modest-size, first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugar-coating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Holland Cotter)    Whitney Museum of American Art: Kiki Smith: 'A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in ''Kiki Smith'': men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    Sigmar Polke Painting is man's oldest conjuring trick, and Sigmar Polke is one of its reigning magicians. In this show new paintings and those from the 1980s, all two-sided and painted with resin, surround a small selection of German Baroque amber (Bernstein is German for amber) jewelry and exquisite tchotchkes. The show simulates a Wunderkammer, a darkened wonder cabinet of the 17th or 18th century. The paintings, made translucent by the resin, nearly defy deciphering. Doodles and abstract splashes of white paint overlay murky washes of glowing resin on both sides of their membranous support, then cast dim shadows on the wall behind, so that the pictures seem suspended in midair, floating. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 988-1623, through Jan. 13. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Chelsea    Aric Obrosey Mr. Obrosey's fastidious graphite depictions of woven and knotted threads have a mesmerizing, meditative quality. Care in the making encourages care in looking. In close-up the motifs combine elements of straightforward trompe l'oeil. Each strand of these lacelike compositions behaves according to strict spatial and structural rules; they may twist and turn, conform or deviate eccentrically. But reality is respected, even when the strands coalesce at the center into a mandalalike circle or a wildly knotted disco ball. And the illusions go deeper: Each strand is something like a world unto itself, with distinct, chainlike structures or decorative patterns that suggest different cultures or other crafts. The strands pulse like arteries of tiny lights in a work dedicated to Felix Gonzalez-Torres. Greater than Mr. Obrosey's drawing skill is his ability to convert what might be called Conceptual content into visual terms. McKenzie Fine Art, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-5467, www.mckenziefineart.com, through Dec. 20. (Smith)    Other Galleries    * 'Looking Back' This inaugural edition of a new White Columns Annual is designed, like the old-time Whitney Biennial, to offer a recap of contemporary art of the immediate past, and in this case the art of a single New York gallery season past. It's a great idea, a chance to linger over shows seen in a rush, or entirely missed, or fondly remembered. The curator, Matthew Higgs, director of White Columns, has made satisfyingly unobvious choices, and any show that includes Klara Liden and Stuart Sherman is a winner. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street (entrance on Horatio Street), West Village, (212) 924-4212, through Dec. 20. (Cotter)    Public Art    NINA KATCHADOURIAN: 'OFFICE SEMAPHORE' Ms. Katchadourian has borrowed marine flag signaling techniques to create an interactive art project consisting of an old-fashioned tourist telescope installed at the corner of a plaza in the middle of the financial district, its lens trained on the window of an upper-floor office in a nearby skyscraper. Each day the man working in the office, or his assistant, arranges objects on his widow sill. The combination and order of the objects represent a specific message, which viewers down on the plaza can interpret using a key-chart on the telescope. 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, corner of Liberty and William Streets; stairway entrance to the plaza is on William Street at Cedar Street; www.publicartfund.org, Jan. 14. (Genocchio)    Last Chance    * Asia society: 'ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW'  Taking its name from a 1978 hit by Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea. Keep a special eye out for Mari Eastman's wryly beautiful paintings; Mika Tajima's glamorous deconstruction of Minimalism; and the video-performance efforts of Patty Chang, Laurel Nakadate and Xavier Cha. An added bonus: 12, or 71 percent, of the show's 17 artists are women. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)    Christian Jankowski: 'Us and them' This show is smart in its exploration of what might be called the banality of feigned evil, but it also feels predictable. Mr. Jankowsky gets closest to real emotion in the 11-minute ''Angels of Revenge,'' in which 12 costume contestants at a horror film convention walk slowly toward the camera while reciting their most dire revenge fantasies. A wolf man complains about having his cellphone stolen; a ''Night of the Living Dead'' type waves a chain saw; a man in a bloody chef's suit suggests a found-art Paul McCarthy video. It is hard to decide if the lameness of their efforts indicates that most people aren't violent, that horror buffs need to get a life, or that Mr. Jankowski's interventionism is temporarily in a rut. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    The Met: 'New Orleans After the Flood: Photographs by Robert Polidori,' After Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Polidori went to New Orleans, where he lived years ago, to shoot photographs of the devastation for The New Yorker. He took hundreds of pictures with a large-format camera that produced wide, superbly detailed color photographs. Mr. Polidori is a connoisseur of chaos, and the beauty of his pictures -- they have a languid, almost underwater beauty -- entails locating order in bedlam. He also photographed signs of recovery: trailers and construction equipment; a few historic homes, stripped to their frames, shorn, on the verge of new life. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman)    * Futoshi Miyagi In his New York solo debut this young, gay, Japanese-born artist works toward self-assertion through self-effacement. He poses with strangers in their apartments for photographic records of illusional domesticity. In the gallery he recreates a picture-covered wall from his own bedroom, but includes only the tacks that held the pictures in place. He dissolves a portrait of himself, taken by a friend, in a bottle of bleach so that the features are erased. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    'Moving Pictures: American Art and Early Film, 1880-1910' What's thought to be the first movie kiss, between May Irwin and John C. Rice, occurred in 1896, photographed by the Edison Manufacturing Company as the subject of a 19-second film shown at a New York music hall. It and dozens of other early movie treasures, along with fine art of the period, are shown in this engrossing if learned survey of the links -- both planned and happenstance -- between the earliest movies and other American visual art forms at the turn of the 20th century. Throughout the show, provocative juxtapositions are made of films and paintings by Thomas Eakins, Maurice Prendergast, Childe Hassam, George Bellows and John Sloan, among others. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, www.nyu.edu/greyart; closes tomorrow. (Glueck)    Betty Parsons: 'Painted Sculpture' In the decade before she died in 1982, at 82, Ms. Parsons began cobbling together scraps of lumber, boats and signs that washed up on the beach near her summer house on the North Fork of Long Island. She added unobtrusive touches of color: mostly stripes that waver somewhere between Mondrian and festive war paint, but also circles and dabs, often in response to nail holes or the faded hues from the wood's earlier life. The resulting works qualify as an endearing yet somehow rigorous folk-modernism. Art Gallery of the Graduate Center, City University of New York, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, www.gc.cuny.edu; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    Catherine Yass: 'Lock' How big is the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River? Judging by the size of its locks, very. Their monumentality and what they tell us of nature's power and man's ability to harness it are the chief subjects of this imposing two-screen film installation. Shot from a crane high on a barge during passes through the dam's locks, the facing screens provide a fore and aft view of the journey, perfectly synched. The gallery feels like the barge's invisible middle section. You don't quite realize the immensity of the structures until you notice the tiny figures moving along gangways at the barges' edges. As a metaphor for the new China, it is pretty intimidating. Galerie LeLong, 528 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 315-0470, www.galerielelong.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)",

    "abstract": "I.     ''Behold!'' reads an official police notice on the waiting-room wall at the Bethnal Green police station, in the East London borough of Tower Hamlets. ''Fear from people should not prevent one from saying the truth if he knows it.'' It is a hadith saying of the Prophet Muhammad, stuck amid a row of posters urging Britons to do their civic duty and report any crimes they might get wind of. Tower Hamlets, which includes large Bengali and Somali communities, is a majority-minority borough. Someone there apparently felt that the hadith poster might help woo those for whom civic duty was an insufficient spur. Today, Britain has more than a million and a half Muslims. A million live in London, where they make up an eighth of the population. They are not just the refugees and tempest-tossed laborers of the developing world, large though those groups may be. London's West End is full of Saudi princes and financiers, and journalists and politicians from around the Arab world; its East End is home to erudite theologians from the Indian subcontinent, along with some unhinged ones. In the 1980's and 90's, a hands-off government allowed London to become a haven for radicals and a center for calls to jihad. Culturally and politically (and theologically and gastronomically), London ranks among the capitals of the Muslim world and is certainly its chief point of contact with the United States and the rest of the West. Since last July 7, when four young British Muslims used backpack bombs to take their own lives and those of 52 others on London's public-transport system, getting information out of the city's various Muslim communities has become a desperate preoccupation of British law enforcement.

    "lead_paragraph": "\"We\u2019re not going anywhere,\u2019\u2019 my driver, Nelson Okello, whispered to me one morning this past June, the two of us sitting in the front seat of a jeep just after dawn in Queen Elizabeth National Park in southwestern Uganda. We\u2019d originally stopped to observe what appeared to be a lone bull elephant grazing in a patch of tall savanna grasses off to our left. More than one \u2018\u2018rogue\u2019\u2019 had crossed our path that morning \u2014 a young male elephant that has made an overly strong power play against the dominant male of his herd and been banished, sometimes permanently. This elephant, however, soon proved to be not a rogue but part of a cast of at least 30. The ground vibrations registered just before the emergence of the herd from the surrounding trees and brush. We sat there watching the elephants cross the road before us, seeming, for all their heft, so light on their feet, soundlessly plying the wind-swept savanna grasses like land whales adrift above the floor of an ancient, waterless sea.

    "abstract": "Selective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.    Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'THE SCENE' In previews; opens on Jan. 11. A buzz-maker at the Humana Festival, Theresa Rebeck's new play is about an out-of-work actor who doesn't solve his problems by having an affair. Tony Shalhoub (''Monk'') and Patricia Heaton (''Everybody Loves Raymond'') star (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    'TRANSLATIONS' Previews start on Thursday; opens on Jan. 25. Brian Friel's drama about a British officer in 19th-century rural Ireland deals with themes of language, imperialism and culture clash. Garry Hynes directs (1:55). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley)    'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'BECOMING ADELE' Eric Houston's one-woman show about a young Brooklyn waitress's journey to self-actualization imagines a New York where fairy tales are possible even for the very ordinary. The sentiment is heavy and thick, but Kimberly Stern's performance burrows through it to deliver moving moments (1:40). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Ginia Bellafante)    'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)    *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)    'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)    'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY'  Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Neil Genzlinger)    'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER'  As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'TWO TRAINS RUNNING'  Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'STRINGS' Keir Dullea stars in Carole Bugg\u00e9's intelligent but ultimately unsuccessful ''Copenhagen''-inspired drama about three scientists on a train (1:45). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 362-0329. (Gates)    'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'TRUE WEST' This perfectly pleasant new version of Sam Shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    Spectacles    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25).

Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100.

(Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30); closing tomorrow. The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Gates)    'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'CIRCUS OZ' Welcome holiday entertainment (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Van Gelder)    'A CRAZY SOUND' The Italian avant-gardist Dario D'Ambrosi offers a jaunty, unexpectedly feel-good musical about the mentally ill (1:15). La MaMa's Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)    'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included.) It's bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100; closing on Tuesday. (Isherwood)    'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    * 'KAOS'  Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (John Rockwell)    'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000; closing tomorrow. (Van Gelder)    * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    ' 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE' Five prominent writers -- Christopher Durang, Mac Wellman, Elizabeth Swados, Roger Rosenblatt and Len Jenkin -- toss off short plays inspired by this Christmas poem, and the Flea Theater's troupe of young actors attack them with verve. The Swados piece, ''Holiday Movies,'' is as wacky as they come (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80s Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more ''Braveheart'' than ''Passion of the Christ.'' Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott)    'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future in which the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, ''Automatons'' leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)    'BLACK CHRISTMAS' (R, 100 minutes) It's been more than 30 years since the original ''Black Christmas'' revealed how much fun it could be to unleash a psycho in a sorority house. Glen Morgan's disastrous remake not only sidelines the original's hilariously obscene phone calls but also drags its unseen killer, and his psychoses, into the light. Smothering terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, the movie is no more than a dismal Christmas card to its predecessor. (Catsoulis)    'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)    'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)    * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)    'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)    'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott)    * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis)    'COPYING BEETHOVEN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) The director Agnieszka Holland and her star Ed Harris bring intelligence and passion to a fictional account about the creation of the Ninth Symphony. Diane Kruger also stars. (Dargis)    'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Catsoulis)    'DEATH OF A PRESIDENT' (No rating, 93 minutes) This fake-umentary, the subject of much hyperventilation since it was shown at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, imagines what might happen if George W. Bush were assassinated. Condemned as irresponsible wishful thinking by some, hailed as a brave artistic statement by others, the movie, directed by Gabriel Range, is far too banal to merit such strong responses. Its formal cleverness wears thin and after a while exposes a lazy, pretentious form of provocation. (Scott)    'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)    'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis)    * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)    'ERAGON' (PG, 99 minutes) This lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Edward Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. Some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. (Catsoulis)    * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)    * '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)    * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 2:12 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)    'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Stephen Holden)    * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)    'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)    'THE GOOD SHEPHERD' (R, 157 minutes) This chilly film about a spy trapped in the cold of his own heart, seeks to put a tragic human face on the Central Intelligence Agency, namely that of Matt Damon. The story more or less begins and ends at the Bay of Pigs. Although the film seems true in broad outline and scrupulous detail, there is something ungraspable and unknowable about this world, even if it is also one we ourselves have helped create. (Dargis)    'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh tries to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis)    'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)    'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this ferociously engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)    * 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)    'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)    * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)    * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)    'MATTHEW BARNEY: NO RESTRAINT' (No rating, 72 minutes) Alison Chernick's aptly titled documentary takes us aboard a Japanese whaling vessel to witness the filming of the artist Matthew Barney's ''Drawing Restraint 9,'' a love story in which he and his partner, Bj\u00f6rk, dress up, drink tea and transform into whales. But after a meager 72 minutes, the man who stretched an obsession with testicles into a five-film cycle remains as much of an enigma as ever. (Catsoulis)    'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)    'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM' (PG, 108 minutes) This season's answer to ''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' it's an overstuffed grab bag in which lumps of coal are glued together with melted candy. (Holden)    'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)    'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)    'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning, Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden)    'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)    'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)    * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almod\u00f3var, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)    Film Series    THE COMPLETE JACQUES RIVETTE (Tonight through Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Jacques Rivette, the innovative French New Wave director, concludes this weekend with two features. Mr. Rivette's most recent film, ''The Story of Marie and Julien'' (2003), a romantic mystery starring Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, plays tonight.

RETURNS (Today through Wednesday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center is presenting eight Pedro Almod\u00f3var films over the holidays. This weekend's features include ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' (1988), Mr. Almod\u00f3var's raucous portrait of the rejected and the high-strung; ''The Flower of My Secret'' (1995), about a romance novelist with creative and personal problems; and ''All About My Mother'' (1999), in which Pen\u00e9lope Cruz plays a pregnant nun. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $10 (but $20 buys a pass to all eight movies). (Gates)    FRANZ WAXMAN: MUSIC FOR THE CINEMA (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Waxman (1906-1967), the German composer, with a 21-film retrospective. This weekend's films include ''Sayonara'' (1957), which employed a mix of American and Asian musical styles; ''Rebecca'' (1940), Hitchcock's haunting translation of the du Maurier romance; and ''Old Acquaintance'' (1943), starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins as longtime friends and rivals.

A-BONES, SWINGIN' NECKBREAKERS (Sunday) Meaty, beaty, big and retro: the brawny sounds of gourmet 1960s-style garage-rock. The A-Bones' take on this sound is brusque and raw, while the Swingin' Neckbreakers play a more controlled version that recalls the Flamin' Groovies, the 1970s band that was perhaps the first (and best) in a long line of '60s garage revivalists. At 8 p.m., Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069, magneticbrooklyn.com; $15. (Ben Sisario)    SANDRA BERNHARD (Tonight through Sunday) Expect outrageous comedy, but also expect some oddly dull music from Sandra Bernhard, like her colorless recent holiday song, ''Miracle of Lights,'' or her cover of the late-period Cheap Trick song ''The Flame,'' which is thankfully tucked into a hilarious routine about rescuing her daughter from a bad boyfriend. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7 and 9:30, Sunday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $45 tonight and tomorrow; $100 Sunday at 7:30, $150 at 10:30. (Sisario)    BLACK LIPS (Tonight and Sunday) Sounding like a nightmarish variant of the 13th Floor Elevators or the Troggs, the Black Lips, from Atlanta, play a grisly version of 1960s garage-rock that is deliberately damaged. Tonight at 10, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10. Sunday at 9 p.m., at Silent Barn, 915 Wyckoff Avenue, at Hancock Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com. (Sisario)    BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Tonight and Sunday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls.

Tonight at 9, with Kudu and DJ Hardedge, and Sunday at 9:30 p.m., at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $30 tonight; for Sunday, $55 in advance or $60 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    ELECTRIC SIX (Tomorrow and Sunday) Electric Six looks fondly back to the early 1980s merger of rock guitars, disco beats and electro blips, with arch and gleefully overblown songs about dancing and romance, like ''Danger! High Voltage'' and ''Nuclear War'' (''on the dance floor''). With the Dansettes on Sunday. At 10 both nights, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15 tomorrow, $25 on Sunday. (Pareles)    * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight through Sunday) The strongest incarnation so far of this singer and pianist's annual holiday bash, ''Home for the Holidays,'' a live variety show featuring a six-member band and three backup vocalists, is a perfect showcase for Mr. Feinstein to balance his two sides: a gregarious stand-up entertainer and an intimate crooner dreaming out loud. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11, Sunday night at 9, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover and $40 minimum tonight and tomorrow night, $650 on Sunday. (Stephen Holden)    RACHELLE GARNIEZ (Thursday) Ms. Garniez is a songwriter who plays accordion, which leads her to wrap her playful songs and hyperactive voice in country tunes, waltzes or wheezy ballads. At 10 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $8. (Pareles)    GLASSJAW (Tonight) This tough-as-nails Long Island band was a big player in the dissonant, tantrum-prone punk subgenre sometimes called screamo or post-hardcore, which peaked in the early years of this decade. A revolving door of lineup changes kept the band from moving forward, but Glassjaw is now reportedly working on a new album. At 6:30, with This Is Hell and Crime in Stereo, at Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario)    GOV'T MULE (Tonight through Sunday) Led by the Allman Brothers guitarist Warren Haynes, this Southern-rock-meets-Led Zeppelin jam band plays three shows for New Year's weekend, with notable guests each night. Tonight is Los Lobos, the enduring Latino rock band from Los Angeles; tomorrow is the North Mississippi Allstars, whose blues-rock wanders into jam territory; and Sunday features Toots Hibbert, the Jamaican singer who, with his band the Maytals, helped shape reggae from the very beginning. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 9 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; $40.50 to $63.50 tonight and tomorrow night; $55 to $79.50 on Sunday. (Sisario)    * 'HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL: THE CONCERT' (Tonight and Sunday) Cynical parents might compare it to the Monkees. But what in the world could be wrong with ''I'm a Believer''? Or, for that matter, with ''Breaking Free,'' the PG-rated climax from ''High School Musical,'' the Disney Channel phenomenon whose soundtrack is the best-selling album of the year? Performing the songs from this tween ''Grease,'' to the accompaniment of many thousands of squeals, will be the cast of the movie, or at least most of it: Zac Efron, who played the heartthrob, Troy, is replaced here by Drew Seeley, who supplied many of Troy's vocals on the soundtrack. Tonight at 7, Sunday afternoon at 3, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; sold out tonight, $35.50 to $55.50 on Sunday. (Sisario)    * JENNIFER HUDSON (Tomorrow) This former ''American Idol'' finalist and star of ''Dreamgirls'' performs songs from that movie in a one-off concert choreographed by Hinton Battle, who also appears in the film. And if that's not enough ''Dreamgirls'' for you, the concert will be followed by remixes of music from the movie by the celebrity DJ Junior Vasquez. At 10 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, saintatlarge.com; $90 in advance, $100 at the door. (Sisario)    JAMES HUNTER (Tomorrow) After years honing his style in London pubs, this dapper British singer has emerged with ''People Gonna Talk'' (Go/Rounder), recreating with care and affection the smooth, slithery R&B of early-1960s American singers like Sam Cooke and Little Willie John. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $29 at the door. (Sisario)    JAPANTHER (Thursday) This Brooklyn avant-rock duo has bridged the gap between scruffy noise-punk and contemporary art: for the latest Whitney Biennial, the band collaborated with Dan Graham, Rodney Graham, Laurent P. Berger and Tony Oursler on a live puppet opera called ''Don't Trust Anyone Over 30.'' But perhaps even more impressive, Japanther has also provided musical accompaniment for a synchronized-swimming performance. Anyone who has witnessed synchronized swimming knows that can't be easy. At 8 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $8. (Sisario)    MOE (Tomorrow and Sunday) One chord is all Moe needs to start one of its nimble, quick-fingered jams. Its music starts with the Grateful Dead-Allman Brothers hybrids that most jam bands use, and from there it takes off toward Southern rock, spacy interludes or the borderline of funk. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. Sunday at 9 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $52.50. (Pareles)    REBIRTH BRASS BAND (Tomorrow) A New Orleans institution since the 1980s, the Rebirth Brass Band updates the traditional strutting rhythms and continuous improvisation of New Orleans parades with an infusion of funk.

King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles)    VERNON REID (Tonight) Long after his time as the lead guitarist of Living Colour, Mr. Reid continues to play in ways so weirdly innovative that he sometimes seems more magician than mere musician. Tonight he offers ''A Night of Pure Guitar'' with Rob Balducci and Dave Weiner. At 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $15. (Sisario)    THE SLIP (Sunday) New Year's Eve was made for jam bands, which are used to playing all night without exhausting themselves (or their audiences). The Slip, from Boston, plays a mild jazz fusion that veers into the abstract post-rock of Tortoise. With Meowskers.

(Sisario)    * PATTI SMITH (Tonight through Sunday) For the ninth year, Ms. Smith and her band ring in the new year with noise, poetry and rock 'n' roll.

(Sisario)    * SPOON (Tomorrow) Led by Britt Daniel, one of the best songwriters ever to get stuck with the meaningless appellation ''indie,'' Spoon, from Austin, Tex., accomplishes a lot with a little. Its tight, jabby songs, influenced equally by minimalist post-punk and sentimental white soul, are beguiling miniatures that seem to end just when you think you've figured them out. As a result, you must listen again and again and again. With Benjy Ferree, a rising singer-songwriter from Washington. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario)    THE SWORD (Tomorrow) Long live Black Sabbath. Or, at least, bands that sound an awful lot like them, such as the Sword, an Austin, Tex., group that seems to have most of what made Black Sabbath great. Fuzzy, decelerated blues-rock riffs? Check. Sasquatch tempo? Check. Songs about vague industrial-age catastrophes and medieval monsters? Check (''The Horned Goddess,'' ''Iron Swan''). Ozzy Osbourne? Well, no, even retro-rock has its limits. At 9 p.m., with Stinking Lizaveta and Motherboar, at Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)    UNCLE MONK (Wednesday) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this acoustic duo, singing tautly written numbers -- kind of like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. With Radio I-Ching and Who Put the Bad Mouth On Me? At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $8. (Sisario)    * THE VIEW (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Arctic Monkeys are so 2006. The next next wave of hyperactive British rock savants is the View, four teenagers from Dundee, Scotland, who play sharp, tuneful pop-punk that resembles that of  the Arctic Monkeys. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., with the Diggs and Favourite Sons, at the Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. (Sisario)    WHITE MAGIC (Thursday) Mira Billotte's songs in White Magic are both spartan and spooky, with simple piano figures underlying vocals that can be steady incantations or elaborate, multilayered rhapsodies. With Women and Children, and Legends. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10.

ABERCROMBIE, BYRON, GOMEZ AND WHITE (Thursday) The guitarist John Abercrombie, the clarinetist and tenor saxophonist Don Byron, the bassist Eddie Gomez and the drummer Lenny White make up this all-star collective, which seems predisposed to lean toward the funky side.

(Nate Chinen)    BALLIN' THE JACK (Thursday) This midsize ensemble, led by the clarinetist and saxophonist Matt Darriau, customarily spikes a swing-era repertory with madcap irreverence. That's certainly true of this engagement, featuring music from Marx Brothers film soundtracks, complete with Grouchoesque vocals from the alto saxophonist Roy Nathanson. At 8 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8.

(Chinen)    CHRIS BOTTI (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Botti's brooding trumpet style has won him a sizable audience, as has his standard-laden repertory.

(Chinen)    PAQUITO D'RIVERA AND THE PANAMERICAN JAZZ ENSEMBLE (Tonight through Sunday) Few musicians have a better claim to pan-Americana than Paquito D'Rivera, the clarinetist and saxophonist who toured extensively with Dizzy Gillespie's United Nation Orchestra. This engagement, at the club that bears Gillespie's name, will feature his more Latin-flavored tunes. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P.

(Chinen)    MAP (Wednesday) The guitarist Mary Halvorson, the bassist Reuben Radding and the drummer Tatsuya Nakatani make up this texture-minded ensemble, which put out a likable album (with a different bassist) a few years ago.

(Chinen)    * SAL MOSCA (Monday) Mr. Mosca has largely based his piano style -- and, to a considerable extent, his career -- on the heady legacy of the pianist-composer Lennie Tristano. But at 79, he assuredly has an improvisational voice of his own; he also has a cult following, chiefly among his former students. He performs infrequently, but that's only one reason that this trio engagement is a noteworthy event.

(Chinen)    TYSHAWN SOREY'S OBLIQUE / PETE ROBBINS AND CENTRIC (Tuesday) Two ambitious ensembles that combine spacious avant-gardism with the melodic punch of rock. Oblique is a sextet led by Mr. Sorey, a ferocious drummer, with ranks including Mr. Robbins on alto saxophone and clarinet. Centric, led by Mr. Robbins, also happens to include Mr. Sorey, along with other bright young players, like the trumpeter Jesse Neuman and the keyboardist Eliot Cardinaux. At 10 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 614-0505, bowerypoetry.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    STEVE TURRE QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Steve Turre, the trombonist and conch shell player, brings both virtuosity and restraint to the conventions of small-group hard bop; his group includes his wife, the cellist and vocalist Akua Dixon, as well as the pianist Ronnie Mathews, the bassist Gerald Cannon and the drummer Dion Parson. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $30. (Chinen)    BOBBY WATSON AND HORIZON (Tuesday through Thursday) The alto saxophonist Bobby Watson formed his first version of Horizon more than 20 years ago, managing to iron a sharp new crease into the legacy of Jazz Messengers-inspired hard bop. His current iteration of the group, as heard on the 2004 album ''Horizon Reassembled'' (Palmetto), consists of Terell Stafford on trumpet, Edward Simon on piano, Essiet Essiet on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. (Through Jan. 7.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    * JOHN ZORN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Noise is the currency at a John Zorn improv party, which can feature any number of open-minded participants; tomorrow's cast will include the violinist Mark Feldman, the cellist Okkyung Lee, the pianist Sylvie Courvoisier and the drummer Matt Wilson. Then, on New Year's Eve, Mr. Zorn plays an early set at Tonic with the bassist and producer Bill Laswell and the drummer Guy Licata, among others. Tomorrow at 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $20.

Opera    'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Tonight and Tuesday night) The excitement of a world premiere at the Met, combined with widespread public interest in the composer Tan Dun, who won an Oscar for his film score for ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' have resulted in a sold-out run for ''The First Emperor.'' Alas, though the story of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who unified the country through brutality and conquest, is compelling, Mr. Tan's ponderous score is a huge disappointment. There are gripping moments, especially some propulsive orchestra passages that incorporate Chinese instruments. But the opera's lyrical flights are slow-moving and sometimes cloying. Mr. Tan has tried to meld Chinese melody and Italianate lyricism. But his music seems caught in some nowhere land between ''Crouching Tiger'' and Puccini's ''Turandot.'' Even the great Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, bravely taking on the challenging title role, cannot save the show. The colorful production is by the Chinese film director Zhang Yimou (''House of Flying Daggers''). Mr. Tan conducts. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)    'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tonight through Sunday night) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. Now offered is Strauss's merry ''Fledermaus,'' with a rotating cast. The quality often varies, but the spirit is usually there. At 7:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+, $125 for the New Year's Eve gala. (Vivien Schweitzer)    'THE MAGIC FLUTE' (Today through Tuesday, and Thursday) Julie Taymor's whimsical, puppet-filled production has gone even more child-friendly, abridged by the director into a 100-minute version with a new English text by J. D. McClatchy. But the Met hasn't skimped on the casts. Today Matthew Polenzani sings Tamino, and Nathan Gunn is a lively, entertaining Papageno; they will be joined tomorrow by the fantastic German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape as Sarastro. James Levine conducts today through Sunday, and Jens Georg Bachmann conducts on Tuesday and Thursday. Today, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at 1 p.m.; tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. A live high-definition telecast will be shown tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. at the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-3809, filmlinc.com; $18; $15 for children. (Schweitzer)    'DIE ZAUBERFL\u00d6TE' (Monday and Thursday) This revival of Julie Taymor's production continues tomorrow at the Metropolitan Opera, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and convincing Pamina. James Levine conducts a cast that also includes Ren\u00e9 Pape as Sarastro, Christoph Strehl as Tamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno and Cornelia G\u00f6tz as Queen of the Night. On Thursday Scott Bergeson conducts, and Lisa Milne is Pamina. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175 to $375 tickets remain for Monday, and $15 to $175 for Thursday. (Schweitzer)    Classical Music    AMOR ARTIS (Sunday) Johannes Somary and his fine chamber orchestra and choir have made their New Year's Eve Bach concert a tradition over the past two decades. This performance, the 22nd installment, includes three Cantatas -- Nos. 137, 191 and 200 -- as well as the ''Brandenburg'' Concertos Nos. 3 and 5. At 9 p.m., St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 874-4513, amorartis.org; $40. (Allan Kozinn)    ARTEK (Tomorrow) This period-instrument group offers one of the last celebrations of the waning Mozart year, commemorating the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth. Enrico Gatti, an Italian violinist, leads the orchestra in ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,'' ''Serenata Notturno'' and arias from ''Don Giovanni,'' ''Il Re Pastore,'' ''La Clemenza di Tito'' and others, with Jessica Tranzillo, a soprano; Barbara Hollinshead, a mezzo-soprano; Drew Minter, a countertenor; and Philip Anderson, a tenor. The pianists Gwendolyn Toth, Artek's director, and Dongsok Shin, her husband, perform Mozart's Concerto for two fortepianos (K. 365). At 8 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 378-0248, artekearlymusic.org; $35 and $20; $10 off for students and 65+. (Schweitzer)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Thursday) Zubin Mehta returns to the Philharmonic next week. The opening work will be Beethoven's Violin Concerto, with Mr. Mehta's old friend the violinist Pinchas Zukerman as soloist, followed after intermission by Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' Mr. Mehta's tenure as music director of the Philharmonic has its defenders and detractors. But this Stravinsky score was a specialty of his back then. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; sold out. (Tommasini)    VASSILY PRIMAKOV AND KONSTANTIN SOUKHOVETSKI (Sunday) These two young pianists from the former Soviet Union, both in their 20s, play an interesting program of Beethoven, Czerny, John Corigliano and Tchaikovsky. Arium offers a little food and drink, and visual art as well. At 4 p.m., Arium Center for the Arts, 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; sold out. (Bernard Holland)    'THE VERY LEAST OF P. D. Q. BACH' (Tuesday) Skewering the traditions of the classical music world is one thing; finding the comedic opportunities inherent in the music itself is another, and that is Peter Schickele's art. His canvas is the life and work of P. D. Q. Bach, the fictional ''last and least'' of J. S. Bach's progeny. With Mr. Schickele as guide and commentator, Xian Zhang will lead the New York Philharmonic in a program that includes the ''Desecration of the House'' Overture, the ''1712'' Overture, ''Eine Kleine Kiddiemusik,'' the Prelude to ''Einstein on the Fritz'' and a venerable P. D. Q. classic, the ''Pervertimento'' for bagpipes, bicycle, balloons and strings. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $30 to $90.

If you want to see how real men pirouette, check out the Trocks, as they are called, performing classics like ''Swan Lake'' and creepy 20th-century ballets like ''The Cage.'' (Through Jan. 7.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44.

At 7:30, the Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; $12; $10 for groups. (Jack Anderson)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight and tomorrow) The final three performances of the 2006 installment of George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker.'' It may have been hard on its rotating casts of dancers, not to mention the orchestra and stagehands, but it's magic for the audience. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycballet.com; $15 to $110. (Rockwell)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Tigers of Wrath: Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Benjamin Genocchio)    Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)    * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951) portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)    * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Glueck)    Queens Museum of Art: 'Queens International 2006: Everything All at Once,' through Jan. 14. The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as of Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition's subtitle. The show tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer's quick-cut video ''Everyday,'' which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)    Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)    Galleries: Chelsea    * ATELIER VAN LIESHOUT: SLAVECITY In this only partly satirical show, architectural scale models, drawings, sculpture, a map and an extensive business plan propose a highly efficient, completely self-sufficient city whose ''participants'' each have a desk job, a farm job and very little time off. The tyranny of it all is brought home in the second gallery, which contains the ''Midi Disciplinator,'' a cell built to accommodate 18 people working in shifts, filing logs into sawdust for no good reason. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, through Jan. 6. (Smith)    * Noah Fischer, 'Rhetoric Machine' This young, Brooklyn-based artist has a winner of a first New York solo: a two-room, Rube-Goldbergesque kinetic environment set to a score of clips from doom-threatening speeches by United States presidents, ardent pop love songs and the baseline sound of jets and bombs. In sync with the soundtrack, low-tech, handmade light-projecting machines whir and jerk into life, turning the show into a combination of modernist ballet m\u00e9canique and gothic danse macabre. Technically ingenious and full of ideas, the show takes approximately 10 minutes to complete one sound-and-motion cycle. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, 5begallery.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)    * CANDIDA HOFER In large color photographs of the different galleries of the Louvre, taken on Tuesdays when the museum is closed, both the long, vaulted spaces and the painting and sculpture they contain speak of different times and styles. Equally effecting, if not a little frightening, is the lavish, timeless grandeur of these vistas. A palace that became a museum, the Louvre is also a precursor of the barrel-vaulted arcades that sprang up in Paris in the first half of the 19th century. Most of them are gone, but the Louvre's arcades live on. Sort of. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018. (Smith)    * CHEYNEY THOMPSON: 'QUELQUES ASPECTS DE L'ART BOURGEOIS: LA NON-INTERVENTION' A teasing, tantalizing, subtly beautiful show by one of the sharper young artists of the moment explores the tensions between street and studio, skill and skepticism, painting and nonpainting and culture and commerce with seemingly abstract canvases, photographs framed by folding street-vendor tables and tinted off-set lithographs of the gallery's storage shelves. The title translates as ''Certain Aspects of Bourgeois Art: Non-Intervention.'' Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, through Jan. 6. (Smith)    * 'When the Revolution Comes' The artist Michael St. John has brought some interesting people together in this scrappy, savory group show. It's great to revisit Nancy Grossman's leather-bound heads, looking as radical as they did 30 years ago, and Holt Quentel's distressed gray banners from the 1980s, out of view since but looking right, right now. Strong young artists like Nate Lowman, Joshua Weintraub and Josh White sustain growing reputations, and a bevy of less familiar figures -- Jamal Cyrus, A. J. Bocchino, Alex McQuilkan and Ellwyn Palmerton -- look good. Also in the gallery: a small solo of vivacious, minutely detailed drawings by Josedgardo Granados that bring pre-Columbian and post-Columbian worlds together in a cultural and psychic revolution still in progress. Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts, 508 West 26th Street, Suite 5A, (212) 463-8500, kathleencullenfinearts.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    * 'November'  The Los Angeles- based curator Jeffrey Uslip put together this obliquely topical group show, which includes several young West Coast-based artists. In a Babel-ish moment in art, language, scrambled and obscured, is one of the themes here, with Kara Tanaka's listening-booth sculpture transmuting past conversations into a melancholic music. Landscape as poisoned terrain is another. Surrealism, art's 21st-century Esperanto, is the prevailing language. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Greenwich and Hudson, South Village, (212) 206-1290, harrislieberman.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)    Last Chance    * 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with the Pratt Institute in New York City, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory ''The Voyage of Life'' (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age to the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794), by Gilbert Stuart, is a distinguished entry from the earlier part of the show. Post-World War II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, hirschlandadler.com; closes today. (Glueck)    * Asia Society: 'Gilded Splendor: Treasures of China's Liao Empire (907-1125)' The first major display of Liao objects outside China, this show gives the lie to the idea of the Khitan as cultural nobodies. Among the more exotic exhibits are those that reveal Khitan burial customs for royal personages: the corpse was first embalmed and then carefully wrapped in silk, and the adornments included a whole-body netting, a metal mask of gold or lesser material, a burial suit and an overcoat. The Khitan taste for jewelry, too, is evident in the elaborate, exquisitely worked examples on display. Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts and other personal objects; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments, embroidered fabrics, miniature pagodas used as containers for Buddhist scriptures; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)    * Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT' Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of ''Description de l'\u00c9gypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)    * Frick Collection: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING' Weighing in at 6 works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works that highlight Cimabue's radicalness without letting it completely steal the show. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; closes on Sunday. (Smith)    Museum of Modern Art: 'Eye on Europe: Prints, Books & Multiples, 1960 to Now' This is a woolly, at times idiosyncratic assemblage of more than 350 prints and multiple editions by 118 European artists. Although they are still often considered secondary mediums, the show charts how prints and multiple editions rose to prominence in the 1960s as an essentially democratic strategy, having largely to do with accessibility and affordability, as artists explored alternatives to conventional painting and sculpture. Following this are displays of artwork by contemporary artists working in these mediums. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org; closes on Monday. (Genocchio)    National Academy Museum: 'Luminist Horizons: The Art and Collection of James A. Suydam, 1819-1865' This show is the first museum survey of the career of this 19th-century American painter and is accompanied by a weighty monograph. His early works were painted in a smooth Luminist style compatible with his material, pleasantly detached scenes of rural tranquillity or calm seas beneath hazy skies. His masterwork, ''Paradise Rocks, Newport'' (1860), is an expansive, low-tide view of a wide, flat beach, meadow and distant rising rocks along the Rhode Island shoreline. The paintings in this show remind us that Mr. Suydam -- and his fellow Luminists -- were a talented group who helped bring a measure of sensitivity, subtlety and poetry to the American landscape tradition. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org; closes on Sunday. (Genocchio)    Parrish Art Museum: 'Roy Lichtenstein: American Indian Encounters' Lichtenstein is more popularly associated with his Pop paintings, often based on comic book images, than with the works here. But in the 1950s, using a somewhat Cubist style, he explored mythic characters like medieval knights or cowboys and Indians. ''Chief Before Teepee,'' an abstract oil painting, and ''Two Wild Indians,'' a drawing, both from 1952, were unearthed by the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation for the show's run at the Montclair Art Museum last year. Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton, N.Y., (631) 283-2118, Ext. 32, parrishart.org; closes on Sunday. (Carol Vogel)    'Replanting the Community Garden' Organized by the artist Michael Tong, this show consists of two environmental pieces. William Brent, a professional landscape designer, contributes an ''Urban Air Scrubber,'' a closet-size smoker's lounge filled with air-purifying plants. A wood construction by Adam Brent is made of shelves holding miniature plants; it's a model for real plant holders and shelters that might be built in tight urban spaces, an idea that makes particular sense at this venerable, financially vulnerable gallery in a neighborhood where grass-roots empty-lot gardens have long been a source of local pride. Tribes Gallery, 285 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 674-3778, www.tribes.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    Wadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson River School Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum' Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)    Paul McCarthy: 'Between Beauty and the Beast' Despite the scattershot nature of this show, mostly of work from around 1990 to 2004, Mr. McCarthy's signature moves and gestures are all here. His scatological side is represented by a selection of drawings featuring crude, sexualized doodles and misspelled messages, unpublishable here, that recall graffiti in public restrooms. In ''Masks'' (1994), the abject and uncanny are explored in a suite of large-scale color photographs of soiled silicon masks that mix fear with surprising pathos. His work also continues to reveal itself as a corrective, or perhaps an addendum, to more antiseptic strains of 1960s Pop. Rather than celebrating or criticizing popular images, Mr. McCarthy plays the role of analyst, musing on the creepy cheerfulness of cartoon characters and their incarnations as amusement park mascots. The seven bright-hued sculptures of ''Dwarf Head'' (2000) borrow from Walt Disney's ''Snow White.'' Only here the dwarfs look decapitated and cryogenically preserved, their cuteness transformed into an eternal, chilling blankness. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy ZPark South, Suite 8D, (212) 955-1785, nyehaus.com; closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)",

    "abstract": "Selective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.    Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'BECOMING ADELE' Previews start today; opens on Wednesday. Eric Houston's solo comedy about the coming of age of a Brooklynite (1:40). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200.    'EXTRAORDINARY DECEPTIONS: A MAGICAL HOLIDAY EXTRAVAGANZA' Starts performances on Tuesday. Get sawed in half at this holiday magic show (1:00). Lion Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4100.    'THE SCENE' In previews; opens on Jan. 11. A buzz-maker at the Humana Festival, Theresa Rebeck's new play is about an out-of-work actor who doesn't solve his problems by having an affair. Tony Shalhoub (''Monk'') and Patricia Heaton (''Everybody Loves Raymond'') star (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    Broadway    'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first installment of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, this production pulses with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast, led by Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday-season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Anita Gates)    'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)    'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom-night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    * 'HOME' Almost nothing happens in David Storey's ''Home'' -- except to those lucky enough to be in the audience, who are likely to find themselves profoundly touched by this portrait of four lost souls in a home for the mentally challenged or disturbed. The play hasn't been seen much since it was on Broadway in 1970, but the Actors Company Theater's production makes you wonder why. The performances by the four leads, Simon Jones, Larry Keith, Cynthia Harris and Cynthia Darlow, are simply exquisite. Samuel Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)    * 'KAOS'  Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (John Rockwell)    'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). The SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)    * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER'  As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'THAT TIME OF YEAR' Who would have thought that fruitcake jokes could still be funny? But three singing fruitcakes are among the daffy high points of this original musical revue, which surprises repeatedly by getting laughs from standard-issue seasonal themes both Jewish and Christian. There are clunkers, but you leave feeling that the season's a bit brighter (2:00). Theater at St. Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820. (Genzlinger)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'TWO TRAINS RUNNING'  Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'NEVER MISSED A DAY' A well-observed and sometimes funny play about a group of co-workers who are giving their souls to the company, and one who has lived to regret it. A good cast brings the characters to life, but their common beef against an unseen boss offers little in the way of conflict (1:30). The WorkShop Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton)    'TRUE WEST' This perfectly pleasant new version of Sam Shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Monday. (Genzlinger)    'FLOYD AND CLEA UNDER THE WESTERN SKY' Floyd and Clea are two country-western singers who strike up an oddball friendship in this gentle but seriously sentimental two-person musical, written by and starring David Cale (1:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'HIGH FIDELITY' This bland musical adaptation of the popular book and movie of the same title erases itself from your memory even as you watch it. Walter Bobbie directs a cast led by the affable and smooth Will Chase (2:00). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza Strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'OPEN DOOR' Federico Restrepo and Loco 7's ''dance puppet music odyssey'' about the joys of immigration is striking and evocative, even if some specific messages aren't altogether clear (1:10). La MaMa E.T.C. (Annex Theater), 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Gates)    'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)    'TWO SEPTEMBER' Mac Wellman calls a halt to his usual brainy wordplay in this surprisingly sober (and rather dry) historical drama that tells two tangentially related stories. The journalist Josephine Herbst recalls her struggles duing the blacklist years, while Ho Chi Minh meets with United States officials in 1945 to seek their aid in forming a new country from the ruins of postwar Indochina (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles.

'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more ''Braveheart'' than ''Passion of the Christ.'' Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott)    * 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, who died in June. (Scott)    'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future where the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, ''Automatons'' leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'BERGMAN ISLAND' (No rating, 101 minutes, in Swedish and English) This documentary portrait of the great Swedish director, now 88 and living on the desolate Baltic Island of Faro, is extraordinarily revealing. In this extended interview, interwoven with fragments from his pictures, he recalls his life and loves and discusses his fear of death. The film underscores the intensely autobiographical nature of his art. (Stephen Holden)    'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)    'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)    * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)    'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)    'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)    'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis)    'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the ''smartest and coolest thief alive,'' and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz)    'FAMILY LAW' (No rating, 102 minutes, in Spanish) Exploratory variations on that old saw, ''Like father, like son,'' are the thematic heart of this third installment of the Argentine filmmaker Daniel Burman's semiautobiographical trilogy of films about fatherhood. The delicate, bittersweet comedy about the relationship of father-and-son lawyers prepares you for an eruption of high drama that never arrives. (Holden)    * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)    * '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)    'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)    * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)    'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)    'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)    'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)    'HERMANAS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Spanish) The ghost of 1970s Argentina haunts 1980s Texas in this perceptive and beautifully acted drama from the Argentine director Julia Solomonoff. After eight years of exile in Spain, Natalia (Ingrid Rubio) travels to Texas to visit her sister, Elena (Valeria Bertuccelli), a suburban wife and mother. Extensive flashbacks to the sisters' teenage years during the military dictatorship reveal a rich vein of familial guilt and long-suppressed resentment. But the movie is most successful in the rocky emotional spaces in which the women struggle to reconcile over a chasm of political discord and unanswered questions. (Catsoulis)    'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)    * 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)    * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 2:10 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)    * 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)    'NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VAN WILDER 2: THE RISE OF TAJ' (R, 98 minutes) Britain and India face off in this strained attempt to transplant the American campus comedy to more uptight shores. Now graduated from college -- and sidekick status -- Taj Mahal Badalandabad (Kal Penn) heads to Camford University in England to pursue a Ph.D. and a bad reputation. While the screenplay dives into British history, and the camera dives into every cleavage in sight, the director, Mort Nathan, harnesses smut and silliness to an oddly innocent tale of true love. (Catsoulis)    'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)    'RUNNING WITH SCISSORS' (R, 116 minutes) From Augusten Burroughs's best-selling memoir, this movie is a showcase of high-quality acting (especially from Annette Bening) without much in the way of dramatic coherence or emotional power. (Scott)    'THE SANTA CLAUSe 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE' (G, 98 minutes) Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no. (Dargis)    * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)    'TURISTAS' (R, 89 minutes) If stupidity were a crime, the nitwits in this cheap horror flick would be doing time in Attica. (Dargis)    'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)    * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almod\u00f3var, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)    Film Series    THE COMPLETE JACQUES RIVETTE (Tomorrow through Dec. 31) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of the innovative French New Wave director continues this weekend with four features. They include ''Merry-Go-Round'' (1983), starring Joe Dallesandro as a New Yorker in Paris, searching for a missing woman; and ''Divertimento'' (1991), Mr. Rivette's shortened version of ''La Belle Noiseuse,'' his own four-hour study of the artistic process. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Anita Gates)    FOX BEFORE THE CODE (Tonight through Dec. 21) Film Forum's three-week retrospective of Fox Studios films that predate Hollywood's family-values-driven Production Code continues this weekend with seven movies. They include ''Looking for Trouble'' (1934), starring Spencer Tracy as a telephone company employee mixed up with crooks, and ''Week Ends Only'' (1932), with Joan Bennett as a young woman in financial need who takes up some questionable part-time work. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $10. (Gates)    FRANZ WAXMAN: MUSIC FOR THE CINEMA (Tomorrow through Jan. 17) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Mr. Waxman (1906-67), the German composer who wrote the scores for ''Sunset Boulevard'' and ''Rebecca,'' with a 21-film retrospective, beginning tomorrow. This weekend's films include Fritz Lang's ''Liliom'' (1934), starring Charles Boyer as a womanizer who has difficulties in the afterlife; Hans Steinhoff's ''Scampolo, ein Kind der Strasse'' (1932), starring Dolly Haas as a homeless waif in Berlin; and James Whale's horror classic ''The Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935), which featured Mr. Waxman's first original Hollywood score. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates)    LOOKING IN/LOOKING OUT: DOCUMENTARIES FROM SCANDINAVIA (Tomorrow) Scandinavia House's festival of documentaries from five countries winds up tomorrow with Nahid Persson's ''Prostitution Behind the Veil'' (2005), a Danish film about two Iranian streetwalkers and their children. It will be screened with ''The Clown Children,'' a 2005 Norwegian documentary about young street performers. 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779, scandinaviahouse.org; $8. (Gates)    THE RETURN OF THOMAS H. INCE (Monday through Dec. 29) The Museum of Modern Art's two-week tribute to Mr. Ince (1880-1924), the silent-era director, producer, screenwriter and murder victim (aboard William Randolph Hearst's yacht), began yesterday. It continues on Monday with films including ''The Bargain'' (1914), a western starring William S. Hart as a bad guy in need of redemption; and ''Hail the Woman'' (1921), a melodrama about a young woman whose puritanical father throws her out of the house. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    CORINNE BAILEY RAE, KEVIN DEVINE (Tonight) Even when she is griping that love is ''a type of loan with no dividends,'' it is hard not to be seduced by Ms. Bailey Rae, a 27-year-old British singer and guitarist who is this year's breakout soul star. In a sweet, tissue-thin voice that can recall Macy Gray or Sade, she sings of sisterly rituals, loves lost and her ''choux pastry heart.'' Mr. Devine, once of the band Miracle of 86, has carved out a niche as a singer-songwriter in the Elliott Smith mold. At 7:30, Housing Works Used Book Cafe, 126 Crosby Street, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3324, housingworks.org; sold out. (Ben Sisario)    BOGMEN (Thursday) The fence-mending reunion thing worked well for '90s alternative giants like the Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., so what about the littler guys? A decade ago, the Bogmen were one of the biggest local draws in New York, mingling cynical lyrics with propulsive guitar riffs and the occasional funk rhythm. It was textbook alt-rock, but the Bogmen struggled to find a national audience and disbanded in 1999. The band's three-day revival begins Thursday at Webster Hall. At 8 p.m., 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $50. (Sisario)    CHAVEZ (Tomorrow) Did somebody say '90s New York alt-rock reunion? A decade ago Chavez's hefty, dissonant guitars and shy vocals fit right in with the music of Pavement, Archers of Loaf and Sebadoh. Now, with a new double album, ''Better Days Will Haunt You'' (Matador), collecting the complete works of the band -- it lasted only three years -- Chavez returns for this concert at Warsaw. Also on the bill is the aptly named Endless Boogie. At 8 p.m., 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $15. (Sisario)    CHEETAH GIRLS (Thursday) Behold the new teenage pop: it is female, its reference points are sexed-up strutters like the Pussycat Dolls and Christina Aguilera, and it has the Disney seal of approval. The Cheetah Girls began as a Disney Channel movie, and the group's latest album (the soundtrack to the sequel) opened in the Top 5. With Everlife. At 7 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $26.50 to $42. (Sisario)    CHILDREN OF BODOM (Sunday) From Finland, an exemplar of the operatically dismal but technically dazzling black-metal school. With Amon Amarth, Sanctity and Gojira. At 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $22.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)    MARSHALL CRENSHAW (Wednesday) Mr. Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970s styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. With Matt Keating. At 8 p.m., the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    * THE EX (Tonight) Visits from this long-running Dutch band are too rare. Devoted to leftist political ideals, the group chocks its lyrics full of topical allusions and has been known to include 140-page books about the Spanish Civil War with its albums. Admirable, sure. But in concert the Ex is blessedly all about the beat: a brawny, anxious punk-funk that never releases its tension. The effect is unforgettably visceral. With Arbouretum and DJ/rupture. At 10, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $12. (Sisario)    * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight and tomorrow night, Tuesday through Thursday) The strongest incarnation so far of the singer and pianist's annual holiday bash, ''Home for the Holidays,'' a live variety show featuring a six-member band and three backup vocalists, is a perfect showcase for Mr. Feinstein to balance his two sides: a gregarious stand-up entertainer and an intimate crooner dreaming out loud. At 8:30 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover and $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden)    GOGOL BORDELLO (Thursday) With an untamed stage persona a bit like Iggy Pop and a bit like a paranoid Kafka protagonist, the singer-contortionist Eugene Hutz leads a cultural mash-up of dirty punk, raucous Gypsy music and vaudevillian theatrics. The band has been playing like there's no tomorrow for years now and shows no signs of slowing down or even taking a breath. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario)    GOOD FOR THE JEWS (Tonight) The tree has been lighted in Rockefeller Center and the department-store window displays have gone up, which means that it's time for the annual ritual of comedians and rockers musing on the true meaning of being Jewish at Christmas. Among the witty reindeer joining the band Good for the Jews for this Hanukkah concert are the singers Lisa Loeb, Tammy Faye Starlite and Julian Fleisher, and the comedians Todd Barry and Rachel Feinstein. At 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $17. (Sisario)    * KIKI & HERB (Wednesday) Fresh from a run on Broadway, the world's most brilliantly perverse cabaret duo does its Christmas show, a highlight of which some years ago was a raucous medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman.'' At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)    JOE LALLY (Tomorrow) Mr. Lally's smooth, muscular bass lines steadied the sound of Fugazi, the alt-rock granddaddies from Washington. His first solo album, recorded while Fugazi is on hiatus, was released this fall. With the Shondes and Rude Mechanical Orchestra. At 8:30 p.m., Lit Lounge, 92 Second Avenue, at Fifth Street, East Village, (212) 777-7987, litloungenyc.com; $6. (Sisario)    RAY LAMONTAGNE (Tomorrow) A master of the breathy, apologetic croon, Mr. LaMontagne, a former shoe factory worker in Maine, has risen fast in the world of hypersensitive young singer-songwriters. His songs about ''trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble'' have also begun to dent the pop world, with cover versions by the ''American Idol'' winners Kelly Clarkson and Taylor Hicks. Also on the bill is Tristan Prettyman. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario)    LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO ELTON JOHN (Tonight and tomorrow night) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring Loser's Lounge series, now 13 years old, both honors and skewers pop greats with clever but usually over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to Mr. John. At 7 and 9, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario)    MATISYAHU (Tomorrow, Sunday and Tuesday) Both the best and worst Hasidic reggae singer in the world, Matisyahu -- who grew up as Matthew Miller in White Plains and followed Phish before discovering orthodox Judaism -- plays a three-night ''Festival of Light'' series of concerts for Hanukkah, a week before his new album, ''No Place to Be,'' is to be released by Epic Records. Opening the shows are Mr. Lif and the Coup tomorrow, Ben Kweller on Sunday and John Brown's Body on Tuesday. At 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $32 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)    THE NEW DEAL (Tonight) Jam bands and electronic dance music usually call for different beats and different wardrobes, but their goal is the same: to make dancers happy with open-ended grooves. The New Deal brings both camps together, using human muscle to approximate computerized breakbeats. With Benzos. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $28. (Pareles)    POPA CHUBBY (Tonight) Popa Chubby hails from the Bronx, but his heart is in steamy, rambunctious Chicago blues and its 1960s-rock spinoffs. In a gruff voice, he sings about characters like a ''sweet goddess of love and beer''; his guitar solos coil and bite. With Irving Louis Lattin. At 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $30. (Pareles)    * RAINER MARIA (Tomorrow and Sunday) For a decade, this earnest and literate trio, which began in Madison, Wis., and moved to Brooklyn, could be counted on for big, urgent cries that sounded just a bit louder than the players were comfortable with (and that's not always a bad thing). Last month it announced that it would be disbanding, and these are its last concerts in New York. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., with Pela and Daylight's for the Birds, at the Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out.

(Sisario)    * LOU REED'S 'BERLIN' (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Reed performs his bleak and beautiful 1973 cabaret-rock album in full for the first time, with friends including Antony and Sharon Jones on backup vocals, and with sets and projections by Julian Schnabel and his daughter Lola. At 8 p.m., St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org; sold out. (Sisario)    SAM CHAMPION (Tonight) This local four-piece derives its shambolic jangle from Pavement, singing about being ''aggressively lazy''; the aggression comes in tense jabs of guitar that recall Neil Young. With Brian Bonz. At 8, Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $8. (Sisario)    OUMOU SANGARE (Tomorrow) Ms. Sangare comes from the Wassoulou section of Mali, where women have a tradition of singing to entertain and instruct. Her group plays circular, triple-time vamps -- griot music tinged with funk -- as her voice soars above them, smooth and impassioned; backup singers spur her onward and dance, tossing bowls in the air. At 7:30 p.m., Aaron Davis Hall, City College, Convent Avenue at West 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7289, carnegiehall.org; free, but tickets are required.

(Many other stations around the country have similar shows.) Playing short sets for Z100 (WHTZ-FM) -- er, for fans, that is -- are Evanescence, the Killers, Nelly Furtado, the Fray, Nick Lachey, Rihanna, the Pussycat Dolls and RBD.

MOSE ALLISON (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Allison is best known for his songs, which combine cosmopolitan wit with a folksy worldview. He enacts a similar fusion as a pianist and singer, recasting Delta blues in bebop's hipster argot. At 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $30. (Nate Chinen)    BASSDRUMBONE (Thursday) The bassist Mark Helias, the drummer Gerry Hemingway and the trombonist Ray Anderson first began knocking about together as BassDrumBone nearly 30 years ago. They have a taut new album, ''The Line Up'' (Clean Feed), that once again proves the haleness of their rapport. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    CHRIS BOTTI (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Botti is a trumpeter whose photogenic style and brooding sensuality suit current notions of the standard songbook as a lifestyle accessory. But his low-gloss polish is generally likable, and he tends to stretch out a bit with his first-rate band. (Through Dec. 24.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592 bluenote.net; cover, $50 at tables, $35 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

Opera    'LA BOH\u00c8ME' (Tomorrow) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown ''Boh\u00e8me'' returns to the Metropolitan Opera for its regular airing. Rolando Villaz\u00f3n, the talented Mexican tenor, is a convincing Rodolfo, although his voice and charisma are somewhat dwarfed by the massive sets. Tomorrow his Mim\u00ec is Maija Kovalevska, the Latvian soprano who was one of the first-prize winners in the 2006 Operalia Competition, which Pl\u00e1cido Domingo runs for young singers. Anna Samuil is Musetta, and Peter Coleman-Wright ably sings her jealous lover, Marcello. Steven Crawford conducts.

(Bernard Holland)    'M\u00c9D\u00c9E' (Tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) Call it garage opera. The Vertical Player Repertory performs in a small Brooklyn factory-turned-studio but has developed a following for its intense performances of unusual works. Darius Milhaud's ''M\u00e9d\u00e9e,'' the last opera performed in Paris before the Nazi occupation, was so successful in November the company has brought it back for three more performances. At 8, Vertical Player Repertory, 219 Court Street, at Warren Street, Brooklyn Heights, (212) 539-2696, vpropera.org; $25. (Anne Midgette)    'RIGOLETTO' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The strong Spanish baritone Carlos \u00c1lvarez has taken over the title role of Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' in the Met's revival of Otto Schenk's grimly realistic 1989 production. Of special interest is the emerging Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja as the rakish Duke. Tuesday brings the Met debut in that role of a young Polish tenor, Piotr Beczala. Friedrich Haider conducts.

(Schweitzer)    Classical Music    AXIOM (Thursday) New and recent music at Juilliard is no longer a one-party system: last year, the New Juilliard Ensemble was joined by Axiom, a student-run ensemble devoted to 20th-century repertory. This week the group offers an orthodox, appealing concert of several titans: Xenakis, Stockhausen and Boulez, along with Milhaud's jazz ballet ''La Cr\u00e9ation du Monde'' and Frederic Rzewski's ''Moutons de Panurge,'' which starts with the whole ensemble playing a single tune and degenerates like a game of ''Operator.'' Jeffrey Milarsky conducts. At 8 p.m., Studio 309, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free.

High-minded concertgoers tempted to roll their eyes at this event should remember that great divas past like Anna Moffo, Eileen Farrell and Joan Sutherland gave Christmas concerts and made Christmas recordings. Moreover, this program has some musically rich and substantive offerings, including arias from oratorios and cantatas by Handel, Mozart and Bach, songs by Bernstein and Reger, instrumental works by Berlioz and Korngold, and the requisite Christmas carols, not to mention Leroy Anderson's jaunty orchestral piece ''Sleigh Ride,'' which, admit it, everyone loves.

(Kozinn)    ORATORIO SOCIETY OF NEW YORK (Monday) Early-music specialists may slim down their ''Messiahs,'' but the Victorians liked their Handel large and loud, and this venerable amateur chorus keeps that particular flame alive: it has sung ''Messiah'' at Carnegie Hall every year but one since the hall opened in 1891. Kent Tritle, a widely respected organist and choral conductor who is almost as ubiquitous as ''Messiah'' itself on New York stages, took over the group's leadership last year, and will conduct.

(John Rockwell)    Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo (Tuesday through Thursday) The Trocks, as fans call this long-established group, are men in tights -- and tutus and pointe shoes. They can be very funny, but they have also won a reputation for real technical ability and knowledgeable restagings of ballet classics. Highlights of the two programs on offer this year are L\u00e9onide Massine's ''Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Parisienne,'' created for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, and Jerome Robbins's ''Cage,'' a chilling portrait of a female devouring its male prey that should be perfect fodder for this company.

Hijack is a dance duo (Kristin Van Loon and Arwen Wilder) from Minneapolis. The three will perform in ''Stacked, Double Cow,'' which shares the bill with a piece called ''3 Minutes of Pork and Shoving.'' At 8 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org; $20; $10 for members. (Dunning)    JUILLIARD DANCE DIVISION (Tonight through Sunday) The entire division will perform in a program of new works created for them by David Parker, Matthew Neenan, Doug Varone and Aszure Barton. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free. (Dunning)    * MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP (Tonight through Sunday) ''The Hard Nut,'' Mr. Morris's affectionate, off-kilter, 1970s disco-style version of this classic, still set to Tchaikovsky's wonderful score, will return to this area for four performances at the flashy Frank Gehry-designed Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College. Today and tomorrow at 8 p.m., tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Sosnoff Theater in the Fisher Center, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7900, bard.edu/fishercenter; $25 to $65. (Rockwell)    Richard Move/MoveOpolis! (Tuesday through Thursday) Richard Move is best known for channeling Martha Graham, but he also makes more serious dance-theater pieces. This program is a chance to see some of his older works in this vein, as well as ''Toward the Delights of the Exquisite Corpse,'' first shown at the Jacob's Pillow festival this summer. It combines several famous talents -- the visual artist Charles Atlas, the writer Hilton Als, the designer Patricia Fields -- and a bunch of talented dancers. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6500, dtw.org; $25; $15 for artists, members, students and 65+. (Sulcas)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday through Thursday) George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker'' continues until Dec. 30, with nine performances this week alone. It may be hard on its rotating casts of dancers, not to speak of the orchestra and the stagehands, but it's magic for the audience. Sunday afternoon will offer a cast full of younger dancers in their roles for the first time, including Ana Sophia Scheller as the Sugarplum Fairy, Tyler Angle as her Cavalier and Sara Mearns as Dewdrop. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., Tuesday though Thursday at 6 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $110. (Rockwell)    NEW YORK THEATER BALLET (Tomorrow and Sunday) The company's production of ''The Nutcracker,'' choreographed by Keith Michael, is childlike and just an hour long. Tomorrow and Sunday at 11 a.m., 1 p.m. and 3:30 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160, fiaf.org; $30; $25 for children 12 and under. (Dunning)    PARSONS DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) David Parsons brings his high-energy company to the Joyce with two programs performed over two weeks. Highlights include ''The Nascimento Project,'' a new collaboration with the Brazilian musician Milton Nascimento; a revival of ''Ring Around the Rosie,'' last seen in New York more than a decade ago; and ''In the End,'' set to music by the Dave Matthews Band. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $42. (La Rocco)    * SARAH SAVELLI (Tonight) There is only one night to see Ms. Savelli, an Ohio dancer whom the tap diva Jane Goldberg describes as the Barbra Streisand of tap, in a program with guests including Ayodele Casel. Tonight at 7:30, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $25. (Dunning)    STREB SLAM (Tonight through Sunday) Elizabeth Streb and her fearless (we hope) high-flying, hard-crashing performers will present a new show, ''Streb SLAM 8: Extreme Action,'' complete with popcorn and cotton candy. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 3 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., SLAM, 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 352-3101, strebusa.org; $15; $10 for children 12 and under. (Dunning)    'TRIBUTE TO BUTOH' CELESTE HASTINGS AND MOENO WAKAMATSU (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Hastings, whose work blends dance, theater and Butoh, takes four women's dreams of the Amazon jungles as her metaphor in ''Amazonas.'' And Ms. Wakamatsu, who began her professional career in architecture, draws from Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' in this program honoring Butoh on the 100th birthday of Kazuo Ohno, a pioneer of the Japanese dance and theater form. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, CRS Center, 123 Fourth Avenue, at 12th Street, East Village, (212) 677-8621, crsny.org; $15, $10 for students. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    American Folk Art Museum: 'A Deaf Artist in Early America: The Worlds of John Brewster Jr.,' through Jan. 7. Few Early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Mr. Brewster was born deaf in an era before remedial help or a common sign language existed. The case the show makes for Mr. Brewster's physical condition's being reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, produced since the early '90s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Benjamin Genocchio)    * Frick Collection: 'Domenico Tiepolo (1727-1804): A New Testament,' through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattista, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did on subject in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions, arranged in chronological order, goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008. (Grace Glueck)    * Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show reminds us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded here by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over humble brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951), portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Glueck)    * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)    * New-York Historical Society: 'Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery,' through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the '60s, a century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 2 West 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)    Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size, first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)    Whitney Museum of American Art: Kiki Smith: 'A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in ''Kiki Smith'': men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with New York City's Pratt Institute, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory ''The Voyage of Life'' (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age with the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794) by Gilbert Stuart and a luscious still life of a steak and with a cabbage and a carrot by Raphaelle Peale (1816-17) are distinguished entries from the earlier part of the show. Post-World War II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, through Dec. 29. (Glueck)    * JOHN CURRIN The leading bad boy of figurative painting is trying his best to be even more provocative. While he usually paints in series, here he has many options under consideration: pornography, romance, still life, portraits of all kinds. The result is a Currin medley that functions as a kind of installation brought off with a new, somewhat vacuous facility. But the paintings with the most Currinesque goofiness and distortions are still the best. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, through Dec. 22. (Smith)    * 'THE ODYSSEY CONTINUES: MASTERWORKS FROM THE NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART AND FROM PRIVATE NEW ORLEANS COLLECTIONS' Nearly 100 European and American objects covering six centuries, from the New Orleans Museum of Art but also from private lenders, are displayed, ranging from the Venetian-born Lorenzo Lotto whose forceful study of an authoritative figure, ''Portrait of a Bearded Man'' (1530-35) is a highlight, to works by contemporary Americans. A showstopper is a full-length portrait of Marie Antoinette (about 1788), by Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, in which the doomed French queen wears an enormous feathered concoction on the head she was eventually to lose. Sculptures by Rodin, Brancusi, Louise Bourgeois and Louise Nevelson are also part of the treasures on view. The show is a benefit for the New Orleans Museum, whose building -- though not its art -- was battered by Hurricane Katrina. Wildenstein, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through Feb. 9. (Glueck)    Sigmar Polke Painting is man's oldest conjuring trick, and Sigmar Polke is one of its reigning magicians. In this show, new paintings and those from the 1980s, all two-sided and painted with resin, surround a small selection of German Baroque amber (Bernstein is German for amber) jewelry and exquisite tchotchkes. The paintings, made translucent by the resin, nearly defy deciphering. Doodles and abstract splashes of white paint overlay murky washes of glowing resin on both sides of their membranous support, then cast dim shadows on the wall behind, so that the pictures seem suspended in midair, floating. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through Jan. 13. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: SoHo    SLATER BRADLEY: 'THE ABANDONMENTS' This show features six new, contemplative video works by this 31-year old artist. In ''Dark Night of the Soul'' (2005-6), which invokes Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' a figure in a space suit is shown wandering through the exotic scenery of the American Museum of Natural History after hours, to the poetic sound of a flute. The chic, odd camera angles suggest detachment, making the suited figure seem as if he were visiting some strange, remote world. Team Gallery, 83 Grand Street, (212) 279-9219, teamgallery.com, through Dec. 23. (Genocchio)    Galleries: Chelsea    Nathan Carter On the surface, Mr. Carter's work is all about communication, transportation and networks. Big, sprawling sculptures and rough collages recreate the hectic spaghetti of subway lines and the intricate wiring of radio circuitry. The work itself cultivates the look of the amateur, the hobbyist with a ham radio or a backyard workshop and a jigsaw churning out crudely built constructions that look as if they might topple over at any second. At the same time, there's an offhanded vapidity to these references that suggests that they are little more than visual candy for the graphically attuned eye. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335; caseykaplangallery.com, through Dec. 22. (Martha Schwendener)    CHRIS DUNCAN: THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF PINK AND BROWN In his New York debut, this young artist from Oakland, Calif., continues the tradition of men who draw (and glue) by sewing that dates back at least to Alan Shields. His richly colored, semi-abstract works on paper, sometimes sewn together into expansive surfaces, combine geometric structures with scattered drips, accrue into playful but quietly magnetic m\u00e9langes of decorative and mystical, and East and West. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through Dec. 22. (Smith)    * GEORGE ORTMAN: EARLY CONSTRUCTIONS, NEW SCULPTURE In the late 1950s and early '60s, Mr. Ortman combined paint, canvas, plaster and wood into geometric reliefs whose every element was physically discrete. Hailed as exemplary ''specific objects'' by Donald Judd, they took some tips from Jasper Johns's flag and target paintings and gave others to Judd's own work. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6242, through Dec. 23. (Smith)    * TL SOLEIN: INSULATUS In these large, ingeniously-made works on paper, which combine stenciling, bright cutout collage and washy fields of color, Mr. Solein brings his considerable pictorial sense to bear on ''Moby-Dick.'' He borrows from 19th-century illustration and folk art as well as personal memory, creating intimate stage-set-like scenes that can evoke anything from puppet shows to Cubism. The results frequently dazzle and sustain comparison with equally well-sourced but better-known paper wizards, from Donald Baechler to Jockum Nordstrom. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 343-2161, through Dec. 23. (Smith)    Last Chance    LUCIAN FREUD The latest efforts of this British painter conform to a certain Freudian formula. Whether nudes or portraits, most paintings make palpable the claustrophobia of the studio and its harsh light, the dead weight of the people posing and the continuous effort on the painter's part to get things right. As usual there are occasional forays into the outside world and a rather startling self-portrait. ''The Painter Surprised by a Naked Admirer'' shows the artist with a naked female model clinging to his leg as he stands (clothed) poised to work on the very painting we are looking at. Acquavella Galleries, 18 East 79th Street, Manhattan, (212) 734-6300, closes Wednesday. (Smith)    * Richard Hamilton This British artist, born in 1922, is famous for having coined the term Pop Art and for pioneering the aesthetic it defined. Yet he remains little known here. The Dickinson and Roundell show is his first New York career survey since 1973. Given its small scale, it can't help but be a scrappy affair, but it is a piece of history. Dickinson Roundell, 19 East 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 772-8083, closes today. (Cotter)    Paul Lee Queer coding has long been a protective necessity, a cultural binder and a source of pleasure, in art no less than in life. Paul Lee, born in London and in his early 30s, explores it in his fragile sculptures and gently prods its mechanisms without fully exposing or demythologizing them. He gives us the props associated with erotically charged environments -- back rooms, baths, parks -- but also preserves a quality of hiddenness, mystery. Massimo Audiello, 526 West 26th Street, No. 519, Chelsea, (212) 675-9082 , massimoaudiello.com, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    * THE MUSEUM AT F.I.T.: 'LOVE AND WAR: THE WEAPONIZED WOMAN.' From a museum known for elucidating both the erotic and architectural nature of clothing design, this characteristically handsome exhibition examines the influence of garments of love and seduction (lingerie) and of war (armor and military uniforms) on modern and contemporary couturiers. The Museum at F.I.T., Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 217-5800, fitnyc.edu/museum, closes tomorrow. (Smith)    ARIC OBROSEY In these fastidious graphite drawings of woven and knotted threads, all the strands behave according to strict spatial and structural rules, even as they coalesce at the center into mandala-like circles or a wildly knotted disco ball. As they twist and turn they also evoke different cultures, materials and crafts. Care in making encourages care in looking. McKenzie Fine Art Inc., 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5467, closes Wednesday. (Smith)    Jeff Perrone Mr. Perrone was a charter member of Pattern and Decoration, the 1970s movement that officially turned craft into art and elevated visual extravagance to a high place. Compared to the ornamental painting and fabric pieces he is best known for, though, the work in this show is Minimalist plain: 46 small earthenware plaques hung edge-to-edge in a row, each painted flat turquoise blue with modest yellow border designs and hand-printed texts, manyof them bitingly topical. Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, off Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-9156, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    * 'Political Cartoons from Nigeria' Most of the drawn and painted images in this show are single-panel lampoons of past and present social inequity and governmental corruption in Nigeria. Nearly all are by Ghariokwu Lemi, who is famous for having painted 26 superb, incident-filled album covers for the Afrobeat idol and political rebel Fela Kuti. For the occasion, Mr. Ghariokwu also introduces two of his younger colleagues, Comfort Jacobs and Lordwealth Ololade, to New York. Without resembling him in style, they follow his sharp commentarial lead. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, closes Sunday. (Cotter)",

    "lead_paragraph": "'We're not going anywhere,\" my driver, Nelson Okello, whispered to me one morning this past June, the two of us sitting in the front seat of a jeep just after dawn in Queen Elizabeth National Park in southwestern Uganda. We'd originally stopped to observe what appeared to be a lone bull elephant grazing in a patch of tall savanna grasses off to our left. More than one \"rogue\" crossed our path that morning -- a young male elephant that has made an overly strong power play against the dominant male of his herd and been banished, sometimes permanently. This elephant, however, soon proved to be not a rogue but part of a cast of at least 30. The ground vibrations registered just before the emergence of the herd from the surrounding trees and brush. We sat there watching the elephants cross the road before us, seeming, for all their heft, so light on their feet, soundlessly plying the wind-swept savanna grasses like land whales adrift above the floor of an ancient, waterless sea.",

What the senator said in public was milder than what he said in private conversations with foreign-policy gurus like Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser in another Bush administration, or his friend Colin Powell, the secretary of state, who thought he still had a chance to steer the administration on a diplomatic course.

Tony Shalhoub (''Monk'') and Patricia Heaton (''Everybody Loves Raymond'') star (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    Broadway    'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley)    'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first installment of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, this production pulses with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast, led by Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included.) Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80s Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday-season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Anita Gates)    'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)    'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom-night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)    * 'KAOS'  Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (John Rockwell)    'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)    'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)    'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY'  Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER'  As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'TWO TRAINS RUNNING'  Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'STRINGS' Keir Dullea stars in Carole Bugg\u00e9's intelligent but ultimately unsuccessful ''Copenhagen''-inspired drama about three scientists on a train (1:45). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 362-0329. (Gates)    'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'TRUE WEST' This perfectly pleasant new version of Sam Shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    Spectacles    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'CIRCUS OZ' Welcome holiday entertainment (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Van Gelder)    'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'THE ATHEIST' Chris Pine stars in Ronan Noone's generally compelling if not always credible one-man drama about a reporter who casually ruins lives trying to make his reputation with a big story (1:30). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'DARK MATTERS' Elizabeth Marvel plays a rural housewife who may be consorting with extraterrestrials in Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's risible new drama about space critters bent on beginning a new race. Pure hokum (2:00). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444); closing tonight. (Isherwood)    'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. The detailed puppets are hard to read even in this small theater, and not all of the vignettes live up to the show's initial promise. Still, there's a lot to like, starting with the narrator: an alligator named Silas Leech, voiced in the plummy tones of the musician and actor Gavin Friday (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Anne Midgette)    * 'HOME' Almost nothing happens in David Storey's ''Home'' -- except to those lucky enough to be in the audience, who are likely to find themselves profoundly touched by this portrait of four lost souls in a home for the mentally challenged or disturbed. The play hasn't been seen much since it was on Broadway in 1970, but the Actors Company Theater's production makes you wonder why. The performances by the four leads, Simon Jones, Larry Keith, Cynthia Harris and Cynthia Darlow, are simply exquisite. Samuel Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Moli\u00e8re's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'THE TAKING OF MISS JANIE' This revival of Ed Bullins's 1974 allegory about race relations and lament for the lost ideals of the '60s is well acted and politically elegant (1:25). The Henry Street Settlement's Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'THAT TIME OF YEAR' Who would have thought that fruitcake jokes could still be funny? But three singing fruitcakes are among the daffy high points of this original musical revue, which surprises repeatedly by getting laughs from standard-issue seasonal themes both Jewish and Christian. There are clunkers, but you leave feeling that the season's a bit brighter (2:00). Theater at St. Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more ''Braveheart'' than ''Passion of the Christ.'' Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott)    'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future where the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, ''Automatons'' leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)    'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)    'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)    * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)    'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)    'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott)    'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Catsoulis)    'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)    'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis)    * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)    'ERAGON' (PG, 99 minutes) This lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Edward Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. Some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. (Catsoulis)    'FAMILY LAW' (No rating, 102 minutes, in Spanish) Exploratory variations on that old saw ''Like father, like son'' are the thematic heart of this third installment in the Argentine filmmaker Daniel Burman's semiautobiographical trilogy of films about fatherhood. The delicate, bittersweet comedy about the relationship of father-and-son lawyers prepares you for an eruption of high drama that never arrives. (Stephen Holden)    * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)    * '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)    'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)    * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)    'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)    'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)    'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh attempts to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis)    'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)    * 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)    'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)    * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)    * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)    * 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)    'MATTHEW BARNEY: NO RESTRAINT' (No rating, 72 minutes) Alison Chernick's aptly-named documentary takes us aboard a Japanese whaling vessel to witness the filming of the artist Matthew Barney's ''Drawing Restraint 9,'' a love story in which he and his partner Bj\u00f6rk dress up, drink tea and transform into whales. But after a meager 72 minutes, the man who stretched an obsession with testicles into a five-film cycle remains as much of an enigma as ever. (Catsoulis)    'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)    'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham's novel lulls you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)    'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)    'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden)    'THE SECRET LIFE OF WORDS' (No rating, 87 minutes) The heart and soul of this movie is the shattering 10-minute confession of a mysteriously glum, hearing-impaired young woman (Sarah Polley) to a burn victim (Tim Robbins) she is nursing on an oil rig in the Irish Sea. The strongest moments in the film, are those that focus on the central couple. (Holden)    * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)    'TURISTAS' (R, 89 minutes) If stupidity were a crime, the nitwits in this cheap horror flick would be doing time in Attica. (Dargis)    'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)    'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)    * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almod\u00f3var, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)    Film Series    THE COMPLETE JACQUES RIVETTE (Tonight through Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of the innovative French New Wave director continues this weekend with four features. ''Divertimento,'' Mr. Rivette's shortened version of ''La Belle Noiseuse,'' is his own four-hour study of the artistic process. ''The Story of Marie and Julien'' (2003), a romantic mystery starring Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, is his most recent film. ''Secret Defense'' (1998), said to have been inspired by Hitchcock's ''Vertigo,'' stars Sandrine Bonnaire as a scientist whose father died mysteriously. ''The Gang of Four'' (1989) is an adventure about acting students and terrorism. (Through Dec. 31.) 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Anita Gates)    FRANZ WAXMAN: MUSIC FOR THE CINEMA (Tomorrow, Sunday and Wednesday) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Waxman (1906-67), the German composer, with a 21-film retrospective. This weekend's films include ''Sunset Blvd.'' (1950), for which Waxman won his first Oscar; ''The Two Mrs. Carrolls'' (1947), a film noir with Humphrey Bogart as the villain: and ''Mr. Skeffington'' (1944), one of Bette Davis's most memorable melodramas. (Through Jan. 17.) Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates)    THE RETURN OF THOMAS H. INCE (Tonight, Wednesday and Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art's two-week tribute to Ince (1880-1924), the silent-era director, producer, screenwriter and murder victim (aboard William Randolph Hearst's yacht), continues this weekend. The full-length features, to be screened with two shorts, are ''Civilization'' (1916), a war drama in which Jesus (George Fisher) appears as a peace advocate, and ''The Typhoon'' (1914), a drama starring Sessue Hayakawa.

(Gates)    SPANISH CINEMA NOW (Tonight, Sunday and Tuesday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's 15th celebration of Spain's film industry concludes next week. The final weekend's features include Javier Rebollo's ''Lola'' (2006), about a voyeur obsessed with his neighbor, and Edgar Neville's ''Flamenco'' (1952), which stars noted Spanish singers and dancers .

(Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    JAI AGNISH, BEN AND VESPER, LENNY SMITH (Thursday) A night in Brooklyn with three underground songwriters from New Jersey. Mr. Agnish, an accomplice of Sufjan Stevens and a sincere indie-rock Christian, sings guilelessly about his faith (he gives a ''thumbs-up to Jesus'') in songs that join acoustic folk with jerky, silly electronics. The male-female duo Ben and Vesper play droopy, forlorn acoustic ballads, and the gospel-folk singer Lenny Smith might be called the father of the scene: his son is Daniel Smith, leader of the perhaps-sincere, perhaps-mocking Christian band Danielson Famile. At 9 p.m., Pete's Candy Store, 709 Lorimer Street, between Frost and Richardson Streets, Williamsburg, (718) 302-3770, petescandystore.com; free. (Ben Sisario)    BENEVENTO-RUSSO DUO (Wednesday) The keyboardist Marco Benevento and the drummer Joe Russo have had a gradual rise on the jam-band circuit with kinetic meanderings that usually begin in peaceful soul-funk and end up in poundingly insistent climaxes that might as well be punk rock. They play a fifth-anniversary show at the Knitting Factory's tiny downstairs Old Office. At 8 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $25. (Sisario)    BOGMEN (Tonight and tomorrow night) The fence-mending reunion thing worked well for '90s alternative giants like the Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., so what about the littler guys? A decade ago, the Bogmen were one of the biggest local draws in New York, mingling cynical lyrics with propulsive guitar riffs and funk rhythms. It was textbook alt-rock, but the Bogmen struggled to find a national audience and disbanded in 1999. The band's three-night return concludes this weekend. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)    BOUNCING SOULS, WORLD/INFERNO FRIENDSHIP SOCIETy (Thursday) Bouncing Souls, the punk kings of New Jersey, have been going strong for nearly two decades and show no signs of slowing down. Their latest album, ''The Gold Record'' (Epitaph), is, like each one before it, chock-full of adrenalized ''Hey! Hey! Hey!'' shout-alongs. The World/Inferno Friendship Society's ''red-eyed soul'' is a snarky mix of ska, punk and horn-driven retro R&B. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $16. (Sisario)    DAVID BROZA (Sunday) The Israeli songwriter David Broza has recorded songs in Hebrew, English and Spanish, singing earnestly and playing virtuosic guitar that connects the Middle East, flamenco and rock. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $45 and $65. (Jon Pareles)    THOMAS DOLBY, BT (Tomorrow) Thomas Dolby entered pop eternity in the guise of a wild-haired mad scientist, with the 1983 novelty hit ''She Blinded Me With Science.'' This year he returned after a long absence -- in his other life he has been an innovative creator of ring tones -- largely in the same gearhead persona (sans the hair). He shares a bill with BT, the king of garish house music. At 9 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 941-8100, canalroom.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)    ELYSIAN FIELDS (Tonight) Elysian Fields plays languid songs that sound best in a late-night haze, as Jennifer Charles's breathy voice hints at decadence and vulnerability while Oren Bloedow wraps the songs in slinky, deadpan guitar. At 11:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Pareles)    FAB FAUX (Tuesday and Wednesday) There are Beatles tribute acts, and then there are Beatles tribute acts. This one, featuring the bassist Will Lee (of the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' band) and the guitarist Jimmy Vivino (from ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien''), recreates even the most complex studio work of the later Beatles without breaking a sweat. For these two concerts, it will perform the White Album. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $35, sold out Wednesday. (Sisario)    * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight and tomorrow night, Tuesday through Thursday) The strongest incarnation so far of the singer and pianist's annual holiday bash, ''Home for the Holidays,'' a live variety show featuring a six-member band and three backup vocalists, is a perfect showcase for Mr. Feinstein to balance his two sides: a gregarious stand-up entertainer and an intimate crooner dreaming out loud. (Through Dec. 30.) At 8:30, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover and $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden)    FISHBONE (Thursday) Starting in the mid-'80s, this willfully manic Los Angeles group took up George Clinton's challenge that funk bands can play rock as well as anybody, and threw in ska, punk and metal, too, becoming a primary influence on generations of genre-jumbling bands. The current version of Fishbone includes only two original members, the bassist John Norwood Fisher and the top-hatted wild-man singer Angelo Moore, who could not possibly be replaced. With Shootyz Groove, Eclectic Collective and Butterbrain. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)    GOSPEL (Wednesday) As in the gospel of dense, throaty hardcore, ecumenically mingled with the complex prog-metal of the Mars Volta. With Ultra Dolphins, Birthday Boyz and Capsule.

(Sisario)    PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tuesday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive curriculum at his Philadelphia school, teaching youngsters the rock 'n' roll canon, as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. Here his students offer a meat-and-potatoes program of ''classic rock favorites.'' At 7 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $15. (Sisario)    GREY DOES MATTER (Tonight) Before he acquired his current band, Jason Crawford, the polymath who records as Grey Does Matter, used to take a reprogrammed Nintendo Gameboy along with him to help perform his spare, guitar-synthesizer songs of disconnection and boyish obsession (''The wind gets in and burns the skin like a battleground super ninja''). At 9:30, with Tall Hands and Hello Nurse, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $8. (Sisario)    HADAG NAHASH (Sunday) Hip-hop has reached every corner of the planet, including Israel, where the personal inevitably becomes political. ''Nine is the number of times I was too close to a terrorist attack,'' goes one song by this Jerusalem group, one of the most popular in Israel, whose name translates as Snake Fish. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $40 and $55. (Sisario)    HATEBREED (Thursday) Like a restaurant that serves only one dish, Hatebreed, a veteran metalcore band from New Haven, sticks steadfastly to a hyper-aggressive churn of mosh-ready guitar riffs and barked vocals that all seem to have one message: ''Destroy everything/Decimate what threatens me.'' Hey, it's more consistent than Denny's. Also on the bill are Sick of It All, Suffocation, Crowbar, Full Blown Chaos and Subzero. At 7 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $23 in advance, $25 at the door.

Tomorrow features the power-pop LeeVees, whose signature song is ''How Do You Spell Hanukkah?''; Tim Fite, whose songs about ''kicking every can in New York City'' go from clean country to aggressive noise; and the comedian Michael Schowalter. Sunday is Golem, which plays rockish arrangements of Eastern European folk songs, and the D.J. SoCalled. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $12 in advance or $15 at the door tomorrow, $18 in advance or $25 at the door on Sunday. (Sisario)    JEFFREY LEWIS (Tuesday) A veteran of the scruffy antifolk circuit that produced the Moldy Peaches and Regina Spektor, Jeffrey Lewis has a severe case of logorrhea that is not confined to his music. A gifted cartoonist, he combines his meandering monologues about everyday life and earnest bohemianism with storyboard history lessons. (Topics have included Karl Marx and the British postpunk stalwarts the Fall.) With Schwervon and Prewar Yardsale. At 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $8. (Sisario)    MARTINA McBRIDE (Tonight) A hitmaker with a rich, confident voice and that most important pop-country qualification, malleability, Ms. McBride concludes her ''Joy of Christmas'' tour, a multimedia spectacle of standards and carols in which, as one of the show's producers has said, ''one minute you're in a quaint village underneath a Christmas tree, the next minute you're in Bethlehem crossing the desert and the next you have a World War II, Bob Hope/Bing Crosby vibe.'' At 7:30, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $58 to $88. (Sisario)    MOONEY SUZUKI (Tonight) One of the sharpest and loudest garage-rock bands in town -- in sound as well as dress -- the Mooney Suzuki draws on the frantic energy of mid-'60s British mod groups like the Who as well as the bruising blues-rock of Led Zeppelin. With the Pierces. At 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10.

(Sisario)    ED PALERMO BIG BAND (Wednesday) Mr. Palermo's band has devoted itself to the quick-changing music of Frank Zappa: sometimes fiercely complex, sometimes as simple as three chords, almost always delivered with biting humor. On Wednesday it plays with Napoleon Murphy Brock, a singer and saxophonist who played with Zappa in the 1970s and '80s.

(Chinen)    NELS CLINE AND ZEENA PARKINS (Thursday) Fans of the rock band Wilco may recognize Mr. Cline as its lead guitarist; fans of the pop queen Bjork may recall Ms. Parkins as her featured harpist. But these two musicians are attentive improvisers first and foremost, as they will demonstrate first in a mostly acoustic vein (at 8) and then with full amplification (at 10). At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $15.

(Chinen)    BOB DOROUGH (Tomorrow) For the generation that came of age in the 1970s Mr. Dorough is best known as the tunesmith behind the more slyly informative ditties on ''Schoolhouse Rock.'' He'll reach back at least a decade further here, on a set that will include ''Blue X-Mas,'' which he recorded with an unusual Miles Davis group in 1962. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    PAQUITO D'RIVERA AND THE PANAMERICAN JAZZ ENSEMBLE (Tuesday through Thursday) Few musicians have a better claim to pan-Americana than Paquito D'Rivera, the clarinetist and saxophonist who toured extensively with Dizzy Gillespie's United Nation Orchestra. This engagement, at the club that bears Gillespie's name, will feature his more Latin-flavored tunes. (Through Dec. 31.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P.

LONNIE SMITH (Tonight through Sunday) David Newman, the soulful tenor saxophonist long associated with Ray Charles, joins Dr. Lonnie Smith, whose unaccredited honorific has always been justified by his authority on the Hammond organ.

At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P.

(Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    * 'DON CARLO' (Tomorrow) The powerhouse tenor Johan Botha is a hefty man and a stiff actor. But he certainly brings the vocal goods to the title role of Verdi's noble masterpiece ''Don Carlo,'' in John Dexter's production at the Metropolitan Opera. The winning cast includes Patricia Racette as Elisabeth, Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Rodrigo, Olga Borodina as Eboli and the astounding German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape as Philip II. James Levine conducts the score magnificently. The final performance of the season is tomorrow afternoon. At 1 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)    'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Tuesday) A rare sighting: new opera at the Met. Tan Dun's East-West fusion promises all the bells and whistles of a grand opera spectacle. Let's hope for the music, too. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Bernard Holland)    'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. Now on offer is Strauss's merry ''Fledermaus,'' performed with a rotating cast. The quality often varies, but the spirit is usually there. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35, $28 for students and 65+. (Vivien Schweitzer)    * 'I PURITANI' (Wednesday) It's been a while since an opera singer reached such heights that she entered the popular consciousness, but the soprano Anna Netrebko is embarked on a dizzying, meteoric rise. It's a worthy package: she's got the looks, she's got the voice, and when she's onstage, the emotional aloofness that marked her earlier aria albums is replaced with dramatic involvement. This season she is taking on, for the first time onstage, two of the bel canto roles featured on her 2004 album ''Sempre Libera'': Anina in Bellini's ''Sonnambula'' in Vienna and Elvira in the same composer's ''Puritani'' at the Met now. Eric Cutler is her Arturo, John Relyea is Giorgio and Patrick Summers conducts. But Anna is the main attraction: for bel canto fans, long accustomed to a starvation diet from the Met, it should be a wonderful holiday present. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anne Midgette)    'RIGOLETTO' (Tonight) The strong Spanish baritone Carlos Alvarez has taken over the title role in this Metropolitan Opera revival of Otto Schenk's grimly realistic 1989 production, which has its final performance of the season tonight. In his debut appearances at the Met, the young Polish tenor Piotr Beczala sings the rakish Duke of Mantua. The technically exquisite, if expressively timid, soprano Ekaterina Siurina sings Gilda. Friedrich Haider conducts. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $205 tickets remaining. (Tommasini)    'DIE ZAUBERFL\u00d6TE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) This revival of Julie Taymor's production continues tomorrow at the Met, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and convincing Pamina. Scott Bergeson conducts a cast that also includes Christoph Strehl as Tamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno, Cornelia G\u00f6tz as Queen of the Night, Stephen Milling as Sarastro and Robert Lloyd as the speaker. On Thursday, James Levine conducts and the mesmerizing German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape sings Sarastro. Tomorrow at 8:30, Thursday at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $150 to $220 tickets remaining tomorrow; sold out on Thursday. (Schweitzer)    Classical Music    * BARGEMUSIC (Sunday) Steven Beck has become nearly the resident pianist at Bargemusic in the last year and has proved to be an adaptable chamber player. In the Christmas Eve concert at this converted coffee barge, Mr. Beck has the stage to himself for a performance of Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations. At 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $60. (Allan Kozinn)    EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Today, tomorrow and Monday) The ''Medieval Christmas'' program by Frederick Renz and his supremely polished vocal and instrumental ensemble has been a seasonal favorite for years and is available on recordings from the group's Ex Cathedra label. But as new performers join the group, Mr. Renz has continued to refine its sound. The works at hand, drawn from all over medieval Europe, include Latin hymns, Spanish cantigas and pieces by Perotin and Hildegard von Bingen. Tonight at 8, and tomorrow and Monday at 3 and 8, St. James Chapel, Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330, earlymusicny.org; $40; $20 for students. (Kozinn)    'MESSIAH' (Tomorrow) Handel's oratorio is so ubiquitous in these parts at this time of year that it should be no surprise it's made the Guinness World Records book: the Masterwork Chorus, founded in 1955, has given the most complete performances of the work. Quality, not quantity, of course, should be the benchmark, but the experience means that the group, based in New Jersey and conducted by Andrew Megill, can be relied on to turn out a pretty good show. Kiera Duffy, Leah Wool, Tony Boutt\u00e9 and Steven Condy are the vocal soloists. At 3 and 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20 to $100. (Midgette)    NEW YORK STRING ORCHESTRA (Sunday and Thursday) A tradition is a habit that people like. It is also a good description of the New York String Orchestra's Christmas Eve concert at Carnegie Hall. In the first of two evenings (the second is Thursday), young players from the United States and Canada led by Jaime Laredo will offer an all-Mozart program. Mr. Laredo will also play the viola next to Jennifer Koh on violin in the E-flat Sinfonia Concertante. Thursday's concert includes works by Joan Tower and Beethoven, plus the Brahms D minor piano concerto with Leon Fleisher. Sunday at 7 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $18 to $48.

If you want to see how real men pirouette, check out the Trocks, as they perform classics like ''Swan Lake'' and creepy 20th-century ballets like ''The Cage.'' (Through Jan. 7.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 p.m. and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Claudia La Rocco)    FORCES OF NATURE DANCE THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Abdel R. Salaam has a voice of his own, one steeped in traditional modern dance taught him as a young rebel by Joan Miller and in the Afro-Caribbean dance forms he began early on to blend with modern dance. He is also a storyteller. In the program tonight, Mr. Salaam tackles the history and relationship of Christianity and Islam in his sprawling but powerful ''Eclipse: Vision of the Crescent and the Cross.'' The host is Woodie King Jr. Tomorrow's program, which includes ''The Life and Legend of Marie Laveau'' and the signature pieces ''Passion Fruit'' and ''Ancestral Earths,'' has Chuck Davis as host. At 7:30, Harlem Stages/Aaron Davis Hall, 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100, harlemstage.org; $25 to $100. (Jennifer Dunning)    I GIULLARI DI PIAZZA (Tonight) This New York-based Southern Italian folk music and dance company will celebrate the Winter Solstice, the longest night of the year, with a performance of ''Spider Dance,'' an ecstatic exorcism dance in which the performers jump like spiders.

(Tonight and tomorrow) Richard Move has collaborated with the greats, like Mikhail Baryshnikov and Debbie Harry. He has also become the greats, as anyone who has seen his impersonation of Martha Graham can attest. Now he brings his new company to New York; who knows who might show up. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $15 and $25. (La Rocco)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday through Thursday) George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker'' continues until Dec. 30, with nine performances this week alone. It may be hard on its rotating casts of dancers, not to speak of the orchestra and stagehands, but it's magic for the audience. Today, tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m., tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 1 p.m., Tuesday through Thursday at 6 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $110. (Rockwell)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Benjamin Genocchio)    Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum : 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design as a whole, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)    * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951) portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)    * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Glueck)    Queens Museum of Art: 'Queens International 2006: Everything All at Once,' through Jan. 14. The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition's subtitle. The exhibition tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer's quick-cut video ''Everyday,'' which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)    Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with New York City's Pratt Institute, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory ''The Voyage of Life'' (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age with the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794) by Gilbert Stuart is a distinguished entry from the earlier part of the show. Post-WorldWar II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, hirschlandadler.com, through Dec. 29. (Glueck)    * 'THE ODYSSEY CONTINUES: MASTERWORKS FROM THE NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART AND FROM PRIVATE NEW ORLEANS COLLECTIONS' Nearly 100 European and American objects covering six centuries, from the New Orleans Museum of Art but also from private lenders, are displayed. They range from the Venetian-born Lorenzo Lotto, whose forceful study of an authoritative figure, ''Portrait of a Bearded Man'' (1530-35), is a highlight, to works by contemporary Americans. A showstopper is a full-length portrait of Marie Antoinette (about 1788) by Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, in which the doomed French queen wears an enormous feathered concoction on the head she was eventually to lose. Sculptures by Rodin, Brancusi, Louise Bourgeois and Louise Nevelson are also part of the treasures on view. The show is a benefit for the New Orleans Museum, whose building -- though not its art -- was battered by Hurricane Katrina. Wildenstein, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, wildenstein.com, through Feb. 9. (Glueck)    Last Chance    DENNIS BALK: HAShISH Abstract Expressionism meets Graffiti photography. Cy Twombly in Cyberspace. Existential physics. The trajectories of car bombs. These phrases came to mind in front of Dennis Balk's garbled computer-generated drawings on canvas and digitally mixed color photographs. Randomness, violence and information overload are intimated with a handful of portrait-snapshots of Arab men, taken at a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, functioning as still points. Michael Steinberg Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-6232, michaelsteinbergfineart.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    DAVID BATES This Texas painter's 14th New York solo show since 1983 features still lifes that bristle like carpentered objects, bayou swampscapes that make nature seem both beautiful and doomed, and portraits of angry Gulf Coast residents (taken from television) who got the short end of the stick when Hurricane Katrina passed through. The residents bring into the open the smoldering aggression that always keeps Mr. Bates's canvases from sitting quietly on the wall and give it the force of immediate human emotions and events. D. C. Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue near 57th Street, (212) 247-2111; closes today. (Smith)    SLATER BRADLEY: 'THE ABANDONMENTS' This show features six new, contemplative video works. In ''Dark Night of the Soul'' (2005-6), which invokes Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' a figure in a space suit is shown wandering through the exotic scenery of the American Museum of Natural History after hours, to the poetic sound of a flute. The chic, odd camera angles suggest detachment, making the suited figure seem as if he were visiting some strange, remote world. Team Gallery, 83 Grand Street, (212) 279-9219, teamgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)    Nathan Carter On the surface, Mr. Carter's work is all about communication, transportation and networks. Big, sprawling sculptures and rough collages recreate the hectic spaghetti of subway lines and the intricate wiring of radio circuitry. The work itself cultivates the look of the amateur, the hobbyist with a ham radio or a backyard workshop and a jigsaw churning out crudely built constructions that look as if they might topple over at any second. At the same time, there's an offhanded vapidity to these references that suggests they are little more than visual candy for the graphically attuned eye. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com; closes today. (Schwendener)    * JOHN CURRIN The leading bad boy of figurative painting is trying his best to be even more provocative. While he usually paints in series, here he has many options under consideration: pornography, romance, still life, portraits of all kinds. The result is a Currin medley that functions as a kind of installation brought off with a new, somewhat vacuous facility. But the paintings with the most Currinesque goofiness and distortions are still the best. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com; closes today. (Smith)    CHRIS DUNCAN: THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF PINK AND BROWN In his New York debut, this young artist from Oakland, Calif., continues the tradition of men who draw (and glue) by sewing that dates back at least to Alan Shields. His richly colored, semi-abstract works on paper, sometimes sewn together into expansive surfaces, combine geometric structures with scattered drips, accrue into playful but quietly magnetic m\u00e9langes of decorative and mystical, and East and West. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, baileygallery.com; closes today. (Smith)    ALLAN McCOLLUM: THE SHAPES PROJECT Long interested in works that question notions of originality and invention, Mr. McCollum has devised a computer program that could eventually generate a unique abstract motif for everyone in the world. In the meantime, he has produced and framed 7,056 of them (at small scale) and arranged them on a floor-to-ceiling ramp with 98 steps. The effect -- a stadium full of art looking at you, the viewer -- is quite amazing. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * GEORGE ORTMAN: EARLY CONSTRUCTIONS, NEW SCULPTURE In the late 1950s and early '60s, Mr. Ortman combined paint, canvas, plaster and wood into geometric reliefs whose every element was physically discrete. Hailed as exemplary ''specific objects'' by Donald Judd, they took some tips from Jasper Johns's flag and target paintings and gave others to Judd's own work. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6242, mitchellalgus.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    STEPHEN PRINA: THE SECOND SENTENCE OF EVERYTHING I READ IS YOU A quietly delirious multimedia environmental listening lounge that incorporates on painting, sculpture, design, appropriation, music and performance as well as its own shipping crates. The choral music, written and recorded by the artist and incorporating phrases from writing on art and economics, is especially nice. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * TL SOLEIN: INSULATUS In these large, ingeniously made works on paper, which combine stenciling, bright cutout collage and washy fields of color, Mr. Solein brings his considerable pictorial sense to bear on ''Moby-Dick.'' He borrows from 19th-century illustration and folk art as well as personal memory, creating intimate stage-set-like scenes that can evoke anything from puppet shows to Cubism. The results frequently dazzle and sustain comparison with equally well-sourced but better-known paper wizards, from Donald Baechler to Jockum Nordstrom. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-2161, luiserossgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)",

    "snippet": "Could Senator Chuck Hagel win the Republican presidential nomination with the message that his party has lost its way?",
    "lead_paragraph": "With a bluntness that seems habitual \u2014 and more than occasionally strikes fellow Republicans as disloyal \u2014 Senator Chuck Hagel started voicing skepticism about the Bush administration's fixation on Iraq as a place to fight the Global War on Terror more than half a year before the president gave the go-ahead for the assault. What the senator said in public was milder than what he said in private conversations with foreign-policy gurus like Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser in another Bush administration, or his friend Colin Powell, the secretary of state, who thought he still had a chance to steer the administration on a diplomatic course. The Nebraskan wanted to believe Powell but, deep down, felt the White House wasn't going to be diverted from its drive to topple Saddam Hussein. When he rose on the Senate floor that October to explain his vote in favor of the resolution authorizing force \u2014 he'd persuaded himself that his vote might strengthen Powell's hand \u2014 he gave a speech that would have required no editing had he decided to vote against it. What sounded then to the venture's true believers like the scolding of a Cassandra sounds fairly obvious three and a half years later, which is to say that Hagel's words can reasonably be read as prescient: \"How many of us really know and understand Iraq, its country, history, people and role in the Arab world?. . .The American people must be told of the long-term commitment, risk and cost of this undertaking. We should not be seduced by the expectations of dancing in the streets.\" The president had said \"precious little\" about post-Saddam Iraq, which could prove costly, Hagel warned, \"in both American blood and treasure.\"",

Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'BUTLEY'  In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)  'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it(2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)  'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE'  (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  * 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)  'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to a demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'LOSING LOUIE' This second-rate English import depicts the impact of an adulterous liaison on two generations of a family in Pound Ridge. Directed by Jerry Zaks, it's a queasy mixture of coarse comedy and soap opera contrivances (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)  'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)  'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, , are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger)  'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant. (1:35) 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)  'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)  'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)  'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)  *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)  'DURANGO'  In Julia Cho's tender-hearted comedy-drama, a Korean-American family takes to the road with a trunk full of emotional baggage in tow. The narrative mostly runs in familiar grooves, but Ms. Cho has a clear, honest voice, and Chay Yew's production sets it off elegantly (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood)  * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'GREAT EXPECTATIONS' It's hard to improve on Dickens, and the playwright Bathsheba Doran doesn't manage to in the Theatreworks/USA production of her version for families and children. Directed by Will Pomerantz, scenes fly by too fast, and Kathleen Chalfant's Miss Havisham should be frightening rather than eccentric. But as her icy prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Estella, Kristen Bush is near perfect (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)  'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)  'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)  'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)  'MIMI LE DUCK' This musical, seen in 2004 at the New York International Fringe Festival, has morphed into a campy celebration of Eartha Kitt, who, just short of her 80th birthday, milks a minor role gleefully. The main order of business, though, is a middle-aged, middle-American housewife (Annie Golden), who, at the urging of Hemingway's ghost, goes to Paris in search of her true self. Diana Hansen-Young, who wrote the book and lyrics, seems to get most of her not-very-revolutionary ideas from mainstream women's magazines (2:05). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)  'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. o.e. (Gates)  'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)  'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)  'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quip-meisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)  'ROMANIA. KISS ME!' A worthwhile collection of six short plays by young Romanian playwrights who grew up after the fall of Ceausescu's regime (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)  'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Moli\u00e8re's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Gates)  * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER'  As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'JOB'S PASSION' The Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin's blending of two biblical characters, Job and Jesus, sometimes flaunts irreverence for irreverence's sake but finds both dizzying humor and rich meaning in human misery (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109. (Gates)  'WOYZECK' This improbably vivacious London-born production of Buchner's great, prophetic drama of existential emptiness finds the bleak rhythm of life in, of all things, the music of Elvis Presley. While Daniel Kramer's production is more flash than feeling, it features a first-rate, gymnastically stylized performance from Edward Hogg in the title role (2:20). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)  'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart and tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)  'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  Last Chance    'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Gates)  * 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger)  'HOME FRONT' Fletcher McTaggert gives a gut-wrenching performance in Daniel Algie's updated Greek tragedy about the family of a soldier missing in action in Vietnam (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Gates)  'THE INTERNATIONALIST' Anne Washburn's quirky comedy follows in the woozy footsteps of an American businessman abroad as he tries to transact business personal and professional through a sturdy language barrier. Ms. Washburn's oblique style is initially intriguing, ultimately wearisome. (2:00). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)  'LIVE GIRLS' Victoria Stewart's drama sends up the docudrama and an Anna Deavere Smith-like performance artist (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)  'MY DEAH'  ''The mind of a beauty queen is a thing to fear!'' John Epperson, a k a Lypsinka, brings his love of cultural deconstruction and reconstruction to this lovably trashy spoof of a certain exalted Greek tragedy, in which a scorned woman sets about chicken-frying her own children to get even with the no-account man who done her wrong. Nancy Opel and Maxwell Caulfield lead the cast in offering big servings of honey-baked ham (1:30). Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)  'SPEEDMOUSE' Two guys from Australia working in remarkable synchrony create wildly funny slapstick out of sound effects and mime (1:20).

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, who died in June. (A. O. Scott) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)  'BACKSTAGE' (No rating, 112 minutes, in French) Beautifully acted and uncomfortably believable much of the time, this close-up study of the toxic relationship of a narcissistic French pop star and a besotted teenage fan produces a feeling of emotional claustrophobia. (Stephen Holden)  'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)  * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis)  'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)   'COME EARLY MORNING' (R, 97 minutes) Ashley Judd returns to the Southern, working-class milieu of her first screen triumph, ''Ruby in Paradise,'' to deliver her most natural screen performance since that film pushed her toward stardom in 1993. Aside from pungent local color, there's not much surrounding this portrait of an embittered barfly floundering through a succession of one-night stands. (Holden)  'DANCE PARTY, USA' (No rating, 66 minutes) During a Fourth of July weekend in Portland, Oregon, a pair of disaffected 17-year-olds are nudged toward adulthood in a movie that favors natural drift over artificial drama. When Gus (Cole Pensinger) meets the more mature Jessica (Anna Kavan), his journey from crass lady-killer to sensitive boyfriend begins. Directed with extraordinary empathy by Aaron Katz (who also wrote the story), this admittedly slight movie is given heft by a plaintive tone and a camera fascinated by emotional shifts and shadows. (Jeannette Catsoulis)  'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)  'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. ( Dargis)  'ENCOUNTER POINT' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Arabic, Hebrew and English) Ronit Avni's documentary about Israelis and Palestinians working toward reconciliation is assured, thoughtful, clear-eyed and even hopeful. (Anita Gates)  * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories, all taking place mainly in the fictional town of Cody, Colo., examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)  * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)  'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this unassumingly named film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer from a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)  * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)  'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)  'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. Despite its abundant merriment, it is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, except for the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)  'FUR: AN IMAGINARY PORTRAIT OF DIANE ARBUS' (R, 122 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as the famous photographer, and Robert Downey Jr. plays her imaginary furry friend. Steven Shainberg directs from a screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson. (Dargis)  'A GOOD YEAR' (PG-13, 117 minutes) This sun-dappled romantic diversion is a major departure for its director, Ridley Scott, and for its star, Russell Crowe. Mr. Crowe is miscast as a ferocious London bond trader who mellows after inheriting a French vineyard. It's a three-P movie, for pleasant, pretty and predictable. Add a fourth P, for piddling. (Holden)  'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)  'HARSH TIMES' (R, 119 minutes) Christian Bale turns in a spectacular technical performance as a war veteran running amok on the streets of South Central Los Angeles and dragging along his best friend (Freddy Rodriguez) on the road to hell. The losers in the directorial debut of David Ayer (who wrote ''Training Day'') are too repellent for you to waste time feeling sorry for. (Holden)  'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this ferociously engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)  'LET'S GO TO PRISON' (R, 84 minutes) Sure, it has shower scenes, but they're sly and restrained rather than frat house obvious, and all the funnier for it. Dax Shepard is hilariously deadpan as a petty criminal who retaliates against a judge by contriving for the man's son (Will Arnett) to be arrested and then purposely being arrested himself so he can harass the prissy fellow. Chi McBride is perfect as a fellow inmate with a taste for prison lovin' and a voice like Barry White's. (Neil Genzlinger)  'THE SANTA CLAUSE 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE' (G, 98 minutes) Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no. (Dargis)  * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)  'TENACIOUS D IN THE PICK OF DESTINY' (R, 87 minutes) As it wobbles from one episode to the next, the rock 'n' roll comedy starring Jack Black is a garish mess, and some of it feels padded. But it has enough jokes to keep you smiling, and Mr. Black brings to it a fervent affection for the music he spoofs but obviously adores. (Holden)  * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)  'WHO THE $#%& IS JACKSON POLLOCK?' (PG-13, 74 minutes) This entertaining documentary follows the decade-long campaign of Teri Horton, a former truck driver, to prove that an unsigned painting she purchased at a thrift shop for $5 is an authentic Jackson Pollock that could be worth $50 million. Self-serving experts are lined on both sides. (Holden)  * 'THE WILD BLUE YONDER' (No rating, 81 minutes) An artful mixture of carefully culled and originally produced material, Werner Herzog's self-described ''science fiction fantasy'' purports to tell the story of an alien species beset by misfortune. Brad Dourif stars alongside some floating astronauts and a few exquisitely beautiful underwater drifters. (Dargis)    Film Series    ROBERT ALTMAN TRIBUTE (Monday) To honor the filmmaker Robert Altman, who died on Monday at 81, the Film Society of Lincoln Center will screen his last film, ''A Prairie Home Companion'' (2006).

This weekend's features are both westerns. ''Two Rode Together,'' (1961), about white prisoners of the Comanches, stars James Stewart and Richard Widmark. ''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'' (1962) teams Mr. Stewart and John Wayne as a lawyer and a lawman in a town with a violence problem.

(Jon Pareles)   * THE BRAVERY, RADIO 4 (Wednesday) Disco first met punk in Britain in the late '70s, but they have had quite a romance in turn-of-the-21st-century New York. The Bravery emerged about two years ago with a battery of catchy, radio-ready songs and buckets of hair gel; the band has been compared, accurately, to the Strokes, Interpol, New Order, U2 and Franz Ferdinand. Radio 4 was among the first local bands to mine the sound of postpunk British groups like the Gang of Four, which it does studiously but not very imaginatively. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario)  CITIZEN COPE (Tuesday and Wednesday) Clarence Greenwood, a k a Citizen Cope, is the umpteenth singer-songwriter to use hip-hop beats and drawled, rap-sung vocals in search of novelty. With Alice Smith. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $30 in advance, $33 at the door. (Sisario)  DISCO BISCUITS (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Disco Biscuits, from Philadelphia, have worked their way up the jam-band circuit with blithe rock that veers toward funk and jazz; hovers in circling, hypnotic riffs; and sometimes turns into a live version of electronic dance music, replacing computer drumbeats with muscle. At 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $32 in advance, $37 at the door. (Pareles)  \u00a1FORWARD, RUSSIA! (Tuesday) At first glance this young band from Leeds, England, seems awfully severe: sharp, angular artwork modeled on the early Soviet avant-garde, and songs named by number (''Twelve'' was its first hit). Its lyrics aren't exactly Beach Boys material, either (''it's another obsidian bloodbath''). But the jabby guitars and jerky disco-punk beat, derived from groups like Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party, are really nothing but good old rock 'n' roll fun. With Snowden and Meneguar. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $14. (Sisario)  ARLO GUTHRIE (Tomorrow) For his annual post-Thanksgiving Carnegie Hall concert, Mr. Guthrie assembles a few generations of his family, including his son, Abe Guthrie; his daughter Sarah Lee Guthrie and her husband and musical partner, Johnny Irion; and, in recorded form, the voice of the folk patriarch, Woody Guthrie. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35 to $60. (Sisario)  THE HOLD STEADY (Tonight) Like a meeting of AC/DC and the E Street Band fronted by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues, the Hold Steady plays bare-knuckled guitar-rock, while its singer, Craig Finn, free-associates about religion and sex in a boozy snarl. ''I guess I've heard about original sin,'' he sings. ''I heard the dude blamed the chick.'' At 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; sold out. (Sisario)  HOT TUNA (Tomorrow) The guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and the bassist Jack Casady started Hot Tuna as a side project from Jefferson Airplane, but it has now long outlasted the original band. Mr. Kaukonen plays spiky, fingerpicked blues that calmly contemplate death and loss, still harking back to the Rev. Gary Davis, with Mr. Casady's bass shadowing him from below. At 7:30 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $39.50 and $49.50. (Pareles)  ENRIQUE IGLESIAS (Thursday) What he lacks in vocal ability Mr. Iglesias makes up for in romantic sentiment and good looks -- or at least his swooning fans think so.

Rachel Fuller, a British songwriter, will present this informal musical salon with her companion, a little-known guitarist named Pete Townshend. ''In the Attic'' is usually a live Web cast from Mr. Townshend's studio, but recently Ms. Fuller has been doing it on the road while the Who has been on tour. In addition to Mr. Townsend, those scheduled to appear include Martha Wainwright, Sean Lennon and, as M.C., Jimmy Fallon.

(Sisario)  KIKI AND HERB (Sunday and Monday) Fresh from a run on Broadway, the world's most brilliantly perverse cabaret duo -- they've performed a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman'' -- are playing a series of late night shows in the intimate Joe's Pub.

(Sisario)  MERCURY REV, NICOLAI DUNGER (Thursday) It doesn't get any more grand than Mercury Rev, a veteran group from upstate New York that luxuriates in a rich, almost spiritual psychedelia, its every guitar chord and vocal part offered upward like a prayer. (The band gets grandiose, though: on its last tour, a screen carried life-lesson bromides from the likes of ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull.'') Mr. Dunger, a Swedish balladeer with serious Van Morrison envy, makes earnest entreaties for romance and existential relief in a tremulous tenor. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $18.50 in advance, $20 at the door.

At 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)  * MY MORNING JACKET (Thursday) A band that has only gotten better with road wear, My Morning Jacket, from Louisville, Ky., has a calm and entrancing take on Southern rock, with expansive, reverberent guitars and the fragile, soulful wail of Jim James.

(Sisario)  * PEACHES (Tonight) For Peaches, a former Canadian schoolteacher who became the uninhibited queen of electroclash, sex is everything: liberating force, political energy, social equalizer. Rap-singing over sparse, nervy electronic beats, she is a dance-floor dominatrix who demands pleasure, and demands it her way. (''Just one thing I can't compromise/I want to see you work it guy-on-guy.'') With Quintron and Miss Pussycat. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario)  LUCIA PULIDO (Tonight) Ms. Pulido, from Colombia, merges traditional Colombian songs with modern jazz. As Susana Baca has done with Afro-Peruvian songs, Ms. Pulido holds on to the rawness of the original melodies while giving them a sophisticated new context.

(Sisario)  SAM ROBERTS BAND, JASON COLLETT (Monday) Sam Roberts, from Montreal, plays big-chord, big-heart rock anthems in the tradition of the Who, with an earnestness that is as much asset as liability (''my love for you is as deep as a coal mine''). Mr. Collett, a sometime member of the Toronto indie collective Broken Social Scene, draws inspiration from Bob Dylan and the Allman Brothers, among others.

(Sisario)  THE SOUNDS (Tonight) Sweden has a strong heritage of dedicated rockers playing lean, tough music. It's also one of the capitals of bubblegum pop, and those two worlds meet, somewhat jarringly, in the Sounds, who about 80 percent of the time sound like graduates of the Academy of Joan Jett, and the rest of the time play a kind of dance-pop (''Tony the Beat'') clean enough for the prom. With Shiny Toy Guns. At 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)  * TEXAS IS THE REASON (Tomorrow and Sunday) Emo is now old enough to have reunion concerts. Texas Is the Reason, which might be called proto-emo, was formed in New York by two Hare Krishnas in 1994 and dissolved three years later; in between it played an influential kind of therapeutic hardcore punk made of big, chunky guitars and unabashedly vulnerable vocals. The band has gotten back together for what it says are only two shows, which are, of course, sold out. With Ian Love and Jon Sass. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday night at 7, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $75 to $125. (Sisario)  JERRY JEFF WALKER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jerry Jeff Walker wrote the hit ''Mr. Bojangles,'' but around his home-stomping grounds of Texas, he's the easygoing, gruffly avuncular icon of the cosmic cowboy mentality, all about spacing out in the wide-open spaces. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $40 at the door.

The Zs' songs sputter forth in Morse code dots of percussion and saxophone, and Dirty Projectors, led by Dave Longstreth, build elaborate ''glitch operas'' with stark pluckings of guitar and strings, precise harmonies and Mr. Longstreth's warbling, ecstatic tenor, all arranged slightly out of whack. At 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $10.

REZ ABBASI AND SNAKE CHARMER (Tuesday) On his new album, ''Bazaar'' (Zoho), the guitarist Rez Abbasi infuses Southeast Asian motifs with jazz flexibility, rock bombast and the swirl of a Hammond B-3 organ.

(Nate Chinen)  DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Thursday) As the name implies, this big band is calibrated for maximum intrigue, with a style that genuflects to Steve Reich minimalism as well as to orchestral jazz in the descent of Bob Brookmeyer. At 10 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, between Houston and Bleecker Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 614-0505, bowerypoetry.com; cover, $12. (Chinen)  GARY BARTZ/MULGREW MILLER (Monday) Mr. Bartz is an alto saxophonist with a searching approach, and Mr. Miller is a pianist with an earthy style. Post-Coltrane modality will most likely play a part in their duets, along with some well-conceived original tunes. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $25 at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)  GENE BERTONCINI (Wednesday) ''Quiet Now,'' a solo guitar album issued by Ambient Records last year, was a perfect showcase for Mr. Bertoncini's tasteful virtuosity. He is performing not only in that unaccompanied setting but also in a trio (Ike Sturm on bass, Mark Ferber on drums), basing his repertory on standards of the Brazilian and classical canons as well as on American song. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20.

(Chinen)  CURTIS FULLER QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Though not among the first wave of bebop revolutionaries at Minton's Playhouse, the trombonist Curtis Fuller made his sterling reputation shortly thereafter, during the heyday of hard bop. He holds court at the refurbished Minton's this weekend, with a rhythm section. At 10 and 11:30, and 1 a.m., Minton's Playhouse, 208 West 118th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-8346; cover, $10, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)  DAVID GILMORE (Tomorrow) Mr. Gilmore recently issued an album called ''Unified Presence'' (RKM) that showcases both his dazzlingly fluid guitar playing and his rhythmically convoluted compositions. Here he strips his group down to a core of Brad Jones on bass and Rudy Royston on drums. At midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $10, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)  * DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND/NEW ORLEANS JAZZ ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) The clarinetist and saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera, the trumpeter Roy Hargrove and the pianist Cyrus Chestnut are a few of the high-wattage players in the Dizzy Gillespie All-Star Big Band. But the chief attraction of this concert is the premiere of ''Rising Tide,'' a topical commission by the trumpeter Irvin Mayfield, for his New Orleans Jazz Orchestra. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $35 to $58. (Chinen)  TOM HARRELL QUINTET (Tuesday through Thursday) An introverted but assertive trumpeter, Tom Harrell leads a hard-swinging post-bop band with Wayne Escoffery on tenor saxophone, Danny Grissett on piano, Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Johnathan Blake on drums. (Through Dec. 3.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)  STEVE LEHMAN QUINTET (Thursday) The alto saxophonist and composer Steve Lehman pursues an abstract lyricism informed by myriad traditions; he has intuitive peers in the trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson, the vibraphonist Matt Moran, the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12; members, $10. (Chinen)  JOE LOVANO NONET (Tonight through Sunday night) Joe Lovano, a tenor saxophonist with much experience in large ensembles, has intermittently led an excellent bop-flavored nonet for a number of years. This week the group has been playing a Miles Davis-centric repertory drawn from Mr. Lovano's recent Blue Note album, ''Streams of Expression.'' At 9 and 11, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)  * RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA QUARTET (Thursday) ''Codebook'' (Pi), the latest album by the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, investigates the topic of cryptography, not necessarily the most promising theme for an improviser. What lifts the project off the ground is the brazen imaginative exertion of his band, which is appearing with one substitution: Craig Taborn, who ably fills in on piano for Vijay Iyer. At 8 and 10 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $15, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)  * MANHATTAN TRINITY (Tuesday through Thursday) This group deserves the high-minded handle; its members are the soulful pianist Cyrus Chestnut, the erudite bassist George Mraz and the impeccable drummer Lewis Nash. (Through Dec. 3.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org: cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)  PAT MARTINO (Wednesday and Thursday) On ''Remember,'' his latest Blue Note album, Mr. Martino pays homage to one of his guitar heroes, Wes Montgomery. That the gesture pays off is a testament to the untroubled self-assurance of his emulation, and the simple satisfaction of a hard-swinging band. (Through Dec. 2.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)  MEDESKI MARTIN SCOFIELD & WOOD (Tonight and tomorrow night) Eight years ago the guitarist John Scofield began his jam-band crossover career with ''A Go Go'' (Verve), an album that cast Medeski Martin & Wood in an accompanying role. Now Mr. Scofield is touring as an equal partner with the groove trio in support of ''Out Louder'' (Indirecto), an altogether superior new release. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $35. (Chinen)  AARON PARKS (Monday) Mr. Parks, who has turned heads for the past few years as the young pianist in Terence Blanchard's band, was a finalist in this year's Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition. Here, as part of a ''Monk in Motion'' concert series, he leads a quartet with Mike Moreno on guitar, Derrick Hodge on bass and Kendrick Scott on drums. At 7 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, between Greenwich and West Streets, (212) 220-1460, tribecapac.org; $25; students, $15. (Chinen)  HOUSTON PERSON QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Person's latest album, ''You Taught My Heart to Sing'' (Half Note), features his tenor saxophone and Bill Charlap's piano in a program of tender duets. Here, without Mr. Charlap, he returns to form, applying his robust tone to a more rhythmically assertive purpose. At 8:30, 10 and 11:30, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue, at 124th Street, Harlem, (212) 427-0253, lenoxlounge.com; cover, $25, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)  RASHANIM/TALAT (Thursday) The guitarist Jon Madof, the bassist Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz and the percussionist Mathias K\u00fcnzli are Rashanim, a rambunctious trio with a new album, ''Shalosh'' (Tzadik), that supports John Zorn's banner ideal of radical Jewish music. Talat, also celebrating a new album, is a comparably less established ensemble with a promising lineup, including the trumpeter Matt Shulman and the saxophonist Marc Mommaas. At 9 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, near Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934, zebuloncafeconcert.com; no cover. (Chinen)  WALLACE RONEY (Tomorrow) On his recent album ''Mystikal'' (High Note), Mr. Roney advances a species of Afro-futurism inherited and adapted from his trumpet mentor Miles Davis. He explores similar territory in a hard-hitting ensemble with his brother, Antoine Roney, on tenor and soprano saxophone; Robert Irving on piano; Clarence Seay on bass; Val Jeanty on turntables; and Eric Allen on drums. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)  PHAROAH SANDERS (Thursday) Mr. Sanders, an authoritative ambassador of the 1960s avant-garde, has never stopped imbuing his performances with the tone of a spiritual quest; he has worthy acolytes in the pianist William Henderson, the bassist Nat Reeves and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. (Through Dec. 3.) At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)  * MARIA SCHNEIDER JAZZ ORCHESTRA (Tonight through Sunday night) Evocative harmonic coloration and swirling rhythmic undercurrent are two of the chief devices of this large ensemble, led by the composer Maria Schneider. Its ranks include improvisers like the tenor saxophonist Rich Perry and the pianist Frank Kimbrough, but its strength lies in a virtually unsurpassed degree of cohesion. At 7:30 and 9:30, with an additional 11:30 show tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $30. (Chinen)  TANGO MEETS JAZZ FESTIVAL (Thursday) The overlap between American jazz and Argentinean tango provides a premise for this quartet engagement featuring the pianist Pablo Ziegler, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the peerless tango composer Astor Piazzolla. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $30. (Chinen)  * HENRY THREADGILL'S ZOOID (Tonight through Sunday night) The august composer and multi-reedist Henry Threadgill has always nursed a fascination with timbre. These days he indulges it best in this superb ensemble, which finds his flute and alto saxophone in conversation with Liberty Ellman's acoustic guitar, Jose Davila's tuba and trombone, Dana Leong and Rubin Kodheli's cellos, and Elliot Humberto Kavee's drums. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $20; members, $10. (Chinen)  VISION CLUB SERIES (Tomorrow) This off-season outreach of the Vision Festival presents Survival, featuring the saxophonist Henry Warner, the bassist William Parker and the drummer Rashid Bakr (at 7:30); and a separate free-jazz trio led by the saxophonist Charles Gayle (at 9).

(Chinen)  DAVID WEISS AND POINT OF DEPARTURE QUINTET (Tonight and Thursday) An assertive trumpeter and an accomplished arranger, David Weiss leads a post-bop ensemble stocked with prime talent: J. D. Allen on tenor saxophone, Nir Felder on guitar, Luques Curtis on bass, and either Jamire Williams or Justin Brown on drums. Tonight at midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $10, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    Classical  Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tonight and Monday) Bartlett Sher's breezy new production of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia'' conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of a handsome cast. Peter Mattei is a robust and agile Figaro. Diana Damrau is a vocally brilliant and feisty Rosina. Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez could not be more adorable as the amorous Count Almaviva, though his voice sounds pinched and shaky at times. Maurizio Benini conducts a fleet and stylish performance. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)  'LA BOH\u00c8ME' (Tomorrow) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown ''Boh\u00e8me'' returns to the Met for its regular airing. Rolando Villaz\u00f3n, the talented Mexican tenor, is a convincing Rodolfo, although his voice and charisma are somewhat dwarfed by the massive sets. Mr. Villaz\u00f3n's mentor and idol, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, leads the orchestra in a fine, lively performance. Angela Marambio, the Chilean soprano, makes her house debut as a warm-voiced, robust Mimi. Cynthia Lawrence replaces Susannah Glanville as Musetta, and Peter Coleman-Wright is her jealous lover, Marcello. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 and $320 tickets remain. (Vivien Schweitzer)  * 'DON CARLO' (Thursday) James Levine will be in the pit when Verdi's noble masterpiece returns to the Met in John Dexter's production. This is a work Mr. Levine reveres and has conducted magnificently over the years. The Met has assembled what looks to be a top-tier cast, with the powerhouse tenor Johan Botha singing the title role for the first time with the company; Patricia Racette as Elisabeth; Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Rodrigo; Ren\u00e9 Pape as Philip II; Olga Borodina as Eboli; and Samuel Ramey as the Grand Inquisitor. At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175. (Tommasini)  'IDOMENEO' (Wednesday) In place of the dramatic tenor Ben Heppner, the clarion-voiced tenor Kobie van Rensburg, who made an impressive Met debut two years ago in Handel's ''Rodelinda,'' takes over the title role in Mozart's noble opera seria ''Idomeneo,'' which has returned to the company's roster in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's highly stylized and effective 1982 production. There are two other cast changes: the elegant mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena sings Idamante, and the bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties sings the volatile Elettra. Best of all, Dorothea R\u00f6schmann, a superb soprano, returns as Ilia. James Levine conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini)  'RIGOLETTO' (Tonight through Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. This weekend it concludes its run of Verdi's ''Rigoletto.'' The quality often varies, but the spirit is usually there. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer)  'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) To many, she's the last of the Golden Age sopranos: Aprile Millo is taking over one of her signature roles for two performances this week at the Metropolitan Opera. Walter Fraccaro is her Cavaradossi; James Morris seems to have become the Met's perennial Scarpia. The conductor Nicola Luisotti should be a fine match for Ms. Millo: both approach this piece, which can seem merely a hoary war horse, as if it actually mattered. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220 tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Tuesday. (Anne Midgette)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) The programming edges toward contemporary chamber music at this floating concert hall this weekend, before moving on to the standard repertory on Thursday. Tonight at a ''cushion concert'' -- you lounge on cushions rather than on the usual folding chairs (although chairs will be available for older listeners who prefer them) -- a piano trio plays works by Ives, Shostakovich, Chick Corea and Bright Sheng. The trio's pianist, Steven Beck, stays on tomorrow and Sunday to perform the Korngold Piano Quintet with the Manhattan String Quartet, on a program that also includes the Ives Quartet No. 1 and Smetana's ''In My Life.'' On Thursday the violinist Mark Peskanov, the flutist Massimo Mercelli and the violist Maurycy Banaszek play Mozart, Beethoven and C. P. E. Bach.

(Bernard Holland)  RUTH CUNNINGHAM (Thursday) This former member of Anonymous 4 sings a program of her own music, along with Western and Eastern traditional chants, and improvisation, to her own accompaniment on harp, flute, recorder and piano. At 8 p.m., Church of St. Luke in the Fields, 487 Hudson Street, at Grove Street, West Village, (212) 414-9419, ruthcunningham.com; $20. (Kozinn)  CHRISTINA JENNINGS AND PETER KOLKAY (Thursday) A flute and bassoon recital may not sound like a wild event. But two adventurous young musicians, the flutist Christina Jennings and the bassoonist Peter Kolkay, both recent winners of Concert Artists Guild prizes, promise a wild survey of contemporary works. Their program, sponsored by the Guild, was inspired, they report, by James Brown, Andy Warhol and the electric-era Miles Davis. There will be works by David Lang, Paul Moravec and Toru Takemitsu, among others. At 7:30 p.m., Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $21. (Tommasini)  LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA (Monday and Tuesday) Kurt Masur, late of the New York Philharmonic, returns to the city with his close associates at the London Philharmonic for two programs: Liszt, Prokofiev and Brahms on Monday, and Sibelius and Beethoven on Tuesday.

(Holland)  MIR\u00d3 QUARTET (Wednesday) Music by the 18-year-old Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Arriaga from 1824, two years before his death, joins more familiar repertory from Shostakovich and Dvorak. This string quartet is presented by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. At 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $30 to $52. (Holland)  NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) New York's premier orchestra is back from its successful tour of Japan and Korea. And for the homecoming, the music director Lorin Maazel is offering what looks to be a perfunctory program. The pianist Joyce Yang is the soloist in Rachmaninoff's ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini,'' heard last season in a dazzling account with the pianist Gabriela Montero. The program also includes Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Symphony. Hmmm. Didn't Mr. Maazel begin the season with this piece? Thursday's program is somewhat more interesting, with works by Mozart, Hindemith, Roussel and Strauss. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96.

(Through Dec. 1.) At 8 p.m., Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, 841 Barretto Street, near Garrison Avenue, Hunts Point, the Bronx, (718) 842-5223, or bronxacademyofartsanddance.org; $15 and $20.

(Dunning)  * LUIS LARA MALVACIAS (Tuesday through Thursday) Twenty-one short sections make up ''There Is No Such Thing,'' a new work from this talented Venezuelan choreographer, who tends to approach dance as visual art, and whose work can sometimes seem as much installation as performance. (Through Dec. 2.) At 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6500, dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+.

(Dunning)  MOVEMENT RESEARCH AT THE JUDSON CHURCH (Monday) This worthy series aims to provide a laboratory of sorts for choreographers, who can show works in progress without the pressure of having to provide a theater-ready show. It's a hit-or-miss experience, but there is always a possibility that the next undiscovered talent is close at hand. This week the choreographers are Ei Arakawa, Christal Brown and Barbara Mahler. At 8 p.m., Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, movementresearch.org; free.

(Rockwell)  JOHANNES WIELAND (Thursday) Mr. Wieland, known for his stylish, sleekly hard-charging modern-dance choreography, will present ''Progressive Coma,'' a new multimedia piece about the power of images in the media.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)   * BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'TROPICALIA: A REVOLUTION IN BRAZILIAN CULTURE,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sun shower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)  BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don't help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Smith)  BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'RON MUECK,' through Feb. 4. So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are ''Dead Dad,'' a 40-inch rendering of the artist's father as a nude corpse, and ''Man in a Boat,'' in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)  * FRICK COLLECTION: 'DOMENICO TIEPOLO (1727-1804): A NEW TESTAMENT,'  through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattist, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious, but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses, who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)  * FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 28. This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Vel\u00e1zquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. Extending John Berger's famous title, the show might be called ''Ways of Seeing Paintings.'' (See above.) (Smith)  * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,'  through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Glueck)  * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO,' through March 28. This show is spectacularly grand and avoids the familiar piety of the standard masterpiece potpourri by virtue of its eloquent installation in the museum's loopy ramp, still the weirdest-coolest place to look at art and at other people looking at art. It's carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. The show's big point, which has the simple virtue of being self-evident, is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)  METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AMERICANS IN PARIS: 1860-1900,' through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition. The basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met's Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)  THE MET: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Sept. 3, 2007. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck)  MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION' AND 'MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION,' through Jan. 7. Memorializing Mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan's collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display -- letters and musical scores -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. And you can hear excerpts from the manuscripts at two different listening stations in the show. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck)  * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MANET AND THE EXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here: eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded here by a selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)  * MOMA: 'BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 15. This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (See above.) (Smith)  * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Many objects were executed by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, an artists' collaborative that insisted on the handmade component of good design, founded by him with the painter and designer Kolomon Moser. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. And there are photographs of many buildings he designed, including the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, an ultraluxurious home for a millionaire that he considered his best Gesamkunstwerk. Though focused on interiors, the show conveys the basic ideas of a designer immersed in a new vision. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)    NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,' through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a ''hotbed of pro-slavery politics,'' inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. The exhibition brings to a close the Historical Society's multi-year exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400.(Edward Rothstein)  * UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists , including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. Stressing as it does the importance of Ukrainian participation in Modernist art, the show is equally significant in its exposure to Americans of lively talents, largely unknown. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck)   * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Smith)  WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: KIKI SMITH: 'A GATHERING, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in ''Kiki Smith'': men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th St, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)    Galleries: Chelsea    STEVE MUMFORD: 'THE WAR IN IRAQ' Mr. Mumford this exhibition of paintings based on field drawings and sketches done in four trips to Iraq from April 2003 to October 2004, during which he was embedded with United States military units in Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle. His paintings function differently from news photographs and television images -- they are not so mediated, which is one reason, perhaps, that they are so arresting. Some of his paintings combine drawings or photographs of events he witnessed and those that happened nearby, like his epic, cinematic work ''The Battle of Baquba'' (2006). Postmasters Gallery, 459 West 19th Street, through Dec. 2, (212) 727 3323 or www.postmastersart.com. (Benjamin Genocchio)    Last Chance    ERNESTO NETO: 'FROM WHAT WE ARE MADE' Mr. Neto presents his version of the miracle of human conception with a luminous white tent the shape of a rainbow, with a thick foam floor, filled with a pile of small, colorful soft sculptures made in pantyhose fabric and stuffed with buckwheat shells. As the viewer enters the space, the floor shifts and subsides, tossing the sculptures and making it hard to stay upright. It is like traversing a marshmallow or wading through a pool of jelly, though with the phantasmagoria of a funhouse in which we can climb and play. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)  * 'PHANTOM CAPTAIN: ART AND CROWDSOURCING' According to the curator Andrea Grover, ''crowdsourcing'' is a new form of corporate outsourcing that parcels out work to armies of amateurs, and the concept is applied to art in this smart little show of ultracolloaborative projects. Harrell Fletcher and Miranda July posted project assignments on their Web site, www.learningtoloveyoumore.com, and present the work of the respondents. Davy Rothbart edits a magazine made up entirely of found notes, photos and letters contributed by readers; a wall full of such material is here. Allison Wiese compiles and publishes books of recipes by artists. Aaron Koblin and Peter Edmunds ask any and all comers to try their hand at digital drawings. Joseph Beuys's assertion ''Everyone is an artist'' lives on. Apexart, 291 Church Street, near White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)",

Nick Hornby's romantic profile of a music hipster made a successful movie, but will it work as a Broadway musical? (2:00). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'KAOS' In previews; opens on Monday. A new fusion of text, dance and music by Martha Clarke that tells four Pirandello stories set in turn-of-the-20th-century Sicily (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200.    'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' In previews; opens on Thursday.

Eugene ONeill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'TWO SEPTEMBER' In previews; opens on Tuesday. Mac Wellman's new play looks at the prelude to the Vietnam War (1:10).

Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first installment of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, this production pulses with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast, led by Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger)    'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant. (1:35) 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)    'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)    'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)    'DURANGO'  In Julia Cho's tender-hearted comedy-drama, a Korean-American family takes to the road with a trunk full of emotional baggage in tow. The narrative mostly runs in familiar grooves, but Ms. Cho has a clear, honest voice, and Chay Yew's production sets it off elegantly (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood)    'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)    'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)    'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quip-meisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). The SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)    'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Moli\u00e8re's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Gates)    * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER'  As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'THE TIMEKEEPERS' Dan Clancy's play, which throws a Jewish artisan and a gay hustler together in a concentration camp, transcends standard Holocaust psychodrama on the strength of its characterizations and definitive performances by Seth Barrish and Eric Paeper (1:35). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, third floor, (212) 760-2615. (Rob Kendt)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    Off Off Broadway    'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette)    Spectacles    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing Cliff's Notes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40).

(Brantley)    Last Chance    'GREAT EXPECTATIONS' It's hard to improve on Dickens, and the playwright Bathsheba Doran doesn't manage to in the Theatreworks/USA production of her version for families and children. Directed by Will Pomerantz, scenes fly by too fast, and Kathleen Chalfant's Miss Havisham should be frightening rather than eccentric. But as her icy prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Estella, Kristen Bush is near perfect (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    'JOB'S PASSION' The Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin's blending of two biblical characters, Job and Jesus, sometimes flaunts irreverence for irreverence's sake but finds both dizzying humor and rich meaning in human misery (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'MIMI LE DUCK' This musical, seen in 2004 at the New York International Fringe Festival, has morphed into a campy celebration of Eartha Kitt, who, just short of her 80th birthday, milks a minor role gleefully. The main order of business, though, is a middle-aged, middle-American housewife (Annie Golden), who, at the urging of Hemingway's ghost, goes to Paris in search of her true self. Diana Hansen-Young, who wrote the book and lyrics, seems to get most of her not-very-revolutionary ideas from mainstream women's magazines (2:05). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'ROMANIA. KISS ME!' A worthwhile collection of six short plays by young Romanian playwrights who grew up after the fall of Ceausescu's regime (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Jason Zinoman)    'WOYZECK' This improbably vivacious London-born production of Buchner's great, prophetic drama of existential emptiness finds the bleak rhythm of life in, of all things, the music of Elvis Presley. While Daniel Kramer's production is more flash than feeling, it features a first-rate, gymnastically stylized performance from Edward Hogg in the title role (2:20). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779; closing on Sunday .

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, who died in June. (A. O. Scott)    'BACKSTAGE' (No rating, 112 minutes, in French) Beautifully acted and uncomfortably believable much of the time, this close-up study of the toxic relationship of a narcissistic French pop star and a besotted teenage fan produces a feeling of emotional claustrophobia. (Stephen Holden)    'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)    * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis) 'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)    'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)    'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. ( Dargis)    'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the ''smartest and coolest thief alive,'' and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz)    'EATING OUT 2: SLOPPY SECONDS' (No rating, 85 minutes) A Rubik's Cube of shifting sexual orientation and elaborate fantasies, this film follows a young gay man who joins an ''ex-gay'' group in his quest to bed a hot male model. Gathering all the accouterments of soft pornography -- cheesy music, low-rent acting and attractively framed genitals -- into a plot of stunning imbecility, the director, Phillip J. Bartel, is most amusing in his zeal to demonstrate the fruitlessness of right-wing efforts to reorient gay men. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)    * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)    'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer from a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)    * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)    'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)    'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, except for the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)    'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)    'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)    'INVISIBLE' (No rating, 86 minutes) Absent parents cause no end of bother in this moody thriller about an unhappily married couple, a remote cabin and a pair of homicidal crazies. Unfortunately, the director, Adam Watstein, is so invested in his theme of nature as emotional healer that the movie's abrupt transition from lush travelogue to murky violence feels jarring and unearned. As both victims and attackers trade abandonment issues ''Invisible'' suggests that weekend getaways are best approached, if not with a pistol, then at least with a firm grasp of psychobabble. (Catsoulis)    'LET'S GO TO PRISON' (R, 84 minutes) Sure, it has shower scenes, but they're sly and restrained rather than frat house obvious, and all the funnier for it. Dax Shepard is hilariously deadpan as a petty criminal who retaliates against a judge by contriving for the man's son (Will Arnett) to be arrested and then purposely being arrested himself so he can harass the prissy fellow. Chi McBride is perfect as a fellow inmate with a taste for prison lovin' and a voice like Barry White's. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'OUR DAILY BREAD' (No rating, 92 minutes) In this superb documentary the Austrian filmmaker Nikolaus Geyrhalter takes an unblinking, often disturbing look at industrial food production from field to factory. You are what you eat; as it happens, you are also what you dare to watch. (Dargis)    'TENACIOUS D IN THE PICK OF DESTINY' (R, 87 minutes) As it wobbles from one episode to the next, this rock 'n' roll comedy starring Jack Black is a garish mess, and some of it feels padded. But it has enough jokes to keep you smiling, and Mr. Black brings to it a fervent affection for the music he spoofs but obviously adores. (Holden)    * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)    Film Series    JACQUES AUDIARD RETROSPECTIVE (Tuesday) Cin\u00e9ma Tuesdays at the French Institute Alliance Fran\u00e7aise concludes its five-week tribute to Mr. Audiard, a contemporary master of the French thriller, next week.

RYAN ADAMS AND THE CARDINALS (Monday through Wednesday) No one exemplifies the frustrations of alt-country better: so much talent, so much rich history to draw on, so much arrogance. But at least Mr. Adams can deliver the goods. Within his unnecessarily voluminous output -- he released three full-length albums last year and posts new songs to his Web site by the dozen -- is some astonishingly beautiful work.

(Jon Pareles)    BRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE (Sunday) This tuneless headache of a band, modeled on the jangly psychedelic rock of mid-1960s Britain and Los Angeles, was well on its way into obscurity when, two years ago, it was featured in a hit documentary, ''Dig!,'' and a legend was created. Since then the band has toured widely, to audiences who wait for its leader, Anton Newcombe, to lash out in paranoia and kick a fan in the head, as he did in the film. With A Place to Bury Strangers. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)    CONVERGE (Tonight) The guitar riffs of this Boston band come like a spray of machine gun bullets, rapid and unrelenting. The violent rasp of Jacob Bannon, the singer, is just as deadly. With Some Girls, Modern Life Is War, and Blacklisted. At 6, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario)    COPELAND (Sunday) Rueful piano ballads that lead to teary, guitar-drenched, not-quite-cathartic peaks: the songs of this Florida band strongly resemble those of Coldplay and Keane. But while its passion is sincere, Copeland lacks something in the sophistication department. (''I'm in love with my doubt/It's freaking me out.'') With Appleseed Cast, Owen and Acute. At 6:45 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)    GENO DELAFOSE AND FRENCH ROCKIN' BOOGIE (Monday) Geno Delafose, the son of the zydeco accordionist John Delafose, holds on to the traditions of an older generation, pumping waltzes and two-steps and blues on his button accordion, keeping the old bayou flavor. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6; Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $22. (Pareles)    DINOSAUR JR. (Tonight and tomorrow night) One of the greatest and most influential original grunge bands, Dinosaur Jr. joined mopey lyrics to furious guitar sludge, a juxtaposition that prefigured Nirvana. Long estranged, the original lineup of J Mascis on guitar, Lou Barlow on bass and Murph on drums reunited last year, sounding brawny and vigorous; their first album together in 18 years is to be released in the spring. At 9, Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $25. (Sisario)    EL VEZ (Tomorrow) Most Elvis imitators are corny; El Vez is conceptual, merging Presleyana, Mexican-American in-jokes and bad puns to honor and simultaneously twist the Presley legacy.

(Pareles)    JEREMY ENIGK (Thursday) In the 1990s Mr. Enigk was the leader of Sunny Day Real Estate, a Seattle group that did as much as anybody to transform emo from a relatively obscure offshoot of hardcore punk into the populist form of yearning and tantrum-throwing that it is today. This fall he released his first solo album in a decade, ''World Waits'' (Lewis Hollow).

(Pareles)    * THE GRATES (Wednesday) Playful and capricious, this guitar-drums-vocals trio from Brisbane, Australia, led by the frequently airborne Patience Hodgson, reaches back to classic 1990s riot grrrl for its passionate amateurism. But on its ambitious debut album, ''Gravity Won't Get You High'' (Cherrytree/Interscope), the band is unburdened by any legacy, going from hip-swaying sassy to defiant and tough, all with a sense that nothing in life is worth getting too upset about (''No I'll never believe the truth in you/Lies are much more fun''). With the White Rabbits, Tigercity and Cassettes Won't Listen. At 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario)    JOAN JETT AND the blackhearts (Tomorrow) With a never-changing arsenal of meaty riffs, sneering looks and defiant declarations of sexual independence, Joan Jett, now in her late 40s, has been expertly playing the tough-chick-with-a-guitar role longer than many of her younger imitators have been alive.

(Sisario)    JUNIOR BOYS (Thursday) When dance music goes sad: squiggly, awkward beats and droopy keyboards surround the forlorn vocals of this Canadian electronic group, who sing about missed birthdays and phones that don't ring. Also on the bill is a D.J. set by Morgan Geist. At 9 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $15. (Sisario)    KLEZMATICS (Monday) This veteran New York band has had a major influence on the bohemian rediscovery and reinvention of klezmer music, the somewhat jazzy dance music of Eastern European Jews. So it made perfect sense when Nora Guthrie, the daughter and archivist of Woody Guthrie, approached the members a few years ago to write music for lyrics that Guthrie wrote in the 1940s and '50s, when he lived on Coney Island with his second wife, Marjorie Mazia, and her Jewish family. There the Dust Bowl troubadour ate blintzes, lighted the menorah and wrote about Hanukkah in the plainspoken, unmistakably Guthrie style: ''It's honeyky Hanukkah, shaky my hand/My candles are burning all over this land.'' The Klezmatics play these songs, as collected on a new album, ''Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah'' (Jewish Music Group). At 7:30 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, henrystreet.org/arts; $20. (Sisario)    DAVID KRAKAUER'S KLEZMER MADNESS (Tomorrow) Well into an illustrious career as a classical clarinetist, Mr. Krakauer stumbled onto klezmer, and his endless curiosity in adapting it to avant-garde jazz, rock and even Latin styles has brought him a wide new audience. For this concert he collaborates with Fred Wesley, the funk trombonist who was a key member of James Brown's band in the 1960s and '70s; and with SoCalled, a k a Josh Dolgin, a Canadian D.J. and keyboardist whose efforts at infusing hip-hop with Jewish identity -- or perhaps the other way around -- include an album, ''The SoCalled Seder'' (JDub). At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $35. (Sisario)    LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES (Tonight) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades: James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960s boogaloo, '70s Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rap, while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-ons somewhere between charm and smarm. At midnight, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $23. (Pareles)     * LOW (Wednesday) With exquisite care, this band from Duluth, Minn., featuring the husband-and-wife team of Alan Sparhawk on guitar and Mimi Parker on vocals, and Matt Livingston on bass, creates hushed, stark songs on a vast sonic scale.

The concept is high, but the effect of the pungently close harmonies and intense percussive yips is immediate and transcendent. At 7:30 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $30 in advance, $35 at the door.

(Pareles)    OTEP (Monday) These Ozzfest vets play brutal noise-metal but are notable mainly for their leader, Otep Shamaya, a smallish woman with the voice of a roaring bear who wears T-shirts with slogans like ''strong aggressive female'' and sings about sexual abuse. With Ground to Machine. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10. (Sisario)    * 'RED HOT + RIOT LIVE' (Tonight and tomorrow night) A tribute to the inimitable Fela Kuti, the Nigerian master of Afrobeat who, on dozens of albums from the early 1970s until his death from AIDS nine years ago, merged James Brown's funk with the chants and polyrhythms of Africa, and used his music as a populist political cudgel against corrupt authority. The lineup for this concert, a benefit for the African Services Committee, an AIDS and H.I.V. support group, includes Tony Allen, Fela's longtime drummer; the eclectic Nigerian duo Amadou and Mariam; Cheikh Lo, from Senegal; Meshell Ndegeocello, the American bassist and funk ambassador; Dead Prez, a politically minded rap duo from Brooklyn; Keziah Jones, a Nigerian singer-songwriter; and Yerba Buena, a New York Latin band, playing with the jazz-funk keyboardist John Medeski.

(Sisario)    THE STILLS (Tonight and tomorrow night) On its debut album three years ago, this Montreal band took the sulking guitar minimalism of New York groups like Interpol and the Strokes and sublimated it into a shimmering, majestic gloom that recalled the glories of U2 and Echo and the Bunnymen. Its most recent album, ''Without Feathers'' (Vice), perplexingly slows things down to a bored crawl. With Au Revoir Simone and Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin tonight, and Favourite Sons and A Brief Smile tomorrow night.

At 9, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $26.50 in advance, $30 at the door.

(Anthony Tommasini)    'IDOMENEO'  (Tomorrow and Wednesday) In place of the dramatic tenor Ben Heppner, the clarion-voiced tenor Kobie van Rensburg takes over the title role in Mozart's noble opera seria ''Idomeneo,'' which has returned to the company's roster in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's highly stylized and effective 1982 production. There are two other cast changes: the elegant mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena sings Idamante, and the bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties sings the volatile Elettra. Best of all, Dorothea R\u00f6schmann, a superb soprano, returns as Ilia. James Levine conducts. Tomorrow at 1 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220 tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini)    'LORD BYRON'S LOVE LETTER'/'THE VILLAGE SINGER' (Wednesday) The operatization of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' by Andr\u00e9 Previn might have obscured the fact that Tennessee Williams did write a single opera libretto of his own. It's ''Lord Byron's Love Letter,'' set by the composer Raffaello de Banfield, first performed in 1955 and nearly forgotten since. Now the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater continues its cultivation of neglected American opera by bringing the work (which is about, what else, dotty old Southern ladies) back for its New York premiere, on a double bill with Stephen Paulus's ''Village Singer.'' Ari Pelto conducts. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428, msmnyc.edu; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette)    'SUOR ANGELICA'/'GIANNI SCHICCHI' (Tomorrow and Sunday). Two-thirds of Puccini's ''Il Trittico,'' fully staged with orchestra, form a showcase for this year's crop of young artists in the Dicapo Opera's program. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $30. (Midgette)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) Andrea Gruber is a soprano who flings herself into roles; accordingly, she takes on her first Tosca with a certain violence. The character becomes tough yet vulnerable in her reading, yet the vulnerability is perhaps too pronounced in her uneven, patchy singing. She resumes the role for the season's final performance tomorrow, paired with the Cavaradossi of Walter Fraccaro and the Met's perennial Scarpia these days, James Morris. The real news is the conductor Nicola Luisotti in his first Met season, who conducts the piece as if it mattered. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220. (Midgette)    Classical Music    * AMSTERDAM BAROQUE ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Ton Koopman leads his period instrument orchestra and choir, along with a slate of vocal soloists (Lisa Larsson, soprano; Bogna Bartosz, alto; J\u00f6rg D\u00fcrm\u00fcller, tenor; and Klaus Mertens, bass) in a program that includes Magnificat settings by Bach and Buxtehude; Bach's ''Jauchzet, frohlocket, auf preiset die Tage,'' from the ''Christmas Oratorio''; and Corelli's ''Christmas'' Concerto Grosso in G minor. At 8 p.m. (preconcert discussion at 7), Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $89. (Allan Kozinn)    ANONYMOUS 4 (Thursday) This excellent female vocal quartet, whose recordings of medieval music captivated a broad audience, took a break in 2004. Now, with their new CD, ''Gloryland,'' they are continuing the exploration of traditional American folk music they began with ''American Angels.'' On Thursday the women will be joined by Darol Anger, a violinist and mandolinist, and Scott Nygaard, a guitarist, for a program titled ''Long Time Traveling,'' featuring folk songs, shape-note tunes and gospel hymns. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35 in advance, $40 at the door. (Schweitzer)    * BANG ON A CAN ALL-STARS (Tuesday) The freewheeling performing arm of the Bang on a Can new-music empire -- well, small empire, anyway -- offers a program that moves through the increasingly porous boundaries between contemporary classical music, rock and jazz. Included are works by Fred Frith, Martin Bresnick, Julia Wolfe, Conlon Nancarrow, Thurston Moore and Don Byron. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $35. (Kozinn)    STEPHANIE BLYTHE (Thursday) This American mezzo-soprano sings lots of Brahms, some delicious Duparc and a little Falla too. Warren Jones is the pianist. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $48. (Bernard Holland)    CHANTICLEER (Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) The annual Christmas concerts by this San Francisco men's choir have become seasonal highlights. The performances are presented in the Metropolitan Museum's spacious and acoustically vibrant Medieval Sculpture Hall, which is decked out with a huge Christmas tree and a Neopolitan Baroque cr\u00e8che, surroundings that perfectly suit the choir's program of medieval and Renaissance sacred works and carols. At 6:30 and 8:30 p.m., (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $60. (Kozinn)    * ELIOT FISK AND THE MIR\u00d3 QUARTET (Tonight) Mr. Fisk plays guitar with energy, intensity and precision, qualities that the Mir\u00f3 players are likely to match in this program of Spanish music. Included are Arriaga's String Quartet No. 3, Leonardo Balada's Caprichos No. 2 and Boccherini's Quintet No. 4 for guitar and strings, best known for its zesty fandango. Mr. Fisk will also play some solo guitar music. At 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $45. (Kozinn)    JUAN DIEGO FL\u00d3REZ (Tonight) The darling of the Metropolitan Opera these days, this Peruvian tenor is making a Carnegie Hall recital debut that Carnegie Hall, interestingly, is not presenting. Mr. Fl\u00f3rez's voice can be a little bleaty for some tastes, but it's always thoughtfully, carefully produced, with clean coloratura and excellent musicianship. His program includes Mozart, Faur\u00e9, Massenet, Bizet, Rosa Mercedes Ayala de Morales, Donizetti and, of course, Rossini, his signature composer. At 8, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $95. (Midgette)    JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) James DePreist conducts his Juilliard hotshots in Berlioz, Mozart and Ravel.

(Holland)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Philharmonic makes one of its run-outs to Long Island as Leon Fleisher takes on one of Mozart's more enticing early piano concertos (No. 12) and Hindemith's nearly unknown and long forgotten ''Piano Music With Orchestra,'' for left hand alone. Lorin Maazel conducts Roussel's ''Bacchus et Ariane'' Suite No. 2, and accompanies Nancy Gustafson in a scene from Strauss's ''Salome.'' The program repeats tomorrow night at Avery Fisher Hall.

Also on tap is Britten's ''Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra,'' featuring Peter Schickele as narrator. And, as is customary at these concerts, there will be the premiere of a work by a young composer: ''Snow'' by Mark Dancigers. Paul Haas conducts. At 2 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $7 to $55. (Tommasini)    * ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) The conductorless Orpheus Chamber Orchestra kicks off its just announced ''New Brandenburgs'' commissioning project at Carnegie Hall. Six composers have been invited to write orchestra concertos inspired by Bach's ''Brandenburgs.'' Stephen Hartke, the arresting California-based composer, starts things off with ''A Brandenburg Autumn,'' which will receive its premiere on this program, alongside, naturally, three Bach concertos: the ''Brandenburgs'' Nos. 1 and 2, and the Keyboard Concerto in D minor with the pianist Jeremy Denk. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $98. (Tommasini)    PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) This orchestra, which has been pulling itself together after a bad financial patch, appears here with one of its multiple principal conductors, Andrew Davis.

At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $27 to $90. (Holland)    VASSILY PRIMAKOV  (Sunday) The latest alternative space for the classical arts is Arium, in the center of the meatpacking district.

It is drawn from what was heard and felt by the choreographer and his dancers in the ground rumblings emanating from ''the concrete of the South Bronx, the floor of the dance studio, the common ground of social realities'' and other terrains, as Mr. Aviles puts it. At 8 p.m., Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, 841 Barretto Street, near Garrison Avenue, Hunts Point, (718) 842-5223, or bronxacademyofartsanddance.org; $15 and $20.

(Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'RON MUECK,' through Feb. 4. So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are ''Dead Dad,'' a 40-inch rendering of the artist's father as a nude corpse, and ''Man in a Boat,'' in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. 200 Eastern Parkway at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, all produced since the early 1990s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images you merely sense that some horrible violence has occurred, or is about to happen. Though wonderfully lucid and dramatic, the moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. But this popular artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. (See above.) (Benjamin Genocchio)    * Frick Collection: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 28. This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Vel\u00e1zquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Smith)    * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is spectacularly grand and avoids the familiar piety of the standard masterpiece potpourri by virtue of its eloquent installation in the museum's loopy ramp. It's carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The show's big point, which has the simple virtue of being self-evident, is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)    * Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded by a prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Holland Cotter)    * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)    New-York Historical Society: 'New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War,' through Sept. 3. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multi-year exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Edward Rothstein)    P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'John Latham: Time Base and the Universe,' through Jan. 8. This retrospective of John Latham, who died this year at 84, suggests a series of nesting time capsules. It spans nearly 50 years of Mr. Latham's work, which is concerned with time, preservation and decay. Among the more idiosyncratic and interesting pieces are a series of ''Cluster'' sculptures from the early 1990s, orbs of plaster embedded with books and suspended from the ceiling, which suggest cultural detritus preserved in celestial rock or geological magma. ''The N-U Niddrie Heart'' (around 1990), in which ''The Pregnancy Survival Manual'' and ''Vanished Species'' are cut up and fitted into glass armatures, with sand scattered around their bases, explores human production (and reproduction) and the passage of time. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Martha Schwendener)    Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this modest-size, first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense,the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugar-coating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)    * UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists, including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck)    * The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Smith)    Whitney Museum of American Art: Kiki Smith: 'A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in ''Kiki Smith'': men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. (See above.) (Cotter)    Galleries: Chelsea    Fred W. McDarrah: 'Artists and Writers of the 60s and 70s' This show of more than 100 photographs by the former Village Voice photographer and picture editor Fred W. McDarrah opens with a shot of Jack Kerouac and some frolicsome women at a 1958 New Year's Eve bash. It is hastily grabbed and opportunistic, like much of Mr. McDarrah's work, for he operated independently, rarely working on assignment. There are groupings of artists in their studios (Alice Neel, Philip Guston, Jasper Johns); actors (Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro on the set of ''Taxi Driver''); and musicians (Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan). Mr. McDarrah's best-known image may be his 1965 close-up of Bob Dylan, dressed all in black and saluting, his countenance as earnest as that of a battle-hardened marine. It is an enduring symbol of the era's antiwar protests, rebellion and counterculture. Steven Kasher Gallery521 West 23rd Street, (212) 966-3978, stevenkasher.com, through Jan. 5. (Genocchio)    Other Galleries    * 'Political Cartoons from Nigeria' Most of the drawn and painted images here are single-panel lampoons of past and present social inequity and corruption in Nigeria. Nearly all are by Ghariokwu Lemi, famous for his 26 superb, incident-filled album covers for Fela Kuti. For the occasion, the artist introduces two younger colleagues, Comfort Jacobs and Lordwealth Ololade, to New York. Without at all resembling him in style, they follow his sharp commentarial lead. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, through Dec. 17. (Cotter)    Last Chance    STEVE MUMFORD: 'THE WAR IN IRAQ' This exhibition of paintings is based on Mr. Mumford's field drawings and sketches done in four trips to Iraq from April 2003 to October 2004. His paintings function differently from news photographs and television images -- they are not so mediated, which is one reason, perhaps, that they are so arresting. Postmasters Gallery, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727 3323 or www.postmastersart.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)",
