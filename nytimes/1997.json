Mr. Valiotis hoped Alma Realty would be the base for a dramatic rise for his career after a few years of joining partners in making real-estate investments in Manhattan. The leap has come to pass, he says, but the biggest part has occurred not in Manhattan but in the Astoria section of Queens, where he and other Americans of Greek origin or descent continue to make a striking impact on business life and real estate activity even as the ethnic composition of Astoria grows more diverse.",

    "abstract": "'I am now very far from home,'' Aziz wrote in French on a piece of notebook paper on a plane from Dakar, Senegal, to New York. ''The people around me are probably going to a luxury room in a four- or five-star hotel. The question in my head is where am I going? Why am I here? How do I talk to people?'' This letter was the first of more than 60 that Aziz has written since leaving his country -- to his family, to dead or vanished friends, to himself. He knew that, like all the others, it would never be sent.    At the time of his flight, Aziz was 27 and almost finished with a master's in sociology. Aziz is one of his nicknames. His real name, like the name of his West African country, the way he got a visa to America and some other details, cannot be revealed without identifying him to authorities back home and endangering his family. He is a short man with close-cropped hair and a serious demeanor. In 1995 he had been an activist in his university's student movement, which opposed the country's dictatorial government. Every week Aziz would speak about freedom and democracy, usually at a secret meeting on campus or in someone's house.  ",

    "lead_paragraph": "'I am now very far from home,'' Aziz wrote in French on a piece of notebook paper on a plane from Dakar, Senegal, to New York. ''The people around me are probably going to a luxury room in a four- or five-star hotel. The question in my head is where am I going? Why am I here? How do I talk to people?'' This letter was the first of more than 60 that Aziz has written since leaving his country -- to his family, to dead or vanished friends, to himself. He knew that, like all the others, it would never be sent.",

    "lead_paragraph": "For 30 years, one notion has shaped much of modern social thought: that the human species is reproducing itself uncontrollably, and ominously. In his best-selling book of 1968, ''The Population Bomb,'' Paul Ehrlich warned that ''the cancer of population growth must be cut out'' or ''we will breed ourselves into oblivion.'' He appeared on the Johnny Carson show 25 times to sell this idea. Lester Brown's ''29th Day'' compared people to geometrically multiplying waterlilies; on the 30th day, the world would end. A study by the Club of Rome (which it later renounced) described how rapacious humans would soon ''run out of resources.''",
