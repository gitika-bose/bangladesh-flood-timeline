    "abstract": "\"The Federal Government is willing to spend money to wash hogs but not babies,\" Senator Moyni han recently told a subcommittee that is considering the proposal. \"The Federal Government is willing to spend millions of dollars to clone the Mississippi River,\" he went on, questioning a plan to construct a parallel waterway and asking, \"What's wrong with the Mississippi7\"  New York's Governor Carey is supporting the Do -[Daniel Patrick Moynihan] approach, as are the Governors of 'Hawaii, California, Michigan, Virginia, Oregon, Utah, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Its compan ion measure has been introduced in the House of Rep resentatives by Jerome A. Ambro of Long Island and has 15 co-sponsors, mostly New Yorkers, but also in cluding Representative James C. Cleveland, Repub lican of New Hampshire, who is a high-ranking mi nority member of the Public Works and Transporta tion Committee. Since Mr. Ambro ranks high in the Democratic majority of that committee, the Ambro Cleveland combination would seem to enhance the prospects of the bill reaching the House floor if the Senate acted favorably on it.  It also would provide millions in New York to com bat beach erosion on Coney Island and in Connecticut for flood control in the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake River Basins and the Byram River. But Senator Moynihan wants to provide  for such a huge project as New York City's third water tunnel, some thing that probably would not get funds under the present system. The tunnel vas under construction from 1970 until 1975, when the city s fiscal crisis forced a halt in work on it. A total of $350 million has been spent on the tunnel, which is to stretch someday for 12.7 miles from the Hillview Reservoir in Yonkers and supply all five boroughs. It has been dogged by delays and litigation, with six contractors suing the city last year for work that they said they had not been paid for. They sued for $100 million and settled for $18 million. The House of Representatives is to vote this week on the Rivers and Harbors Act, which also contains provision for a $25 million loan for the water tunnel. The city would like to get the loan, of course; it would prefer the approach in the [Domenici]-Moynihan measure.  ",
