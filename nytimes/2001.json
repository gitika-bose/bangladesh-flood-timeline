Juan Forero (NYT)    PERU: TOLEDO LEADS IN POLL  The American-trained economist Alejandro Toledo leads former President Alan Garc&#237;a less than a month before Peru's presidential runoff, according to a poll released Thursday. Mr. Toledo had 56 percent support of respondents in the first poll published since first-round elections on April 8. Mr. Garc&#237;a, whose 1985-90 populist government was overshadowed by corruption charges, guerrilla violence and economic chaos, had 44 percent support. The poll surveyed 1,500 eligible voters this week had a margin of error of 2.6 percentage points.  (Associated Press)",

    "lead_paragraph": "The chaotic retreat by Taliban forces from Kabul, and indeed from most of northern Afghanistan, is a dramatic development that did not seem conceivable even a week ago. But the Northern Alliance's triumph does not, by itself, achieve the basic American objective of defeating the Taliban and destroying the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. That may require more difficult military operations against the Taliban in their southern stronghold, where the United States lacks a combined Afghan force like the Northern Alliance.",

Success is more likely if three basic principles are respected. No government should be imposed from outside. All the country's major ethnic, language and religious groups must be fairly represented. Political and economic reconstruction efforts will require sustained international support.",

But for some, George, who died on Nov. 29 at the age of 58, was an icon of another phenomenon, equally influential in shaping the music of today. I'm referring to the world-music culture, which, starting in the 60's, has become an inescapable aspect of our music life. George was among the first Western musicians to recognize the importance of music traditions millenniums old, which themselves had roots in indigenous music, both popular and classical. Using his considerable influence and popularity, he was one of those few who pushed open the door that, until then, had separated the music of much of the world from the West.",

Two gunmen were killed by Israeli sharpshooters. The raid was clearly calculated to destroy the battered cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians.   A12    Russia-Iran Arms Deal  The Kremlin signed an accord that will let Iran buy jets, missiles and other weapons from Russia. And the atomic energy ministry said it planned to deliver the first of two nuclear reactors to Iran next month. The arms deal comes six years after Moscow stopped such sales to Iran under pressure from the United States, which regards Iran as a leading sponsor of terrorism.   A12",

    "lead_paragraph": "When people talk about clashing civilizations, as so many politicians and academics do now, they can sometimes miss the central issue. The inadequacy of this thesis begins well before we get to the question of whether civilizations must clash. The basic weakness of the theory lies in its program of categorizing people of the world according to a unique, allegedly commanding system of classification. This is problematic because civilizational categories are crude and inconsistent and also because there are other ways of seeing people (linked to politics, language, literature, class, occupation or other affiliations).",

    "lead_paragraph": "Today is Independence Day, and India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, will speak to the nation from the ramparts of Delhi's 17th century Mogul bastion, the Lal Qila. These days the address is delivered from behind a bulletproof screen. With one prime minister lost to Sikh separatists and a former prime minister to Tamil assassins, Indian security is tight. This year the fear is of a Kashmiri plot. So we celebrate a nation besieged, from without and within, by competing nationalisms. We cannot celebrate that paradox, yet we can hardly escape it.",
