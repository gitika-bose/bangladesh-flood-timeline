Bangladesh's fertility rate has declined from seven births per woman in 1975 to fewer than five today -- a considerable achievement in a country that is the world's most densely populated and getting more crowded. Yet population agencies fail to acknowledge the human costs of its aggressive family planning policy.",

Mr. Rushdie, who has been in hiding since being sentenced to death by Iranian religious leaders in 1989, is organizing an international protest on Ms. Nasrin's behalf by other prominent writers.    I am sure you have become tired of being called \"the female Salman Rushdie\" -- what a bizarre and comical creature that would be! -- when all along you thought you were the female Taslima Nasrin. I am sorry my name has been hung around your neck, but please know that there are many people in many countries working to make sure that such sloganizing does not obscure your identity, the unique features of your situation and the importance of fighting to defend you and your rights against those who would cheerfully see you dead.",

The United Nations is faltering in its most crucial post-cold-war task: keeping the peace in a world that has lost its superpower balance. Yet there is no other organization that can do the job.   \"Five years into the post-cold-war era, I think we've all learned that the U.N. is fairly indispensable,\" said Sir David Hannay, Britain's representative. \"At the same time, there is no lack of disasters and problems. So that means that it's the U.N. with all its warts, or it's the law of the jungle.\"",

By 5:35 on a late-summer morning, the temperature has already climbed to 118 degrees -- and is rising as fast as the sun clears the treeless horizon. The Saudi Arabian border is 15 miles to the west; 40 miles to the east is the Persian Gulf. In between, in any direction, dead Iraqi soldiers still lie in the sand.\n\nPerhaps the most important feature of the landscape, however, is what is not visible -- which explains the cautious behavior of Floyd D. (Rocky) Rockwell, a mine field supervisor for a Tampa-based company called CMS, for Conventional Munitions Systems. A sturdy, suntanned man of 46, Rockwell walks slowly across the sand, swinging what looks like a green oversized metal detector ahead of him. Behind him, 22 men, dressed in tan fatigues and working in paired teams, proceed with equal care. They are, after all, in this together. Six days a week, for the past year and a half, Rockwell's squadron has awakened in darkness and driven 50 miles across the desert to this place: a purgatory 100 yards wide and 80 miles long in which, every six feet, deadly clusters of land mines lie hidden. Each morning, as the men arrive on the mine field's outer edge, they don helmets and Kevlar knickers and \"last chance\" vests, then step inside the looping barbed-wire cordon that defines the field's outer edges.",

    "abstract": "  TWO HARLEM HOSPITAL doctors have calculated that the life expectancy of black men in central Harlem is shorter than that of men in Bangladesh. In America, the leading cause of death among black males between the ages of 15 and 24 is homicide. The unemployment rate in America for black males is more than twice that of white males. Even black men with jobs and higher education do not, for the most part, receive the same pay as white men or black women. Among recent college graduates with one to five years on the job, white men earned an average of $12.85 an hour in 1991, black women earned $11.41, white women earned $11.38 and black men $11.26.   The plight of black men in the nation's inner cities has been widely reported. Their experience, however, does not represent that of all black men. But the condition of the black male underclass remains the consuming preoccupation of many Americans, none more so than successful black men in America. The Times Magazine convened six of them, from a variety of fields, at a symposium moderated by Bob Herbert, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times, to talk about it.",
