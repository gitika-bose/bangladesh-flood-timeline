The main road between Dhaka and Sylhet was severed and most townspeople were evacuated from Habiganj.",

A predicted rise in sea level of one foot within the next 30 to 40 years will drive much of the Atlantic and Gulf shoreline inward by a hundred feet and some of it by more than a thousand feet, according to marine geologists. The environmental and economic consequences will be felt much farther inland.   The loss of land to the seas ''will create havoc on our shoreline,'' warned Orrin H. Pilkey, a marine geologist at Duke University. ''Americans have been rushing to the coast, but much of our beachfront development has been contemptuous of natural forces.''   Creeping waters will destroy buildings and roads, wipe out recreational beaches, escalate flood problems many miles inland, pollute community wells with saltwater and drown coastal marshes vital to fish and birds.",

The Senate Environmental Pollution subcommittee last week listened to experts on the ''greenhouse effect,'' the atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, that slows the escape of heat from the earth's surface. Their principal conclusion: its impact will show up sooner than previously expected, perhaps within a decade. The most pessimistic projections envision a rise in global temperatures by as much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the 2030's.   Witnesses spoke of changing climates and ecosystems, rising seas and eroding shorelines. But some, notably those representing the Reagan Administration, cautioned that many unanswered questions remain. Excerpts from the statements of four of the experts follow.",

    "abstract": "  Scientific and technical advances in agriculture have yielded an era in which harvests are now outpacing population growth, resulting in unprecedented food abundance.   From 1960 to 1986, the amount of land on which grain was planted grew by less than 11 percent. Yet in the same period, improvements in crops and planting practices caused grain harvests to more than double. This year, grain production will total roughly 1.66 billion metric tons, according to the Department of Agriculture.   This is not to say that all people are well fed. Africa provides grim reminders that the world has not solved its hunger problem. Inefficient distribution of food and inequities in income leave many without enough to eat. But today hunger is less the result of absolute food shortages than of political situations and policy decisions.",

    "abstract": "  Surprising French Foods About a million square feet of exhibition space in a new industrial park area north of Paris near Charles de Gaulle Airport were devoted last week to the biennial food show for the trade, Le Salon International de l'Alimentation. Exhibitors came from 68 countries, including Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Iceland, Poland and the United States, but not the Soviet Union; two-thirds of the exhibits were French.   French gastronomy appears to be on a collision course with convenience and diet. Although traditional high-butterfat cheeses such as Epoisses were shown, the proliferation of 20 percent butterfat cheeses (where none existed five years ago) was astonishing. One of the best was a tomme maigre de Savoie, available in both 10 and 20 percent fat versions. Virtually every cheese - including bleu d'Auvergne, morbier and St.-Nectaire - now comes precut and prepacked in plastic for supermarket sale.",

''But I knew,'' she said this morning, clutching her children and standing in line for a different plane, one that would help her flee the pile of bloodstained shoes and clothing but not the memory left by Pan Am Flight 73.   ''I knew the end was coming when the lights went dark and I pushed the children down on the floor and covered them with my body,'' she said. The Shooting Begins    It was then, in the 10 o'clock darkness of Friday night, that the soothing man who had said he preferred not to kill people on his birthday began to spray the cabin with machine-gun fire.   Eighteen of the 389 people on the Pan American World Airways jumbo jet would be killed and dozens would be wounded before the ordeal ended with the capture of the four gunmen.",

But the Federal Government's efforts to help those still on the farm have strained relations with some of Washington's closest allies.   To curb the giant trade deficit and meet farmers' concerns in an election year, the United States, the world's leading food producer, is subsidizing exports of wheat, sugar, rice and other commodities. State Department officials say these sales have been managed so as to minimize their impact on world markets. But they have piled new pressures on depressed prices, affecting the economies of Australia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Argentina, the Caribbean Basin countries and the European Community.",

The item has aroused passions since it was first proposed to the Assembly four years ago by Spain's delegation after what was described by those present as a ''well-wined luncheon.''   Iceland's chief delegate at the time, Hordur Helgason, objected to the resolution because it ignored Leif Ericsson's visit to North America. African countries said the resolution glorified colonialism. And Ireland's delegates claimed Irish saints had visited the New World as well.",

He was 78 years old and had been hospitalized since May with severe respiratory problems.   In the course a political career that spanned more than 50 years, Mr. Ram, an ally of Mohandas K. Gandhi in India's fight for independence, held almost every important Cabinet post except the Prime Ministry.   His bids to become prime minister failed in 1977 and 1979, and Mr. Ram and his supporters later blamed high-caste Hindu politicians for blocking his chances, saying that they wanted to prevent an untouchable, from the lowest rung in the country's outlawed but ubiquitous caste system, from becoming India's top leader.",

World's Word is what its editors call a ''sporadical,'' meaning a publication that comes out when they have time, which is when they are not preparing loan papers, or writing scholarly articles on Special Drawing Rights and other esoterica for official publications.   World's Word is not an official publication of the bank or the fund, although it is underwritten by the two institutions, produced by their staff and distributed free. It started three years ago with an initial printing of 1,000. The seventh issue just came off the presses in a run of 6,000. #21 Languages Appear in It In 21 languages from Dutch to Urdu, the magazine has taken the literary outpourings of the global economic fixers and found, in the words of the editor, Jose Pedro Correia da Silva, the ''common language of the human heart and human aspirations.''",

    "abstract": "  Plummeting oil prices suggest that the world may be crossing a threshold, marking the emergence from a dozen painful years in which expensive petroleum skewed economies, geopolitics and national and individual priorities.   If sustained, the drop in prices would affect everything from Sunday driving habits to solar energy projects, from the Soviet Union's economy to immigration from Mexico.   In the last few months alone, crude oil prices have fallen by one-third, to less than $20 for a 42-gallon barrel. Today's prices are roughly half what they were at their peak five years ago, and now some analysts are talking about $15 oil.   ''We went from economic slavery to economic freedom,'' said Pierre Rinfret, who runs an economic consulting firm in New York. ''The decline in the price of oil is one of the most bullish things for the future of the industrial world that I've seen in 35 years of forecasting.''",

The issue is intended to focus greater international attention on the critical social and economic problems in Africa, where many nations are experiencing food shortages and starvation, domestic policy problems, civil disruption, abandoned development projects and economic and natural disasters.   The stamp issue also will be used to raise money to combat these ills. In a Dec. 3, 1984 Declaration on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa, the General Assembly decided that one half of the net revenue earned from the sale of the stamps should be earmarked for implementation of the objectives of the declaration. This money will be applied directly to programs assisting the African peoples.   The stamps will be in denominations of 22 cents, 1.40 Swiss francs and eight Austrian schillings. The designs are taken from original artwork by three Ethiopian artists. All three studied at the School of Fine Arts in Addis Ababa and earned Master of Fine Arts degrees at Howard University in Washington, D.C.",
