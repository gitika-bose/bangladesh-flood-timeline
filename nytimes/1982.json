    "abstract": "  Ann Crittenden reports on international economic affairs for The New York Times.   Imagine Manhattan's Helmsley Palace in the South Bronx. Dacca's first new hotel since the 1960's is a gigantic five-star refuge, a $40 million product of Japanese aid to Bangladesh, set in the middle of one of the worst slums in the world. The Sonargaon is an elegant stage setting for local arts, and a retreat where visiting dignitaries, foreign-aid bureaucrats and journalists can relax over imported wines and Chateaubriand. But permeating the luxurious grounds and drifting over the swimming pool is a faint smell of garbage, of smoke fires and human waste. There is an extra edge of obsequiousness in the service, an unnerving desperation in the rickshaw drivers who crowd around the guests as they step into the capital city's street. No matter how insulated, life at the Sonargaon, like life everywhere in Bangladesh, is more or less uncomfortable.  Ever since winning its independence from Pakistan in a brutal civil war 10 years ago, Bangladesh has been the world's pre-eminent recipient of international aid. The country, no bigger than Illinois but with a population of 90 million - more than the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries and Switzerland combined - has been the beneficiary of a steady, multibillion-dollar dole of food and money from governments and private relief agencies from dozens of nations.  The money accounts for almost 90 percent of Bangladesh's development budget and roughly one-tenth of its annual gross national product.",

    "abstract": "  A student-led movement has called for a new confrontation with the Indian Government in its campaign for the expulsion from Assam, a northeastern state, of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants.   With another round of negotiations failing to make any headway, student leaders set Thursday, Dec. 2, for a 24-hour general strike and also called for the picketing of state government offices here in Gauhati, the capital of Assam. The Assamese here, who are primarily Hindu, are worried that they might be overwhelmed culturally and economically by the influx of immigrants, most of them Moslems from neighboring Bangladesh.   The state government, consisting since last March of administrators named by New Delhi, has reacted to the strike call by arresting two leading members of the All-Assam Student Union. Paramilitary and police forces have been placed on alert, and they have been ordered to make preventive detentions to keep order.",

Two hundred and thirty-seven of these drugs, including some produced by American companies, were immediately banned, apparently in response to similar bans or restrictions in industrialized countries.   The Bangladesh law primarily creates trade barriers intended to stimulate development of the local pharmaceutical industry. But the Ministry of Health also outlawed dangerous drugs like clioquinol, an anti-diarrhea drug that Japan banned years ago following evidence of severe neurological side-effects. American companies subsequently withdrew the drug from the United States market voluntarily, but continued selling it abroad in developing countries.",

He also said that Bangladesh felt nothing but friendship toward the United States and that he thought President Reagan was a strong leader.   General Ershad also confirmed reports that two Soviet Embassy attaches were arrested a week ago while trying, for thus far unexplained reasons, to set fire to nearly 600 reels of movie film. Firm on Rooting Out Corruption   In the 75-minute interview, the soft-spoken general, who on March 24 suspended constitutional government, also made the following points:   - Not even family ties with army officers will save the lives of former Cabinet ministers if they are found guilty by military tribunals of corruption. ''We can hang them,'' General Ershad said.",

Lieut. Gen. Hussain Mohammed Ershad, the army chief of staff, who seized power Wednesday to ''end corruption in public life,'' issued martial-law regulations that said those facing prosecution could include former presidents, former Government ministers and members of the defense and police forces.   There were reports of many arrests, and several former Cabinet members were said to have been imprisoned for trial, but apparently none from the Government that was ousted in the coup.   The deposed President, 75-year-old Abdus Sattar, was said to be at his home here in Dacca, with police guards posted outside.

Grass Zeusifies. His own ''Headbirths'' - part fiction, part travelogue, part screenplay and part political pamphlet - is a wise, sad, witty mess.   (The bad boy of German letters has more structural problems with his short books than with his long ones, as if he felt that such baggy monsters as ''The Tin Drum,'' ''Dog Years'' and ''The Flounder'' needed elaborate skeletons, whereas ''Cat and Mouse'' and ''The Meeting at Telgte,'' so skinny, could be spineless.)",

The idea of a World Food Day originated in 1979, when the F.A.O.  decided to designate a day each year to focus international attention on food-related cncernss. Oct. 16, the date of the founding of that organization in 1945, was selected.",

When she asks if they want fruits, vegetables and meat that stay fresher longer, they say yes.   But when she mentions a preservation technique that promises to make those things possible, they respond, she says, by asking such half-serious questions as ''Does it make you glow in the dark?''   The technique is irradiation - exposing foods to gamma rays or electrons emitted by radioactive materials - and it may soon do to some consumer foods in this country what it has long done to cosmetics, hospital equipment, baby powders and meals astronauts have eaten on the moon and in orbit: kill off substantial amounts of bacteria in food or sterilize it altogether. The food itself does not become radioactive, just as dental and chest X-rays do not make teeth and lungs radioactive. In low doses, irradiation has little effect on taste.",

But such meetings operate under what they call a rule of consensus, meaning unanimity.  Libya said no, and that blocked that exit.",

Both sides said today that the talks went well, although neither the South African Government nor its guerrilla opponents have yet made the critical decision to halt the fighting in the former German colony, which is also known as Namibia.   But in the eyes of some diplomats here, the most remarkable feature of the meetings was that they took place at all, since the United Nations is on record as loathing the South African Government and its apartheid system.   The talks, which began Aug. 2, took place over three days in the map room on the 38th floor of United Nations headquarters.",

    "abstract": "  HOLIDAY   New York has a special facility for taking on the coloration of whatever holidays its people are celebrating. Today is St. Patrick's Day, and the spirit will suffuse the city with more than the parade that has become its local cliche.   In quieter precincts, just a few steps away from the Fifth Avenue parade, an exhibition of vintage photographs depicting Dublin between 1880 and 1914 opens today. It is in the Rotunda, on the third floor, at the entrance of the main reference room of the New York Public Library's main building at 42d Street (930-0717).   The hundred views seen here were taken by Robert French for a picture postcard company and are among the trove of 40,000 glassplate negatives found by Kieran Hickey, a film maker, in Dublin's National Library. The exhibition, courtesy of the Irish Foreign Ministry, has been given the name ''Fadographs of a Yestern Scene,'' taking its words from the vocabulary of that famous Dubliner of that period, James Joyce.",

    "abstract": "  SEASONAL   Today is Ash Wednesday, and the St. Bart's Players, for the first time, will usher it in with a musical at St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue and 51st Street. The musical, ''Godspell,'' is as old as the New Testament in its theme, which is based on the Gospel according to St. Matthew. But it is only middle-aged as theater, having blossomed on Off Broadway in 1971, with an ensuing run of more than 2,100 performances.   The show is by Stephen Schwartz, composer and lyricist, and Michael Tebelak, adapter of the work. In this Lenten production, it is directed by Susan H. Schulman, who last year did a remarkably lively revival of ''Annie Get Your Gun'' at the Equity Library Theater. Phil Hall and Steven Gelfer serve as musical director and choreographer.",

Or is the world headed for an ecological and social disaster, overcrowded, choked on pollution and running out of natural resources?   The debate between optimists and pessimists on these questions has intensified over the last year and a half in the wake of ''The Global 2000 Report to the President,'' a major Carter Administration study that found alarming stresses on the earth's resources and environment. Last week, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, the combatants again took verbal swipes at each other.   It became apparent that much of the gloom-and-doom rhetoric of recent years has been based on questionable data and analyses. But the evidence to support an ''everything is rosy'' view is equally shaky.",

The country is suffering from a problem common to the Caribbean region: lower income from its traditional exports - in this case, sugar, rice and bauxite - and sharply higher prices for petroleum products.   Some international economists believe that Guyana's economic situation has been complicated by problems in production and management. Still another factor, they say, has been the Government's effort to build a system of ''cooperative socialism'' while trading almost entirely within the capitalist world.",

A thousand researchers in more than 60 countries receive The Winged Bean Flyer, a newsletter established to keep scientists abreast of the rapid developments concerning this seeingly miraculous plant. The highly nutritious crop promises to become the soybean of the tropics, where it alone may do more than any combination of foods to counter malnutrition.   ''Few crops have risen so quickly from total obscurity to the winged bean's current level of prominence,'' notes a new report from the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council, which catapulted the winged bean to international fame among food researchers with its first report on the plant in 1975.   Among those who study it, the winged bean is known as ''a supermarket on a stalk'' because it combines the desirable characteristics of the green bean, garden pea, spinach, mushroom, soybean, bean sprout and potato. Save for the stalk, virtually the entire plant is fit for human consumption - from flowers and leaves to tuberous roots and seeds.",

    "abstract": "  The lives of 20,000 children could be saved each day by adoption of four simple, low-cost health measures that have already proved successful in limited trials in several developing countries, the United Nations Children's Fund said in a report yesterday.   Although health problems among the world's poor children remain enormous and may never be eliminated, fund officials said a significant impact could now be made with existing techniques that could be easily used even by illiterate people who have few hygienic amenities.   Dr. Richard Jolly, deputy director for programs, said at a news conference that if the four measures were ''seriously implemented, half the young children who now die each year would live.'' He added, ''Doubts and skepticism need to be overcome, rather than vested interests.''",

This year the figures are even worse.

    "abstract": "  Peter Townsend, a professor of social policy at England's University of Bristol, has become a key figure in discussions of social policy issues. His latest book, ''Poverty in the United Kingdom,'' proposes a ''deprivation index'' that, Mr. Townsend says, provides a scientific method for measuring poverty. The index is based on a dozen criteria that depart from traditional income-based standards and include such categories as taking yearly vacations and eating cooked meals.   The book has stimulated lively controversy, much of it revolving around the question of whether absolute (as opposed to relative) poverty can be measured. In recent months, Mr. Townsend has been consulted by the British Government and has commanded huge audiences for his lectures.   Steven Rattner, a New York Times correspondent in London, asked Mr. Townsend to elaborate on his ideas. Excerpts from their conversation follow.",

A century ago, Henry Morten Stanley, the Welsh-American journalist-turned-explorer-turned-colonialist passed this way and his journeyings took him clean across Africa.   Moshe Itan, Israel's sole representative and charge d'affaires at the recently opened embassy, says he hopes his country will have equal success in re-establishing its presence on a similar scale, now that President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire has broken ranks with the bulk of the Africans and restored diplomatic relations. The blackruled nations severed ties with Israel in 1973 during the war that October between Israel and the Arabs.   Israel's invasion of Lebanon makes it likely, however, that elsewhere in Africa, Israel's diplomats will face as much of a struggle in raising their flag as did the early explorers.",

    "abstract": "  OH WHAT A PARADISE IT SEEMS By John Cheever.  100 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $10. By JOHN LEONARD   AMONG the living, John Cheever's favorite American writer is Saul Bellow. It is as if the apple wanted to be a lemon, and can't. ''Oh What a Paradise It Seems,'' a very short and often lovely novel, might just as easily have been a long letter from Cheever to Bellow on being old. But what would Bellow's Mr. Sammler make of Cheever's Lemuel Sears? They seem not to be visiting the same planet.   Lemuel - from the Hebrew: ''pledged'' or ''consecrated to God'' - forgives the planet in advance: ''Coming from a generation that could, perhaps, be characterized by the vastness of its disposition to complain, he didn't suppose he could scorn men and women who must be looking for something better. That things had been better was the music, the reprise for his days. It had been sung by his elders, by his associates, he had heard it sung in college by Toynbee and Spengler. ... What a bore it had been to live in this self-induced autumnal twilight!''",

By MOLLY IVINS   T exas is a wonderful, funny and astonishing place, but it helps if you do not suffer from excessively refined sensibilities. Texas can be tacky.   Texas, God forbid that anyone should forget it, is a big state. It has everything that anyplace with a claim to civilization has - symphony orchestras, museums, theaters, universities, fern bars, psychiatrists and Chinese restaurants. It also has more provincialism and chauvinism than any American place I know of. By keeping in mind that provincialism is a universal characteristic, the visitor will be able to summon the tolerance required for the Texas strain.",

Guidebooks emerged when grand tours began to go under: those arranged in lordly fashion, using servants and letters of introduction, and those carried out more rumbustiously -Dumas brawling through Andalusia, Borrow busybodying his way around what he chose to call ''Wild Wales.'' They gave place to the institutionalized timidity of the Victorians, who preferred books to introductions, as being more likely to unite a decent moral tone with thorough instruction. Hence Baedeker.   Guidebooks have since sprouted in every direction. The heirs to Baedeker flourish: Blue Guides and Nagel's guides, detailing village by village and mile after mile. They are soberly written and ostensibly without angles or color. Only ostensibly: The notion that the world has an intelligible history that has deposited artifacts that are worth seeing and, furthermore, ought to be seen, is colorful enough these days, if you think about it.",
