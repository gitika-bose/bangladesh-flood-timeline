Illness and death from gastrointestinal disease have begun to increase; supplies of medicine and water purification tablets are scarce. 4 Members of Burma's air force defected to the opposition, hours after a former leader declared a provisional Goverment. Diplomats said the move could signal a weakening of military support for the Goverment. 3 The political upheval in Burma is a genuine democratic revolution, according to experts on Burma, who wonder why it took the Burmese so long to rise up against the authoritarian Government. 3 Washington stood behind its charge that Iraq had used poison gas against the Kurds.
