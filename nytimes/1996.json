    "abstract": "In 25 years of independence, Bangladesh has been plagued by wars, violent coups and military dictatorships. But last month the nation opened a potentially hopeful period by holding the most peaceful election in its history, with nearly three-quarters of eligible voters going to the polls. The winner was the left-of-center Awami League led by Sheik Hasina Wazed, whose father brought the  nation to independence in 1971. If Mrs. Wazed honors her pledge to govern by accommodation and with moderate economic policies, Bangladesh could emerge with  stronger democratic institutions and economic conditions.         The return to power by Mrs. Wazed's party is a poignant moment for Bangladesh. In 1971, when Bangladesh was the eastern portion of Pakistan, the league was led by her father, Sheik Mujibur Rahman. His victory in parliamentary elections that year was rejected by the Pakistani leadership in the western half of the country, prompting an invasion of eastern Pakistan by India that split Pakistan asunder. Sheik Mujib, as he is known, ruled the newly created nation of Bangladesh ruthlessly. In 1975 he and more than a dozen family members and aides were murdered in a coup by army officers, setting off two decades of political turmoil.   ",

Although Earth's rate of spin is gradually slowing because of the tidal drag  of the moon, the slowing would have been measurably greater if it were not for the influence of 88 reservoirs built since the early 1950's, said the scientist, Dr. Benjamin Fong Chao, a geophysicist at the Goddard Space Flight Center, an arm of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Greenbelt, Md. Each  of the reservoirs contains at least 2.4 cubic miles of water weighing 10 billion metric tons. The reservoirs contain the bulk of the world's impounded water.   ",

A1     FINANCING TERRORISM    Some of the major sources of money for terrorists in recent years have not been unfriendly countries, but individuals from countries allied with the United States, posing a thorny diplomatic issue.  A1     SERB BUNKER INSPECTED    NATO officials inspected Bosnian Serb military headquarters, ending a tense confrontation over the issue of whether access would be provided, as required under the Dayton peace accords. A3     EXECUTIVE ABDUCTED IN MEXICO    The president of a Japanese electronics company based in California was abducted in Mexico, and his company decided to negotiate with the kidnappers rather than to seek the help of the authorities. A7     U.S. ON ALERT IN BOSNIA    American peacekeepers in Bosnia were on a high state of alert after  intelligence was received that suggested that a terrorist attack might be planned. A3     SETTLING BANGLADESH SCORES    The new leader of Bangladesh began carrying out her promise to bring to justice the army officers who killed her father and 15 family members in a coup in 1975. Three retired officers were arrested. A4     Sanctions led to gasoline rationing in Burundi. A8     Tokyo Journal: Mourning for a time when people were carefree. A4     National A10-19, B6     G.O.P. GOES AFTER CLINTON    Republicans melded family images with hardball politics at their convention in San Diego, as a line-up of speakers exploited what party leaders believe are President Clinton's vulnerabilities.  A1     CONGRESS'S DIMINISHED PRESENCE    As Speaker Newt Gingrich spoke at the convention, he made no mention of Congress.  A1     QUESTIONING COVERAGE    The day after, network executives wondered whether they had made the right decision in picking up many of the images Republican Party gave them.  A1     Critic's notebook: The convention ''scripted for television.''  A16     Bob Dole used the day to focus on people with disabilities.  A15     Jack Kemp's selection makes a New York a priority.  A19     News Analysis: The ''convention bounce'' is often transitory.  A17     Colin Powell tried to stake out independent ground.  A17     The role of minorities is a top issue at the convention.  A19     GERMAN MILITARY MOVES IN    A new training center in south-central New Mexico is the first military site leased by a foreign government in the United States. To locals, it is simply ''the German base.''  A1     PROBLEM WITH REFORM BALLOTS    Former Governor Richard Lamm, Ross Perot's only rival for the Reform Party nomination has yet to receive a ballot in the mail.  A14     FEARS IN WYOMING    As attention focuses on Jackson, Wyo., as the Clintons spend a vacation there, local residents are more concerned by the one million other tourists expected this year.

I had come to Samashki, or what was left of it, with a small entourage -- a driver, a photographer and a translator -- and a question: What happened to Fred Cuny?         At the time of my conversation with Basayev, in early November, it had been seven months since Cuny, perhaps America's preeminent disaster-relief specialist, and three of his colleagues had disappeared in Chechnya -- and nearly three months since the international efforts to find them had been called off. They were presumed dead. The manhunt, one of the most extraordinary in recent times, had not uncovered where they had been killed or why.   ",
