    "abstract": "  One of the frustrations for planners of the Earth Summit in Rio has been the inability of the world's nations to reach agreement on an idea that seems relatively obvious: that something must be done to keep the earth from slowly getting hotter.   Despite the possibility of floods, famines and droughts within the next 50 or 100 years -- though not all scientists are convinced that global warming is a real threat -- the pre-conference talks have already badly split on the issue. Rich nations want poor ones, with their rapid birth rates, to stop scrambling to get more factories and more cars, even if that means they will stay poorer for a while. Poor nations, by contrast, furious that the rich ones have produced far more pollution per person for the last 200 years, want the industrialized countries to be the ones to drive less, plug in less and put expensive scrubbers on their smokestacks -- and they want them to admit that it's more important for poor nations to get out of poverty than to be ecologically pristine.",

    "abstract": "  INTERNATIONAL A2-12 SALVADOR ACCORD: PEACE AT LAST?   The Salvadoran peace agreement reached at the U.N. will bring an almost immediate truce in the 12-year civil war, and by autumn, disbanding of the five rebel armies, Government and rebel officials said. Some points are unresolved.  A1  The rebel soldiers' joy eclipsed even the Rolling Stones.  A12  UNEASY FRIENDSHIP   News Analysis: Bush's trip to Japan next week has turned into a messy confrontation over trade, and a major political test for Miyazawa. But the Japanese also hope to make the trip at least look like a success for a President they view as a friend.  A1  Bush reassures Australia on economy and security.  A10  THE PRICE IS WRONG   Russian consumers wake up today with the cost of their no-frills existence far higher. Their reactions will determine the success or failure of Yeltsin's fateful political and economic gamble.  A1  Georgia's opposition talked of forming an interim government.  A8  Reunion with Romania? The Moldovans are intrigued.  A9  CROATIA AGREES TO U.N. FORCE   Croatia joined Serbia and the Yugoslav Army in formally accepting a United Nations proposal for the possile deployment of an international peacekeeping force in embattled regions of its territory.  A3  LOOKING ELSEWHERE FOR ARMS   With the cessation of arms aid from Moscow, an era ended in the Afghan war. But now, Muslim rebels fear that Najibullah may find new benefactors in bordering former Soviet republics that fear an Islamic government in Kabul.  A4  MORE HOUSING IN THE TERRITORIES   The Israeli Government has yielded to the demands of far-right parties and Jewish settlers, agreeing that two-thirds of the publicly financed houses and apartments in 1992 will be built in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  A3  Cardinal O'Connor, on Mideast tour, arrives in Lebanon.  A2 Saddam Hussein's oldest son urges public executions.  A3 Phnom Penh Journal: Once again, Buddhism safe and serene.  A4 Assam rebels were said to operate from Bangladesh A5 India seems adrift in a world without its Soviet mentor.  A6 A planned Dresden-Prague highway upsets environmentalists.  A7  NATIONAL A14-18  NEW HAMPSHIRE TAX DEBATE   For years New Hampshire has prided itself on having neither a state income tax nor a state sales tax, but with the state caught in its worse financial straits since the Great Depression, pressure is on for a new source of revenue.  A1  THE JOB MACHINE FALTERS   For decades, banks, fast-food restaurants, hospitals, law firms, retail chains and governments have been the engine that powered the great American job machine. No more. Except for health care, the services are in the throes of a pervasive shake-up.  A1  WHITHER THE STOCK MARKET?   The stock market story of 1991 was one of prices that soared early in the year and again at the end. But the economy barely limped along, and consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in a decade. Such a divergence suggests that something has to give.  D1  RINGSIDE SEAT ON DISASTER   Harold D. Jones has had a front-row seat on the excesses of an era. As the United States trustee in charge of administering all bankruptcy cases in New York, Connecticut and Vermont, he has seen hundreds of thousands of parties file for bankruptcies. And he says he does not expect much letup.  D1  TIED UP IN RHODE ISLAND   A year after the newly elected Governor of Rhode Island ordered the closing of 45 banks and credit unions, many of the people whose accounts were frozen have still not been paid, and state regulators are still ironing out how to do so.  A14  A DIMMER LAS VEGAS STRIP   Las Vegas has long sold itself as a fantasy world largely resistant to recessions. But now hard times have finally hit the Strip.  A14  BALLOON TECHNIQUE FOR ARTERIES   Using a balloon to open clogged arteries works better than medicine alone for relieving chest pain, a new study found.A16  GOOD NEWS FOR NEWBORNS   The use of deep anesthesia to protect newborns from pain during surgery appears to substantially improve their chances of survival.  A16  Flooding worsens in southeast Texas near Houston.  A15  Federal disaster aid declarations rose in 1991.  A15  METROPOLITAN Digest, B1 THE SPRAWLING APPLE?   Without quite noticing it, the New York area has transformed itself into a sprawling region that more than ever resembles Los Angeles, where a movie at the multiplex has become as much a day out as a journey to Lincoln Center or Herald Square.  A1  NO HOME AND NO SCHOOL   It may seem as if the homeless are everywhere in New York City these days, but the one place they often are not is in school. A decade after large numbers of families began living in shelters and hotels throughout the city, little has been done to make it easy for the homeless to keep their children in school, advocates for schools and the homeless say.

The Bush Administration should have done this months ago. Distribution has been the main problem in getting food aid to the interior and to the capital, Mogadishu, the scene of savage street warfare. Human rights groups charge that the U.S. was dragging its feet, fearful of an election-year quagmire in the Horn of Africa; the Administration says it has long been ready to move but was waiting for the U.N. to take the lead.",

Charts, polls and surveys all indicate that no one cooks anymore, yet someone out there is buying cookbooks -- a lot of someones, by the look of it -- and if the current offerings are anything to go by, the cooks are fearless in the kitchen and increasingly interested in alternatives to the standard meat-and-two-vegetables American dinner plate.",

In theory, the management agency is responsible for coordinating the Government's response to domestic emergencies. In reality, it has little practical authority to carry out Presidential priorities -- particularly when it tries to coordinate with much larger entities, like the Pentagon or the Department of Transportation. Moreover, the agency has become a dumping ground for mediocre political appointees with little background or interest in disaster relief. In fact, its ratio of political appointees to career professionals is the highest in the Government.",

    "abstract": "  A Big Splash   Here's how long it took the tribute to Bob Dylan at Madison Square Garden that's scheduled for Friday night, featuring everybody from George Harrison, Eric Clapton and the rock poet himself to members of the group Pearl Jam, to sell out: 70 minutes. That's for 18,200 seats, and each person was allowed to buy only one pair of tickets at a time. The tickets started at $80 for the public and at $150 for industry types. What recession?   \"We were pleasantly surprised about the response,\" said Kevin Wall, the chairman of Radiovision, the company producing the show. \"The demographic is the same as has been buying back-catalogue records for years and saving the music industry. It's getting people out of the suburbs into cars to go to a concert in New York, which is hard to do. The demand is much greater than the tickets we had, and I think we could have done five nights. To have George and Dylan and Eric, it's magical. I think when value is put out here in the market place, people will buy, even if we're deep in a recession.\"",

The essence of Bhutan, the last Himalayan Buddhist kingdom, was all around.   Behind us, obscured by a thicket of brilliant April rhododendrons -- red, lavender and yellow plants the size of trees -- was the retreat where Gantey's Buddhist abbot had retired for a long meditation. In front of us, on the valley floor where black-necked Siberian cranes had wintered, were half-timbered farmhouses, clusters of bamboo poles with flapping prayer flags and the emerald fields of spring.",

    "abstract": "  In the early 70's, a bizarre, inexplicable illness was sabotaging the academic career of Cynthia Carey. Then a young biologist, she was writing a dissertation on the physiology of coldblooded animals. Her creature of choice was Bufo boreas, named for the ancient Greek god of the north wind, an extravagant tag for a warty, blotchy, four-inch toad. It is more commonly and appropriately known as the western toad, its range encompassing the mountains of western North America. Twice a week, Carey went into the vast, pristine wilderness of Colorado to do her research. At times the toads were so plentiful she had to be careful when driving away not to crush them under her wheels.   In 1973, two years into her work, the illness struck. When she went into the field, Carey started coming upon an alarming sight: dozens of dying toads, toads barely able to move because their legs were puffy and red. She took one back to a veterinarian, who told her the toads were dying from an opportunistic infection because their immune systems had collapsed. But why?   Carey was in no position to unravel the mystery -- she had a dissertation to do. But by 1979, there were no western toads, healthy or sick, to be found at any of the previous sites, or anywhere else in Colorado she looked. \"These are wilderness areas,\" she says today from her laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where she is an associate professor of biology. \"There was no development, no housing, no habitat destruction. I was sad and mystified.\"",
