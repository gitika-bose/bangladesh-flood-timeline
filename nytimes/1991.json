But in a country the size of Wisconsin with 118 million residents, the poor have no choice but to put up huts and try to make a living fishing the Bay of Bengal or planting rice in the mud.   On the night of April 29, an awesome cyclone struck. Winds tore apart rickety homes, waves swept away whole families, and those they spared lost cows, boats, crops, sometimes everything. By an official estimate that no one can vouch for the accuracy of, 139,000 died.   Slowly, people have been rebuilding. The government is helping. So, independently, are opposition parties seeking votes. About 7,500 American military personnel worked for two weeks. In these pictures, taken on assignment from the CARE and Oxfam relief agencies by photographers for Drik, a picture library for third world photographers, both the hopelessness and the hope can be seen. The little girl at top was adopted by a distant uncle. The crops are returning. For better or worse, the chars are a homeland again.",

    "abstract": "  Three-year-old Badshar survived when a cyclone sent a 20-foot storm tide into this village last week, but it is too early to say whether that makes him lucky. Lacking shelter, food and clean water, he is already ill, and it may be that he withstood the destruction only to face a slow death from hunger and diarrhea.    Nothing but a mud flat is left of Digipura, a village that was once home to 780 people just a mile from the sea on the southeastern coast of Bangladesh. The Government says 125,000 people were killed when the cyclone struck on the morning of April 30, and at least 240 of them were villagers here. Adequate relief has still not arrived to help Badshar and the tens of thousands like him.     A three-day journey along the length of the coast, by car, by boat and on foot, found that for many survivors like Badshar, the ordeal is far from over. The initial horror of the storm has been replaced by the prolonged horror of hunger, homelessness and sickness.  Hunger and Its Pangs     Emergency food and other aid has reached most areas, but it is a tiny fraction of what is needed. Communications are almost non-existent, bridges have been swept away and roads have been washed out. Relief workers fear that people in remote villages and on flooded offshore islands may be quietly starving because no one knows of their plight. Even if no one is starving, nearly everyone is hungry.    Some food has been delivered to Digipura, reachable only by hiking several miles along a muddy path and inching across some bamboo poles that have been put up to replace destroyed bridges. But it is only enough to feed people one meal of rice a day.     The cyclone survivors live in makeshift shelters of tin and plastic scavenged from the debris, and they have little protection from the driving rain that has fallen in the last few days. Some victims fear that conditions will get worse before they get better.    \"It is getting worse each day,\" said Mirahmed, a 70-year-old villager who was surveying the remnants of his home in the Banskhali region, south of the port of Chittagong. \"We need food, medicine and water. Until we get them, life will get worse.\"    To travel along the coast is to view a kaleidoscope of misery. Refugees sleep in emergency shelters, in schools, in bits of plastic sheeting, even on the roads. They are invariably hungry, and they hold out their hands for food or money to anyone they see.    A few bodies remain unburied, along with many bloated corpses of cattle and other animals. In the village of Khankhanabad, hard by a broken bridge of mud that was once an embankment keeping the sea off the farmland, survivors poked around their land today looking for anything salvageable, bypassing the body of a teen-age boy wedged in the sand. The people of Khankhanabad have their own problems: of 450 villagers, only 60 survived.  Rice Prices Climbing     The cyclone leveled virtually everything, but the poorest and most miserable, those living in thatched huts on strips of lands no surer that sandbars, overwhelmingly suffered the most. Their huts were washed away, often with their loved ones inside.    But the concrete homes of wealthier people generally suffered little damage, at least if they were a mile or two from shore. Some well-stocked merchants have even profited: the price of rice has risen, and the price of building materials has soared. Nails cost 10 times more than they did two weeks ago.    It will take years for the coastal region to regain economic vibrancy, and even then only with large sums of foreign aid. Most people have lost not only family members, homes and possessions, but livelihoods as well.   \"I used to work on fishing boats,\" said Badurrahman, a 35-year-old who like many Bangladeshis has a single name. \"But now most of the boats have been destroyed, so I don't know where I'll find work.\"  Half a Village Swept Away     Mr. Badurrahman spoke in the village of Gomatali, where nearly half the population of 3,500 was killed, including Mr. Badurrahman's wife and three children. The stench of death hangs over the island, and Mr. Badurrahman cannot bear to look at the spot of mud where his hut once stood. He speaks bleakly, grimly, with no sign that he is happy to have survived by seizing a plank of wood and riding the floodwaters to the mainland, 2 miles away.    He returned to the island and is now sleeping in the hut of friends and eating a meal of rice a day, supplied by private relief organizations. Army medics have arrived and are treating local children for diarrhea, so no one on the island seems to be in danger of dying. But like Mr. Badurrahman, many seem to feel little reason to live.    Gomatali is a barren land of mud and hurried graves, and most of the people still seem in shock. Shadad Hossain, a 12-year-old boy who lost his parents and his brothers and sisters, stood barefoot with solemn eyes full of pain and seemed too numb to think of anything but the cyclone. It took him a while to decide, when asked, that he was hungry. For the last week, he said, he has had only a bit of rice each day.    Farmers as well as fishermen have lost their means of earning an income. Their fields have been flooded with salt water, and in some areas the tide flows through broken dikes that once kept the ocean from the coastal farmland. The dikes, hugely important to local agriculture, were badly damaged all the way from Cox's Bazar, a resort farther south, to Chittagong, the main southeastern port, and the tides now deposit new salt on the land twice a day.  Monsoon Season Looms     Tornadoes have struck the country for three days running, compounding the calamity and slowing relief efforts, and in a few weeks the monsoon rains will begin. Unless the embankments are repaired, the higher-than-normal spring tides will sweep across the coastal areas and islands each day. That is unlikely to carry people into the sea, but it will increase their misery and could make large regions uninhabitable. It will also drench more land with salt water and make farming those areas impossible.    If the dikes are rebuilt soon, the farmers in some areas will be able to plant a new crop in time to harvest their rice by November, if they are given seed, fertilizer and equipment, all free of charge. Even so, they would rely on handouts for food for half a year. In other areas, the salt-saturated land may not support crops for as long as two or three years. For now, outside assistance offers the people their only hope of a meal and the sole chance to get back on their feet.    \"There was lots of food here, but it has all been washed away,\" said Shubal, a fisherman in the village of Jahanabad, north of Chittagong. \"Those were our fishing boats. We're waiting for relief, but it hasn't come and so we have almost nothing to eat.\"    Mr. Shubal said that three people in his village, on the edge of the disaster area, died in the cyclone, and that two others since then have died of the diarrhea afflicting most of the villagers. He said he hoped that the Government would give out fishing nets so that he and other fishermen could have some way of putting food on the table.    So far there has been no major epidemic of cholera or other disease, and even the diarrhea, while widespread, seems to have caused a small number of deaths. People in most villages said children were suffering from diarrhea but were not dying from it. Even in the worst-hit areas, deaths are the exception.    But medical workers say that a cholera outbreak is still a possibility, and that some of the cyclone victims are at the end of their strength and vulnerable to disease.    \"The health situation is getting worse,\" Dr. Nazrulislam Chowdhury said as he bustled along a path through the mud to give first aid to villagers along the coast. But some medical workers said that the situation was improving and that a large number of deaths seemed unlikely for now.    Government officials gave more optimistic assessments than private relief workers, but even the officials acknowledge that there are remote areas -- particularly on the islands -- that have not yet been reached.    In part this is because of communication difficulties and a lack of coordination among agencies, so that sometimes no one knows if a particular area has already been helped. Rough seas have also made it difficult to reach the seaward side of the islands, and then there are a myriad other problems and uncertainties that hamper relief work.  Displaced Seek Out Cities     \"Our women are very conservative,\" said Ansarul Karim, an ecologist who is helping run a private relief effort on the southern island of Maiskhal. \"If they lost their clothing in the cyclone, they won't come out of their huts. They might just starve in their huts.\"    Mr. Karim, like most relief workers interviewed in the field, said the emergency work was being carried out too slowly. He warned that growing numbers of displaced people might flock to the cities, possibly provoking social unrest.    Already, large numbers of refugees have found their way to Chittagong, where they stand outside government offices hoping for food.    Sometimes the mood is tense: a dispute during distribution of rice the other night led to a minor riot. Local people climbed onto a building and hurled bricks and stones at the police. After 20 minutes, order was restored, but the peace seems to be a sullen one.",

As the operation begins, it appears that the troops will provide an important increment to an already immense relief effort, but will not take charge or make a sudden and overwhelming difference in the way food and medicine are distributed. The troops did not go ashore, and for now the task force's main mission is expected to be as movers for food, medicine and other relief materials to remote areas, like offshore islands, where survivors of the April 30 cyclone have little to eat and often lack shelter and safe water. A few relief flights began today, by helicopters that arrived earlier, but most of the work is scheduled to begin Thursday and to last two weeks.",

    "abstract": "  When Japan opened its shores last year to a flood of immigrants from Brazil and Peru, few adjustment problems were expected. After all, the newcomers were Japanese, or at least descendants of Japanese who had sought opportunities in South America earlier this century.    Now Japanese have discovered that while the immigrants may look familiar, they act like foreigners. They talk more noisily than native-born Japanese do, and greet each other with laughter and embraces. They have trouble with the language. And they complain about their problems.  The Samba in Tokyo    \"The people of Japan do not respect us,\" said Roberto Ishizuka, a 26-year-old former automobile worker in Sao Paulo who works six long days a week making car seats at a factory here in the region west of Tokyo. \"The Japanese treat us like some kind of an inferior race.\"    In Japan these days, Portuguese-language radio programs and newspapers have multiplied, offering news and music from Brazil and advice on problems in Japan. There was even a recent Brazilian street festival flavored with samba and salsa in Tokyo.    At the Tia Maria restaurant here, a couple of dozen Brazilians of Japanese descent were enjoying steaming bowls of feijoada, drinking Brazilian beer and reading newspapers in Portuguese. A sign on the wall warned people to disperse in the late evenings, as requested by the police.    Despite sometimes back-breaking work in foundries, factories and construction sites, life on the whole has been good for the newcomers, who can make $2,000 a month and send half of it home. Often they live in company-owned dormitories and are bused to their 14-hour-a-day jobs.    But the immigrants say they suffer discrimination in stores and restaurants, citing a story of one department store near here that once had a loudspeaker announcement that a group of them had entered and the clerks should be on guard.    Another major problem, workers and Government officials say, is that employers usually pay no health or welfare benefits, leaving workers helpless when injured by molten metal or a sharp blade on the job.   Unscrupulous recruiting agents siphon off their wages, they say, and make sweeping promises about jobs that prove false.    \"The people over here think Brazilians are living in Brazil like wild Indians,\" said Miyako Clemente, who works at an auto-parts company. \"Sometimes I can feel my roots here, and I want to learn and write Japanese. But sometimes it makes me desperate, and I feel like I want to get out.\"  Immigrants Total 150,000    In a turbulent world where millions flee oppression and starvation and migrate to other countries, the 150,000 people of Japanese descent looking for work in their ancestral land may seem like a trickle. But it marks a break with decades of Japanese refusal to let in unskilled foreigners.    Not that the need has not been great. Employers universally complain that younger Japanese in a newly affluent society no longer want to do dirty, difficult or dangerous work, and factories, restaurants and shops often seem desperate to fill jobs.    In recent years, many of those jobs have gone to Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Thais and other Asians who come to Japan on tourist visas and remain illegally while the immigration authorities look the other way. Estimates are that more than 100,000 illegal Asian immigrants work in Japan.    But Parliament, worried that the country might become like France or Germany, flooded by foreigners with customs looked on as strange by the native-born majority, enacted tough new curbs on immigration of unskilled people two years ago, and the police began expelling the Asians.  Law Changed for Descendants    Then Japan seemed to discover another pool of workers, descendants of its own people. Last year laws were changed to allow in any foreigner with parents or grandparents in Japan, and the number of workers fleeing the troubled economies of Brazil and Peru rose sharply.    Critics say those policies reflect the latent racism of Japan, which they accuse of turning its back on millions of people desperate for work on their own continent.    \"Japan feels it has to do something about its labor shortage,\" said Kyoko Yotsuya, a volunteer with the Seirei Social Welfare Community, a Christian group here. \"But they're afraid that if they open the doors to anyone, there'll be chaos. So they only want certain kinds of people.\"    The reactions of native-born Japanese to the Brazilians seem to involve class considerations as much as racial ones. Americans of Japanese descent, for instance, say they are not looked down on, perhaps because most of them are not here to do factory work.  Dress and Act Differently    The Brazilians, when they arrive and often long afterward, usually speak no Japanese. And they say the native Japanese can often tell they are Brazilians just from the way they dress or act, even before they open their mouths.    Indeed, anyone living in Japan is so aware of the polite and aloof way that Japanese deal with each other in public that it was often startling to see people in Hamamatsu embracing each other noisily in public, until one realized that they were Brazilian and not Japanese.    The first Japanese emigrated to Latin America in the first decade of this century, finding work at coffee and cotton plantations. Later waves worked in factories and raised children who achieved success and prominence, like President Alberto Fujimori of Peru.    But the last couple of years have been troubled ones for the economies of Latin America, and now a large percentage of Japanese descendants, the overwhelming majority from Brazil, have come here for work. When they get into trouble, it is the Brazilian Embassy, not the Japanese authorities, that they turn to.  'Expected to Be Japanese'    \"Somehow, Japan expected them to be Japanese,\" a Brazilian Embassy official in Tokyo said. \"It's been a kind of shock, not only for Japan but for our people. It's harder on them than it is on the rest of us foreigners because there are different expectations for them.\"    Japanese officials maintain that the immigrants were not brought in to fill jobs, per se, but only to visit their families.   \"There is a demand for foreign workers, but we did not change the law for that,\" said Kei Ogiso, an official at the immigration bureau of the Justice Ministry.    The Government, meanwhile, has tried to accommodate the new immigrants, establishing a dozen centers in central Japan to assist foreign laborers and tell them of their rights. Brazil plans to open two consulates in areas populated by the immigrants.    \"We are developing necessary protections for them,\" said Kouhei Nagashima, assistant director of the consular and migration policy division at the Foreign Ministry. \"Of course, it is not yet sufficient. But the problem has grown so quickly, we cannot be expected to solve it right away.\"",

    "abstract": "  Price reductions for tourists' accommodations and meals in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan have been announced by the Government. The tiny country between India and China is also admitting more visitors. It was once among the most expensive and exclusive of tourist destinations. All-inclusive rates that ran as high as $250 a day or more per person for accommodations, food, guides and transportation have dropped to $220 in the peak months of April and October for visitors staying in hotels. Lodges now cost about $150 a day and campsites $120 to $130. In March, May, July, August, September and November, rates range from $175 for hotels to $100 to $120 for campers. Low-season rates for January, February, June and December will be $130 for hotels and $80 to $90 for campsites, with lodges only slightly higher.    While most monasteries will remain closed to foreigners, tourists may be admitted to certain festivals held in monastic-fortress compounds called dzongs. One of these is the Thimphu Festival from Sept. 17 to 20. Ritual masked dances are the centerpieces of these religious celebrations. Most Bhutanese practice a form of Tibetan Tantric Buddhism. Tours to Bhutan must be booked and paid for in advance. Only one airline, Bhutan's Druk Air, flies to the country's only airport, at Paro, connecting the landlocked nation to Bangkok, Dhaka (Bangladesh), Katmandu (Nepal) and New Delhi.",

    "abstract": "  LITTLE girls in China no longer have their feet crushed by foot-binding, and widows in India are no longer supposed to be roasted alive on the funeral pyres of their husbands. But a stark statistic testifies to women's continuing unequal status: at least 60 million females in Asia are missing and feared dead, victims of nothing more than their sex. Worldwide, research suggests, the number of missing females may top 100 million.   If sex discrimination in the West means office harassment or fewer good jobs for women, in the third world it often means death. A traditional preference for boys translates quickly -- in China, India and many other developing countries -- into neglect and death for girls. While the discrimination is widely seen as a relic of outdated attitudes, in fact the problem appears to be getting worse in Asia. Recently released census data in China and India show that in both countries the sex ratio of the population became more skewed over the course of the last decade.",

There is no spontaneity or joy here, however. The men and a few dozen listless women are mercenaries of a sort, trucked in from the neighboring state of Haryana on the promise of a few rupees or a free trip to town to provide a sea of faces and applause. The portable crowd belongs to Devi Lal, Haryana's political godfather and the Deputy Prime Minister of India. He's sitting in a shaded pavilion, surrounded by a dozen fawning politicians who are preparing to kick off their campaigns for national elections this week. They are served mango juice.    On the ground, Devi Lal's people, dusty and thirsty and stuck there until the boss speaks, grow restless as speaker after speaker drones on. A few get up and shout for Devi Lal. They want the main event, but they are polite. Men with sticks tell them to sit down.",

With the flags of 39 nations as a backdrop, he tells his listeners that the bank, born in Attali's fertile brain a mere two years ago to guide the transition of the Soviet Union and the rest of Eastern Europe to capitalism and democracy, will be \"the first institution of the post-cold-war period . . . the first institution of a united Europe . . . the first institution of the new world order.\"   The heads of state and finance ministers from the BERD's member countries strain in vain to keep up with the soaring rhetoric. Attali, whose owlish face turns handsome when animated, spews out references to Spinoza, Tolstoy, Hobbes, Voltaire, Goethe, Kafka and Sakharov. He ends with a prayer that the bank will one day help \"700 million Europeans unite in a single ideal of peace, tolerance and light.\"",

As Kuwaiti Government officials return slowly, teen-agers in the Kuwaiti underground say they have executed captured Iraqi secret police. 1    Fleeing Iraqi troops, caught by surpise, were ravaged 17    Wounded U.S soldiers describe the attack on their barracks 17    Planning for the offensive campaign to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait began last fall even as the Bush Administration insisted publicly that its only mission was to defend Saudi Arabia and enforce U.N. sanctions.  1    The U.S. wants a military presence in the gulf that would be much larger than than the one it had before, officials said. The arrangements are already under discussion between American and Arab leaders.  19    The war has devastated the ecology of the Persian Gulf and much of Asia. Experts say it might take years to clean up the environmental damage caused by three oil slicks and thousands of burning oil wells.  19  International 3-15, 21    The contra rebels have grown angry since the murder of Enrique Bermudez, their military leader.

They had come in search of work and refuge along the heel of the Italian boot. Instead, they found squalor and fear of epidemic. In the overwhelmed port of Brindisi, it took the Government days to mobilize the forces to provide food, shelter and showers. The official Italian line was clear, and it was intended to be heard by tens of thousands of other Albanians looking to escape Eastern Europe's last Communist bastion: You are not political refugees, and if you come here you risk indifferent treatment and possible repatriation.",

Since the beginning of the war in the Persian Gulf, its owner, Graham Warden, has had the place decked out in Union Jack bunting, and he doesn't give a damn if brazen patriotism offends the Muslims from Bangladesh and Pakistan who have displaced most other people like him from the neighborhood.    The regulars who come to shoot darts by the doorway include a couple of reservists and even a local named John Major, so Warden claims. For $:2.50 ($5), the 33-year-old publican will make you a \"Scud missile,\" with a chemical warhead of Middle Eastern arrack liquor, vodka and bitter lemon, or a \"Patriot missile,\" with American Jack Daniel's, English gin and grenadine. \"The place has been called the Flying Scud since the 1880's,\" Warden explains. \"It's actually the foam the wind whips up.\"",
