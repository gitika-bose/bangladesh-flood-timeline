    "abstract": "   The army general who led a coup against the Government of Bangladesh 18 months ago came to rural southeast Texas today and watched how long-grain paddy rice was sorted, milled and parboiled here at the highly automated El Campo Rice Milling Company.    If it seemed odd that a man of the sword should be interested in agriculture, it was not surprising to those who understand the political realities of Bangladesh, an impoverished land where a poor harvest or food shortages can lead to enormous turmoil.   ''We are trying to be self-sufficient, so we are looking at everything to find better technology to produce better rice and more rice,'' said the leader, Lieut. Gen. Hussain Mohammad Ershad, President of the martial law Government.   General Ershad spoke at the Wharton County Electric Cooperative in nearby El Campo, where he and his entourage were treated to a Texas lunch of barbecued beef, beans and rice. They appeared to enjoy the food; his Texas hosts may been been rural folk, but they were diplomatically savvy enough to omit the pork ribs for the Islamic guests.",

Bangladesh, many here say, must have political peace so recent gains in food production, economic development and birth-control programs can be stepped up.

In Decatur, Ala., for example, that was the year, 1933, when the largest industry in town, which had employed 2,000 people, sank to its knees and closed. A much smaller operation went bankrupt, then another and another. Seven of the eight banks in the county folded.  Cotton was selling for 5 cents a pound and land was selling for the amount of tax owed. Children had empty stomachs, parents had vacant eyes.   The per capita income in the region was $168 that year, about 45 percent of the national average. The birth rate was about a third above the national average. About 30 percent of the residents in some areas of the valley had malaria. More than half the three million people lived on farms, and half of them were sharecroppers. About 97 percent of the farms had no electricity. Fires burned about 10 percent of the forests each year, and floods ripped along the rivers. About 7 million of the region's 12 million cleared acres were severely eroded.",

    "abstract": "   A report issued today by the National Academy of Sciences says that the coming warming of the earth caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is ''cause for concern'' but that there is sufficient time to prepare for its impact.    The academy's report follows by three days a report by the Environmental Protection Agency on the warming phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect. The two reports are similar in their findings, but the environmental agency called for steps to begin now to deal with the expected changes in world temperature and climate.   Tonight President Reagan's science adviser, George A. Keyworth 3d, sharply criticized the E.P.A. report and praised the National Academy's. He called the environmental agency's report ''unwarranted and unnecessarily alarmist.''",

    "abstract": "THE PRICE OF POWER Kissinger in the Nixon White House.  By Seymour M. Hersh.  698 pp. New York: Summit Books. $19.95.   SEYMOUR M. HERSH'S book could be called the Kissinger antimemoirs.  ''The Price of Power'' is a colossal effort to show that the image of mastery and public service conveyed by Henry Kissinger's own volumes is just one more skillful deception and that the unseemly aspects of policy making or the occasional miscalculations and mistakes acknowledged by the former National Security Adviser and Secretary of State actually constitute the essence of the Nixon-Kissinger era.   Mr. Hersh, an award-winning former reporter for The New York Times, has spent years stalking his prey. He has, he tells us, held more than 1,000 interviews. Many former officials have shown or given him their notes or hitherto unpublished documents; he has also read and compared the innumerable memoirs written about one of the most controversial and savage periods of modern American history.",

Soon he was stretched out on a cot in a long, spotless, wardlike room that held perhaps 125 similarly stricken people, more than half of them children who appeared to be less than 5 years old.   Pale and sunken-eyed, some of the children whimpered or cried as their mothers, wrapped in gaily colored Bengali saris, ministered to them, but most were silent.   No cyclone or war was responsible. All were victims of a medical disaster of gigantic proportions and lethal powers. It is not the plague, malaria or yellow fever. It is simple, miserable, inelegant diarrhea, the most widespread and pervasive health problem in underdeveloped nations, and the biggest killer of children on the earth.",

Some were slain by tribesmen; others were struck down by a range of tropical diseases, including malaria and cholera. Yet the handful of American Baptists, Welsh Presbyterians, Irish Roman Catholics and Italian Jesuits persevered, tramping through jungles of pine and teak to carry their message to villages perched on steep hills.   Nearly 200 years later the foreign missionaries have been eased out of the politically sensitive northeast by the Indian Government, but their work of evangelizing and winning new converts is being continued by Indians who are running the large network of educational institutions, health centers and churches started by the pioneers.",

In New York, a restaurant owner reflects on the way his lover, shunned by hospitals and airlines and then by undertakers, died this winter of the ailment, acquired immune deficiency syndrome.   In Denver, a woman calls to ask how she should fumigate an apartment she bought from a homosexual.In Houston, some people refuse to donate blood lest they contract AIDS from the needles at the blood bank.  In New Orleans, a club owner sees a turn toward monogamy, a retreat from the casual, anonymous sex that has characterized ''the gay life style'' for many homosexuals.",

More and more, the shopkeepers are Asian in what was once one of many suburblike, homogeneously white commercial centers in the city's ''borough of homes.'' For them, and for many non- Asians as well, this area in Queens has become an exciting and exotic gastronomic mecca.   You can smell the paprika, fennel, sesame oil and mango chutney, and the pungency of the spicy, hot Korean salad called kimchee brings water to the eyes. The fruit and vegetable stands have stacks of lotus and taro roots, bok choy and choy sum, dried black mushrooms and cuttlefish alongside the fresh fruits and vegetables, and in the Sam Bok market on Main Street, Hono Pak will sell you five-feet-long sheets of dried seaweed and bottles of Mackoly, one brand of natural Korean rice wine.",

At cocktail parties and dinners around town, the fighting around Beirut and St. Georges was nearly the sole topic of discussion.   Information, Washington's stock in trade on a day-to-day basis, becomes, at times of crisis, an essential commodity sought by everyone. This week, it seemed that all kinds of Washingtonians - lobbyists, members of Congress and business executives - all had become reporters. They were after the ''inside'' stuff on how and by whom decisions were being made at the top.",

In fact, correspondents reached by telephone today in the state capital, Gauhati, said all adversaries in the tragedy had sought to avoid responsibility and had refrained from blaming one another for the more than three weeks of violence, which erupted as a mostly Hindu political movement led by students sought to prevent state election balloting in which Moslem immigrants were also allowed to vote. Officials say more than 1,000 people died in the attacks on Moslem settlements by Assamese.   There have been no reported arrests. The leaders of the movement, which has demanded that the immigrants, mostly from Bangladesh, be removed from electoral rolls and deported, have condemned the violence in ambiguous terms while praising those who boycotted and protested the elections. Two divisions of paramilitary troops are maintaining low profiles. Civil servants brought in from other states to supervise the vote are reported to be anxious to go home.",

There is no marker and I did not know until later, when a friendly geologist pointed to the place on a map, that the line crosses the road between Gyangze and Xigaze.   About the time our Japanese station wagon crossed the squeeze, one of my companions pointed out the left window. I looked, and there in the ditch, among the boulders and fossils of two continents, stood a naked man. He grinned and waved with the self-assured aplomb of a Manhattan street kid.",

    "abstract": "  WHEN HE ROSE TO SPEAK, THE general was still wearing his cap, with the full complement of ornamental braid due his rank. Solemnly, he gave his undergraduate audience a rigid salute. The white, rosy-cheeked expressions turned up to him could not have been more earnest had they been in church. And the general easily slipped into an evangelist's role, depicting a conflict between forces of light and darkness. The former, it went without saying, were well represented in this lecture hall at the University of the Orange Free State in Bloemfontein, an Afrikaans-language citadel not noted for its tolerance of wayward ideas. The forces of darkness were the ''terrorists,'' black South Africans manipulated by the ''dragon'' of international Communism. It was exactly what might have been expected in Bloemfontein, except for one conspicuous detail: The general, Xhanti Charles Sebe, Director of State Security of the supposedly independent ''homeland'' of Ciskei, was black.  More than pigmentation made him a surprising figure. A handful of young Afrikaners in the hall seemed uneasily aware that here was a black man who surpassed them in ideological commitment; from their point of view, he was almost too good to be true. The coiled energy and enthusiasm in the man came out in a gravelly voice and staccato articulation. When he spoke of ''the devilish, destructive actions of trained terrorists,'' he squeezed off each syllable like a retaliatory shot.",
