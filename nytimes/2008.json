    "lead_paragraph": "(Photo: Sediment from rivers is adding land area to Bangladesh. Can this counter rising seas? (The New York Times)) Scientists in Bangladesh have been reappraising forecasts of eventual inundation of sprawling, crowded delta regions as seas rise in a warming world. According to several reports, a fresh satellite analysis shows that new lands formed by sediment carried from the crumbling Himalayas are adding to Bangladesh's land area -- at least for now.   As wire stories circulated overnight, I sent out some queries to sea-level experts and will report back on how this battle between new sediment and rising seas will play out.   Sea level is not uniform globally. Juneau, Alaska, is rising, for instance. The land there is rebounding, freed of the weight of ice-age glaciers. When I visited Juneau last year, biologists told me that a fight is brewing over whether protected coastal wetlands should no longer be protected once they are dry. (Coastal property owners say the new land is theirs.)  The fate of Bangladesh's lowlands will be determined by a mix of changes in the height of the Indian Ocean, subsidence of deltas as aquifers are drained and newly deposited sediments compress, and the addition of all that Himalayan soil.  In checking out the news from Bangladesh, I noticed that the Dutch have been advising Bangladeshis to do as the Dutch do -- use engineering to work with the flow of sediment and accelerate the accretion of new lands. A recent article in The New Nation -- \"Can Bangladesh Trap Silt?\" -- is worth a look. All of this serves as a useful reminder that humans are not some static element in the climate puzzle, but a dynamic, responsive and innovative one -- at least once a human community gets a strong signal that action is needed.   When I wrote with James Kanter last year about the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on impacts from global warming, I made sure we noted how the consequences for humans change significantly when adaptation is taken into account (boldface added):    Without such adaptations, it said, a rise of 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century could lead to the inundation of coasts and islands inhabited by hundreds of millions of people. But if steady investments are made in seawalls and other coastal protections, vulnerability could be sharply reduced.  Bangladesh has already proved to be one of the world's most resilient countries in the face of flood threats, as Secretary General Ban Ki-moon pointed out here. It sounds as if the country is getting geared up to find ways to exploit the eroding Himalayas as a way to counter the erosion of its coasts.  Adaptation can buy time and cut losses in the short run. But in the end, many experts note that unabated greenhouse-gas emissions essentially mean there will be no new normal climate or coastline to adapt to -- in Bangladesh or anywhere else. ",

McNeil has been covering the grim toll wrought by infectious diseases in developing countries, and the global threat some pathogens pose in our increasingly interconnected world. In Science Times this week, he provides a valuable update on the H5N1 virus behind recent outbreaks of avian flu. While out of the headlines, it remains a simmering threat that, experts say, needs far more attention than it is getting. He took some time to explore the issue with me for Dot Earth readers. Please feel free to post any additional questions you may have, or comments, and I\u2019ll forward them to him.Q. That was a fine summary today of the bird flu situation, which seems to be on simmer, not boil, but hardly a non-threat at this point. This is a risk I want to explore on Dot Earth because it\u2019s one of the potential \u201chard knocks\u201d we face in a world of growing populations and mobility. ",

The first time I spoke to him last fall, he was at home in his apartment in Tokyo. The next time, he was in Accra, the capital of Ghana, in West Africa. Several weeks after that, he was in Uzbekistan, by way of Tajikistan and China, and in short order he and his phone visited Helsinki, London and Los Angeles. If you decide not to call Jan Chipchase but rather to send e-mail, the odds are fairly good that you\u2019ll get an \u201cout of office\u201d reply redirecting you back to his cellphone, with a notation about his current time zone \u0097 \u201cGMT +9\u201d or \u201cGMT -8\u201d \u0097 so that when you do call, you may do so at a courteous hour.",

The mornings seem \u201cunbearably liquid\u201d with humidity, and tempers worsen as \u201cthe air stopped around people\u2019s throats, not a stir, everything still as buildings.\u201d Then come the daily \u201cexclamations of lightning,\u201d and always there is \u201cone small boy, or a very old man, or even a dog\u201d waiting with his tongue out for the first drop of rain to fall. The description allows for a few seconds of calm in an increasingly tense plot, but it\u2019s also a bravura set piece. It\u2019s almost as if Anam were giving herself a test \u0097 if she were writing about Los Angeles, she\u2019d do the Santa Ana winds \u0097 a test she passes, not least because she never uses the word \u201cmonsoon.\u201d And from that moment on, almost everything goes right with this historical novel about the birth of a new nation.

    "snippet": "Any number of ways to reduce your carbon footprint.",
    "lead_paragraph": "A CLEAR SENSE OF EMISSION: Carbon-dioxide equivalents may be the most complicated currency on world markets today. A basic exchange works like this: When a company like the Gap commits to reducing emissions but cannot, or chooses not to, cut the energy used to move clothes across the globe, it finances someone else\u2019s green project. Rather than put $100, say, toward reinventing its shipping system, the Gap may spend $20 to plant trees or invest in a clean utility. If a new power plant is needed in India, carbon investments from the Gap and others make it possible to build a more expensive wind farm instead of a coal plant. Win-win, the logic goes: because carbon emissions are a global problem, it doesn\u2019t matter where they are reduced. The system of carbon trading exploded after the Kyoto Protocol and in 2006 sustained a $30 billion market representing nearly 1.7 billion tons of traded carbon dioxide. The market extends beyond signatories to include companies that participate voluntarily. These days, even individual consumers are joining in to pay offset retailers somewhere between $3 and $40 per ton in order to counter the carbon they emit driving to work or just running their refrigerators. But individuals are confronting many of the same uncertainties that companies and countries have been navigating under the Kyoto Protocol. First, how to determine your emissions? There are several calculators on the Web, but they yield different answers. \u201cWhen you fly, the fuel efficiency of your plane varies,\u201d Jeff Swenerton, a spokesman at Green-e, an offset-certification program, points out. He says that calculators, for example, don\u2019t factor in that \u201call things being equal, different airplanes of the same model can have wildly different burn rates.\u201d Once you have a carbon figure, which offsets should you buy? Certification isn\u2019t standardized either. Part of the problem is in the measuring: how old should a replanted forest be before it earns credit? What if it gets logged or burns? Another issue: how do certification schemes verify that the projects they invest in add real, new carbon reduction to the market? Should credits subsidize solar power in a city that already gives solar tax breaks? There are social questions too: should certification only make sure that carbon hasn\u2019t entered the atmosphere, or should it include other goals, like sustainable development? Some argue that if a project generates less carbon but disrupts a local community, it forces the poor to take responsibility for the pollution of the rich and reinforces a model of development that created the problem of global warming in the first place. Although it has been muddled by competing standards, the market is maturing. The Voluntary Carbon Standard, created by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and two other nongovernmental organizations, is widely seen as a benchmark of quality assurance, and carbon credits certified by it sell for between $5 and $15 per ton. Credits certified by a competitor, the Gold Standard, sell for between $8 and $40 per ton, while offering additional standards for sustainable community development. \u201cWe can\u2019t necessarily rely on a country\u2019s environmental standards as adequate,\u201d says Michael Schlup, director of the Gold Standard. He also adds, \u201cWe need to give something to people and places who are giving us emissions reductions safely.\u201d (The V.C.S. recognizes that the Gold Standard offers an added virtue.) Russell Simon, a spokesman for the nonprofit carbon retailer Carbonfund.org who admits the carbon-certification business \u201creally is a baffling market,\u201d says he thinks that a battle over standards can be healthy, but that one or two companies need \u201cto emerge and build trust in their brand of certification.\u201d He adds, \u201cIt is a bit like the wars we used to have at the beginning of using the word \u2018organic.\u2019 Now we agree what that means.\u201d TESS TAYLOR",

    "lead_paragraph": "(Photo: Rafael Soler is one of five finalists in the annual Vendy Awards, a contest to pick the city's best sidewalk food. (Photo: Robert Stolarik for The New York Times)) When Rafael Soler first started selling Dominican food in Red Hook Park, in 1998, it was with a lifetime of cooking experience, a few days of hasty preparation and the help of a battalion of unpaid family members in lieu of service employees.   Some things slipped through the cracks: The first customer, Mr. Soler recalled this week, ordered a cup of coffee, and had a $20 bill to pay for it. Mr. Soler realized he had forgotten to bring change.   \"I said, 'You know something, I'll give you the coffee free,'\" he recalled on Wednesday, standing by his food truck in a storage lot by the Brooklyn waterfront. \"This is my first customer. He's lucky, that guy.\"  It was not a mistake Mr. Soler repeated \u2014 fortunately for him, and for the many fans he has made over the years who are happy to see him still in business, selling food from his native Dominican Republic and from his wife's native El Salvador. Now, after a trying year in which he and his fellow Red Hook vendors faced the prospect of being shut down by city government, he has reached the top of the street vendor heap. Mr. Soler, the subject of this week's Dispatches feature in the City section, is one of five finalists in the Vendy Awards, a competition to be held next weekend to pick the best street food in the city.  His nomination marks the first time a Red Hook Park vendor \u2014 or any Brooklyn-based vendor \u2014 has been a finalist. (The other four finalists this year are a Jamaican cook based in the Bronx, a Bangladeshi who cooks in Midtown, a purveyor of lamb and falafel from Queens who also cooks in Midtown, and three California brothers who sell grilled meats in SoHo.)  Cesar Fuentes, the executive director of the Food Vendors Committee of Red Hook Park, the vendors' incorporated umbrella organization, said on Thursday that the selection is a vindication for all of the vendors, who number more than a dozen.  \"I think it's a crowning achievement after such a tough year,\" he said. \"Some of the vendors actually have invested over $50,000, their life's savings, mortgaged their homes, maxed out their credit cards. It comes as a triumph, not just for Rafael but for all the Red Hook food vendors that he represents.\"  The vendors' travails have been well-chronicled. They have been operating in Red Hook Park, in one form or another, for 34 years, Mr. Fuentes said, selling food to fans of the soccer and baseball games who gather there on the weekends. The vendors' popularity exploded in the city's Latino communities in the 1990s, he said, and in recent years has been discovered by foodies at large.  That discovery, though, brought unwanted attention from city government. In June 2007, the Parks Department raised the possibility that the vendors would have to enter into a competitive bidding process to keep their spots in the park. Then, while the vendors weathered that storm, with help from elected officials including Senator Charles E. Schumer, they were required to meet city Health Department regulations to continue operating.  For cooks who had traditionally worked on portable stoves, selling their creations across folding tables, this meant buying and outfitting expensive trucks, complete with full kitchens. The stress of the experience took a toll within the vendors' organization, and even after word emerged that they would be allowed to stay, legal wrangling caused the vendors to miss the spring months and part of the summer. And when they returned, it was to grumbles that many customers found the trucks less charming and welcoming than the old setup.  Mr. Fuentes, who is Mr. Soler's stepson \u2014 he first got to know many of the vendors while working for Mr. Soler and his mother at their stand \u2014 acknowledged that much of the scene is not as it was before the regulatory trouble. But the food is exactly the same, he said, adding, \"The one thing that wasn't lost was that talent that came from the artisans.\"  The good news for the vendors is that things finally seem to be sorted out. They have a six-year permit, and will be in the park, at the corner of Clinton and Bay Streets, on Saturdays and Sundays through October \u2014 and maybe into early November if the weather is nice. And, Mr. Fuentes said, they plan to be back out next year promptly in April. Additionally, Mr. Soler and two other vendors have expanded their businesses, with satellite stands at Brooklyn Flea, the Fort Greene flea market \u2014 though that site has had some problems of its own.  Sean Basinski, director of the Street Vendor Project, an organization that has 750 vendor members \u2014 including Mr. Soler \u2014 and sponsors the Vendys as an annual fund-raiser, said the troubles in Red Hook are typical for street vendors in the city. Steep fines make violating city laws a dangerous proposition, he said, adding, \"For a guy who sells peanuts at a dollar a bag, a $300 ticket is going to put you out for a week.\"  Mr. Basinski said the Vendys, which will be held in the Tobacco Warehouse in Dumbo on the Brooklyn waterfront on Oct. 18 ($80 for advance tickets), are intended to recognize exceptional street vendors who are able to do something creative with their businesses. At the same time, he said, people should remember that the contestants' flair is not necessarily typical, and that most vendors are just working-class people trying to eke out a living under tough circumstances  \"The truth is that somebody selling hot dogs, most of our vendors, are not so elevated,\" Mr. Basinski said. \"The fact is that most of our vendors are selling nuts, or fruit, or handbags, because they know it sells, and they know where to get it, and they have people that supply them, and they know how much they can make each week.\"  Besides celebrating the finalists, he said, the awards aim to \"remind people that even the guy who sells apples is wonderful, and provides a service in his own way.\"  Considering even the most mundane vendors' independence and spirit of entrepreneurship, he said: \"These are some of the last examples, it sounds corny, but of the American dream. Who's standing up for them?\" ",

    "lead_paragraph": "SERE GRAPES: Though ultraripe wines have been fashionable in the Napa Valley for more than a decade, climate change appears to be forcing the issue. While recent summers were cool, most Napa winemakers agree that 10-year averages are the hottest in memory. Too often, a result has been overripe grapes, and the cooked flavors and throat-searing alcohol that accompany them. If temperatures continue to rise even slightly, Napa could be in trouble. Most superior grape-growing regions enjoy cool summer nights, which allow vines to recover from the stress of the day\u2019s heat. Lose that, and you\u2019re left with grapes better suited for bulk wines. \u201cIf average nighttime temperatures increase even a few degrees,\u201d says Andrew Walker, a professor in the department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California at Davis, \u201cthen there\u2019s really no difference between Napa and the Central Valley.\u2019 Tony Truchard, whose Truchard Vineyards is located in Carneros, Napa\u2019s coolest pocket, says: \u201cIf I could start the California wine industry over again, I wouldn\u2019t plant on the valley floor at all. It\u2019s too hot, and it\u2019s going to get hotter.\u201d But those mature vineyards are considered Napa\u2019s most prestigious. And Napa retains other desirable attributes. \u201cIn Napa, we\u2019ve got rootstocks we like, soils we think are the best,\u201d Pat Garvey, an owner of Flora Springs Winery and Vineyards, says. \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d Instead, Garvey and others have set out to mitigate the heat\u2019s effect. The mandate is clear: undo everything that was done in the name of ripeness during the 1990s. Those cabernet clones imported from Bordeaux because they ripen so easily? Rip them out and plant something more reluctant. Vines positioned near the ground to soak up radiant heat? Install a trellis system and pull them higher. Wineries have started planting vineyards on a northeast-southwest axis, which minimizes strong afternoon sunlight. They add cover crops \u0097 clover, bell bean \u0097 to compete with the vines and prolong the fruit\u2019s maturation process. And they\u2019re removing fewer leaves. \u201cWe used to try for as much sun as possible, but we\u2019ve backed off,\u201d says Doug Shafer of Shafer Vineyards. \u201cShading has become really important. Without it, we get roasted fruit.\u201d Trying to reduce alcohol in the winery is like trying to bring a snapshot into focus in the darkroom, but it can be done. Perhaps the most widespread technique, though one rarely acknowledged, is dilution. \u201cYou use what we call \u2018Jesus Units,\u2019 because they turn water into wine,\u201d says the owner of a Napa Winery known for its elegant cabernets. Manual sorters, previously employed to detect rot, now look for overripe grapes. \u201cIt\u2019s a large investment in labor, but it makes a significant difference,\u201d Michelle Edwards, the winemaker at Cliff Lede Vineyards, says. \u201cLast harvest on some properties, I removed as much as 10 percent of the grapes off the table because they were desiccated. \u201d These changes cost money, but they\u2019re less costly than allowing wines to carry such alcoholic heat that nobody wants to drink them, and less drastic than abandoning Napa cabernet altogether. Still, the future might include grape varieties that do better in hot weather, like Grenache and Syrah. \u201cIf it keeps getting warmer, maybe we have to think about that,\u201d Shafer says. \u201cMaybe cabernet won\u2019t always be king here. I have a hard time saying that, but it could be the answer.\u2019 BRUCE SCHOENFELD",

Well, in one sense, the yield sign hasn't disappeared \u2014 its behavior has just been transferred over to the stop sign. Compliance at stop signs is notoriously low, and some 3,000 people a year are killed in \"failure to yield right of way\" type crashes at intersections with stop signs. But I'm not sure if or why municipalities have stopped using them.   Generally, for stop-sign intersections to be transferred to \"yield control,\" they have to meet a number of criteria, involving \"sight distance,\" daily average vehicle counts (intersections with low traffic are generally good candidates for yield, and as many places get more crowded that might explain their reduced usage) and crash histories. As converting to yield control has seen crashes go up (according to, for one, National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 320) \u2014 possibly because of increased confusion of right-of-way decisions, among other things. And given that, based on the above numbers, a lot of stop sign intersections are plenty dangerous, I can see how local governments might be leery to changeover.   By the way, I'm totally in favor of yield control vis-a-vis roundabouts, which force drivers to slow and reduce the chance for a T-bone collision.   Q. The United States has very few traffic circles, or roundabouts, as they are known in the United Kingdom. Are there traffic flow benefits to using traffic circles, assuming we could somehow teach the population how they should be properly entered and exited? -- Jeff Bean  A. Given that we actually invented the traffic circle, I think it's high time we brought it back. But not the traffic circles of yore, but the modern roundabout \u2014 a totally different beast. There are absolutely traffic flow \u2014 and emissions \u2014 benefits to roundabouts (as well as the discussed safety benefits above). Research by Mandaville, et al., at Kansas State University has found that roundabouts can reduce average vehicle delay by 65 percent, and other research has found signalized intersections generate twice the emissions as those controlled by roundabouts.   There are a few reasons, but the most obvious is that a stopped vehicle generates on the order of seven times the emissions of a vehicle moving at 10 miles an hour. The idea that people would find it difficult to go slowly around a small circle with other cars raises questions about whether those people should be operating heavy machinery to begin with.  Q. In his book \"Micromotives and Macrobehavior,\" the Nobel-winning economist Thomas Schelling observed that many people caught in traffic jams do not view themselves as part of the problem. Did you rely on the work of economists in writing your book? -- Gabe Nugent  A. Absolutely. It's probably not surprising, because traffic is a perfect fit for economists, with concepts like incentives, equilibrium, etc., underlying and informing all kinds of traffic behavior, from the individual driver to larger networks. I talk about, for example, Arthur Cecil Pigou, who did groundbreaking work on the idea of taxing activities \u2014 like driving \u2014 that generate \"negative externalities,\" i.e., essentially the unpaid costs someone exacts on others for their activity. When we drive we aren't charged (or at least adequately) for the emissions we're spreading on people's streets, the damage we do to the road, or the additional congestion we're generating by our own driving, etc.   I talk about Sam Peltzman, whose famous \"Peltzman effect\" \u2014 the idea that increasing regulation of safety equipment hasn't necessarily been accompanied by relevant increases in safety \u2014 has been much debated but is arguably correct in certain ways.   And I talk, of course, about Schelling, who famously used the example of rubbernecking to talk about the way our small individual actions can add up to colossal social effects \u2014 in this case, rubbernecking. Every driver takes their 10 seconds, adding to every other driver's wait, and as every other driver approaches, they figure since they've already waited, they may as well take their 10 seconds too.   Q. After driving in Europe -- mostly Germany -- for a number of years, I'm convinced that most highway congestion problems in the United States are caused by failure to observe or enforce \"keep to the right, pass only on left\" laws. Traffic flows smoothly on autobahns because slow vehicles stay in the right lane. Faster drivers always have the right of way. It works beautifully! Your thoughts? -- Fred Bothwell  A. The autobahn is tricky for direct comparison because a) there often is congestion; b) they have automated speed limits in some sections, so when traffic is forming all lanes are forced to slow; and c) there's a much different vehicle mix \u2014 fewer drivers in general, and a richer driver population \u2014 including no trucks on Sunday. The roads, owing to higher taxes, are typically better maintained and suffer less from construction delays.   There's also the obvious logical fallacy of worrying about \"keep right\" laws when the person concerned about such laws is violating the speed limit law by 15 m.p.h. or higher. Also, in heavy traffic, during which, incidentally, the left lane often clogs first, there's a social question here: because the highway handles the most vehicles per hour at 55-60 m.p.h., why should a lane be given over to fewer drivers who want to go faster when that negatively affects the remaining flow? (echoes of the H.O.V. lane here).   That said, even for drivers going within relative bands of the speed limit, but with slightly different speeds, there's a good logic to assigning some order to those speeds, in the same way there's a logic to doing this on things like people movers on airports (one of my pet peeves is the \"road hogs\" who treat it like a place to stand, blocking all the \"lanes\"). But in traffic there are always weird exceptions, like an exit or entrance on the left, etc. There's also the notion that someone is always going to want to go faster than someone else, so it raises the question of that one person's desire is really equivalent to the cost of all the other people having to make lane changes, raising the crash risk for every other driver.  Q. In light of current gas prices and the likelihood of ongoing increases, do you think bringing back the 55 m.p.h. speed limit is a good idea? Do you think it feasible? -- Stephen  A. As this debate could fill an entire book, I'll just say if you're interested in reducing fuel usage (and thus prices) and road casualties, it's a good idea. On the feasibility question, I think we'd need much, much higher fuel prices, speed governors or I.S.A. (intelligent speed adaption) technology in cars, or automated speed camera rollouts. Appealing to people's altruism or common sense (e.g., burning less fossil fuel) seems to fail as an abstract principle, in traffic as elsewhere.   Q. Mr. Vanderbilt, do you believe, as I do, that as many people enter their vehicles they feel they're putting on a kind of \"anti-civility suit\" that somehow absolves them of all requirements to function as polite, humane participants in society? -- Sixto Fernandez  A. By all means. Walt Disney got at this brilliantly in Motor Mania, the 1950 short that shows Goofy changing from \"Mr. Walker\" to \"Mr. Wheeler.\" I think the reasons are varied, ranging from the sensorial isolation of being in a car to lingering class issues to anonymity and lack of feedback or consequences for acting rudely in traffic, to the very stress of driving itself, amongst other things. Of course, some people simply act in the car like they do off-road. It's been shown, for example, that people with more off-road criminal violations are more likely to commit on-road violations.   Q. \"Ants obey traffic rules.\" What does that mean? -- Ipod Rod  A. Army ants traveling to and from food sources on their daily commutes (which change every day) seem to instinctively create lane systems for outbound and inbound traffic. A traffic sign in Bangalore, India, even gets at this, rather poetically. It reads: \"When ants can obey laneing laws why can't we the humans?\" They also lay a variety of pheromones on the trails as they move, of course, and these are surprisingly complex, containing a variety of all kinds of, essentially, \"traffic signals.\"   Q. I travel all around the country and have become very conscious of the differences in honking behavior. In New York City, honking is rampant, especially among taxi drivers. On the West Coast, you can go all day without hearing a car horn. Why is that? -- Harold Levine.  A. It's a great question. One reason is, I think, the pace of life is simply faster in New York City. In his book \"The Geography of Time,\" Robert Levin conducted experiments among various cities in the United States, using a variety of measures, and found that New York ranked third in \"overall pace,\" while Los Angeles ranked 36. There does seem to be something to that \"California lifestyle.\"   It could also be that Californians are more anesthetized by being in their cars all day. I also think that New York City crams more people closer together, with more vehicles and more pedestrians (and thus more chances to honk) in a tighter space, one that has more traffic signals \u2014 and again, more chances to be delayed (particularly by distracted idiots on their cellphones).   As for taxi drivers, many of these have come from places, like Bangladesh, where honking is a much stronger cultural presence in everyday life, so it's not hard to imagine they've carried some of that with them.   Q. Do ramp meters really work? Do they just divert traffic? Or is something else going on? -- Erik Gunn  A. Ramp meters, from the research I've seen, do work, at least for the overall system (they may \"punish\" some individual drivers).   In Minneapolis a \"ramp meter holiday\" was declared at the behest of a state senator, who thought they were \"causing congestion.\" The Transportation Department found that traffic conditions worsened during the shutdown, so they were turned back on \u2014 and remain on.   Anyone who sends an email has experienced a form of ramp metering; there's a \"congestion window\" that will basically hold up your email if the network is busy, as it's been found that metering the oncoming flow is more efficient in the long run than simply dumping more information (or vehicles) onto the network routes.  Q. I'm wondering how long will it be, in your estimation, before we won't drive at all? -- Misha  A. Given the strides we've already made in semi-automation in cars, I think it may not be long at all before highway driving is largely taken away from the hands of humans. If you mean \"before we won't drive at all\" in terms of even getting into a car, that future seems almost impossible for me to imagine. Though the examples of Denmark, with its high social happiness and incredibly high (and increasing) bicycle commuting, seem more sustainable long term than countries like China, which are going through the motorization phase the United States went through in the 1950s (with its attendant fatalities), and perhaps, having achieved this, will some day go back to the future, as it were, and lessen dependence on the private car.   I found Beijing, with its smog and super-blocks, its retrograde pedestrian tunnels and bridges, its epic commutes and hostile traffic and directionally challenged taxi drivers, one of the least pleasant large cities in which to get around (I did prefer the food there though!).   Q. Have you heard of any large scale projects or tests going on in the area of traffic-light timing? -- Jonathan  A. Well, Los Angeles is always looking to expand and optimize its ATSAC system, which features real-time adaptive signals, and based on studies, have been able to squeeze more capacity out of their existing infrastructure. And a number of studies, for different systems in different places, having definitely seen reductions in travel times, delays, stops, etc. But there's always cost issues (\"smart\" lights cost more) and the thorny question of \"splits.\" Everyone in one direction wants the \"green wave,\" but so do the other drivers approaching the intersection from different directions.   Intersections are finite resources; you can't just give to one user without taking away from others. But we've all had the experience of waiting at particularly fruitless signals, which may be the result of traffic patterns having changed since the original signal timing plans were put in place. But I've been cautioned that, like medicine, adaptive signals need to be applied in the right cases \u2014 some intersections can be so saturated there wouldn't be much improvement from the costly upgrade.   Of course, the most adaptive, most real-time intersection control out there is the yield-entry roundabout \u2014 and they work just fine when the power goes out! ",
