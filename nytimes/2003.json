Her detention by the military government since May 30 has drawn international condemnation, including tougher American penalties signed by President Bush on Monday. The detention of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is the symbolic center of a harsh crackdown under way to crush the pro-democracy movement. Seth Mydans (NYT) ",

A fine science writer's account of efforts to preserve large top-of-the-food-chain carnivores like tigers and crocodiles, and a meditation on what life would be like without them.    THE ART OF BURNING BRIDGES: A Life of John O'Hara, by Geoffrey Wolff. (Knopf, $30.) This conversational, frankly opinionated biography by a fellow fiction writer who has himself endured rejections and editing goes far toward redeeming O'Hara from the the ranks of the impossible and placing him among the merely very difficult.    ONE PILL MAKES YOU SMALLER, by Lisa Dierbeck. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) A sober first novel that overturns the traditional optimism of the coming-of-age story; things get worse and worse for Alice Duncan, a prematurely developed 11-year who is neglected, coerced and used as the fantasy object of some quite unpleasant adults.    JOURNAL OF THE DEAD: A Story of Friendship and Murder in the New Mexico Desert, by Jason Kersten. (HarperCollins, $24.95.) A spare, understated account of two inexperienced young men from around Boston who camped out in the New Mexico desert with three pints of water between them and got lost.    BRICK LANE, by Monica Ali. (Scribner, $25.) A first novel of remarkable technical assurance, set in an immigrant section of London; its protagonist, a village girl from Bangladesh, is imported to marry a striving 40-year-old. After ages of silence and passivity as a mother and garment worker, she discovers her own daring and desire in an adulterous episode.    TRIANGLE: The Fire That Changed America, by David Von Drehle. (Atlantic Monthly, $25.) An account of the Triangle Waist Company fire in Manhattan in 1911, which killed 146 garment workers and led to reformed labor law in New York; the author, a Washington Post reporter, provides a detailed background portrait of the city and the times.    ELEONORA DUSE: A Biography, by Helen Sheehy. (Knopf, $32.50.) A smart, industrious, passionate biography of a great figure scarcely anyone now living ever saw, an international superstar in works by Sardou, Zola, Verga and Dumas fils, a sexual adventurer of some note and a willing helper to younger performers.    THE KNOWN WORLD, by Edward P. Jones. (Amistad/HarperCollins, $24.95.) A novel of epic proportions that copes with incongruous historical data, like the existence of free blacks who owned slaves in the antebellum South, and with the moral confusion and pollution that arose from slavery without respect of color.

It neither hurts nor heals in any material sense; no phalanx of soldiers will broach borders for it, no one will lose or gain employment as a result, and no babies shall be birthed. Its sublime bloody uselessness -- here lies its attraction for this particular novelist. For even if I am very bad at it, nothing too bad will come of it.

    "abstract": "A selective listing by Times critics of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.    * AESOP ROCK, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Aesop Rock is the most intriguing of all the rappers affiliated with the Brooklyn-based label Definitive Jux. His new album, ''Bazooka Tooth,'' is full of off-kilter beats and bilious rhymes that overlap so densely that you may sometimes think you are hearing two records at once. His logorrhea can be exhausting, but his quick tongue and enigmatic narratives may win you over, even if you can decipher only a few lines at a time. One riff seems to go something like this: ''Buried his nozzle in fossil marker art/Pardon, cadaver had a legitimate pulse, and littered volts/Over the village where the skittish pigeons molt.'' Tomorrow night at 9, with El-P, S. A. Smash and others. Tickets are $15; sold out, but returns may be available (Kelefa Sanneh).",
