Thousands of islands are created, swept away and recreated every year at the point where the myriad brown waterways of the Ganges delta tumble into the Bay of Bengal. And these shifting islands, called ''chars,'' teem with farmers during the day who come to plant and harvest rice in the rich soil.   It was from these islands that hundreds, possibly thousands of Bengalis were swept into the ocean Saturday by 10- to 15-foot waves created by a cyclone with winds as high as 100 miles per hour. Bangladesh officials said it was impossible to tell yet how many people were lost; the confirmed death toll was at least 1,400.",

    "abstract": "  At no time do we in the developed, industrial world become more aware of the accidental good fortune we enjoy than when the habitual meanness of life in one of the globe's impoverished nations is made even meaner by a natural disaster.   Such is the case now in Bangladesh, whose coastal delta, with its heavily populated and poorly protected network of islands, was struck on Saturday by a cyclone and tidal wave. With communications primitive, there is no way to estimate the death toll, except that it is likely in the tens of thousands - and possibly higher.   Weather calamities are so common in Bangladesh - monsoon floods and cyclones and droughts - that the average disasters, in which sometimes hundreds are killed, cause barely a ripple in this troubled nation's life. But the cyclone that smote the delta over the weekend - and the huge tidal wave it pushed before it -was not average.",

    "abstract": "  ''Marie Curie once said that a scientist must be interested in things, not people. Well, I just didn't have what it takes,'' says June Goodfield, the English scientist-turned-writer who inspired the five-part television series ''Quest for the Killers'' that begins a week from this Tuesday evening at 10 on Channel 13.   The series, based on Dr. Goodfield's new book, recounts five recent medical whodunits, focusing as much on the researchers and the victims of diseases as on high technology. In the programs, important medical advances in such diverse settings as Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh and Greenwich Village are re-enacted on location by the same scientists who were originally involved.   ''I wanted to get behind some of today's really interesting biomedical stories,'' said Dr. Goodfield, an ebullient woman of 58. Today, she shows no signs of the shell shock one expects from authors whose writings have been, as they say, ''adapted'' for television. Indeed, she feels the series more than did justice to her prose, and she is already planning another television project.",

As the fighting went into the seventh day, the police reported that four people were killed when Palestinian guerrillas clashed with militamen of Amal, the mainstream Shiite Moslem movement, in the Baalbek area of the Bekaa region, about 50 miles east of Beirut. [1:5.] Hundreds of people were killed when a hurricane struck the southern coast of Bangladesh and offshore islands. An unofficial report put the death toll at 600 in the Noakhali district on the east side of the mouth of the Ganges River, and 1,000 nationwide.",

    "abstract": "  After 10 years of losing ground in its battle against environmental destruction, this Himalayan kingdom is turning to new approaches in a desperate effort to prevent its hills and forests from turning into vast barren deserts.   Environmental experts say Nepal, a country with some of the world's most breathtaking scenery, is threatened with calamity unless it can reverse a trend that has left it with only 10 million forested acres today, compared with 16 million acres two decades ago.   Some experts project that at the current rate, all forests will disappear within 25 years. Even tourists are affected by the problem. Hikers and trekkers in the Mount Everest region are now required by the Government to take along kerosene for fuel, since the region has been largely denuded of trees.",

Several Indian shops have been forced to close lately. Some shopkeepers are hanging on, but say they fear they will have to leave when their leases are up. Others, who own their buildings, are prospering and have opened branches in Jackson Heights, Queens, in what is now called Little India No. 2.",

The answer depends on whom you talk to, with optimism and pessimism in almost equal balance.   Michael Pflueger, the United States Department of Agriculture representative at the Hunt's Point wholesale market in the South Bronx, said he had not seen an acute shortage of citrus so far. ''I think the bulk of the harvest has been made,'' he said, although he noted that late-season Valencias, the largest and most important crop for juice, are still on the trees. ''Late winter and early spring is when you'll probably see a real shortage of juice oranges,'' he said. Mr. Pflueger said the wholesale price of oranges had risen from $10 to $12 a hundred a week ago to $12 to $13 a hundred at the start of this week.",

New findings, described by one expert as ''electrifying'' in their implications, are galvanizing international efforts to combat the deficiency. The studies indicate that the vitamin deficit, which is widespread in the third world and a major cause of blindness there, is also responsible for significant increases in measles, diarrhea and other potentially deadly diseases among tens of millions of children.   International health officials are developing a plan they hope will eliminate the deficiency worldwide and, in the process, reduce childhood deaths. Experts said the findings had already rejuvenated flagging vitamin therapy programs in Bangladesh and other Asian countries.",

For a WASP like me, raised on the blandly nutritious food of New England, ethnic food means a chance to taste, explore and, above all, to cook from virtually all the cuisines of the world. With so many important end-of-the-year holiday meals coming up - not just Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas dinners but also the traditional feasts of Santa Lucia (Scandinavian), St. Basil (Greek) and the Three Kings (Hispanic), the Boar's Head Festival (Old English), the Russian and Chinese New Years - this is the perfect time to go in search of other cuisines. For some cooks, the pursuit of a single necessary ingredient is what the quest is all about, the chance to reward one's friends with an authentic national dish, Brazilian feijoada or a genuine Hungarian Szekely gulas, every element in place, the proportions balanced and the recipe evolved over long discussions with a purveyor of Brazilian or Hungarian food who still remembers what it tasted like in the old country and who has the contents on hand to prepare it that way.",

For a WASP like me, raised on the blandly nutritious food of New England, ethnic food means a chance to taste, explore and, above all, to cook from virtually all the cuisines of the world. With so many important end-of-the-year holiday meals coming up - not just Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas dinners but also the traditional feasts of Santa Lucia (Scandinavian), St. Basil (Greek) and the Three Kings (Hispanic), the Boar's Head Festival (Old English), the Russian and Chinese New Years - this is the perfect time to go in search of other cuisines. For some cooks, the pursuit of a single necessary ingredient is what the quest is all about, the chance to reward one's friends with an authentic national dish, Brazilian feijoada or a genuine Hungarian Szekely gulas, every element in place, the proportions balanced and the recipe evolved over long discussions with a purveyor of Brazilian or Hungarian food who still remembers what it tasted like in the old country and who has the contents on hand to prepare it that way.",

From the start, many of the workshops were marked by disputes between representatives of nations involved in disputes, such as Iraq and Iran.

Though a large percentage of Indians living in New York and elsewhere in the United States migrated from the state of Gujarat, and though many of us are interested in preparing vegetable dishes as part of a healthy diet, the incredibly tasty vegetarian cuisine of India's Gujarat region is unfamiliar to most Americans.   I realized this when, returning by plane from a trip to that part of the world, I sat next to an Indian gentleman who told me that Gujarati cooking is ''among the most interesting in the nation.'' Oddly enough, he continued, ''you can't find a decent Gujarati restaurant in New York.''   The soil of Gujarat, which is in the western part of the country, is very rich; so, too, are the varieties of vegetables, legumes and grains cultivated in the state. This abundance suits the people well. Most are Hindus or Jains: the first do not eat beef, because they consider the cow sacred, and often avoid other meat also; the second are strict vegetarians.",

    "abstract": "  After decades of frustrating failure, scientists are reporting the first glimmers of success in their efforts to design new ''miracle crops'' for starving regions of Africa.   In recent months farmers in Zimbabwe have achieved record harvests of maize using a high-yielding hybrid laboriously developed by agricultural researchers; a new high-yielding, drought-resistant strain of sorghum has been distributed for the first time to some farmers in the Sudan; and progress has been claimed toward developing new varieties of other staple food crops in Africa.   Nobody expects a technological revolution in African agriculture overnight or believes that agricultural technology alone can solve the continent's awesome economic, political and social problems. But some optimistic scientists believe that science may ultimately be able to do for Africa what it has already helped to accomplish in much of Asia -eliminating chronic food shortages and periodic, seemingly inevitable, famines.   ''The job is going to take some time,'' said Nyle C. Brady, assistant administrator for science and technology in the Agency for International Development.",

    "abstract": "  THE CITY OF JOY By Dominique Lapierre Translated by Kathryn Spink. 464 pp. New York: Doubleday & Company. $17.95.   AN Indian proverb says that if a bag of Calcutta dust is put under the bed of a virtuous man or woman, he or she will become corrupt. But there are some, not a few, but millions, who must be exempt becuase they have no bed; they sleep on a plank laid on bricks or over a gutter, if they are lucky, or on the pavement or any space they can find. These are the refugees from Bangladesh, Bihar, Assam or the refugees from their own countryside, who flock into the city, adding themselves to its already swarming poor.   Calcutta was built for exploitation, but for farily benevolent exploitation, not virulent as it is now. ''If it was possible to steal the air we breathe, there'd be people in Calcutta prepared to do it,'' one character says, quoting Ram Chander. He is a wise and generous rickshaw puller, one of the innumerable lesser characters of ''The City of Joy,'' Dominique Lapierre's new book in the nonfiction historical genre he and Larry Collis, used in such popular successes as ''Is Paris Burning?'' about the liberation of Paris and ''Freedom at Midnight,'' about the partition of India.",

''It's your Woodstock,'' the singer Joan Baez told the crowd in John F. Kennedy Stadium. Seventeen-year-old Tom Teter of Vineland, N.J., agreed:   ''It's our Woodstock and it's just as good.''   There was abundant reason for the comparison. The organizers of Live Aid consciously harkened to the 1969 festival, a counterculture conclave that led Abbie Hoffman to coin the term ''Woodstock Nation'' for America's young. And certainly Live Aid as an event, a spectacle, addressed the desire of many fans - people in their teens or 20's who know Woodstock as an icon of the decade they worship - to enact their vision of the 1960's.   But if Woodstock was the obvious point of reference for the mammoth Live Aid shows in Philadelphia and London - seen by 162,000 fans in Kennedy and Wembley Stadiums and an estimated 1.5 billion on a worldwide television broadcast - it was not necessarily the right one. If anything, the distance from a rain-soaked dairy farm in Bethel, N.Y., to a state-of-the-art stage in Philadelphia is measured in much more than 16 years and a few hundred miles.",

Farm Aid - as Sunday's 12-hour concert and broadcast from Urbana, Ill., is called - comes only two months after the Live Aid concerts, which have raised more than $60 million for Ethiopian famine relief.   Next week will also see the release of ''Sun City,'' a benefit single for the anti-apartheid movement, which features Bruce Springsteen, Miles Davis and dozens of other performers. Popular music is also raising money for such causes as the Greenpeace Foundation and teen-age suicide prevention. Farm Aid addresses a more local and more partisan issue - the American family farm - than did Live Aid, but the concert itself will be modeled on the Live Aid shows.",

The program, announced here on Monday at the joint meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, would largely be available for drought-stricken countries of sub-Saharan Africa.   One aim of the new lending pool apparently is to provide the type of emergency funds that the I.M.F. is accustomed to providing, but without the same short payback requirements and without the austerity measures that would restrict economic potential.      Broad New Approach    The establishment of the special fund is in line with a new approach to third world lending that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d planned to outline in a speech to the meeting's delegates this afternoon.   At a news conference this morning he said that, in addition to supporting the new special fund, he also would be recommending an ''enhanced'' role for the World Bank.",

The cashew-sized silkworms, a not uncommon food in China, were singularly appropriate. Mr. Shamash had just signed a joint venture with the China Silk Corporation, one of the biggest of the state-owned enterprises. It produces silk in 27 of China's 29 provinces and employs 50 million workers.    Mr. Shamash and his Western partner in the Dalien venture, Courtaulds Ltd., of London, each agreed to invest $1.5 million to set up a dyeing and finishing plant in China for tussah silk, a rough-textured fabric used for blazers and other sportswear. His family-owned trading company, S. Shamash & Sons Inc., of New York, will market the fabric to apparel makers worldwide. Courtaulds, an old-line British textile producer, is supplying the manufacturing and technical skill.",

There were no hospital gowns and no one watching dials for vital signs, just a few small trays of instruments on the cloth next to the boy.   When the last stitch was tied, the doctor performing the operation, Paul Ickx, a volunteer with Doctors Without Borders, a Paris-based organization, slowly stood up to his full 6 feet. He removed his gloves, washed and walked to a nearby building that he shares with the three nurses on the staff.   The doctor, 31 years old, has cropped black hair, small metal-rimmed glasses and a drooping mustache.",

Longowal, president of the Sikhs' major political party, the Akali Dal, had spent the earlier part of the day in the state capital of Chandigarh, where he conferred with party colleagues on how to contest state and parliamentary elections that Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had ordered for late September.   The elections were intended to restore political normalcy in a state where, for the last four years, confrontations between Government security forces and militant Sikh separatists have fostered an atmosphere of growing tension, uncertainty and violence. On July 24, Longowal had signed a historic accord with Prime Minister Gandhi under which the Indian Government conceded a number of longstanding Sikh demands concerning regional autonomy. In return, Longowal committed himself to finding a peaceful solution to the Punjab's problems within the framework of the Indian Constitution.   Longowal, a 54-year-old man with a long beard and a gentle face, bowed before the Granth Sahib, Sikhism's bible, and began speaking to the mostly Sikh congregation, urging reconciliation between Sikhs and Hindus.",

    "abstract": "  IN FEBRUARY OF 1935, MY FATHER, ADAM Kaufman, jumped bail, and carrying skis he did not know how to use, he slid and stumbled from his native Poland into temporary sanctuary in Czechoslovakia.   This summer, after 50 years, my 82-year-old father came back, to visit me in Warsaw.   In the half century of his absence, Poland's borders have shifted some 200 miles to the west; my father's nationality, the Jews of Poland, have been killed or have fled; and though, in his day it was Communists who were hunted and imprisoned as dissidents, today a Communist government hunts and imprisons others. Yet, though the demographics have changed radically and the landscape has been altered by war and time, there is much in the conspiratorial and romantic culture of contemporary Poland that my father found movingly familiar.  At the outset, I think I am obliged to declare myself. From an intimately subjective perspective, this story begins on a subway train in 1946, when my mother and father and I were returning home from visiting friends in Brooklyn. During the evening, my father had used the Polish verb ''to sit'' in a way I had never heard it used before. ''Yes, I sat with him,'' he had said, or, ''We sat there for two years.'' On the train home, I timidly asked him did that mean he had been in jail. Very gently, he said yes, that in another time, in another place, he had been a Communist revolutionary and that he had spent nine and a half years in jail between the time he was 22 and 33 years old.",
