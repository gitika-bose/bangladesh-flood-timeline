    "lead_paragraph": "LONDON today is radiant and self-aware, no longer seeming like a venerated museum the whole world feels obliged to visit because it is so cutely Olde Worlde. Even grumpy Londoners like myself, who have to grapple with these pilgrims, now concede that there is something exhilarating in the air, and that it is qualitatively different from the 80's, when shallow yuppies seemed dangerously close to taking over the metropolis. What we are witnessing feels portentous, a key historical juncture that tomorrow's scribes will look back on and note. In her diary entry for May 26, 1926, Virginia Woolf wrote: ''London is enchanting. I step out upon a tawny coloured magic carpet and get carried into beauty.'' Today she would look down on a place less beautiful, perhaps; infinitely more unsettling, at times like Babel, yet magnetically attractive and engaging.",

I plan to make the spicy corn fritters ''adapted'' from Anne Rosenzweig's Lobster Club menu. But when someone asks me where I got the recipe, I'll say it's from an anonymous Bangladeshi chef.",
