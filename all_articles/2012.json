    "text": "From Bangladesh to Rochester, With a Missed Connection\n2012-04-24T12:00:01.000Z\n\u201cThe Newlyweds,\u201d Nell Freudenberger\u2019s affecting if sometimes ungainly new novel, starts off as a sort of high-concept Hollywood movie, mashing up the familiar fish-out-of-water story line with a girl-torn-between-two-boys plot. What all feels a bit like a paint-by-numbers exercise, however, gradually opens out into a genuinely moving story about a woman trying to negotiate two cultures, balancing her parents\u2019 expectations with her own aspirations, her ambition and cynical practicality with deeper, more romantic yearnings.\nThe premise is this: Amina, a determined young Bangladeshi, meets an older American man named George on an online dating site; they e-mail for 11 months before meeting, and she eventually moves to America and marries him. It is more like the arranged marriage of Amina\u2019s grandparents than like her parents\u2019 love match. \nNot all that surprisingly, there is little chemistry between the newlyweds, and during a trip home Amina realizes that she still loves Nasir, a family friend and her teenage crush. At the same time her new suburban life in Rochester represents the American dream she and her parents have spent years fantasizing about, and she wages a fierce campaign to bring her mother and father to the States. \nThe novel grew out of a story called \u201cAn Arranged Marriage,\u201d which appeared in The New Yorker\u2019s \u201c20 Under 40\u201d fiction issue in 2010 and was originally inspired, Ms. Freudenberger said in a New Yorker interview, by a young woman she met on an airplane who had just come to the United States from Bangladesh to marry an American man she\u2019d met on the Internet. In the acknowledgements to this novel, Ms. Freudenberger thanks Farah Deeba Munni for sharing her story (and making introductions to her family in Dhaka and Haibatpur and her husband in the States) and for \u201cgiving me the freedom to make something entirely different\u201d from it. \nMs. Freudenberger dealt with similar cross-cultural themes \u2014 Americans abroad, or foreigners visiting the United States \u2014 in her debut collection of stories, \u201cLucky Girls,\u201d and her first novel, \u201cThe Dissident.\u201d Here, she avoids sentimentalizing her characters, but she also initially fails to give us much insight into their inner lives. As a result they emerge in the first part of the novel as brittle stick figures who are more annoying than compelling. \nAmina comes across as a calculating fortune seeker, willing to marry a man with whom she enjoys no emotional or sexual connection simply to get to the United States, while George comes across as a fussbudget loser, whose chief appeal rests in his ability to help a poor foreigner get a green card, and eventually, an American passport. \nAmina finds sex with George unpleasant or tolerable at best. She often thinks that he doesn\u2019t know who she is, and she comes to believe that much of his past will always remain a mystery. For that matter, both Amina and George turn out to be keeping major secrets from each other \u2014 secrets about earlier romantic attachments that they have not completely put behind them.\nAlthough Ms. Freudenberger\u2019s account lacks the precision and emotional detail that, say, Jhumpa Lahiri has brought to her descriptions of Bengali immigrants adapting to life in the American suburbs, she works hard to chronicle with sympathy and humor Amina\u2019s efforts to master the new protocols of daily life in Rochester.\nAmina learns to shovel snow, passes her driver\u2019s test, gets a job at Starbucks, studies for her citizenship exam. She talks to her mother nearly every day and thinks about trying to put off having a baby until her mother arrives to help her. \nShe also thinks about making plans for a proper Muslim wedding \u2014 which she\u2019s promised her parents she would have, in addition to the civil ceremony \u2014 but keeps putting it off. She has a hard time understanding the American concept of sarcasm, of meaning the opposite of what the words suggest.\nWhere \u201cThe Newlyweds\u201d comes alive is in the second half, when Amina returns to Bangladesh to try to obtain American visas for her increasingly unstable mother and her hapless father, who has had one business disaster after another. Writing about a foreign country seems to kick Ms. Freudenberger\u2019s gift for observation into high gear, and she does a visceral job of conjuring the place where Amina grew up: the countryside \u201cso green that you almost expected to look up and see a green sun in the sky; the city streets, hazardous with mobs and rickshaws and pools of black sewage. \nHere there are roaches in the hospital corridors and the danger of violent assaults in which acid is thrown at an enemy. But here there is also a dense network of extended family, family friends and neighbors, a support system in the face of the swirling whirlpools of fortune. \nMore important, Ms. Freudenberger captures in these later pages Amina\u2019s confusion, her sense of being caught between two cultures, of having become someone who is regarded as an outsider in both her new adopted country and the country she still thinks of as home. \nIn America she is seen as uptight and overly worried about propriety and appearances; in Bangladesh she is seen as the headstrong one \u201cwho\u2019d done everything her own way.\u201d She is nostalgic for her girlhood but suffocated by her gossipy, competitive and overprotective relatives; flooded with fond memories of her youth, but also newly aware \u2014 as a now cosseted American \u2014 of the inconveniences, dangers and frustrations of life in Bangladesh.\nA cousin congratulates Amina on escaping the provinciality and poverty there and achieving \u201cthe dream life in America,\u201d and yet when Amina sees her teenage crush, Nasir, she feels all the ardor and intensity that is lacking in her marriage to George and wonders what sort of life she and Nasir might have had together \u2014 might still have, if he reciprocates her feelings.\nThe Amina-Nasir relationship and Amina\u2019s relationship with her aging parents are the nucleus of this novel and reveal the contradictions deep within Amina\u2019s own heart. Unlike her synthetic partnership with George, these are real, complex, deeply felt connections that have both endured and changed over time, and in depicting them Ms. Freudenberger demonstrates her assurance as a novelist and her knowledge of the complicated arithmetic of familial love and the mathematics of romantic passion.

    "text": "Deciding Where Future Disasters Will Strike\n2012-11-03T18:51:57.000Z\nWE all have an intuitive sense of how water works: block it, and it flows elsewhere. When a storm surge hits a flood barrier, for instance, the water does not simply dissipate. It does the hydrological equivalent of a bounce, and it lands somewhere else. \nThe Dutch, after years of beating back the oceans, have a way of deciding what is worth saving with a dike or sea wall, and what is not. They simply run the numbers, and if something is worth less in terms of pure euros and cents, it is more acceptable to let it be flooded. This seems entirely reasonable. But as New York begins considering coastal defenses, it should also consider the uncomfortable truth that Wall Street is worth vastly more, in dollar terms, than certain low-lying neighborhoods of Brooklyn, Staten Island and Queens \u2014 and that to save Manhattan, planners may decide to flood some other part of the city. \nI think I was the only journalist who witnessed the March 2009 unveiling of some of the first proposed sea-wall designs. \u201cAgainst the Deluge: Storm Surge Barriers to Protect New York City\u201d was a conference held at N.Y.U.\u2019s Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn, and it had the sad air of what was then an entirely lost cause. There was a single paying exhibitor \u2014 \u201cPlease visit our exhibitor,\u201d implored the organizers \u2014 whose invention, FloodBreak, was an ingenious, self-deploying floodgate big enough to protect a garage but not at all big enough to protect Manhattan. When we lined up for the included dinner, which consisted of cold spaghetti, the man waved fliers at the passing engineers. But as I look back over my notes, I can see how prescient the conference was. A phrase I frequently scrawled is \u201cBreezy Point.\u201d \nOne speaker got a sustained ovation. He was an engineer from the Dutch company Arcadis, whose $6.5 billion design is one with which I suspect we will all soon be familiar. It is a modular wall spanning 6,000 feet across the weakest point in New York\u2019s natural defenses, the Narrows, which separates Staten Island and Brooklyn. Its main feature is a giant swinging gate modeled on the one that protects Rotterdam, Europe\u2019s most important port. Consisting of two steel arms, each more than twice as long as the Statue of Liberty is tall, Rotterdam\u2019s gate is among the largest moving structures on earth. And New York\u2019s barrier would stretch across an even larger reach of water \u2014 \u201can extra landmark\u201d for the city, he said triumphantly. That\u2019s when everyone began clapping.\nThe engineers in the room did not shy away from the hard truth that areas outside a Narrows barrier could see an estimated two feet of extra flooding. If a wave rebounding off the new landmark hits a wave barreling toward it, it could make for a bigger wave of the sort that neighborhoods like Arrochar and Midland Beach on Staten Island and Bath Beach and Gravesend in Brooklyn may want to start fretting about. \nI attended the conference not just because I was interested in the fate of New York, my onetime home, but because I was recently back from parts of Bangladesh decimated by a cyclone. By now it is commonplace to point out that climate change is unfair, that it tends to leave the big \u201cemitter countries\u201d in good shape \u2014 think Russia or Canada or, until recently, America \u2014 while preying on the low-emitting, the poor, the weak, the African, the tropical. But more grossly unfair is the notion that, in lieu of serious carbon cuts, we will all simply adapt to climate change. Manhattan can and increasingly will. Rotterdam can and has. Dhaka or Chittagong or Breezy Point patently cannot. If a system of sea walls is built around New York, its estimated $10 billion price tag would be five times what rich countries have given in aid to help poorer countries prepare for a warmer world. \nWhether climate change caused Sandy\u2019s destruction is a question for scientists \u2014 and in many ways it\u2019s a stupid question, akin to asking whether gravity is the reason an old house collapsed when it did. The global temperature can rise another 10 degrees, and the answer will always be: sorta. By deciding to adapt to climate change \u2014 a decision that has already been partly made, because significant warming is already baked into the system \u2014 we have decided to embrace a world of walls.\nSome people, inevitably richer people, will be on the right side of these walls. Other people will not be \u2014 and that we might find it increasingly convenient to lose all sight of them is the change I fear the most. This is not an argument against saving New York from the next hurricane. It is, however, an argument for a response to this one that is much broader than the Narrows.",

    "text": "Bangladesh Finds Gross Negligence in Factory Fire\n2012-12-17T20:51:18.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Criminal charges for \u201cunpardonable negligence\u201d should be brought against the owner of the Bangladesh garment factory where a fire killed 112 people last month, according to a preliminary report from a government inquiry submitted Monday.\n\u201cThe owner of the factory cannot be indemnified from the death of large numbers of workers from this fire,\u201d Main Uddin Khandaker, the official who led the inquiry, said in an interview. \u201cUnpardonable negligence of the owner is responsible for the death of workers.\u201d \nThe Nov. 24 fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory, where workers were making clothes for global retailers like Walmart and Sears, has focused attention on the unsafe work conditions and low wages at many garment factories in Bangladesh, the No. 2 exporter of apparel after China. The fire also has exposed flaws in the system that monitors the industry\u2019s global supply chain: Walmart and Sears say they had no idea their apparel was being made there.\nMr. Khandaker submitted a 214-page report to Bangladesh\u2019s Home Ministry on Monday, blaming the factory owner, Delowar Hossain, for negligence and saying that nine of his midlevel managers and supervisors prevented employees from leaving their sewing machines even after a fire alarm sounded. \nMr. Hossain could not be reached for comment.\nThe report also stated that the fire was \u201can act of sabotage,\u201d but it did not provide any evidence.\nSome labor advocates found that explanation unconvincing. \u201cThey don\u2019t say who did it, they don\u2019t say where in the factory it was done, they don\u2019t say how they learned it,\u201d said Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a monitoring group in Washington. \u201cRegardless of what sparked the fire, it is clear that the unsafe nature of this factory and the actions taken by management once the fire started were the primary contributors to the horrendous death toll.\u201d\nBangladeshi officials have been under intense domestic and international pressure to investigate the blaze and charge those deemed responsible. Families of the victims have demanded legal action against Mr. Hossain. Labor advocates have argued that the global brands using the factory also shared in the responsibility for the tragedy.\nFires have been a persistent problem in Bangladesh\u2019s garment industry for more than a decade, with hundreds of workers killed over the years. Mr. Khandaker said his inquiry recommended the creation of a government task force to oversee regular inspections of factories and uphold the rights of workers. \nBangladesh has more than 4,500 garment factories, which employ more than four million workers, many of them young women. The industry is crucial to the national economy as a source of employment and foreign currency. Garments constitute about four-fifths of the country\u2019s manufacturing exports, and the industry is expected to grow rapidly.\nBut Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing formula depends on keeping wages low and restricting the rights of workers. The minimum wage in the garment industry is $37 a month, unions are almost nonexistent, and garment workers have taken to the streets in recent years in sometimes violent protests over wages and work conditions.\nWorkers at Tazreen Fashions had staged small demonstrations in the months before the fire, demanding wages they were owed. On the night of the fire, more than 1,150 people were inside the eight-story building, working overtime shifts to fill orders for various international brands. Fire officials say the fire broke out in the open-air ground floor, where large mounds of fabric and yarn were illegally stored; Bangladeshi law requires that such flammable materials be stored in a room with fireproof walls. \nThe blaze quickly spread across the length of the ground floor \u2014 roughly the size of a football field \u2014 as fire and toxic smoke filtered up through the building\u2019s three staircases. The factory lacked a sprinkler system or an outdoor fire escape; employees were supposed to use interior staircases, and many escaped that way. \nBut on some floors, managers ordered workers to ignore a fire alarm and stay to work. Precious minutes were lost. Then, as smoke and fire spread throughout the building, many workers were trapped, unable to descend the smoke-filled staircases and blocked from escape by iron grilles on many windows. Desperate workers managed to break open some windows and leap to the roof of a nearby building and safety. Others simply jumped from upper floors to the ground.\n\u201cWe have also found unpardonable negligence of midlevel officials at the factory,\u201d Mr. Khandaker said. \u201cThey prevented workers from coming down. We recommend taking proper legal measures against them.\u201d\nMr. Khandaker listed a host of violations at Tazreen Fashions: managers on some floors closed collapsible gates to block workers from running down the staircases, the ground-floor warehouse was illegal and the building\u2019s escape plan improper, and the factory lacked a required closed-circuit television monitoring system. None of the fire extinguishers in the factory appeared to have been used on the night of the fire, suggesting poor preparedness and training.\nMoreover, Mr. Khandaker said, the factory lacked a required fire safety certificate. It had applied for an annual renewal, but a certificate had not yet been issued.\nAsked about the allegation of sabotage, Mr. Khandaker said that investigators had found no evidence of an electrical short circuit, and that eyewitnesses had suggested possible foul play. He said the report recommended a full criminal investigation into the matter.\n\u201cIt seems to us that it was sabotage,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody set the fire.\u201d",

    "text": "Fatal Fire in Bangladesh Highlights the Dangers Facing Garment Workers\n2012-11-25T08:44:47.000Z\nMUMBAI, India \u2014 More than 100 people died Saturday and Sunday in a fire at a garment factory outside Dhaka, Bangladesh, in one of the worst industrial tragedies in that country.\nIt took firefighters all night to put out the blaze at the factory, Tazreen Fashions, after it started about 7 p.m. on Saturday, a retired fire official said by telephone from Dhaka, the capital. At least 111 people were killed, and scores of workers were taken to hospitals for treatment of burns and smoke inhalation.\n\u201cThe main difficulty was to put out the fire; the sufficient approach road was not there,\u201d said the retired official, Salim Nawaj Bhuiyan, who now runs a fire safety company in Dhaka. \u201cThe fire service had to take great trouble to approach the factory.\u201d\nBangladesh\u2019s garment industry, the second-largest exporter of clothing after China, has a notoriously poor fire safety record. Since 2006, more than 500 Bangladeshi workers have died in factory fires, according to Clean Clothes Campaign, an anti-sweatshop advocacy group in Amsterdam. Experts say many of the fires could have easily been avoided if the factories had taken the right precautions. Many factories are in cramped neighborhoods and have too few fire escapes, and they widely flout safety measures. The industry employs more than three million workers in Bangladesh, most of them women.\nActivists say that global clothing brands like Tommy Hilfiger and the Gap and those sold by Walmart need to take responsibility for the working conditions in Bangladeshi factories that produce their clothes.\n\u201cThese brands have known for years that many of the factories they choose to work with are death traps,\u201d Ineke Zeldenrust, the international coordinator for the Clean Clothes Campaign, said in a statement. \u201cTheir failure to take action amounts to criminal negligence.\u201d\nIn a statement from the United States, Wal-Mart said, \u201cWhile we are trying to determine if the factory has a current relationship with Walmart or one of our suppliers, fire safety is a critically important area of Walmart\u2019s factory audit program and we have been working across the apparel industry to improve fire safety education and training in Bangladesh.\u201d\nThe fire at the Tazreen factory in Savar, northwest of Dhaka, started in a warehouse on the ground floor that was used to store yarn, and quickly spread to the upper floors. The building was nine stories high, with the top three floors under construction, according to a garment industry official at the scene who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. Though most workers had left for the day when the fire started, the industry official said, as many as 600 workers were still inside working overtime.\nThe factory, which opened in May 2010, employed about 1,500 workers and had sales of $35 million a year, according to a document on the company\u2019s Web site. It made T-shirts, polo shirts and fleece jackets.\nMost of the workers who died were on the first and second floors, fire officials said, and were killed because there were not enough exits. \u201cSo the workers could not come out when the fire engulfed the building,\u201d said Maj. Mohammad Mahbub, the operations director for the Fire Department, according to The Associated Press.\nIn a telephone interview later on Sunday, Major Mahbub said the fire could have been caused by an electrical fault or by a spark from a cigarette.\nIn a brief phone call, Delowar Hossain, the managing director of the Tuba Group, the parent company of Tazreen Fashions, said he was too busy to comment. \u201cPray for me,\u201d he said and then hung up.\nTelevision news reports showed badly burned bodies lined up on the floor in what appeared to be a government building. The injured were being treated in hallways of local hospitals, according to the reports.\nThe industry official said that many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition and that it would take some time to identify them.\nOne survivor, Mohammad Raju, 22, who worked on the fifth floor, said he escaped by climbing out of a third-floor window onto the bamboo scaffolding that was being used by construction workers. He said he lost his mother, who also worked on the fifth floor, when they were making their way down.\n\n9 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\n\u201cIt was crowded on the stairs as all the workers were trying to come out from the factory,\u201d Mr. Raju said. \u201cThere was no power supply; it was dark, and I lost my mother in dark. I tried to search for her for 10 to 15 minutes but did not find her.\u201d\nA document posted on Tazreen Fashions\u2019 Web site indicated that an \u201cethical sourcing\u201d official for Walmart had flagged \u201cviolations and/or conditions which were deemed to be high risk\u201d at the factory in May 2011, though it did not specify the nature of the infractions. The notice said that the factory had been given an \u201corange\u201d grade and that any factories given three such assessments in two years from their last audit would not receive any Walmart orders for a year.\nA spokesman for Walmart, Kevin Gardner, said the company was \u201cso far unable to confirm that Tazreen is a supplier to Walmart nor if the document referenced in the article is in fact from Walmart.\u201d\nBut the International Labor Rights Forum, which tracks fires in the Bangladesh garment industry, said documents and logos found in the debris indicated that the factory produced clothes for Walmart\u2019s Faded Glory line as well as for other American and foreign companies.\nBangladesh exports about $18 billion worth of garments a year. Employees in the country\u2019s factories are among the world\u2019s lowest-paid, with entry-level workers making the government-mandated minimum wage of about $37 a month or slightly above.\nTensions have been running high between workers, who have been demanding an increase in minimum wages, and the factory owners and government. A union organizer, Aminul Islam, who campaigned for better working conditions and higher wages, was found tortured and killed outside Dhaka this year.",

    "text": "Garment Workers Stage Angry Protest After Bangladesh Fire\n2012-11-26T16:42:22.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Thousands of Bangladeshi garment workers staged angry protests on Monday, demanding justice after at least 112 people died over the weekend in a fire at a factory on the outskirts of Dhaka where labor advocates found the charred remains of clothing from brands sold at global retailers like Walmart.\nThe protests paralyzed much of the Ashulia area, an important industrial belt north of Dhaka, the capital, as workers blocked roads, prompting some factories to close for the day. A second garment factory in a different part of Dhaka was engulfed in flames on Monday morning. By afternoon, the second fire had been brought under control without any casualties being reported.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina offered prayers and sympathy for the families of the dead as her cabinet declared that Tuesday would be a day of national mourning. At the same time, she voiced suspicions that the fires were arsons intended to undermine the country\u2019s garment industry. Without presenting any evidence of a broader conspiracy, she called for vigilance against sabotage.\nThe prime minister on Monday issued a call in Parliament to detain those who were \u201ccarrying out subversive activities\u201d and to \u201ctake necessary actions against the culprits,\u201d according to BSS, a state-owned news agency.\nShe said two workers were arrested over the weekend after attempting to set fire to another factory in the Dhaka area.\nThe weekend fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory ranks as one of Bangladesh\u2019s worst industrial disasters. Witnesses described a desperate scene, as workers leapt from the upper floors of the factory, trying to land on nearby rooftops and escape the smoke and flames. Others suffocated inside the factory building, as the blaze apparently rendered stairwells impassable.\nKalpona Akter, a Bangladeshi labor leader, said she toured the factory after the fire was extinguished and found labels for a variety of global retailers, including Faded Glory, a brand she said was manufactured for Walmart. Ms. Akter said she also found labels for brands sold at leading European retailers.\n\u201cThese international, Western brands have a lot of responsibility for these fire issues,\u201d said Ms. Akter, the executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity. \u201cIn this factory, there was a pile of fabrics and yarn stored on the ground floor that caught fire. Workers couldn\u2019t evacuate through the stairs. What does this say about compliance?\u201d\nOn Monday, Walmart said that the \u201cTazreen factory was no longer authorized to produce merchandise for Walmart,\u201d but confirmed that one of its suppliers had \u201csubcontracted\u201d work to the factory without authorization. The company said that it was immediately terminating its relationship with the supplier. \nA document posted on the Web site of Tazreen Fashions appeared to be an inspection complaint by Walmart. In the document, an \u201cethical sourcing\u201d official flagged violations at the factory in May 2011, without detailing the problems. \nThe company that owns the factory indicated on its Web site that it had received a stamp of approval from an organization, Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production, that is enlisted by many Western retailers and manufacturers to certify that their suppliers are meeting certain standards. But in an interview, Avedis Seferian, the chief executive of the accreditation organization, said that claim was incorrect. \n\u201cThis particular factory has never been WRAP-certified,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been to that factory.\u201d \n\n9 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nBangladesh is a garment powerhouse, with more than $18 billion a year in exports, ranking second behind China. More than three million workers are employed in the country\u2019s 4,500 garment factories, most of them women. The industry has become an essential engine for the domestic economy, and a critical source of foreign currency that helps the government pay for imported oil.\nBut Bangladesh\u2019s garment industry has also attracted rising international and domestic criticism over a poor fire safety record, low wages and policies that restrict labor organizing inside factories. The Clean Clothes Campaign, a European group that opposes sweatshops, said that more than 500 Bangladeshi laborers had died in factory fires since 2006. In 2010, 29 workers died from a fire inside a Bangladeshi factory making clothing for Tommy Hilfiger.\nGarment factories across Bangladesh are expected to close on Tuesday for the day of mourning, as flags will be flown at half-staff around the country. Meanwhile, many family members of workers at the Tazreen factory are continuing to search for loved ones. Some victims were burned beyond recognition.\nNur Alam, 30, had been searching for his older brother, Anwar Hossain, since the fire erupted on Saturday. \u201cI went inside the factory with some officials on Sunday,\u201d Mr. Alam said. \u201cI saw the remains of three people. It was impossible to identify them.\u201d\nThe police were continuing to investigate the blaze. Delowar Hossain, the managing director of the parent group of Tazreen Fashions, could not be reached for comment on Monday.\nThe second fire broke out on Monday morning on a lower floor of a 12-story building that included three separate garment factories in the Uttara area of Dhaka. Muhammad Mahboob, a fire official, said an electrical spark in the building\u2019s generator on a lower floor might have caused the fire. He said a dozen fire trucks reached the building quickly and doused the blaze within an hour, containing the damage to a single floor. ",

High Commissioner for Refugees. It seeks both to support new education efforts and to improve existing ones, especially those tied to getting more girls into schools. \n\u201cMillions of children are being robbed of their fundamental right to quality education,\u201d Sheika Moza said at the conference, which was sponsored by the Qatar Foundation. \u201cRight across the world, because of disaster, because of poverty, children are being denied a chance to change their destinies. We can change this, and because we can, we must.\u201d \nThe groups together plan to invest $152.6 million on 25 projects in 17 countries over the next three to seven years, with an emphasis on some of the world\u2019s poorest communities, conflict zones and nomadic societies. These initiatives include \u201cfloating boat\u201d schools that serve as both bus and schoolhouse for poor children in the flood-prone delta of the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh and efforts to provide primary education for children in refugee camps in South Sudan. \nA spokeswoman for Sheika Moza declined to say how much Educate a Child was investing in the venture. \nGordon Brown, the former British prime minister who is the United Nations\u2019 special envoy for education, said at the announcement in Doha that Educate a Child\u2019s efforts tied directly into the U.N. Millennium Development Goals on education. He added that the U.N. would have a plan in place by April for countries not on track to meet those goals. \n\u201cIt\u2019s our duty to make sure resources are allocated to meet this objective, and it\u2019s important that new organizations and foundations are willing to support this,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cSheika Moza is the catalyst to ensure that we can and we will accomplish the U.N. development goal objective.\u201d \nRakesh Bharti Mittal, vice chairman and managing director of the Indian conglomerate Bharti Enterprises, was also present at the announcement. \n\u201cI firmly believe that if you educate a girl, you educate a family,\u201d said Mr. Mittal, who is also chairman of the Bharti Foundation, an Educate a Child partner. \u201cYou educate future generations.\u201d \nThough Educate a Child was formally announced last week, the foundation said that it started financing initiatives last spring and had reached 500,000 children so far. \u201cFor me, this is not enough,\u201d Sheika Moza said.

    "text": "The Truth About Foreign Aid\n2012-01-26T14:11:32.000Z\nLast week, Oxfam and Save the Children released a report saying that emergency relief in the Horn of Africa came months late, costing thousands of lives and millions of dollars. Oxfam and Save the Children conclude that humanitarian assistance should be done differently. The anti-foreign aid establishment is using the report to argue that aid doesn\u2019t work and should be cut across the board.\nThe very fact that $2.1 billion has been donated to help the victims of the famine is a testament to human beings\u2019 generosity. But that fact of our generosity also explains why I am so frustrated by the increasing opposition in many rich countries to foreign aid. \nWe know people care about the suffering of others. Not only that. They are willing to express their caring by making significant donations, even in very hard times. So what keeps them from supporting government investments to alleviate extreme suffering?\nAccording to public opinion research, many people believe aid is either stolen by corrupt leaders or wasted on ineffective programs. Naturally, no one is eager to make investments they\u2019re convinced won\u2019t pay off. \nThere is also the argument that aid doesn\u2019t work even when it gets to its intended recipients. This claim is not convincing either. In the past 50 years, the number of children who die every year has gone down from 20 million to fewer than 8 million. Meanwhile, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has declined by more than half. These massive improvements are due in large part to aid-funded programs to buy vaccines and boost farmers\u2019 productivity. \nI am confident that we can get the price of AIDS drugs down to $300 per person per year in the very near future. That will mean that every $300 a country gives to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and malaria represents a person who will stay alive for another year. Every $300 that\u2019s not forthcoming represents a human being who will almost certainly die. That is a stark but realistic way to think about the choices we\u2019re making when we debate aid budgets.\nMy hope is that we can convert some of the generosity that goes into humanitarian relief into stronger support for foreign aid programs. \nMany of those suffering in the Horn of Africa were going hungry before there was a recognized emergency in the region. In fact, more than 1 billion people in the world don\u2019t have enough food to eat.\nOne of the most powerful solutions to this problem is to help poor farmers get more out of their tiny plots of land. In parts of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa especially, farmers plant low-yielding seeds, climate change is starting to shrink their harvests, and plant diseases are invading their fields. \nNew seeds and other tools can help farmers cope with these challenges. For example, my foundation helped fund the development of a variety of rice that can survive flooding and will feed an extra 30 million people every year in Bangladesh and India. That additional rice will not only prevent starvation but also help farmers earn more so they can take sick children to the doctor and pay school fees.\nThe question is, how do we continue to do the research needed to develop these new tools? Poor countries are investing more in their own agricultural sectors, but they don\u2019t have the resources to lead on R&D. Aid is a key piece of the puzzle, and right now the entire research budget of the group responsible for agricultural science for the poorest is just $300 million per year. It\u2019s a shame to see such a high-leverage opportunity generate such ambivalence.\nI am proud to live in a world where a stranger\u2019s suffering matters. Yet foreign aid, the best way to address that suffering, has a growing legion of critics. That is a contradiction we must remedy, and the best way to do it is to tell the truth about aid. \n  Bill Gates is co-chairman of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. ",

    "text": "In Poll, Many Link Weather Extremes to Climate Change\n2012-04-18T03:55:02.000Z\nScientists may hesitate to link some of the weather extremes of recent years to global warming \u2014 but the public, it seems, is already there.\nA poll due for release on Wednesday shows that a large majority of Americans believe that this year\u2019s unusually warm winter, last year\u2019s blistering summer and some other weather disasters were probably made worse by global warming. And by a 2-to-1 margin, the public says the weather has been getting worse, rather than better, in recent years.\nThe survey, the most detailed to date on the public response to weather extremes, comes atop other polling showing a recent uptick in concern about climate change. Read together, the polls suggest that direct experience of erratic weather may be convincing some people that the problem is no longer just a vague and distant threat.\n\u201cMost people in the country are looking at everything that\u2019s happened; it just seems to be one disaster after another after another,\u201d said Anthony A. Leiserowitz of Yale University, one of the researchers who commissioned the new poll. \u201cPeople are starting to connect the dots.\u201d\nThe poll opens a new window on public opinion about climate change.\nA large majority of climate scientists say the climate is shifting in ways that could cause serious impacts, and they cite the human release of greenhouse gases as a principal cause. But a tiny, vocal minority of researchers contests that view, and has seemed in the last few years to be winning the battle of public opinion despite slim scientific evidence for their position.\nThe poll suggests that a solid majority of the public feels that global warming is real, a result consistent with other polls that have asked the question in various ways. When invited to agree or disagree with the statement, \u201cglobal warming is affecting the weather in the United States,\u201d 69 percent of respondents in the new poll said they agreed, while 30 percent disagreed.\nDr. Leiserowitz\u2019s unit at Yale, along with researchers at George Mason University, commissioned the survey, conducted by Knowledge Networks. That company surveyed 1,008 American adults by computer in the last half of March, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\nWhile many online polls are not representative of the broad public, Knowledge Networks is noted for its efforts to overcome this problem, including giving computers to households too poor to have them. The survey reveals public attitudes that are at least roughly consistent with scientific understanding of how the climate is changing.\nFor instance, when people were asked whether they attributed specific events to global warming, recent heat waves drew the largest majorities. Scientists say their statistical evidence for an increase of weather extremes is indeed strongest when it comes to heat waves.\nAsked whether they agreed or disagreed that global warming had contributed to the unusually warm winter just past, 25 percent of the respondents said they strongly agreed that it had, and 47 percent said they somewhat agreed. Only 17 percent somewhat disagreed, and 11 percent strongly disagreed.\nMajorities almost as large cited global warming as a likely factor in last year\u2019s record summer heat wave, as well as the 2011 drought in Texas and Oklahoma. Smaller but still substantial majorities cited it as a factor in the record United States snowfalls of 2010 and 2011 and the Mississippi River floods of 2011. Those views, too, are consistent with scientific evidence, which suggests that global warming is causing heavier precipitation in all seasons.\nOne of the more striking findings was that 35 percent of the public reported being affected by extreme weather in the past year. The United States was hit in 2011 by a remarkable string of disasters affecting virtually every region, including droughts, floods, tornadoes and heat waves.\nDr. Leiserowitz said that recent events might be puncturing the public\u2019s \u201cvery simplistic mental model of what global warming is supposed to be.\u201d\nPast survey work had suggested, he said, that people tended to see the climate change problem as \u201cdistant in time and space \u2014 that this is an issue about polar bears or maybe Bangladesh, but not my community, not the United States, not my friends and family.\u201d\nBecause the survey questions are new, it is not clear how people\u2019s views about weather extremes may be changing over time. However, more general polling by the Gallup organization suggests that public concern about climate change, which has waxed and waned over the years, may be starting to rise again.\nSince 1989, Gallup has asked, \u201chow much do you personally worry about global warming?\u201d The percentage of people saying they were worried peaked at 66 percent just before the recession, then fell to a low of 51 percent in 2011, as the economy overwhelmed other concerns.\nGallup\u2019s most recent survey, in March, showed an uptick to 55 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible that this is the start of a trend back up,\u201d said Frank M. Newport, Gallup\u2019s editor in chief, though he added that another year of polling data would be necessary to be certain.\nAdvocacy groups seeking policies to limit climate change say that extreme weather is giving them an opening to reach the public.\nA group called 350.org is planning a worldwide series of rallies on May 5, under the slogan \u201cConnect the Dots,\u201d to draw attention to the links between climate change and extreme weather. (The group\u2019s name is a reference to what it views as the safe upper limit for the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.)\n\u201cMy sense from around the country and the world is that people definitely understand that things are getting freaky,\u201d said William E. McKibben, the founder of 350.org. \u201cDuring that crazy heat wave in March, everyone in Chicago was out enjoying the weather, but in the back of their mind they were thinking, this is not right.\u201d",

    "text": "Crops in India Wilt in a Weak Monsoon Season\n2012-09-03T20:47:08.000Z\nMURUMA, India \u2014 Vilas Dinkar Mukane lives halfway around the world from the corn farmers of Iowa, but the Indian sharecropper is at risk of losing his livelihood for the same reason: not enough rain.\nWith the nourishing downpours of the annual monsoon season down an average of 12 percent across India and much more in some regions, farmers in this village about 250 miles east of Mumbai are on the brink of disaster. \u201cIf this situation continues, I\u2019ll lose everything,\u201d said Mr. Mukane, whose soybean, sugarcane and cotton crops were visibly stunted and wilting in his fields recently. \u201cNothing can happen without water.\u201d\nDrought has devastated crops around the world this year, including corn and soybeans in the United States, wheat in Russia and Australia and soybeans in Brazil and Argentina. This has contributed to a 6 percent rise in global food prices from June to July, according to United Nations data. \nIndia is experiencing its fourth drought in a dozen years, raising concerns about the reliability of the country\u2019s primary source of fresh water, the monsoon rains that typically fall from June to October.\nSome scientists warn that such calamities are part of a trend that is likely to intensify in the coming decades because of climate changes caused by the human release of greenhouse gases. \nA paper published last month blamed global warming for a large increase in the percentage of the planet affected by extreme summer heat in the last several decades. And the World Meteorological Organization, a division of the United Nations, recently warned that climate change was \u201cprojected to increase the frequency, intensity and duration of droughts, with impacts on many sectors, in particular food, water and energy.\u201d\nScientists say that in addition to increasing temperatures, climate change appears to be making India and its neighbors Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh more vulnerable to erratic monsoons.\nStudies using 130 years of data show big changes in rainfall in recent decades, said B. N. Goswami, director of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, a government-backed research organization. Climate models suggest that while overall rainfall should increase in the coming decades, the region can expect longer dry spells and more intense downpours \u2014 forces that would seem to cancel each other out but in fact pose new threats. \n\u201cHeavy rains are normally short duration, and therefore the water runs off,\u201d said Dr. Goswami, who added that more research was needed to fully understand the impact of climate change on monsoons. \u201cWeak rains are important for recharging groundwater.\u201d\nIndia is more vulnerable to disruption from drought than countries like the United States. While agriculture accounts for just 15 percent of India\u2019s economy, half of its 1.2 billion people work on farms, and many of its poorest citizens already cannot afford enough food after price increases of 10 percent or more in the last couple of years.\n\u201cThese kinds of rainfall failures have a lot of human effects,\u201d said Yoginder K. Alagh, chairman of the Institute of Rural Management and a former Indian minister. \u201cA large number of people don\u2019t get employment. There are acute drinking water problems.\u201d\nFood grain and oilseed production in India could fall up to 12 percent this year as a result of poor rain, said P. K. Joshi, director for South Asia at the International Food Policy Research Institute. \nThe good news is that the drought is not likely to result in widespread famine. India has more than 76 million tons of wheat, rice and other grain in storage, in part because of government support for those crops and an export ban put in place in 2008 when global food prices shot up. But analysts expect prices for dairy, meat, lentils and vegetables to rise. \nUnlike the United States, where crop insurance and other government programs provide a safety net for farmers, India offers ad hoc and unpredictable government support, increasing the risk that legions of farmers will be wiped out. \nIf it does not rain soon, Mr. Mukane, 25, who works a field here in Muruma, said he would have to sell whatever he could to repay banks and lenders 500,000 rupees (about $9,000), much of it borrowed at an interest rate of 7 percent a month.\nWeak monsoon rains were also an underlying cause of the blackouts that cut power to half of the country in July. The paucity of water lowered the supply of power from dams that account for a fifth of electric capacity, even as consumers cranked up fans and air-conditioners and farmers ran electric pumps to draw water from wells.\nAcross the country, rainfall has been about 12 percent below long-term averages through Sept. 2. But that broad number belies the acute pain in many parts of the country. Rainfall here in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra state is down 36 percent. In parts of the north and west, it is down 13 to 72 percent. At the same time, heavy rain and flooding have displaced tens of thousands in the eastern state of Assam. \nExperts say the impact of the poor monsoon rains has been compounded by mismanagement. The chief minister of Maharashtra, Prithviraj Chavan, recently said that much of the $1.5 billion a year that the state spent on water projects appeared to have been wasted, with virtually no increase in the amount of irrigated farmland over the last decade. \nKiran Singh Pal, a government engineer who manages the irrigation system in the region, said it was poorly maintained because officials like himself had not been given enough money and staff. He also said many farmers had received no government water because so much of it was cornered by a few powerful landowners. \n\u201cWe have enough water to irrigate all the fields,\u201d Mr. Pal said. \u201cThe problem is we don\u2019t have any control.\u201d\nMr. Mukane, the sharecropper, and his neighbors said their problems were heightened because they received much less water this year from a nearby reservoir, which is so depleted that it can barely provide drinking water to Aurangabad, a city of 1.2 million. \nFederal and state officials have begun offering small types of relief for hard-hit areas, like fodder for cattle, cheap diesel fuel and subsidized seeds.\nBut Bhaurao Bhanudas Date, a 48-year-old farmer near Muruma, said that what he needed most was water. He said he expected little to no return from his sugarcane and cotton crops this year and would have to fall back on the income he earned from selling fodder and milk from his five cows. \nMr. Mukane said his father recently went to a temple to pray for rain, taking a pot of river water as an offering. The family is particularly anxious because Mr. Mukane\u2019s wife is expecting their first child, and the government usually provides relief only to landowners, not to farmers who rent land.\n\u201cWe keep looking up, hoping it will rain today,\u201d he said on a recent afternoon as clouds covered the sky. About 10 minutes later, his prayers seemed to have been answered when a light drizzle started. But it petered out after a few minutes.",

    "text": "Honoring a Life Lived Courageously\n2012-10-25T12:50:15.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 As hallowed institutions of British life \u2014 the BBC above all, but also the police and prosecutors, and hospitals and schools that should care for young people \u2014 were being sullied by the spreading scandal around the always weird Jimmy Savile, it was a moment of clarity, and hope.\nScores of people, most of them from the media, were gathered in the \u201cjournalists\u2019 church,\u201d St. Bride\u2019s, just off Fleet Street, to remember Horst Faas \u2014 a great journalist, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer and legendary photo editor for The Associated Press and, though he probably would have thought this least of all, a great German.\nShafts of light shone down on our faces, and the ravages of age, multiplied by covering wars, drinking hard and smoking plenty, showed starkly. But that was not important; coming together to honor this man was.\nThe first reading was from \u201cMy Friend Horst\u201d by the late David Halberstam, who called his friend a genius, \u201cone of the three or four best people\u201d he ever met.\nBoth Mr. Halberstam and Horst (this is how he was known; Mr. Faas just does not sound right) won Pulitzer Prizes in Vietnam, Mr. Halberstam in 1964 for written dispatches, Horst in 1965 for what the citation called \u201cdaring and courageous combat photography.\u201d Horst won a second Pulitzer, together with Michel Laurent, in 1972 for pictures from Dacca, Bangladesh. Two of the most famous images from Vietnam \u2014 Eddie Adams\u2019s 1968 picture of an execution at point-blank range in Saigon, and Nick Ut\u2019s picture of a naked girl running from a napalm attack \u2014 were sent under Horst\u2019s direction from The A.P. bureau in Saigon.\nThis was a man who survived a near-fatal injury while covering Vietnam in 1967, who saw with unusual clarity not just the picture to take, but how to live life to the full. Famous for his trenchant pronouncements in perfect but always German-accented English, he also listened uncommonly carefully, as is clear in the cadence of his written dispatches from Vietnam and his tireless later work to commemorate the many photographers \u2014 including North Vietnamese \u2014 who died covering the war.\nIndeed, in the words of the first powerful hymn we sang: \u201cWho so beset him round with dismal stories, do but themselves confound \u2014 his strength the more is. No foes shall stay his might, though he with giants fight: He will make good his right to be a pilgrim.\u201d\nHorst\u2019s extraordinary pilgrimage began in Berlin, where he was born in April 1933, just after Hitler had come to power. With his father on the Eastern front, Horst was the man of his family as they fled the Russian advance in 1945, eventually settling in Munich.\nIn 1951, he joined the Keystone press agency, where he said he learned to recognize a good photograph because he had so many hundreds of thousands to sort. He joined The A.P. in Bonn in 1955, and after covering wars in Congo and Algeria was sent to Vietnam in 1962. He semi-hung up his cameras in London in 1976, when he became The A.P.\u2019s renowned European photo editor until retiring in 2004. In Hanoi in 2005 for a Vietnam reunion, he suffered a spinal hemorrhage that left him a paraplegic \u2014 but still a determined traveler and master of sparkling phone talk.\nThis was the man we had gathered to remember in the London he loved so well that it was a picture of Horst \u2014 gray-haired, portly, but somehow always impish \u2014 on his bicycle at a London pub that greeted us at the service.\nAnd, to the point about institutions, this was a British one at its best: a beautiful church designed by Sir Christopher Wren in 1672, words and hymns ancient and modern woven together by David Meara, archdeacon of London, and a magnificent organist and choir who electrified us with everything from Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy\u201d to the Bill Withers soul hit \u201cLean On Me,\u201d topped off by a British ditty about photography that just had us erupting in unchurchlike applause.\nAfterward, of course, we went round the corner to that other great British institution, the pub. Never mind that insight about the ravages of alcohol \u2014 only a real drink would do for Horst. \nSome of his photographs were dotted around. One, taken Jan. 1, 1966, showed mothers and their children in a flooded trench, peering up in a sheer terror that crossed the decades. Horst imparted the secrets of war photography as he raised his \u201carmy\u201d \u2014 the many A.P. photographers who followed him in capturing stunning images, in war and peace. That picture from the trench seemed to illustrate his mantra: \u201cI know how not to be noticed, and how to get in the middle of things,\u201d he told the Newseum. Yet, if you want to survive: \u201cDon\u2019t get involved, don\u2019t get mixed up, don\u2019t get between the groups.\u201d\nHorst learned that kind of survival \u2014 and clarity \u2014 early, in the ruins of Hitler\u2019s Germany. Although he died in Munich, he spent most of his adult life outside Germany, and was arguably better known in America, in Britain and even in France, where photojournalism has a special place in the arts pantheon, than in his native land.\nBut as the choice of music (Beethoven, Schubert, Mahler) reflected, and as his superb administrative skill attested, he was a cultured, disciplined German. Always definite, but never \u2014 despite a reputation for sternness \u2014 dictatorial. And with great humor.\nOnce, in 1993, for the war in Bosnia, we had to order an extra-short flak jacket for a female A.P. reporter there. Horst oversaw such orders \u2014 \u201cWhat does she think this is?\u201d he barked, \u201cGiorgio Armani?\u201d\nBut Horst took the order. And, when he sent it, it came, of course, in a Giorgio Armani bag.",

    "text": "The Voters Speak: Yes to Bathrooms\n2012-04-07T01:38:20.000Z\nTHE bathrooms won. \nLast week\u2019s Metropolitan cover article, \u201cPutting In Their 2 Cents,\u201d chronicled an experiment in participatory budgeting, in which residents of each of four City Council districts decided how to spend roughly $1 million of their council member\u2019s budgets for neighborhood improvements. Voting on the proposals ended last Sunday, and votes were tallied last week. \nKeith Christiansen\u2019s project, to improve the children\u2019s bathrooms at Public School 124 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, won handily, earning 43 percent of the vote. \u201cI\u2019ve had students tell me no more holding it in,\u201d said the principal, Annabelle Martinez. \u201cThe only thing that saddens me is that we have to go through a process like this to get bathrooms that respect children.\u201d \nReworking the deadly crosswalk at Ocean Parkway and Church Avenue in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn also won, with 27 percent of the vote. But a plan to create an extensive green corridor in East Flatbush did not garner enough votes to move forward.\nParticipatory budgeting, however, is as much about involving disenfranchised members of the public as it is about financing projects, and the elections were intended to draw maximum participation. People did not have to be registered to vote to cast ballots, and citizenship status and prior criminal convictions were irrelevant. \n\u201cThis told people you could still have an opinion in your community if you\u2019ve done your time. We\u2019re not holding that against you,\u201d said Kim Lloyd, who knocked on doors in a senior citizen housing complex in East Harlem. \u201cIf you\u2019re an immigrant, you can still have an opinion in your community.\u201d \nTo further increase participation, voting took place over several days, and efforts were made to reach people in their own languages. In Kensington, for instance, where there is a large population of Bangladeshi immigrants, fliers were translated into Bengali. This outreach particularly helped bring in women in the community. \n\u201cMen felt like they have a power that they can make a choice, but for the first time the women felt like, \u2018Oh, I can do that too,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said a resident, Annie Ferdous, who translated the voter information into Bengali. \u201cThey saw the ballot in Bengali and thought, \u2018O.K., maybe I can understand and get involved.\u2019\u00a0\u201d \nIn the Rockaways, Queens, organizers focused on reaching potential voters in an area known as \u201cthe buildings,\u201d which are low-income residences, City Councilman Eric Ulrich\u2019s office said. Volunteers focused on Bay Towers, where they did mailings, made phone calls and knocked on doors to invite residents to participate. \nIn the 2009 Council election, 1 percent of district voters had annual household incomes of less than $25,000, according to data provided by the Community Development Project at the Urban Justice Center. In the participatory budget process, 10 percent of the voters were from such households.\nMeanwhile, in the district represented by Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito, which includes East Harlem, 47 percent of the voters in the budget process were Latino, compared with 39 percent who voted from that district in the 2009 Council elections \u2014 and 21 percent who voted citywide that year, according to the data from the Justice Center and exit polls conducted by Edison Research. \nIn East Flatbush, staff members in Councilman Jumaane Williams\u2019s office said they were surprised that the largest number of votes came from Flatbush Gardens, a low-income housing complex. The polling site was near where people pick up mail and do laundry. \n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping some of these methods translate into traditional civic engagement mechanisms,\u201d said Sondra Youdelman, executive director of Community Voices Heard, a group that helps mobilize low-income New Yorkers and that worked on outreach for the budgeting vote. \nOver all, the winning projects reflected the concerns, and the mobilization efforts, in the communities. \nIn Ms. Mark-Viverito\u2019s Eighth Council District, which also includes the Upper West Side and Mott Haven, the Bronx, the proposal getting the most votes will benefit the elderly ($100,000 for Meals-on-Wheels vans), but voters also chose playground improvements in public housing complexes ($500,000). \nIn Mr. Ulrich\u2019s district, the volunteer fire departments can expect some new equipment: an oxygen refill system ($60,000), a water pump to help with flooding ($39,000) and pagers ($48,000). These projects are among nine that voters in the district approved, at a cost of $1.37 million. \nIn City Council District 39, which reaches from Kensington to Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn and is represented by Brad Lander, schools and environment reigned. In addition to the stall doors and other improvements to the P.S. 124 bathrooms, winners included a community composting system in Gowanus ($165,000), 100 new street trees ($100,000) and path repairs in Prospect Park ($205,000). \nSecurity was the primary concern for Mr. Williams\u2019s district, the 45th, which reaches from East Flatbush to Midwood in Brooklyn. The proposal that drew the most votes was a $400,000 plan for security cameras at seven locations.\nResidents also voted to spend $450,000 on two proposals that would add lights to each of the district\u2019s parks and the field behind the Tilden Educational Campus, where, among the shadows, classmates of Marcus Monfiston, 16, a student there, have been attacked. \nMr. Monfiston, a junior at Kurt Hahn Expeditionary Learning School at Tilden High School, plays football and baseball. He and some classmates created the proposal to add lights to their field and spent evenings convincing residents who also use the area after hours to vote for the project.\nThe son of a restaurant supervisor and a technician, Mr. Monfiston said he had wanted to be a pharmacist and a sales manager and many other things. But now that he has experienced a participatory budget cycle, his views are different. Mr. Monfiston thinks he might be drawn to politics. \n\u201cI was like, I can really make a change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just here to go to school. We can be more, do more.\u201d",

    "text": "For Asians, School Tests Are Vital Steppingstones\n2012-10-27T01:14:24.000Z\nTing Shi said his first two years in the United States were wretched. He slept in a bunk bed in the same room with his grandparents and a cousin in Chinatown, while his parents lived on East 89th Street, near a laundromat where they endured 12-hour shifts. He saw them only on Sundays.\nEven after they found an apartment together, his father often talked about taking the family back to China. So, following the advice of friends and relatives from Fuzhou, where he is from, Ting spent more than two years poring over dog-eared test prep books, attending summer and after-school classes, even going over math formulas on the walk home from school.\nThe afternoon his acceptance letter to Stuyvesant High School arrived in the mail, he and his parents gathered at the laundromat, the smell of detergent and the whirl of the washing machines filling the air. \u201cEveryone was excited,\u201d Ting recalled.\nTing\u2019s father said he felt rejuvenated, and now dismissed the idea of returning: \u201cI thought: the next generation will have a good future,\u201d he said.\nOn Saturday, more than 15,000 students are expected to file into classrooms to take a grueling 95-question test for admission to New York City\u2019s elite public high schools. (The exam on Sunday, for about 14,000 students, was postponed until Nov. 18 because of Hurricane Sandy.)\nNo one will be surprised if Asian students, who make up 14 percent of the city\u2019s public school students, once again win most of the seats, and if black and Hispanic students win few. Last school year, of the 14,415 students enrolled in the eight specialized high schools that require a test for admissions, 8,549 were Asian. \u00a0\nBecause of the disparity, some have begun calling for an end to the policy of using the test as the sole basis of admission to the schools, and last month, civil rights groups filed a complaint with the federal government, contending that the policy discriminated against students, many of whom are black or Hispanic, who cannot afford the score-raising tutoring that other students can. The Shis, like other Asian families who spoke about the exam in interviews in the past month, did not deny engaging in extensive test preparation. To the contrary, they seemed to discuss their efforts with pride.\nThey also said they were puzzled about having to defend a process they viewed as a vital steppingstone for immigrants. And more than a few saw the criticism of the test as an attack on their cultures, as troubling to them as grumblings about the growing Asian presence in these schools and the prestigious colleges they feed into. \u201cYou know: \u2018You\u2019re Asian, you must be smart,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Jan Michael Vicencio, an immigrant from Manila and a junior at Brooklyn Tech, one of the eight schools that use the test for admission. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not sure it\u2019s a compliment or an insult. We get that a lot.\u201d\nAlmost universally, the Asian students described themselves on one edge of a deep cultural chasm.\nThey cited their parents\u2019 observance of ancient belief systems like Confucianism, a set of moral principles that emphasizes scholarship and reverence for elders, as well as their rejection of child-rearing philosophies more common in the United States that emphasize confidence and general well-being.\nSeveral students said their parents did not shy away from corporal punishment as a means of motivating them. And they said that rigorous testing was generally an accepted practice in their home countries, with the tests viewed not so much as measures of intelligence, but of industriousness.\n\u201cMost of our parents don\u2019t believe in \u2018gifted,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Riyan Iqbal, 15, the son of Bangladeshi immigrants, as he and his friends \u2014 of Bengali, Korean and Indian descent \u2014 meandered toward the subway from the Bronx High School of Science one recent afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s all about hard work.\u201d\nNo student, they said, was off the hook. Riyan, the son of a taxi driver and a Duane Reade cashier, and his schoolmates said their parents routinely plied them with motivational tales about the trials they endured back home, walking to school barefoot, struggling with hunger, being set back by floods and political unrest. \u201cYou try to make up for their hardships,\u201d Riyan said.\nThe summer after sixth grade, Riyan spent most days at a small storefront \u201ccram school,\u201d memorizing surface area and volume formulas. In seventh grade, he was back there on Saturday and Sundays, unscrambling paragraphs and plowing through reading passages. The classes cost his parents $200 a month.\n\u201cI knew my parents would still love me if I didn\u2019t get into Bronx Science,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they would be very disappointed.\u201d\nJerome Krase, a professor emeritus in sociology at Brooklyn College, and one of the editors of \u201cRace and Ethnicity in New York City,\u201d said that a growing number of Asian immigrants in recent years had experienced serious adversity in their home countries. \u201cThe children hold the honor of the family in their hands,\u201d Professor Krase said. \u201cIf they succeed, the family succeeds.\u201d\nComplaints about the test and its effect on the racial makeup of the top schools date back at least to the civil rights era. When school officials began openly discussing changing the admissions policy in the early 1970s, white parents persuaded the State Legislature to pass a law cementing the test as the only basis of admission to the specialized high schools. At the time, according to an article in The New York Times in 1971, Stuyvesant High School was mostly white, 10 percent black, 4 percent Puerto Rican or \u201cother Spanish surnamed,\u201d and 6 percent Asian.\nThis year at Stuyvesant, 72 percent are Asian and less than 4 percent are black or Hispanic.\nMelissa Potter, a spokeswoman for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of the groups that filed the complaint with the United States Department of Education in September, said that though some of the city\u2019s poorest Asian immigrants had found their way into these schools, many were still being left out, for the same reason that poor blacks and Hispanics were: they do not have access to the grueling, expensive and time-consuming test preparation for the exam. The complaint argued that other factors, like school grades, teacher recommendations and personal experience should also be taken into account.\nCity education officials, as well as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, have rejected the idea that the one-test entry system should be rethought. \u201cYou pass the test,\u201d the mayor said last month, \u201cyou get the highest score, you get into the school \u2014 no matter what your ethnicity, no matter what your economic background is.\u201d\nThe city began offering a free test-prep program several years ago for black and Hispanic students, but after a legal challenge, other ethnic groups were granted the same access to the course. Today, 43 percent of the students in the program are Asian. Three years ago, Ting Shi was one of them.\nThe filing of the complaint has led to some uncomfortable discussions about race, aided by the anonymity of the Internet. On the elite schools\u2019 alumni Web sites, discussions can veer into \u201cdangerous territory,\u201d as one commenter from Brooklyn Tech recently noted during a heated exchange. The discussion included a post about how the N.A.A.C.P. ought to be pushing parents to get \u201cmore involved in their children\u2019s education.\u201d\nMeanwhile, a parent on a popular education e-mail list referred to the \u201cAsian-ification\u201d of the elite schools, and a post on Urban Baby grumbled about \u201cAsian kids taking all the spots because they prep excessively.\u201d\nCriticizing Asians\u2019 success on the test is \u201clike a defense mechanism,\u201d said Faria Kabir, a sophomore at Brooklyn Tech, who emigrated from Bangladesh when she was 6. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone is blaming you for something that isn\u2019t actually your fault.\u201d\nBeyond issues of race, those who favor a broader admissions policy say the reliance on one test for admission, one that has spawned an industry of tutoring programs, has distorted what it means to be a top student.\nSharon Chambers, the owner of a karate studio in Queens, whose son, Kyle, was scheduled to take the test on Saturday, said students should be able to demonstrate their abilities in a more well-rounded way, one that might not cost so much. \u201cA test like this is not a full indicator of a child\u2019s potential,\u201d Ms. Chambers, who is black, said.\nOthers take issue with the exam on philosophical grounds. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to prep Sunday to Sunday, to get into a good high school,\u201d said Melissa Santana, a legal secretary whose daughter Dejanellie Falette has been prepping this fall for the exam. \u201cThat\u2019s extreme.\u201d\nBut a Bensonhurst resident, Emmie Cheng, who is of Chinese descent but emigrated here as a child from Cambodia, was not sure she agreed.\nThis fall, her daughter Kassidi has spent every Tuesday afternoon and all of Saturday at the Horizon Program, a tutoring program near her house, reviewing work she has done over the past three years. Kassidi also takes a prep class on Sundays.\nStill, Ms. Cheng, a director at a shoe importing company, said guiding her daughter through this process \u2014 which cost her about $2,000 this year alone \u2014 paled in comparison to what she had experienced earlier in her life. Her father and four brothers died of starvation during Cambodia\u2019s civil war. And once here, she said, she watched her mother struggle in a garment factory.\n\u201cThis is the easy part,\u201d Ms. Cheng said.",

    "text": "Horrific Fire Revealed a Gap in Safety for Global Brands\n2012-12-07T02:24:33.000Z\nASHULIA, Bangladesh \u2014 The fire alarm shattered the monotony of the Tazreen Fashions factory. Hundreds of seamstresses looked up from their machines, startled. On the third floor, Shima Akhter Pakhi had been stitching hoods onto fleece jackets. Now she ran to a staircase.\nBut two managers were blocking the way. Ignore the alarm, they ordered. It was just a test. Back to work. A few women laughed nervously. Ms. Pakhi and other workers returned to their sewing tables. She could stitch a hood to a jacket in about 90 seconds. She arranged the fabric under her machine. Ninety seconds. Again. Ninety more seconds. She sewed six pieces, maybe seven.\nThen she looked up.\nSmoke was filtering up through the three staircases. Screams rose from below. The two managers had vanished. Power suddenly went out throughout the eight-story building. There was nowhere to escape. The staircases led down into the fire. Iron grilles blocked the windows. A man cowering in a fifth-floor bathroom called his mother to tell her he was about to die.\n\u201cWe all panicked,\u201d Ms. Pakhi said. \u201cIt spread so quickly. And there was no electricity. It was totally dark.\u201d\nTazreen Fashions Ltd. operated at the beginning of the global supply chain that delivers clothes made in Bangladesh to stores in Europe and the United States. By any measure, the factory was not a safe place to work. Fire safety preparations were woefully inadequate. The building itself was under construction \u2014 even as sewing work continued inside \u2014 and mounds of flammable yarn and fabric were illegally stored on the ground floor near electrical generators.\nYet Tazreen was making clothing destined for some of the world\u2019s top retailers. On the third floor, where firefighters later recovered 69 bodies, Ms. Pakhi was stitching sweater jackets for C&A, a European chain. On the fifth floor, workers were making Faded Glory shorts for Walmart. Ten bodies were recovered there. On the sixth floor, a man named Hashinur Rahman put down his work making True Desire lingerie for Sears and eventually helped save scores of others. Inside one factory office, labor activists found order forms and drawings for a licensee of the United States Marine Corps that makes commercial apparel with the Marines\u2019 logo. \nIn all, 112 workers were killed in a blaze last month that has exposed a glaring disconnect among global clothing brands, the monitoring system used to protect workers and the factories actually filling the orders. After the fire, Walmart, Sears and other retailers made the same startling admission: They say they did not know that Tazreen Fashions was making their clothing.\nBut who, then, is ultimately responsible when things go so wrong?\nThe global apparel industry aspires to operate with accountability that extends from distant factories to retail stores. Big brands demand that factories be inspected by accredited auditing firms so that the brands can control quality and understand how, where and by whom their goods are made. If a factory does not pass muster, it is not supposed to get orders from Western customers.\nTazreen Fashions was one of many clothing factories that exist on the margins of this system. Factory bosses had been faulted for violations during inspections conducted on behalf of Walmart and at the behest of the Business Social Compliance Initiative, a European organization. \nYet Tazreen Fashions received orders anyway, slipping through the gaps in the system by delivering the low costs and quick turnarounds that buyers \u2014 and consumers \u2014 demand. C&A, the European retailer, has confirmed ordering 220,000 sweaters from the factory. But much of the factory\u2019s business came through opaque networks of subcontracts with suppliers or local buying houses. Labor activists, combing the site of the disaster, found labels, order forms, design drawings and articles of clothing from many global brands.\nWalmart and Sears have since said they fired the suppliers that subcontracted work to Tazreen Fashions. Yet some critics have questioned how a company like Walmart, one of the two biggest buyers in Bangladesh and renowned for its sophisticated global supply system, could have been unaware of the connection. \nThe factory\u2019s owner, Delowar Hossain, said his managers arranged work through local middlemen. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the buyers,\u201d Mr. Hossain said in an interview. \u201cThe local man is important. The buyer \u2014 I don\u2019t care.\u201d\nBangladesh is now a garment manufacturing giant, the world\u2019s second-leading apparel exporter, behind China, which is no longer the cheapest place to make many basic goods. Bangladesh has the lowest garment wages in the world, and many of the Tazreen factory\u2019s victims were young rural women with little education, who earned as little as $45 a month in an industry that now accounts for $19 billion in exports.\nIn Bangladesh, public outrage about the fire has boiled over. An estimated 100,000 people attended the burial ceremony of 53 workers whose bodies could not be identified. Industry leaders have promised financial support for survivors and the families of the dead. The Bangladeshi government has started inspecting the country\u2019s 4,500 garment factories; it has already found fire code violations in almost a third of the hundreds it has examined. \n\u201cNow we have to do much more,\u201d said Mohammad Shafiul Islam Mohiuddin, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, conceding past failures. \u201cWe have learned. We start from here.\u201d\nIn the United States, Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis compared the Tazreen blaze to the 1911 Triangle shirtwaist factory fire in New York, which led to sweeping reforms of American sweatshops. In Bangladesh, factory fires have been a persistent problem, with the International Labor Rights Forum saying more than 600 garment workers have died in such fires since 2005. \nAnd even before the Tazreen blaze, outside pressure was building on Bangladesh\u2019s garment sector to increase wages and ease restrictions on union organizing. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, along with European diplomats, has urged the government to investigate the unsolved murder of a labor organizer, Aminul Islam.\nIn reconstructing the deadly blaze, The New York Times interviewed more than two dozen survivors; relatives of the victims; Bangladeshi fire officials; garment factory owners and managers; auditors; and others. In the end, analysts said, the conflagration was a tragic byproduct of an industry in which global brands and retailers, encouraged by hundreds of millions of consumers around the world, are still primarily motivated by the bottom line.\n\u201cWe as consumers like to be able to buy ever-greater quantities of ever-cheaper goods, every year,\u201d said Richard M. Locke, deputy dean of the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. \u201cSomebody is bearing the cost of it, and we don\u2019t want to know about it. The people bearing the cost were in this fire.\u201d\n\u2018Precious\u2019 Escape Time Is Lost\nSeveral months ago, Shima Akhter Pakhi was summoned to the sixth floor of Tazreen Fashions. Ms. Pakhi, 24, had worked at the factory for three years, and every month she sent money back to her family in rural Bangladesh. Now she earned a monthly base salary of $51, maybe $20 more with overtime. Up on the sixth floor, managers were tapping her for fire safety duty.\nWhen Ms. Pakhi started at Tazreen, the factory had only three floors, but the owner was adding five upper floors in expectation that business would grow. The empty, unfinished sixth floor was nearly the size of a football field. Ms. Pakhi and a few other employees were handed fire extinguishers and taught to remove the pin, squeeze the handle and spray. They were also told that in the case of a fire on upper floors, employees should evacuate down the staircases in descending order from top to bottom.\n\u201cThey did not tell us what we would do if the fire started on the ground floor,\u201d Ms. Pakhi recalled.\nFire investigators say the blaze erupted on the cavernous ground floor after stacks of yarn and fabric caught fire. Had the fabric been stored in an enclosed, fireproof room, as required by law, the fire could have been contained and the workers could have escaped.\nInstead, the blaze spread quickly, pushing up the staircases, along with toxic fumes from burning acrylic. Investigators discovered that few fire extinguishers had been used. And, finally, managers made a catastrophic mistake by initially dismissing the fire alarm.\n\u201cThey killed time,\u201d said Abu Nayeem Mohammad Shahidullah, the director general of Bangladesh\u2019s national fire service. \u201cTime was so precious, so important. But they said it was a false alarm.\u201d\nMr. Hossain, the factory owner, said in a separate interview with Bangladeshi news media that he did not know why managers on the floor would have tried to stop employees from leaving the factory. He added that none of the gates in the staircases were locked.\nManagers had been preparing the factory for inspections from buyers and staged a drill a few days before the fire, several employees said. Ms. Pakhi said managers had even displayed photographs of the fire training session on bulletin boards. \n\u201cI think they took the pictures and hung them on the board to show the buyers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would see the pictures and think they have trained people to fight fires. But personally, I don\u2019t think I could fight fires with this training.\u201d\nTazreen Fashions is part of a larger garment conglomerate, the Tuba Group, which owns at least half a dozen apparel factories in Bangladesh. Mr. Hossain said a team from Walmart\u2019s local office conducted a compliance audit last year and faulted the factory for excessive overtime, while making no mention of fire safety or other issues. Moreover, he said, the local buying houses had also inspected and approved the factory, tantamount, he assumed, to approval from Walmart and the other global brands these middlemen represented.\nKevin Gardner, a Walmart spokesman, said the company stopped authorizing production at Tazreen \u201cmany months before the fire.\u201d But he did not say why. Accredited outside auditors inspected the factory on Walmart\u2019s behalf at least twice in 2011, he said. That May, auditors gave the factory an \u201corange\u201d rating, meaning there were \u201chigher-risk violations.\u201d Three months later, the factory\u2019s grade improved to \u201cyellow,\u201d meaning there were \u201cmedium-risk violations.\u201d \nSears, in a statement, said its supplier \u201cwas not authorized\u201d to produce goods at the Tazreen factory and that it had done so \u201cin violation\u201d of Sears\u2019s rules.\nBut David Hasanat, the chairman of the Viyellatex Group, one of the country\u2019s most highly regarded garment manufacturers, pointed out that global apparel retailers often depend on hundreds of factories to fill orders. Given the scale of work, retailers frequently place orders through suppliers and other middlemen who, in turn, steer work to factories that deliver low costs \u2014 a practice he said is hardly unknown to Western retailers and clothing brands. The order for Walmart\u2019s Faded Glory shorts, documents show, was subcontracted from Simco Bangladesh Ltd., a local garment maker. \u201cIt is an open secret to allow factories to do that,\u201d Mr. Hasanat said. \u201cEnd of the day, for them it is the price that matters.\u201d\nA Friend Shouts, \u2018Save Us!\u2019\nOn the sixth floor, Hashinur Rahman heard the screams and rushed to a staircase. He and others had been making satiny lingerie, but they pushed past a manager and began descending into thicker and thicker smoke. Ignoring the manager would save their lives.\nThe factory did not have ceiling sprinklers or an outdoor fire escape. Fire officials later concluded that the two staircases on the eastern side of the building were quickly overwhelmed with fire and toxic smoke. But officials say the lone western staircase remained passable for many minutes and provided an escape route for many survivors. About 1,150 people were working that night, and all of the roughly 300 workers on the second floor managed to escape down the stairs, fire officials said.\nMr. Rahman, 32, had barely made it out of the building, along with many of his colleagues, when his cellphone rang. It was a friend who worked on the third floor. Hundreds of people were trapped.\n\n9 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\n\u201cSave us!\u201d the friend shouted. \u201cHelp us!\u201d\nMr. Rahman said he ran to the narrow alley that separated the factory\u2019s western wall from a building under construction. The gap was maybe five feet. Work crews had covered the western wall with rickety bamboo scaffolding so they could put plaster on the exterior of the still-unfinished Tazreen factory.\nMr. Rahman climbed the bamboo to a third-floor window covered with an iron grille. He leapt onto a concrete slab of the new building and found a brick. He began smashing the grille, trying to break it open. He looked inside and saw his co-workers\u2019 desperate faces. They were in the room where samples were made and sent to buyers for final approval, and they stood on sewing tables, pulling frantically on the grille.\nOne seamstress, who goes by a single name, Rahima, had tried to escape the third floor by a stairwell but began choking on smoke. As the smoke thickened, Ms. Rahima said, she fell to the floor. Then people trampled her.\n\u201cWhen I fell down, and the people were stepping on me, I did not think I would survive,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut then I thought of my daughter.\u201d\nMs. Rahima had been married to a husband who beat her. When their daughter was born five years ago, the husband fled. Ms. Rahima left her village to find work in the garment industry, which has provided an escape from grinding rural poverty for millions of women like her in Bangladesh and around the world. She moved into a rented room with her two sisters and got a job at Tazreen. In the village, Ms. Rahima\u2019s parents cared for her daughter while she sent back money. Two days before the fire, the little girl arrived for a rare visit.\n\u201cI got my strength, and I stood up,\u201d Ms. Rahima said. \u201cI ran to the sample room.\u201d\nFinally, the iron grille gave way.\nA few men jumped to the concrete slab of the adjacent building. Leaning against the scaffolding, they reached across the gap to help co-workers make the leap. Women went first. Ms. Rahima made it across. So did Ms. Pakhi. On other floors, people smashed open windows or tore out exhaust fans and leapt into the darkness. Some landed on the metal roofs of nearby shanties. Some landed on the ground.\nAnd some never made it out at all.\nSon Phones \u2018Ma\u2019 Before Dying\nAs word spread, people raced to the factory: mothers, fathers, husbands, wives and gawkers. Soon a throng stood beneath the building, their faces glowing in the cruel brilliance of the flames. Golapi Begum left her own factory job and raced to Tazreen Fashions to find her son, Palash Mian. He was 18 and worked on the fifth floor. Ms. Begum stared up at the factory and shrieked.\nThen her cellphone rang. It was her son.\n\u201cMa, I have no way to save my life,\u201d he told her. \u201cI cannot find any way to get out. I am in the bathroom of the fifth floor. I am wearing a black T-shirt. And I have a shirt wrapped around my waist. You will find me in the bathroom.\u201d\nHe hung up. He called his father, as well as several friends. Then his phone went dead.\n\u201cI became insane,\u201d his mother said. \u201cI spent the whole night in front of the main gate of the factory. I was screaming all the time.\u201d\nShe found him the next day. Rescuers had lined up all the recovered bodies on the grounds of a nearby school. Family members unzipped bag after bag, searching. One husband looking in vain for his young wife said the charred human remains looked like chunks of coal.\nBut Ms. Begum unzipped a bag and found her son. She recognized his face.

    "text": "As Walmart Makes Safety Vows, It\u2019s Seen as Obstacle to Change\n2012-12-29T03:55:00.000Z\nWhen Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Michael Duke, appeared at a Council on Foreign Relations meeting in New York this month, a raucous crowd of protesters awaited him. Walmart was confronting reports of bribery in Mexico, a wave of labor demonstrations in the United States and, perhaps most critically, questions about a grisly fire that had killed 112 workers at a Bangladeshi garment factory used by several Walmart suppliers.\n\u201cWe will not buy from an unsafe factory,\u201d Mr. Duke told the audience. \u201cIf a factory is not going to operate with high standards, then we would not purchase from that factory.\u201d\nBut Mr. Duke\u2019s reassurances that Walmart enforces high standards in the global clothing industry appear to be contradicted by inspection reports it requested and some of Walmart\u2019s own internal communications: \n\u00b6 Just two weeks before Mr. Duke\u2019s vow, a top Walmart executive acknowledged in an e-mail to a group of retailers that the industry\u2019s safety monitoring system was seriously flawed. \u201cFire and electrical safety aspects are not currently adequately covered in ethical sourcing audits,\u201d Rajan Kamalanathan, the executive, wrote to other board members of the Global Social Compliance Program, a business-led group focused on improving the supply chain.\n\u00b6 Three inspection reports from 2011 and 2012 at the Tazreen Fashions factory where the fire occurred revealed serious repeated violations, including a lack of fire alarms in many areas, a shortage of fire extinguishers and obstacles blocking workers\u2019 escape routes. At the same time, those inspections did not even cover whether the factory had fire-safe emergency exits, leaving that responsibility to often lax government inspectors. \n\u00b6 Walmart led an effort to block a plan to have global retailers underwrite safety improvements at factories in Bangladesh, according to minutes of an April 2011 meeting as well as several participants.\nWalmart has become the world\u2019s largest retailer by demanding the lowest costs from suppliers and delivering the lowest prices to consumers \u2014 while promising its customers that the billions of dollars of goods it buys from Bangladesh, China and other countries are produced in safe, nonsweatshop factories. Walmart buys more than $1 billion in garments from Bangladesh each year, attracted by the country\u2019s $37-a-month minimum wage, the lowest in the world. \nBut even as the deadly Nov. 24 fire at the Tazreen factory has stirred soul-searching inside and outside the apparel industry about the effectiveness of its global factory monitoring system, some nonprofit groups say Walmart has been an important obstacle to efforts to upgrade fire safety. That is partly because it has shown little interest in changing the existing practice of demanding that the factories, often operating at razor-thin margins, meet fire safety standards at their own cost.\n\u201cThey are squeezing the manufacturers, and the manufacturers are happy to get away with the minimum compliance that they can,\u201d said Farooq Sobhan, a former Bangladeshi diplomat involved in past negotiations between Bangladesh and the United States on trade policy for apparel. \u201cIt is kind of a vicious cycle.\u201d\nWalmart says it is doing everything it can to prevent factory fires. \u201cWalmart has been advocating for improved fire safety with the Bangladeshi government, with industry groups and with suppliers,\u201d Kevin Gardner, a Walmart spokesman, said in an e-mail. \u201cWe firmly believe factory owners must meet our supplier standards, and we recognize the cost of meeting those standards will be part of the cost of the goods we buy. We know our customers expect this of us and our suppliers.\u201d\nWalmart also insists that several of its apparel suppliers were using the Tazreen factory without its approval. Two days after the Tazreen fire, Walmart said it had \u201cde-authorized\u201d use of the factory, but without saying when or why; two weeks later it said it had taken the action \u201cmany months ago.\u201d \nBut critics say that the inspection reports discovered in the Tazreen factory\u2014 which were obtained by The New York Times from a labor advocacy group \u2014 underscore fundamental problems with Walmart\u2019s supply chain in Bangladesh, allowing it to avoid addressing safety problems it should have dealt with.\n\u201cThe Walmart system of audits and inspections is not improving the factory safety conditions here in Bangladesh,\u201d said Kalpona Akter, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity. \u201cThey maintain this system to enable them to keep their hands clean and deny responsibility.\u201d\nTwo Walmart-sponsored inspections in 2011, along with a third monitoring report in April 2012, revealed recurring violations, with the first Walmart audit report, containing a warning from a Walmart official, giving the factory an \u201corange,\u201d or high risk, assessment. Under Walmart\u2019s rules, such factories are to be reinspected within six months, and are disqualified only after failing three audits within two years \u2014 raising the possibility that workers remain exposed a year or more to serious dangers before a factory is dropped.\n\u201cIt is not enough to have a system that does a checklist of problems and keeps track of what happens to those problems every six months,\u201d said Dara O\u2019Rourke, a labor specialist at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cThey should say, \u2018We got Code Orange problems in this factory, which are putting workers\u2019 lives at risk. What can we do immediately to solve these problems and eliminate these risks?\u2019\u00a0\u201d \nFlawed Monitoring\nIn February 2010, Douglas McMillon, chief executive of Walmart International, arrived in Dhaka, Bangladesh\u2019s capital, on an unannounced visit. Walmart was already a major buyer of garments in Bangladesh but now planned to purchase far more.\nUnder tight security, Mr. McMillon held court in a conference room of the Radisson hotel, summoning a small delegation of industry leaders. One participant recalled even being forbidden from taking his cellphone and fountain pen. During the meeting, according to the participant, Mr. McMillon spoke out about Walmart\u2019s commitment to corporate social responsibility and expressed sympathy when one Bangladeshi factory owner complained about the difficulty in meeting certain standards, given the low prices paid by buyers. \n\u201cThey wanted to enhance their actions of corporate social responsibility,\u201d said the participant, agreeing to speak only on the condition of anonymity because of Walmart\u2019s influence in Bangladesh. \u201cBut it never happened.\u201d\nWalmart has long held itself out as an industry leader in pushing for safety and ethical standards at the overseas factories that supply its stores, saying it further toughened its fire safety standards this year. It boasts that monitors did 9,737 inspections at 8,713 factories last year to verify that Walmart\u2019s suppliers were adhering to its standards. Moreover, Walmart executives have played a forceful role in industry discussions about what should be done to prevent future factory fires. \n\u201cWe need to work with the industry and to find other ways to raise the bar on safety standards,\u201d Mr. Duke said at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nIn the days after the Tazreen disaster, Mr. Kamalanathan, the Walmart executive who acknowledged the inadequacy of factory inspections, proposed a series of recommendations to improve fire safety. But nearly all of them put the onus on Bangladeshi authorities and factory owners. \nHe called on the government to conduct more inspections, tighten standards and phase out factories deemed unsafe. He suggested more rigorous fire safety training and, significantly, said factory owners should pay for any corrective actions. A copy of his e-mail was provided by an official who believes Walmart has not done enough to improve factory safety.\nMany workplace safety experts say Walmart\u2019s own monitoring system is part of the problem. A report on an inspection of Tazreen Fashions, conducted in May 2011, found that the factory had only 30 of the 66 required fire extinguishers. There were no fire alarms or fire hose pipes on the factory\u2019s fourth and fifth floors and no smoke detectors in the room where yarn was stored. The evacuation plan was outdated, and the factory lacked a health and safety committee, as required by law. The factory\u2019s managers said they would fix most of the problems within weeks.\nThe factory was again inspected seven months later, in December 2011, and again serious problems were discovered. Like the previous inspection, it was sponsored by NTD Apparel, a Montreal-based company that supplies Walmart. The inspection found an inadequate number of fire extinguishers; partly blocked exit routes; an absence of battery-powered, backup emergency lights on the work floor to help workers escape in case of a power failure; and three exit doors on the ground floor that opened inward, a feature that can prove fatal when hundreds of workers are rushing and pushing to escape a blaze.\nSajeev Jesudas, president of UL Verification Services, whose company conducted the daylong December inspection, said it did not consider itself responsible for inspecting for fire escapes or enclosed stairways. \u201cThat\u2019s the responsibility of the local building code inspector,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t have jurisdiction to inspect the building code.\u201d\nBangladesh\u2019s government inspectors, however, are known to be overstretched and prone to frequent lapses. Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium in Washington, said a major reason so many workers died was that yarn and fabric were not stored in a fireproof warehouse, as required by law, and that the eight-story factory did not have the external fire escapes or enclosed fireproof, smoke-proof staircases that the Walmart-backed inspector should have flagged.\n\u201cIf Walmart\u2019s audits are not ensuring that a multiple-story factory in Bangladesh has functioning fire emergency exits,\u201d Mr. Nova said, \u201cthen they\u2019re not really auditing for fire safety.\u201d\nRepeat Violations\nSerious safety problems continued well into 2012. An inspection last April \u2014 done by a Bangladesh apparel contractor that often supplies Western companies \u2014 found numerous violations, not just continuing problems with fire extinguishers and fire alarms but also that Tazreen needed to keep aisles \u201cfree from blockage at cutting section and sewing section.\u201d \nWalmart has released only limited details of its own relationship with Tazreen Fashions. Documents found at the factory after the fire show that six Walmart suppliers had been using the factory in the previous 18 months, including two relying on Tazreen in the weeks just before the fire. Documents show that as recently as last Sept. 13, two months before the fire, 55 percent of the factory\u2019s production was for Walmart suppliers. Two days after the fatal fire, Walmart said it had fired a supplier who it said was using the factory without permission.\n\n9 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nWalmart says on its Web site that it has dropped 94 factories in Bangladesh for fire safety issues since 2010; 23 other factories moved to safer buildings. \nFor all the problems, though, many labor advocates do not want buyers like Walmart to simply abandon factories found wanting. \n\u201cWe want buyers to stay and use their power to ensure factories treat workers decently,\u201d said Ms. Akter of the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity. \u201cWalmart did not have to leave, because they had the power and the money to make the factory safe.\u201d\nIn April 2011, an urgent meeting was called in Dhaka, bringing together 50 labor leaders, factory owners, government officials and representatives of retailers like Walmart, Sears, Gap and Target. The issue was fire safety. Two factory fires in 2010 had killed 50 workers. \nBlocking Fixes\nOn the table were two issues: how to improve safety and who should pay for it. Labor advocates and Bangladeshi officials hoped Western companies would pledge to help finance improvements in fire safety, like fire alarms and fire escapes. But according to the minutes of the meeting and several participants, Walmart took the lead in blocking the proposal.\nThe minutes, which were made available to The Times, state that Sridevi Kalavakolanu, a Walmart director of ethical sourcing, joined by an official from the Gap, noted that the proposed improvements would involve up to 4,500 factories and would \u201c\u2018in most cases\u201d involve a \u201cvery extensive and costly modification.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not financially feasible for the brands to make such investments,\u201d the minutes quoted them as saying. \nOne participant, Ineke Zeldenrust, international coordinator for the Clean Clothes Campaign, an antisweatshop group based in Amsterdam, said that Walmart was the retailer that \u201cmost strongly advocated this position\u201d and that its opposition effectively killed the proposal. \nWalmart said its remarks were taken \u201cout of context,\u201d adding that it \u201chas been actively developing and implementing proactive programs to raise fire safety awareness and increase fire prevention.\u201d\nBut Richard Locke, a factory monitoring expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, questioned Walmart\u2019s approach. \u201cIf Walmart is serious about trying to improve safety,\u201d he said, \u201cthen the retailers need to contribute\u201d to financing safety improvements. \nLabor groups and some Western retailers are pressing Walmart to join an effort in which PVH, the parent of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, and Tchibo, a German retailer, have agreed to help pay for fire and electrical safety improvements at Bangladeshi factories. Under the plan, an independent international monitor would inspect factories, and the companies would promise to pay what was needed to bring the factories up to standard.\nIn the recommendations he e-mailed to officials at other retailers, Mr. Kamalanathan, Walmart\u2019s head of ethical sourcing, expressed sadness about the Tazreen fire but largely attributed the problems to inadequate fire safety preparations and poor oversight by Bangladeshi agencies, which he noted were \u201cunderstaffed\u201d and \u201cunable to adequately and comprehensively monitor all factories.\u201d He then floated Walmart\u2019s new plan, including recommendations that Bangladeshi government officials inspect more strictly, closing unsafe factories, while factory owners finance needed safety improvements.\nExperts agree that Bangladesh\u2019s government and factories provide inadequate monitoring and enforcement on fire safety. But many also agree that it is unrealistic to expect governments to enforce labor laws aggressively and shut down unsafe factories, given the disincentives for Bangladesh and other low-wage countries that are eager to attract apparel orders to create jobs and increase exports.\n\u201cIt is disingenuous,\u201d said Professor O\u2019Rourke of Berkeley, \u201cfor a company to blame the local government for not doing its job, when the company knows very well that part of the reason there are so many factories in this country is that local labor laws and other laws are not enforced and production costs are lower because of that.\u201d\nMr. Sobhan, the former Bangladeshi diplomat, said that Walmart, for all its ambitions, was far less active on corporate social responsibility issues in Bangladesh than retailers like Carrefour and H&M. \u201cThey are certainly lagging well behind the others,\u201d Mr. Sobhan said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see them being more proactive in doing the right thing.\u201d",

    "text": "Export Powerhouse Feels Pangs of Labor Strife\n2012-08-24T01:05:15.000Z\nISHWARDI, Bangladesh \u2014 The air thickened with tear gas as police and paramilitary officers jogged into the Ishwardi Export Processing Zone firing rubber bullets and swinging cane poles. Panicked factory workers tried to flee. A seamstress crumpled to the ground, knocked unconscious by a shot in the head. \nDozens of people were bloodied and hospitalized. The officers were cracking down on protests at two garment factories inside this industrial area in western Bangladesh. But they were also protecting two ingredients of a manufacturing formula that has quietly made Bangladesh a leading apparel exporter to the United States and Europe: cheap labor and foreign investment. \nBoth were at stake on that March morning. Workers earning as little as $50 a month, less than the cost of one of the knit sweaters they stitched for European stores, were furious over a cut in wages. Their anger was directed at the Hong Kong and Chinese bosses of the two factories, turning a labor dispute into something potentially much larger.\n\u201cIf any foreigner got injured or killed, it would damage the country\u2019s image around the globe,\u201d said a police supervisor, Akbar Hossein, who participated in the crackdown. \u201cWe all know the importance of these factories and this industry for Bangladesh.\u201d \nBangladesh, once poor and irrelevant to the global economy, is now an export powerhouse, second only to China in global apparel exports, as factories churn out clothing for brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Gap, Calvin Klein and H&M. Global retailers like Target and Walmart now operate sourcing offices in Dhaka, the capital. Garments are critical to Bangladesh\u2019s economy, accounting for 80 percent of manufacturing exports and more than three million jobs. \nBut with \u201cMade in Bangladesh\u201d labels now commonplace in American stores, Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing formula depends on its having the lowest labor costs in the world, with the minimum wage for garment workers set at roughly $37 a month. During the past two years, as workers have seen their meager earnings eroded by double-digit inflation, protests and violent clashes with the police have become increasingly common. \nIn response, Bangladeshi leaders have deployed the security tools of the state to keep factories humming. A high-level government committee monitors the garment sector and includes ranking officers from the military, the police and intelligence agencies. A new special police force patrols many industrial areas. Domestic intelligence agencies keep an eye on some labor organizers. One organizer who had been closely watched, Aminul Islam, was found tortured and killed in April in a case that is unsolved.\n\u201cThe garment industry is No. 1 for exports and dollars for the country,\u201d said Alonzo Suson, who runs the Solidarity Center in Dhaka, an A.F.L.-C.I.O.-affiliated labor rights group. \u201cAny slowdown of that development is a national security issue.\u201d\nFor the Obama administration, which has cultivated Bangladesh as a regional ally in southern Asia, labor unrest has become a matter of growing concern. In a May visit to Dhaka, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton raised labor issues and the Islam murder case. In June, Ambassador Dan W. Mozena warned Bangladeshi garment factory owners that any perception of a rollback on labor rights could scare off multinational brands and damage the garment industry. \u201cThese developments could coalesce into a perfect storm that could threaten the Bangladesh brand in America,\u201d he said.\nFor global brands, which are forever chasing the cheapest labor costs from country to country, Bangladesh has been a hot spot, especially as wages have risen in China. McKinsey, the consulting giant, has called Bangladesh the \u201cnext China\u201d and predicted that Bangladeshi garment exports, now about $18 billion a year, could triple by 2020. \nBut in late July, representatives from 12 major brands and retailers, alarmed by the rising labor unrest, prodded the Bangladeshi government to address wage demands, a suggestion rejected by the labor minister. \u201cNo reason to be worried,\u201d Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, the minister, told reporters, noting that brands were not canceling orders.\nBangladesh was born in bloodshed during a 1971 war of independence from Pakistan and has since gyrated between military rule and fragile democracy. It has about 150 million people and is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Derided by Henry A. Kissinger as the world\u2019s \u201cbasket case,\u201d Bangladesh has since made considerable progress on fronts like women\u2019s literacy, juvenile and maternal mortality, per capita income, and life expectancy. \nThis upward arc is often credited to Bangladesh\u2019s vibrant civil society, but the garment sector, in which about 80 percent of the workers are women, has also played a critical role, providing socially acceptable jobs to women in a conservative Muslim country. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in lobbying the United States for favorable trade preferences, has argued that such policies would improve the lives of millions of poor women.\nBangladesh\u2019s Home Ministry, in a written response to questions, said the government does not favor factory owners over workers but acts as a \u201creferee/umpire\u201d while maintaining an \u201cinvestment friendly\u201d environment for foreign and domestic investors.\nYet Ms. Hasina\u2019s government has resisted expanding labor rights in a country where the owners of about 5,000 garment factories wield enormous influence. Factory owners are major political donors and have moved into news media, buying newspapers and television stations. In Parliament, roughly two-thirds of the members belong to the country\u2019s three biggest business associations. At least 30 factory owners or their family members hold seats in Parliament, about 10 percent of the total.\n\u201cPolitics and business is so enmeshed that one is kin to the other,\u201d said Iftekharuzzaman, director of Transparency International Bangladesh.\u201cThere is a coalition between the sector and people in positions of power. The negotiating position of the workers is very, very limited.\u201d\nA Country Within a Country\nMohammad Helal Uddin joined Rosita Knitwear in May 2010 and was thrilled to have the job. Rosita was inside the new Ishwardi Export Processing Zone, not far from his home village, meaning he could live with his wife and two young daughters and not have to toil in the fields. \u201cI feel I have a kind of dignity in this job,\u201d he said. \nMr. Uddin, 28, worked in the knitting department and after six months was promoted, with a base salary of $55 a month. He soon began to notice irregularities. Workers were not getting promised annual raises, monthly attendance bonuses or the 17 paid holidays a year, beyond their usual one day off a week. Employees also said they worked four hours of overtime a day but were paid for only two. \nThree decades ago, Bangladesh created a network of export zones to attract foreign investment with tax incentives and other benefits. Today, a large majority of Bangladesh\u2019s garment factories lie outside these zones, but the zones are favored by foreign investors. Rosita and its sister factory, Megatex, both owned by the Hong Kong conglomerate South Ocean, were the first plants in the Ishwardi zone. Zones like Ishwardi operate like countries within a country. They are governed by a separate agency, the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority, and by separate laws. By tradition, the authority has been run by a military officer, active duty or retired, and many factories have hired retired soldiers to oversee security. \nFor workers, wages were higher in the zones and conditions were better. But unions were initially banned, and workers had no right to organize until 2004 when Parliament, facing international pressure, approved worker associations at individual factories. \n\n13 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nAt the Rosita factory, workers elected a 15-member association last December, with Mr. Uddin as president. In January, a female employee complained that a Bangladeshi middle manager was pressuring her to have sex with one of the Chinese bosses. Enraged, workers demanded that the management address her complaint as well as the discrepancies over annual raises and earned leave. Six weeks of confrontation and chaos followed. In February, equipment in the Rosita factory was damaged during a rampage. Nearly 300 workers were accused of vandalism and fired, with their names posted on a blacklist at the gate of the Ishwardi zone. Mr. Uddin, who denied any wrongdoing, was fired and temporarily jailed.\nWhen he tried to return to work on Feb. 20, Mr. Uddin said two black-clad officers hustled him into the tiny guardhouse. The officers were members of the Rapid Action Battalion, a government paramilitary force infamous for vigilante attacks known as \u201ccross fire\u201d killings. He said one of the officers ordered him to sign a resignation letter. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Mr. Uddin said he told them. \nHe said one of the officers pushed a gun against his shoulder. \u201cIf you don\u2019t sign,\u201d the officer told him, according to Mr. Uddin, \u201cwe will take you in the car and you will have to face the cross-fire.\u201d\nMr. Uddin signed. Inside the factories, according to several workers, police and paramilitary officers walked through the workrooms, holding termination letters. The message was clear: work or leave.\nBy March, an American labor rights group, the Institute for Global Labor and Human Rights, was advocating for the workers. A South Ocean executive arrived at Ishwardi and promised to address worker complaints over wages and unpaid leave. Then on March 20, workers discovered that managers had cut the piece rate, a type of production bonus, meaning a loss of wages. Another standoff ensued as managers closed the factories. But when workers returned March 25, the wage cut had not been fully restored.\nHundreds of workers gathered outside the front door of the factory in an impromptu sit-down strike. Eight workers, interviewed in June, said all the managers had left the factories. A small contingent of police officers soon arrived and ordered everyone back to work. A seamstress said a police officer knocked her to the ground, beating her unconscious with a stick and shredding her clothes. \u201cI kept asking them to stop,\u201d said the seamstress, who asked not to be identified, fearing reprisals. \u201cBut even after I fell to the ground, they kept beating me and pulled my hair.\u201d\nWorkers began throwing stones and chanting slogans against the police, who fled. Hours later, after officials in Dhaka were notified, officers from the Rapid Action Battalion as well as surrounding police stations arrived. Officer Hossein, the police supervisor, denied that the police were aggressors, saying officers were told that foreign managers were trapped inside the factories and that angry workers were vandalizing equipment. \u201cThey attacked the police,\u201d Officer Hossein said. \u201cThey started the violence.\u201d\nCellphone videos show police officers firing rubber bullets and pummeling workers with cane poles. \u201cThey treated workers as if they were not human beings,\u201d one worker said.\nThe Power Equation\nBangladesh\u2019s two major political parties, the governing Awami League and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, often seem engaged in a blood feud. Yet, many analysts say, the two parties agree on one thing: safeguarding the garment industry.\nThree months after the clash at Ishwardi, tens of thousands of angry workers protested near Dhaka, demanding higher wages and crippling one of the country\u2019s most important industrial zones for more than a week. Riot police officers dispersed the protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets, as scores of people were injured.\nFollowing huge protests in 2010, Ms. Hasina raised the minimum wage for garment workers to $37 a month from about $20. But her government has resisted the renewed worker demands, even as executives at some leading brands have voiced support for adjusting wages and expressed concerns about labor unrest. \nIn June, top executives at the Swedish retailer H&M fretted that recurring labor protests were disrupting production and called on Bangladeshi factories to rectify the situation. \nMajor brands have been stung by bad publicity. This year, War on Want, a nonprofit group, found that workers in five factories making products for Nike, Puma and Adidas were paid less than the minimum wage and complained of workplace abuse and sexual harassment. In March, the parent company of the Tommy Hilfiger brand, PVH Corp., hurriedly donated $1 million toward a factory safety initiative as ABC News was preparing to broadcast a report on a fire that killed 29 workers in a Bangladeshi factory making clothes for Tommy Hilfiger.\n\u201cThey want to see better standards and conditions in factories in Bangladesh,\u201d said Julia K. Hughes, president of the United States Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel, a trade group in Washington. \u201cNo company is arguing that wages should not rise in Bangladesh. They are not saying what the wage should be, but absolutely wages should go up.\u201d\nBut many factory owners are skeptical that buyers are truly willing to pay higher prices. One owner, Shawkat Ali Bhuiyan, said he had stopped working with companies like Walmart and Target because his profit margin was almost nonexistent, while some Bangladeshi labor leaders blame the foreign brands for exploiting workers.\n\u201cWe need to clean up the whole supply chain,\u201d said Roy Ramesh Chandra, a powerful public sector union leader. \u201cThe brands need to fulfill their responsibility. The manufacturers need to fulfill their responsibility. And the government should comply with international obligations and respect international labor standards.\u201d\nBangladesh has responded to international pressure in the past, sharply curtailing child labor and improving safety conditions in the 1990s. Now, though, the pressure points are the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain for wages, issues that require action by a political system dominated by business interests, including the garment sector.\nA. K. Azad, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, played down the garment sector\u2019s political clout. \u201cWe are not powerful,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cPower lies with the politicians. Power lies with the media.\u201d\nBut many apparel tycoons have also gone into politics or begun media careers, purchasing newspapers or starting independent news channels. Mr. Azad, who owns one of the country\u2019s biggest garment factories, also owns a Bengali-language newspaper and a television station. Several Western diplomats privately noted that news coverage often emphasizes the disruptions caused by protests above the concerns of workers. \nAt the Rosita and Megatex factories, South Ocean management hired a labor oversight firm, Verit\u00e9, which detailed a host of problems, including humiliation of workers, summary firings and deliberate interference with the ability of workers to organize. New management teams are now running the factories, and Verit\u00e9 is helping put in place changes to increase wages and protect worker rights. \u201cSouth Ocean have taken labor issues at the two factories extremely seriously and have taken swift actions to address those issues,\u201d the company\u2019s law firm, Winston & Strawn of Hong Kong, said in a statement.\nMany of the workers involved in the March 25 clash are back on the job, despite their anger over how they have been treated. The seamstress who was knocked unconscious, her clothes shredded, said she had little choice, since she was the family\u2019s sole breadwinner. \u201cI am helpless,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to get food.\u201d\nSouth Ocean dropped charges against Mr. Uddin but the police are still pursuing separate charges. Meanwhile, officials at the export zone authority have blacklisted him from being hired at factories inside the zones. \u201cWe spoke up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we became criminals in the eyes of all authorities.\u201d",

    "text": "In Nepal, After Revolt, \u2018Art Was Changed Forever\u2019\n2012-05-18T12:00:12.000Z\nThe sea-green mural at Lasanaa, an arts center here, has familiar elements of Nepali art: images of snowy Himalayan peaks and curlycue whorls representing wind in Buddhist thangka tapestries.\nBut it is the unconventional images that reflect the anxieties of a country in painful flux. A floating fuel tank and a gas pump symbolize Nepal\u2019s chronic fuel shortages. A retreating bus in the mural is a sajha, a cheap, popular mode of public transportation here that is now defunct in the wake of government instability. Tucked inside an urn is a visa \u2014 coveted by many who seek opportunities overseas.\nThe mural was painted by 22 Nepali artists in \u201cRedefining Katmandu Valley,\u201d an exhibition on view last month at Lasanaa, which means \u201cart\u201d in the Newari language here. The show aimed to break clich\u00e9s and give a sociopolitical edge to art in Nepal, said Ashmina Ranjit, an artist and founder of Lasanaa.\nCommon themes in the show captured the zeitgeist in the capital of this mountain nation between India and China. Urban landscapes choked by electrical wires and labyrinthine roads evoked the chaotic congestion of Katmandu.\nOne work re-interpreted the eight auspicious Buddhist symbols with a modern bent. Mounted on eight-foot-tall panels, or 2.4 meters, the re-imagined symbols hinted of urban decay. The conch shell was fashioned from the battered body of a motorbike, like the tens of thousands that buzz and shriek through Katmandu\u2019s streets. The lotus \u2014 a symbol of purity \u2014 was made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 of old newspapers. Buddha\u2019s footprints in the lotus\u2019s center were a pair of plastic flip-flops. The infinite knot was made of frayed rope bound with black electrical wire.\nAfter a civil war that lasted from 1996 to 2006, Nepalis went to the polls and ended a centuries-old monarchy in 2008 in favor of democracy. But the promises of democratic government have not come true. A constitution is pending after four years of squabbling by numerous political factions.\nNow 14-hour power cuts and frequent strikes cripple the country. Infrastructure and services have crumbled for lack of governance; roads are potholed and the air is hazy with pollution.\nGiven this turmoil, art would seem the least of Nepal\u2019s concerns. But artists and art organizers in Katmandu said it was relevant and necessary. During the civil war, \u201cthere was so much pain in Nepal that art was changed forever,\u201d said Sangeeta Thapa, founder and director of the Siddhartha Art Gallery here.\n\u201cArtists couldn\u2019t separate pain from work,\u201d she added. \u201cThey began to question Nepal society for the first time.\u201d\nDespite Nepal\u2019s troubles, contemporary arts in the capital are percolating. Lasanaa\u2019s new Live Art Hub, opened in December on the grounds of the Martin Chautari institute in Thapathali, in south Katmandu. It is Lasanaa\u2019s first semi-permanent space since the arts trust was founded in 2007 by Ms. Ranjit. Over the years Lasanaa has received support from the Danish Embassy here, the Danish Center for Culture and Development in Denmark, the Ford Foundation, the Arts Network Asia of Singapore and the U.S. Educational Foundation\u2019s Fulbright program in Nepal, among others.\nAt Live Art Hub, simple thatch walls turned the institute\u2019s front yard into an al fresco exhibition and gathering space for talks, performance art, workshops and readings. Long burlap curtains and a corrugated roof over a new cement floor sheltered artwork.\nNepal has a legacy of traditional arts, as evident in the seven Unesco world heritage sites in Katmandu Valley. Magnificently carved palaces in the capital\u2019s Durbar Square are famed symbols of the country\u2019s artistic and cultural heritage.\nBut under the monarchy, a century of political isolation until 1951 meant Nepal remained closed to the world. Contemporary artists in neighboring India, Pakistan and Bangladesh benefited from art academies set up over the years by the British Raj, but Nepal\u2019s isolation stunted development. Contemporary art focused mainly on conventional, staid notions of beauty, such as pastoral scenes and beatific Buddhas.\nNepal\u2019s government-run arts academies focus on traditional landscapes and still-lives and do not encourage innovation, Ms. Ranjit said in an interview at Lasanaa last month. \u201cEducation here is spoon-feeding. You don\u2019t even chew it,\u201d she added. Contemporary art here also suffers from a lack of bona fide critics and a foundation for conceptual art, she said.\nMs. Ranjit trained as a painter at Lalit Kala, the fine-arts department of Tribhuvan University here, and earned further art degrees from the University of Tasmania and Columbia University in New York. When she returned to Nepal in 1999, she saw the need for an alternative space that could help contemporary art mature.\nAlthough Nepal was in the throes of civil war, Ms. Ranjit was struck by the initial disconnect between art and a society in turmoil. \u201cMany artists said, \u2018We have nothing to do with politics.\u2019 I said, \u2018How can you be away from all this?\u201d\u2019 she recalled.\nThat began to change with international workshops here and projects like a 2002 performance piece Ms. Ranjit organized called \u201cBichalit Bartaman,\u201d (Disillusion Present), that addressed the violence in Nepal and its state of emergency.\nLasanaa also offers residencies to emerging Nepali artists. Rather than learning by rote, they research concepts in their art, write proposals and meet in workshops with visiting artists \u2014 from Nepal and overseas.\n\u201cThe workshop was eye-opening,\u201d said Bikash Shrestha, 26, from Pokhara who completed a residency at Lasanaa this spring. \u201cI learned more in four months than in four years of college.\u201d\nOthers are trying to nurture and showcase contemporary arts in Nepal. The Center for Art and Design at Katmandu University was established in 2003 and has a reputation for fresh thinking. And Ms. Thapa\u2019s Siddhartha Art Gallery has been a hub for contemporary art in Baber Mahal Revisited, a sleek cluster of upscale boutiques, galleries and cafes in south Katmandu.\nMs. Thapa, director of the gallery and a descendant of Nepal\u2019s royal family, opened Siddhartha in 1987. After growing up mostly outside the country, she returned from the United States in the 1980s. Government arts academies were in a dilapidated state and access to art books and resources was limited, she said. Artists went to Indian art schools in Benares and Baroda for training and support.\nAnd politics hampered creativity in Nepal. \u201cThe government favors artists who toe the line,\u201d Ms. Thapa said in an interview at her home here. \u201cArt was based on who you\u2019ve pleased. In Nepal, politics has entered everything. It\u2019s like a virus.\u201d With her gallery, she tried to create a place where art was based on merit and fueled by new ideas.\nExposure to and dialogue with international artists is important, both Ms. Ranjit and Ms. Thapa said. To that end, Ms. Thapa co-founded the Katmandu Contemporary Arts Center in 2007 with Celia Washington, an artist in London. \nThe center is housed at the Patan Museum in the historic Durbar Square of Patan, a 20-minute drive from Katmandu. The small center in a leafy garden behind the museum has exhibition space, an office and art library with books donated mostly by the Tate Gallery in London. It offers residencies for international and homegrown artists. Sanjeev Maharjan explored the gritty side of life in the capital with his series of paintings featuring pig carcasses brought by rickshaw to butcher shops in his Katmandu Valley neighborhood.\nTo encourage even more cross-border exchange, Ms. Thapa established the Siddhartha Arts Foundation in October to organize the second Katmandu International Arts Festival, which is to run this year from Nov. 25 to Dec. 21.\nThe first international arts fair was held in 2009 and brought together 111 artists from 25 countries with financing from foreign foundations, like the Prince Claus Fund of the Netherlands and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, as well as a few Nepali companies like the conglomerate Surya Nepal and the Himalayan Bank. So far there have been 162 submissions from 37 countries for the 2012 festival. The first five days will be devoted to international arts and a symposia, though Ms. Thapa said funding has not yet been secured.\nDespite a flurry of activity, the market for contemporary art in Nepal has waned. In the 1980s and even during the civil war, a solid art market sustained Siddhartha and other galleries. Now, Ms. Thapa said, political instability and strong Maoist unions that pressure Nepali companies have \u201cdestroyed confidence in the market.\u201d Expatriate art buyers have also dried up since the global recession.\nBut at a grassroots level, the art scene in Katmandu appears lively. At the closing of Lasanaa\u2019s exhibition in April, about 100 people turned up. On a Friday afternoon last month, more than 300 people, including many young men toting motorbike helmets and cameras, crowded into the Siddhartha Art Gallery to view the winning photos in a contest titled \u201cHamro Nepal,\u201d or Our Nepal.\nThe contest was organized by Artudio, which promotes photography and public art and was created by Kailash Shrestha, 27, a graduate of the Center for Art and Design at Katmandu University.\nPhotographs of hirsute yaks, mountain peaks and butterflies hung on the walls of the airy three-story gallery. But there were less idyllic images, too: An old woman hauling a gas tank and baby on her back, cars cleaving the murky waters of a flooded street in Katmandu.\nChemi Lama, 26, a freelance photographer, stood next to his winning print titled \u201cUnsafe Duty in an Unsafe Country\u201d that captured the harsh beauty of a boy perched on rickety scaffolding over a crowded city street. \u201cSlowly things are changing,\u201d said Mr. Lama, who wore a camera slung proudly over his neck. \u201cVisual literacy in Nepal is growing day by day.\u201d",

    "text": "Tobacco: Uphill Battle for Antismoking Campaigns in Poor and Middle-Income Countries\n2012-08-20T20:43:58.000Z\nDespite expensive antismoking campaigns, 41 percent of men in poor and middle-income countries still smoke and more young women are starting to, according to a major new survey of global tobacco use.\nThe survey, based on 248,452 interviews in 14 countries and published in The Lancet on Thursday, found that the world\u2019s two most populous countries, India (above) and China, had the most new smokers, and the percentage of people who quit there and in Egypt, Bangladesh and Russia was as low as it was in the United States 50 years ago.\nWhile Westerners in general can afford to smoke, the poorest nicotine addicts sometimes buy tobacco rather than food for their families, said the study\u2019s leader, Gary A. Giovino of the University at Buffalo of the State University of New York. \nAt present, tobacco causes only 4 percent of deaths in poor countries, compared with 18 percent in rich ones, but that trend is shifting.\nGovernments of poor countries collect $9,100 in tobacco taxes for every $1 they spend on antismoking messages, a Lancet editorial added. In some countries, the tobacco company is government-owned.\nIn the 20th century, 100 million people died from smoking; in the 21st century, up to one billion will, the World Health Organization has estimated.\nThe survey was done with money from the foundations of Bill Gates and the New York City mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, who in 2008 jointly pledged to spend $500 million fighting tobacco use overseas. ",

    "text": "University Caters to the Deprived\n2012-11-26T03:27:43.000Z\nCHITTAGONG, BANGLADESH \u2014 It is not the most glamorous of campuses: a handful of converted apartment blocks, huddled around a short, narrow gated street that ends in a small garden. Tucked away inside the buildings, there is a small library, a dining hall, a doctor\u2019s clinic, classrooms and a small gym where karate classes are held.\nFor the 541 students who attend the Asian University for Women, the basic and somewhat cramped facilities are home. And for many of them, the university, which opened its doors in this sprawling, bustling Bangladeshi port in 2008, represents the rare and coveted chance to get an English-language, university-level education.\nNearly all of the students come from deprived backgrounds. Their room, board and education costs \u2014 which total about $15,000 a year \u2014 are covered by donations. Most of the students would not be here without the funding and the university\u2019s female-only admissions policy. \nThey come from a dozen countries as varied as Cambodia, Sri Lanka, China, Myanmar, India and, of course, Bangladesh, where the university is located. They practice many religions and speak 33 languages. \nSoon, recruitment will be extended to three more countries \u2014 Egypt, Malaysia and Indonesia \u2014 for an even more diverse mix.\nStepping into the university lets a person visit \u201ca dozen different countries all at once,\u201d said Chogyel Wangmo, one of 23 students from the mountain kingdom of Bhutan. \u201cThere are no prejudices, no assumptions.\u201d \nMs. Wangmo, who had to walk several kilometers to submit her application, is the first woman from her village to attend a university.\n\u201cIt was quite a shock to come here,\u201d said Bayan Hisham Salaymeh, who wears a head scarf and is a native of Hebron in the Palestinian territories. The traffic, the different language, even the spicy food was an adjustment. \n\u201cI had never been in a place with so much diversity before,\u201d said Ms. Salaymeh, 21. \nMany of the students had never been abroad before they came to this university. Many had limited English and computer skills and were given a year of preparatory training before starting their formal undergraduate studies.\nAll of them were selected for being dynamic and determined, and for their dedication to making their education count. \n\u201cWe look for the gleam in their eyes,\u201d said Kamal Ahmad, the university\u2019s founder. \u201cWe look for courage, a sense of outrage at injustice, and empathy \u2014 a sense that they are moved by the woes of other people.\u201d\nBorn in Bangladesh and educated in the United States, Mr. Ahmad worked for many years in development organizations and as a lawyer in the United States and Britain. A passionate believer in education, he arranged basic schooling for children in the slums in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka when he was a teenager. \nMr. Ahmad said that educating young women could play a critical role in Asia, where, despite progress in some countries, gender discrimination and stereotyping are still rife.\nMr. Ahmad\u2019s decision to set up a university for women was, in part, a deliberate attempt to help redress some of the gender imbalances in tertiary education. It also builds on the fact that women tend to deploy their skills, income or education to support their families and communities \u2014 and that educating and empowering young women, in particular, is thus likely to benefit their societies as a whole, Mr. Ahmad said.\nTaslima Khanam, who attends the Asian University for Women and is from Chittagong, is studying public health with the goal of helping the government of Bangladesh combat medical issues. \nSumpa Sarkar, also from Bangladesh, plans to get a doctorate in politics and become a professor. \u201cI want to share my knowledge with other people,\u201d she said by telephone from the French city of Reims, where she and Ms. Khanam are on a one-year exchange program at the prestigious Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques.\nThere are also young women like Mowmita Basak Mow, a native of Chittagong, who, like so many of the women here, exudes confidence and enthusiasm that is likely to help her go far.\nKubra Panahzada is one of 40 students from Afghanistan, who, before she came to Chittagong, set herself up as a liaison between nongovernmental groups and companies offering spare parts and other supplies.\n\u201cA friend of mine in Kabul is a businessman \u2014 and I thought, if he can do this, why not me?\u201d she said. \n\u201cI want to help others as well as myself,\u201d Ms. Panahzada, 24, added. \u201cI am the future of my country.\u201d\nMr. Ahmad said that the Asian University for Women was not only about academic training and exposing students to other cultures and religions, but it is also about giving hundreds of young women the confidence to challenge established assumptions about themselves and others. \nMeherun Ahmed, who teaches social sciences at the university, said that the young women were often timid and inhibited when they arrived; some were even depressed. For many, being encouraged to think independently and critically, rather than learning by rote, is new and takes time and adjustment. \n\u201cBut there\u2019s a real fighting spirit,\u201d Ms. Ahmed said. \u201cIf you look at them now, you wouldn\u2019t believe the difficulties they had.\u201d\nThe Asian University for Women has received financial backing and other high-profile support from around the world. Its chancellor, for example, is Cherie Blair, the wife of Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. Mrs. Blair is an international human rights lawyer and campaigner for women\u2019s equality. \nOn the financial front, donations of about $50 million have come from individual donors and organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the U.S. State Department. In May, the IKEA Foundation committed $5 million to sponsoring 100 students for five years.\nThe Bangladeshi government, whose female foreign minister, Dipu Moni, is a trustee of the university, has made available a large plot of land on the outskirts of Chittagong.\nThere, a new campus is slowly emerging from the rugged terrain, with the help of a work force that includes women as well as men.\nOnce the new complex is finished, there will be room for 3,000 students. But the going is slow, and the funding is hard to obtain, so completion remains a long way off. Until then, the lack of space in the existing campus is a major hurdle to expansion.\nA milestone for the fledgling outfit, meanwhile, comes next May, when the first group of students \u2014 138 in all \u2014 graduates.\nThere are dreams of jobs with international companies, of postgraduate degrees, of setting up businesses and nongovernmental organizations, and of promoting women\u2019s education back home.\nAmong the expected 2013 graduates is Nazneen, 26. Already, her studies have taken her from her home in the Hunza Valley, in the mountainous far north of Pakistan, to Stanford University, where she took part in a summer academic program last year. Nazneen, who uses only one name, is majoring in politics, philosophy and economics and has also done an internship at the World Bank. Her next goal is to get a master\u2019s degree.\nAs for Ms. Salaymeh, the student from Hebron, she has embraced the diversity that shocked her when she arrived. The conflict in and around the Palestinian territories, she said, is \u201csuffocating\u201d \u2014 and she is determined to help change that once she returns, by helping people become more aware of the world outside.\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of another place on earth,\u201d she said, \u201cthat needs my help as much as my home country.\u201d",

    "text": "Migratory Hearts\n2012-04-26T20:31:09.000Z\nAt the end of Nell Freudenberger\u2019s second novel, \u201cThe Newlyweds,\u201d we encounter the following sentence: \u201cI believe that it is only by sharing our stories that we truly become one community.\u201d\nA worthy objective, surely. Nonetheless we\u2019re on tricky ground here, and a little probing on our part is called for. The sentence quoted above is in fact part of a Starbucks \u201cReach for the Stars\u201d writing competition entry attributed to the novel\u2019s protagonist, Amina, a Bangladeshi woman who has immigrated to America. But Amina\u2019s entry, it turns out, was not actually written by Amina. It was written, and submitted, by Kim, an American cousin of Amina\u2019s American husband, George. Kim is a yoga instructor. She is a storyteller, a bit of a liar. Like Freudenberger herself, she has spent time in South Asia. And Kim is held up, at least partly, as a stand-in for the author:\n\u201c \u2018But you always wear Indian clothes,\u2019 Amina said.\n\u201cKim laughed. \u2018I wear my own version. This kind of thing.\u2019 She indicated the bulky sweater she was wearing over an unseasonable cotton dress and a pair of black tights. \u2018But trust me \u2014 I look stupid in a sari.\u2019 \u201d\nFreudenberger is aware of the pitfalls she faces in telling us Amina\u2019s tale, and she wants us to be aware of them too. If Kim has invented a competition-\u00adwinning story as Amina, about Amina, without Amina\u2019s permission, and with various inaccuracies, what, Freudenberger invites us to ask, has Freudenberger done?\nAt stake here isn\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 the question of authenticity, which is a red herring: nationalities, ethnicities, genders and even species do not \u201cown\u201d the right to fictional narratives spoken in what purport to be their voices. Such a proposition, taken to its logical extreme, would reduce fiction to autobiography, and while fiction may well be alive and kicking in the belly of many an auto\u00adbiography, to confine fiction solely to that domain would be madness.\nNo, the more pressing issue is that of verisimilitude, truthlikeness, the illusion of being real, a quality without which fiction that adheres to the conventions of what is commonly called realism (a problematic term, but useful shorthand for the more cumbersome \u201clet\u2019s try not to draw attention to the fact that this is all made up\u201d-ism) starts to feel to its audience like an ill-fitting and spasmodic sock puppet.\nFor despite the subversive wink embodied in Kim \u2014 her name of course brings to mind a certain Kipling character who could blend in with the natives but risked occasionally getting caught \u2014 the experience of reading \u201cThe Newlyweds\u201d remains substantially the experience of reading a work in the realist vein. This is a third-\u00adperson account that hews closely to Amina\u2019s point of view. Truthlikeness is thus important to its ambitions.\nAnd Freudenberger brings impressive attributes to bear in her attempt to achieve it: a powerful sense of empathy, of being able to imagine what it is to be someone else, to feel what someone else feels; an effective but unfussy writing style that avoids drawing attention to itself; and an international sensibility, which allows her to write about places outside America not as peripheral \u2014 mere playgrounds for American characters \u2014 but as central to themselves.\nThe novel begins with Amina recently settled in Rochester, checking for her green card in her new mailbox \u2014 new, as George says, because of: \u201cThugs. Potheads. Smoking weed and destroying private property.\u201d This vandalism is no directed, racist attack, but a continuing, community\u00adwide problem, one of many symptoms revealing an America where things aren\u2019t as good as they used to be.\nBut the past hasn\u2019t exactly been wonderful either, not for Amina, and not for George, as may go without saying for a couple who meet online across continents through AsianEuro.com and agree, with barely any physical interaction \u2014 and despite obvious differences in nationality, culture and religious upbringing \u2014 to wed.\nAmina and George do have things in common. A certain earnestness. Practicality. The desire to start a family. And, though both try to keep this hidden: abandoned and unfruitful romantic entanglements with \u201ccousins\u201d that, spilling suddenly into the present, threaten to under\u00admine their marriage.\nOn Amina\u2019s side there is Nasir. Handsome, tempting and loyal to Amina\u2019s increasingly insolvent parents, he has returned to Bangladesh from a stint overseas that included a flirtation with a more conservative, politicized and \u2014 to Amina \u2014 off-putting form of Islam. Though he is like family, Nasir is not a blood relative but the orphaned son of Amina\u2019s father\u2019s best friend and comrade-in-arms against brutal Pakistani forces in Bangladesh\u2019s 1971 war of independence.\nGeorge\u2019s beautiful cousin Kim is, like Nasir, a biologically plausible mate, in her case because she was adopted. Also like Nasir, she is back from a sojourn abroad, which included minor roles as an exotic extra in Bollywood films and a real-life marriage to a rich Indian and rather compatible lover who, Kim says, \u201ccould make me, you know, like every time.\u201d\nSet largely in Dhaka and Rochester, with stopovers in New York City and rural Bangladesh, the love polyhedron that is \u201cThe Newlyweds\u201d is at heart a tale of never-\u00adending migrations. Its world is full of mirrors, the refracted similarities conjured up by globalization. Upstate New Yorkers wear elements of South Asian garb to yoga studios, and a young man pulls a Bangladeshi rickshaw in \u201ca lungi and a threadbare black T-shirt with a picture of the Sydney Opera House in neon green.\u201d Of the United States immigration bureaucracy, Freudenberger writes: \u201cNone of it made any sense. . . . Amina had expected better of America.\u201d In Bangladesh even hospitals require bribes. And everywhere there is debt, pressing down hard, and uncertainty, especially over jobs.\nBut differences remain, and one of these lies in attitudes toward relationships between younger adults and the elderly. The final third of the novel recounts Amina\u2019s return to Bangladesh and her attempts to bring her parents to America \u2014 not just to America, but to live with her and George in their house. George is initially less than thrilled by this idea. His aunt Cathy, on the other hand, grows tearful at the thought: \u201cI think about what\u2019s going to happen to me. With the diabetes and my heart. . . . What I mean is \u2014 it\u2019s wonderful to have a child who wants to look after you.\u201d\nAt moments the truthlikeness of \u201cThe Newlyweds\u201d falters, when its perspectives seem to belong more properly to its author than to Amina. Yet as Freudenberger writes (of Amina, but perhaps also of herself): \u201cShe had the strange feeling she was lying, even as she told . . . the truth.\u201d And truths are indeed present in this novel \u2014 in its cleareyed openness and compassion toward the world, in its nuanced and human representation of Muslim characters and their varying Islams, and in the under\u00adstanding and sympathy it displays for the nostalgia of migrants, which is to say for all human beings, even those who are born and die in the same town and travel only in time.",

    "text": "Looking to Frontier Markets for Next Big Thing in Investing\n2012-04-30T03:37:50.000Z\nThe difficulty with investing in the next big thing is that it is often not recognized as that until after it has become a current or former big thing. Before its arrival, it tends to be seen only as a crazy, risky thing or nothing at all.\nEmerging-market portfolio managers specialize in finding the next big thing. But after the transformation of many economies in Asia and Latin America in the past two decades and the strong returns and mainstream popularity of their markets, what\u2019s left to be found?\nHow about stock markets in Africa, the Middle East and Asian countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka? Investment advisers who focus on the developing world contend that many of these so-called frontier markets, especially in Africa, offer similar opportunities to the fledgling markets of earlier generations.\n\u201cAfrica is going to be the next big growth story that\u2019s largely undiscovered,\u201d said Larry Seruma, manager of the Nile Pan Africa Fund, a U.S. mutual fund that holds shares in companies that are based in the region or that do substantial business there. \u201cIt can supplant Brazil, China and Russia if its potential is realized,\u201d he said.\nThat\u2019s a big if, and contemplating Africa\u2019s many problems only makes it seem bigger. There is desperate poverty, disease and hunger, compounded by other scourges that limit opportunities for Africans to improve their lives: political instability, deficient education systems and in some cases longstanding military conflict.\nBut the case for the region and frontier markets elsewhere is precisely that they have just set out on the path to economic and social progress and still have a long way to go. That is the same journey made by the big emerging economies of today. It\u2019s barely four decades since Chinese farms were decollectivized, for instance, and less than two decades since Brazilian inflation was running at more than 40 percent a month.\n\u201cFrontier markets are often in a much earlier state of economic development than larger emerging markets and may have only recently opened to foreign investing,\u201d said Mark Mobius, one of the pioneers of investing in the developing world, who directs emerging-market operations at Franklin Templeton, the fund management company. \u201cThis helps explain their high growth potential. Newer markets typically have more room to grow, and the search for growth potential amid acute global volatility is encouraging many investors to expand their horizons.\u201d\nA recent report by Citigroup identified 11 economies expected to show exceptional growth through the middle of the century, including two of the usual suspects, China and India. Most of the others are frontier markets \u2014 Bangladesh, Iraq, Mongolia, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Vietnam \u2014 or else minor emerging markets that managers of frontier portfolios sometimes invest in, like Egypt and the Philippines.\nAdvocates of investing in places like these expect them to become the markets of tomorrow. As for today and yesterday, well, that\u2019s a different story. The MSCI frontier markets index lost about two-thirds of its value during the global collapse of 2008 and 2009.\nThat is slightly worse than MSCI\u2019s indexes of global emerging and mature markets, but where frontier markets really suffer in comparison is in the period since then. The recovery in frontier markets has been much shallower, leaving the index at less than half of its 2008 high, while the other two indexes have recovered nearly all of their lost ground.\nPradipta Chakrabortty, a manager of the Harding Loevner Frontier Emerging Markets Fund, attributes the weakness, particularly in Africa, to the political turmoil of the Arab Spring revolts and to a run of economic and financial hardship, not there but to the north.\n\u201cAfrica has a lot of capital coming in from Europe,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn 2010 it started flowing into frontier markets, but the recovery got nipped in the bud because of the sovereign debt crisis.\u201d\nMr. Chakrabortty pointed out, though, that some deep-pocketed investors continued to funnel money into frontier markets. Chinese enterprises are making huge purchases of industrial and agricultural assets in places like Africa and Vietnam.\nWhenever other investors decide to join them, there are three themes that fund managers expect to drive returns for years to come: growth of a middle-class consumer society, with all the products and services that are its trappings; production and export of natural resources; and development of infrastructure, including the transportation and communication networks required for the success of companies involved in the other two themes.\nMr. Chakrabortty finds some of the best opportunities these days in Africa and the Middle East and in Vietnam and Bangladesh, where labor is less expensive than elsewhere in Asia. His portfolio is heavily invested in consumer-oriented stocks like Safaricom, a Kenyan telephone service provider, and Equity Bank, also in Kenya. Other selections include Squire Pharmaceuticals in Bangladesh and First Bank of Nigeria.\nMr. Mobius sees encouraging prospects for frontier markets pretty much everywhere. He said he was \u201coptimistic about the long-term growth potential in many countries\u201d in Africa and added that \u201cwe must not overlook Latin American countries such as Colombia and Peru, the countries in Eastern Europe, such as Romania, and countries in Asia such as Vietnam, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\u201d\nMr. Seruma focuses on Africa, but he does not feel the need to invest there to capture the continent\u2019s promise. His portfolio includes holdings like African Oil, which has discovered reserves in Kenya but has a stock listed in Canada, and Tullow Oil, which is listed in Britain and has energy assets in Ghana and Uganda.\nHis fund also owns developed-frontier hybrids like East African Breweries, which is half owned by the global beverage conglomerate Diageo, and Nestl\u00e9 Nigeria. Among the pure African stocks he favors are Guaranty Trust Bank in Nigeria and Flour Mills of Nigeria, a producer of basic foods.\n\u201cAs more capital gets employed\u201d in the markets he follows, \u201cyou\u2019re going to see returns catch up with the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Seruma predicted. As for how long it will take for them to become a big thing, he is uncertain. \u201cYou have to focus on the long-term growth story,\u201d he said, \u201cand be a patient investor.\u201d",

    "text": "On Jackson Heights Sidewalks, a Treat\u2019s Messy Aftermath\n2012-08-13T02:09:13.000Z\nOn a stroll through the busy streets of Jackson Heights, Queens, Sahadev Poudel kept gesturing at the ground with disgust. He stopped on the sidewalks in front of sari boutiques and Indian grocery stores, pointing out stains that looked like dried blood.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all over the place,\u201d said Mr. Poudel, 33, who immigrated from Nepal in 2004. \u201cThis is completely bad behavior that we brought from our hometown.\u201d\nThe sidewalks of New York have long been blotted by black blobs where chewing gum met its demise. But the reddish-brown splotches that trouble Mr. Poudel are seemingly unique to the 74th Street commercial district, and they are causing friction among the South Asians who eat, work and shop there.\nThese are the marks of paan.\nAt a dollar each, paan has become a popular after-dinner treat in Jackson Heights. It is made by folding dried fruits, nuts and pastes into a betel leaf, a member of the pepper family. Some people like a sweet type of paan with candy-coated fennel seeds and rose petal preserves, chomping on it to freshen their breath or swallowing it to help digestion. Others go for paan with cured tobacco, despite warnings about blackened gums and oral cancer.\nWhatever the mix, paan loses its flavor in a matter of minutes \u2014 leading to a messy end. To the chagrin of Jackson Heights shopkeepers, some passers-by spit half-chewed betel leaves and saliva onto the sidewalks, just as they did in their native countries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s now becoming an icon of Jackson Heights,\u201d said Mr. Poudel, who runs an Internet radio station aimed at Nepalis in New York.\nPaan dyes the saliva a reddish brown, giving it a bloodlike hue that may, in fact, be enhanced by traces of blood, since chewing tobacco can cause gums to bleed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d said Tala Haider, 16, who grew up in Pakistan and lives in Flushing. He said he occasionally bought sweet paan in Jackson Heights, but would never spit on sidewalks. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing blood on the street,\u201d he said, \u201cand it just makes you sick.\u201d\nSpitting in public carries a fine of at least $200, said Alexandra Waldhorn, a spokeswoman for the health department. But shop owners say they have never seen anyone receive a violation.\nOnce paan spittle hits the sidewalk, the city does not come to wash it away. Kathy Dawkins, a spokeswoman for the Sanitation Department, said it did not remove stains, paan or otherwise, from sidewalks. But she promised that the city would \u201cpay closer attention\u201d to the issue.\nThe stains regularly set off debates in Jackson Heights, which attracts visitors from a mix of paan-chewing countries like Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. Many are quick to lay the blame for the ubiquitous blemishes on any nationality but their own. Older immigrants privately scold newcomers for clinging to the bad habits of their homeland.\nOn a recent night, a green neon sign with the word \u201cPAN\u201d \u2014 a variation of the typical spelling \u2014 glowed in the window of the Kabab King restaurant at 37th Road and 73rd Street. At a stand inside the restaurant, a worker folded betel leaves for a steady stream of customers.\u00a0Asked about the stains outside Kabab King, the worker, Mr. Abdul Malek, denied that his customers spit in public. He then added that 95 percent of his customers are from Pakistan, not his native Bangladesh.\nMD Yousuf, who manages the paan shop and is from Pakistan, estimated he sold about 100 too 200 pieces of paan a week.\nOne of those Pakistani customers, Mirza Ali, said he stopped by Kabab King two or three times each week to pick up sweet paan. It is a two-hour round-trip drive from Mr. Ali\u2019s home in West Babylon, on Long Island, but he said the unique flavor was worth it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good enjoyment,\u201d Mr. Ali, 43, said with a smile.\nSidewalks are not the only victims of paan.\nShiv Dass, president of the Jackson Heights Indian Merchants Association, said customers sometimes entered his two clothing stores and unintentionally drooled the red juice onto his merchandise.\nHe cannot easily remove paan stains, so he ends up discarding most of the soiled clothes. \u201cThat stuff doesn\u2019t come out,\u201d he said.\nMr. Dass and Mr. Poudel have proposed signs that would discourage paan spitting, perhaps written in South Asian languages like Bengali, Hindi and Urdu.\nEmad Choudhury, who moved from Bangladesh in 1978, said he wanted to educate newer immigrants about American social customs. Mr. Choudhury, a car salesman, is organizing a convention this month in Boston that he said would draw 5,000 Bengali immigrants from across the United States. It will be a good opportunity to spread his message.\nFor now, however, store owners are suffering the consequences of paan spittle. The employees at the Delhi Heights restaurant on 74th Street, not far from Mr. Yusuf\u2019s stand, said that they scrubbed the sidewalk with bleach every day but that doing so did not always remove the stubborn spots.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good for the customer or anyone else,\u201d said Suman Oli, 27, an assistant manager at the restaurant. \u201cThat\u2019s a very bad habit.\u201d",

    "text": "This Prom Has Everything, Except for Boys\n2012-05-01T16:10:31.000Z\nHAMTRAMCK, Mich. \u2014 The prom countdown was nearly complete, the do-it-yourself Greek columns, pink and white tulle bows and plastic flutes with the \u201cOnce Upon a Dream\u201d logo awaiting the evening of evenings.\nBut as she looked at her reflection in the mirror, her one-shoulder lavender gown matching the elaborate hijab that framed her face in a cascade of flowers \u2014 a style learned on YouTube \u2014 Tharima Ahmed knew that what lay ahead was more than simply a prom.\nAs organizer of Hamtramck High School\u2019s first all-girl prom, which conforms to religious beliefs forbidding dating, dancing with boys or appearing without a head scarf in front of males, Tharima, 17, was forging a new rite of passage for every teenage Muslim girl who had ever spent prom night at home, wistfully watching the limousines roll by.\n\u201cHi, guys \u2014 I mean girls!\u201d Tharima, a Bangladeshi-American, exuded into the microphone as 100 girls \u2014 Yemeni-American, Polish-American, Palestinian-American, Bosnian-American and African-American \u2014 began pouring into the hall on Bangladesh Avenue.\nThis was prom, Hamtramck-style: the dense scrappy working-class city of 22,500 encircled by Detroit, once predominantly German and Polish, has become one of the most diverse small cities in America. Its new soul lay in the music playlist embedded in Rukeih Malik\u2019s iPhone: Lady Gaga, Cobra Starship, the Belgrade-born singer Ana Kokic and The Bilz, a Canadian-South Asian band, singing \u201c2 Step Bhangra.\u201d\nIn this season of wobbly heels and cleavage, the bittersweet transformation of teenagers in jeans and T-shirts into elegant adults barely recognizable to their friends is an anticipated tradition.\nBut at the all-girl prom, there were double double-takes, as some of Tharima\u2019s classmates, normally concealed in a chrysalis of hijab and abaya, the traditional Muslim cloak, literally let their hair down in public for the first time.\nEman Ashabi, a Yemeni-American who helped organize the event, arrived in a ruffled pink gown, her black hair falling in perfect waves, thanks to a curling iron. Like many here, she stunned her friends.\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Oh my god!\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Simone Alhagri, a Yemeni-American junior who was wearing a tight shirred dress. \u201cThis is how you look underneath!\u201d\nThe dance was the denouement of seven months of feverish planning in which a committee raised $2,500, mostly through bake sales. Ignoring the naysayers who could not imagine anyone coming to a prom without boys, Tharima and her friends approached their task systematically, taking a survey of all the girls at Hamtramck High. They found that 65 percent were not able to attend the coed prom because of cultural and religious beliefs. After discussion, the school supported the student-driven alternative.\nIn addition to Muslim girls (and alumnae who never got the opportunity), non-Muslim students wanted to go, too. \u201cI want to support all my girls,\u201d said Sylwia Stanko, who was born in Poland and whose friends are mostly Bengali-American or Arab-American. \u201cI know how important it is to them.\u201d\nThe prom promised \u201cmusic all night, except during dinner and five minutes for prayer.\u201d A former Knights of Columbus hall was transformed into princess-pink perfection.\n\n10 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nTharima placed a huge order for decorations with PromNite.com, including a light-up fountain to which the girls added pink food coloring.\nTharima had dreamed of prom night since her freshman year, squirreling away photographs of ballrooms and ads for tiaras.\nAs Tharima prepared for her big night, her mother, Roushanara Ahmed, recalled the fancy pink sari she wore to an all-girls party in what is now Bangladesh. \u201cI was in high school,\u201d she said, her voice low, eyes softening. \u201cI know her feelings.\u201d\nLike the prom, the city of Hamtramck is a mixer of a different kind. Along Joseph Campau Street, a monumental statue of Pope John Paul II presides over Pope Park, with its festive mural of Krakow. A poster for the television program \u201cBosnian Idol\u201d is displayed in the Albanian Euro Mini Mart, known for homemade yogurt and burek, traditional spinach and meat pies. During her English class, Tharima can hear the call to prayer over loudspeakers from the Islah Islamic Center a few blocks from school.\nDiversity was hard-won: The mosque, one of five in the city, was the subject of controversy in 2004, when some people strenuously objected to the city\u2019s decision to allow it to broadcast prayers five times a day; the city ultimately prevailed, regulating the hours when the call may be sounded.\nIn sharp contrast to earlier immigrants, drawn by the once-thriving auto industry, a quarter of the residents now live below the federal poverty level.\n\u201cPeople here have to work out their difficulties,\u201d said Mayor Karen Majewski, an ethnic historian and Hungarian folk dancer. \u201cThere\u2019s no opportunity to hide in your cul-de-sac.\u201d\nAt Hamtramck High, which has 900 students, many non-Muslims respectfully tuck away their food and water bottles during Ramadan. The prom reflects a broad cultural shift. \u201cTwenty years ago, parents used to pull fifth-grade girls out of school for arranged marriages,\u201d said Chris Bindas, a library aide who brought chocolate-dipped cream puffs to the prom. \u201cNow these same girls are going to college\u201d \u2014 albeit a college close to home, where the girls will continue to live with their parents.\nTharima, who plans to work while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, has applied for 27 scholarships, saving all the rejection letters.\n\u201cThese are my weaknesses,\u201d she said of her financial struggles. \u201cBut they are also my strengths.\u201d\nOn Saturday night, when the strobe lights started, throwing jewels of light around the room, the shy comments of \u201cOh, you look gorgeous!\u201d and \u201cOoh, I love your shoes!\u201d gave way to the sheer joy of music, the girls fist-pumping in unison, some discarding their heels and some hugging one another in disbelief.\nShortly before 8, it was time for prayer, the spaghetti straps and empire waists disappearing under hijabs and abayas, a prayer rug taking its place on the dance floor.\nAfterward, when the prom royalty was announced, it was no surprise \u2014 except to her \u2014 that Tharima was pronounced the senior queen, a tiara ceremoniously placed atop her hijab. Amid whoops and shrieks, she struggled to maintain her composure. Her mascara was not so lucky.\nThen the hall erupted with a song by the band 3alawah, and the girls performed a debka, a Middle Eastern circle dance. Everyone held hands, snaking around the dessert buffet and columns decorated with artificial wisteria.\nThe jubilant energy of 100 young women feeling victorious and beautiful filled the room.",

    "text": "Internet Unshackled, Burmese Aim Venom at Ethnic Minority\n2012-06-15T19:34:02.000Z\nBANGKOK \u2014 Over the past year, Myanmar\u2019s government has ended its heavy censorship, allowing citizens unfettered access to a wide variety of Web sites that had been banned during military rule. When the government first began dismantling its Internet controls in August, visits to sites like YouTube soared.\nBut as the poverty-stricken country of 55 million makes a delicate transition to democracy, hateful comments are also flourishing online about a Muslim ethnic group, the Rohingya, that is embroiled in sectarian clashes in western Myanmar that have left more than two dozen people dead.\n\u201cThe lid of authoritarianism has come off, and people finally have the freedom to express themselves,\u201d said U Aung Naing Oo, the author of \u201cDialogue,\u201d a book about conflict resolution in Myanmar\u2019s fractious society. \u201cAll these grievances have come out,\u201d and \u201cthe voices of reason are on the sidelines for now.\u201d\nWhen the discovery of a \u201cRohingya body\u201d was announced Thursday on the Facebook page of the Eleven Media Group, one of the largest private media organizations in Myanmar, one reader, Pyaephyo Aung, wrote that he had been \u201cwaiting for this kind of news for a long time.\u201d Another reader, Ko Nyi, used a racial slur and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not even enough that he is dead.\u201d\nIn online forums, Rohingya are referred to as dogs, thieves, terrorists and various expletives. Commenters urge the government to \u201cmake them disappear\u201d and seem particularly enraged that Western countries and the United Nations are highlighting their plight.\nThe violence in Rakhine State, which borders Bangladesh, has left 29 people dead and more than 2,500 houses burned during the past week, according to officials quoted in the Burmese news media. About 30,000 people have been displaced by the violence, according to the United Nations.\nHarder to measure has been damage to Myanmar\u2019s complex multiethnic fabric as the government of President Thein Sein tries to steer the country toward reconciliation between the military and the people, and between the Bamar majority and the dozens of smaller ethnic groups.\nSo far, the violence has been limited to Rakhine, which is relatively isolated from the rest of the country by a mountain range. But many among those who have posted angry comments on Internet sites have equated the Rohingya with other Muslims scattered around Myanmar. In Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s main city, worshipers at mosques reported that prayer services left out traditional Friday sermons as a precaution against widening the sectarian conflict.\nThe issue of the Rohingya is so delicate that even Myanmar\u2019s leading defender of human rights and democracy, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has been oblique and evasive about the situation. Asked at a news conference on Thursday whether the estimated 800,000 Rohingyas in Myanmar should be given citizenship, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was equivocal. \u201cWe have to be very clear about what the laws of citizenship are and who are entitled to them,\u201d she said in Geneva, which she was visiting as part of a European tour. \u201cAll those who are entitled to citizenship should be treated as full citizens deserving all the rights that must be given to them.\u201d\nDefending the Rohingya, who are stateless and are described by the United Nations as one of the most oppressed minorities in Asia, is politically risky for both Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and Mr. Thein Sein.\nMr. Thein Sein\u2019s government is trying to rein in the news media to limit violence against the Rohingya. A popular publication called Hlyat Ta Pyet was banned this week for an indefinite period after it published what the government judged to be inflammatory coverage of the violence in Rakhine, said U Maung Myint, president of the Burma Media Association, which advocates media freedom.\nThe government has also ordered that all Rakhine-related news go through the censorship board, a rollback to the procedures during military rule. \u201cThis is the worst moment for media since the \u2018civilian\u2019 government assumed power,\u201d Mr. Maung Myint said.\nThe Internet, however, has remained unfettered \u2014 and heavily tilted against the Rohingya. On Facebook and on news sites, there appeared to be very few comments this week defending the Rohingya or calling for reconciliation.\nA United Nations report published in December described the Rohingya as \u201cvirtually friendless\u201d among other ethnic groups in Myanmar. That is a polite assessment.\nThe source of the hatred toward the Rohingya is complex but appears to turn on religion, language, colonial resentment, nationalism and skin color.\nIn 2009, a Burmese diplomat who was then consul general in Hong Kong sent a letter to local newspapers and other diplomatic missions calling the Rohingya \u201cugly as ogres.\u201d The diplomat, U Ye Myint Aung, compared the \u201cdark brown\u201d complexion of Rohingyas with the \u201cfair and soft\u201d skin of the majority of people in Myanmar.\nThe Rohingya are often called \u201cBengali\u201d by their opponents in Myanmar, a term that suggests that they belong in India or Bangladesh.\nAlthough they have been denied citizenship and are subjected to \u201cforced labor, extortion, restriction on freedom of movement, the absence of residence rights, inequitable marriage regulations and land confiscation,\u201d according to the United Nations, the government has allowed many of them to vote, including in the country\u2019s first elections after military rule, in 2010.\nLike the Roma of Europe, they are not wanted in either Myanmar or neighboring Bangladesh. United Nations officials in Geneva said Friday that Bangladeshi border guards were pushing back boatloads of people trying to flee. The boats, laden with women, children and others wounded in the violence, have been left drifting in the broad Naf River delta between the two countries, short of food and water, said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nThe provenance of the Rohingya is as difficult to trace as that of many of Myanmar\u2019s other ethnic groups: they appear to be a mixture of Arabs, Moors, Turks, Persians, Moguls and Pathans, according to the United Nations. Myanmar\u2019s government counts more than 130 ethnicities in the country. The Rohingya are not on that list.\nMany online commentators in Myanmar have called for the expulsion of the Rohingya \u2014 or worse. When the Eleven Media Group reported Thursday that a woman\u2019s corpse was spotted floating in a river, but did not disclose the ethnicity of the victim, one reader said he was confused. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should be happy or sad,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t know what nationality she is.\u201d",

    "text": "In Myanmar, True Comfort in the Food\n2012-10-15T20:35:54.000Z\nEACH time the Canadian photographer and writer Naomi Duguid traveled to Myanmar from 2008 to 2011, researching the country\u2019s food traditions, she knew she had to cram in as much eating and learning as possible. \n\u201cI had to assume that every trip might be the last,\u201d she said, alluding to the country\u2019s long epoch of military rule, during which contact between ordinary citizens and outsiders was risky. If she had been caught in her usual research mode \u2014 lingering for days in outdoor markets, photographing street food and ingredients, learning from home cooks \u2014 she could have been branded a journalist and barred from the country. But having documented the food of Thailand, China, Laos, Cambodia, India, Pakistan, Tibet, Malaysia and Singapore, she was determined to \u201ccomplete the journey\u201d in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. \n\u201cThe country had become a black hole\u201d since the first time she visited, in 1980, she said. \u201cBut food is the last refuge for people under siege.\u201d \nShe could not have assumed, or even imagined, that by the time her new book, \u201cBurma: Rivers of Flavor,\u201d was finally published last month, a democratically elected government would rule the country, the activist Daw Aung San Suu Kyi would be freed from house arrest and elected to Parliament or the country\u2019s longstanding barriers against outside influence (there are few Internet connections and no McDonald\u2019s or Starbucks in Myanmar) would begin to soften. To her surprise, the book is now a timely, as well as absorbing and gorgeous, guide to a cuisine that has remained relatively unknown and untouched. \nFor fans of Southeast Asian cuisines like Thai and Vietnamese, discovering Burmese food is the adult equivalent of finding a new playground, right in your neighborhood. The familiar profile of hot, sour, sweet and salty is there, but in new combinations and with new cornerstones: crisp-fried garlic and shallots, Indian spices, edible tea leaves, sweet-hot red chile powders and dark, smoky palm sugar. \n\u201cOur food is not as famous in the world as Thai or Indian,\u201d said Thataw Tabun, one of the organizers of an annual Burmese food fair in Queens that is avidly tracked by New Yorkers who love Southeast Asian food. \u201cBut our aunties are just as good cooks.\u201d \nFor the festival, strings are pulled and heaven and earth moved to bring in ingredients like preserved tea leaves, baby ginger and fresh roselle, a tangy relative of the hibiscus, with green leaves that are steamed or fried with chile powder. Mr. Tabun, who is in his 30s, lived in Yangon until he was a teenager, and like most of the community here, uses \u201cBurma\u201d and \u201cBurmese\u201d when referring to his native country and culture. The name comes from the largest ethnic group in the country, the Bamar, but there are many others, including the Kachin, Shan, Chin and Rakhine, all with distinct cultures and cooking styles that reflect the mixed topography of the land.\nMyanmar sits on the eastern edge of the Indian Ocean, streaked top to bottom with wide river valleys \u2014 the Irrawaddy, the Sittaung, the Salween \u2014 where most of the population lives. Its long coastline stretches up from Thailand and curves back to Bangladesh. \nBut its bulk is in the north, wedged between India and China. Many Burmese dishes carry the scents and flavors of both. In a stew, you might find the okra and turmeric of Bengal; in a salad, the tart vegetables and dried shrimp of Yunnan, the part of China that borders Myanmar. Everywhere, crisped shallots and garlic, bracing turmeric, tangy lime, crunchy roasted peanuts and chile pastes infuse the most basic dishes with wild contrast and crunch. \n\u201cThoke \u2014 you could call them salads \u2014 are the dishes that leap out to me in Burma,\u201d said Ms. Duguid, 62, as we sliced round, deep-purple Asian shallots during a recent cooking session. Since she has produced authoritative books on Southeast Asia, western China and the entire world\u2019s ways of cooking rice and flatbreads, when she finds something distinctive, it is likely to be very interesting indeed. \n\u201cSalad\u201d turns out to be an accurate but inadequate translation of thoke, just as \u201csauce\u201d is inadequate for \u201csalsa\u201d when it comes to Mexican food. Thoke are lavishly seasoned combinations of raw and cooked vegetables, fresh herbs, chopped nuts, toasted seeds and often a single rich ingredient like pork cracklings or dried shrimp. \u201cThe Burmese want a little bit of everything in each bite,\u201d she said, explaining why thoke ingredients are cut small and always tossed together with the hands. \n\n8 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nFruits are used in thoke in their sweet-sour state: often pomelo, the cousin of grapefruit, or tomatoes, which as in most of Southeast Asia are used when still small and streaked with pale green. \nOur cooking session ended up completely dedicated to gyin thoke, a lively ginger salad that can have as many as 20 ingredients, each contributing an element of contrast and surprise. In Myanmar, it would be made with shavings of young ginger; Ms. Duguid has come up with an excellent workaround with shreds of sushi-style pickled ginger. \n\u201cObsessing about authenticity has become this competitive sport,\u201d she said. \u201cCooks in Burma, or anywhere, will always use what they can get their hands on and what tastes good.\u201d \nMs. Duguid\u2019s work, both in her new book and in six previous books with her former husband, Jeffrey Alford, has more in common with anthropology than with usual notions of food and travel writing. In \u201cFlatbreads and Flavors,\u201d they reached around the world to find kinships among pita and pizza, tortillas and tandoor breads. In \u201cSeductions of Rice,\u201d they managed to explore all of Asia (with a few detours to the Mediterranean) by diving deeply into every place and every way that rice is grown, polished, processed and eaten. \n\u201cWhen I look at her books, I despair that I am just dancing over the surface of these cuisines that I am trying to explore,\u201d said Dave Cook, who writes the Eating in Translation blog and has traveled extensively in Asia. \u201cShe goes deep.\u201d Her books always include thorough discussions of geography, ethnography, religion, history and agriculture, along with descriptions of spices and aromatics and recipes so alluring that you can almost smell them on the page. \nThe photography is just as evocative. Her images of Myanmar\u2019s ancient Buddhist temples, its monks and markets, and especially its women, who do most of the selling and cooking of food, connect the written word to real people and real food. In her books, a rusted tin can of glowing fresh chiles or a pile of shallots, carefully arranged by a teenage girl with a saucy grin, can tell you as much about a curry as the recipe. \nBut, she said, she has always been careful to keep a safe distance between herself and the people she photographed or interviewed. \u201cWherever we went, our mantra was first, do no harm,\u201d she said, referring to the many places she had worked where, simply by asking questions or taking pictures, Westerners could bring trouble. \u201cAnd the second was, keep the generals out of the kitchen,\u201d she said, meaning: keep the work focused on food, even when politics, ethnic clashes and boundary disputes threatened to enter the picture.\nAfter more than 30 years of near-constant travel in turbulent places like Tibet, Bangladesh and Myanmar, Ms. Duguid is convinced of the importance of food in the lives of ordinary people in extraordinary situations. Inside their homes, at their stoves and tables, is often the only place where people feel safe. Mr. Tabun, while declining to comment on life in Yangon under military rule, said the city\u2019s residents could always find comfort in a morning bowl of mohinga, a rich, aromatic breakfast soup that is often called the Burmese national dish.\nEven in politically turbulent places, as a lone woman who looks like any other Western tourist with a camera, Ms. Duguid said her presence in a food market generally went unnoticed. But the key for making real contact with cooks has always been to not ask questions too soon. \u201cI try to hang around and not need anything from anyone for as long as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter a while, people seem to decide that I\u2019m harmless, either because they think I am a lunatic, or because I have this wide-open peasant face.\u201d\nNow, Ms. Duguid divides her year between Toronto and Chiang Mai in northern Thailand, which was her base for research trips to Myanmar. The two regions share a dish, a rich coconut-milk chicken curry with springy egg noodles, called khao soi in Thai and kout swe in Burmese, that is a touchstone for lovers of Burmese food. \n\u201cThat balance of rich and tangy and spicy gets me every time,\u201d said the New York chef Sara Jenkins, who recently cooked an all-Burmese dinner at her restaurant, Porsena, although her culinary grounding is strictly Italian.\nOne appetizer was a dish of tiny dried anchovies, as slim as spaghetti, fried crisp and dusted with garlic and chile powder. \u201cThey tasted Italian as much as Burmese to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun of getting out of your comfort zone and into the world.\u201d",

    "text": "Crisis in Myanmar Over Buddhist-Muslim Clash\n2012-06-10T16:32:28.000Z\nBANGKOK \u2014 Myanmar declared a state of emergency on Sunday in a western state where at least 17 people have been killed this month in violence between Buddhists and Muslims.\nThe violence poses another obstacle to the government of President Thein Sein as he tries to open up the country after years of isolation under a military junta and steer it toward democracy.\nSoldiers and police officers are trying to restore order in villages in Rakhine State where the clashes have left many people wounded and 500 homes burned on Friday and Saturday alone. Four people were wounded in clashes on Sunday, The Associated Press reported.\nMr. Thein Sein, a former general, announced the state of emergency on national television on Sunday evening. It was unclear what the practical consequences of emergency rule would be; the military and the police in Myanmar, also known as Burma, already wield significant power despite the country\u2019s move toward democracy.\nMr. Thein Sein has made national reconciliation between the Burmese majority and the country\u2019s vast patchwork of ethnic groups a priority of his presidency.\nBut the tensions near the border with Bangladesh fall outside the scope of reconciliation efforts because they involve people from a Muslim ethnic group, the Rohingya, whose members the government does not recognize as citizens.\nTensions in the area had been building for several months, said Chris Lewa, an expert on the Rohingya who has championed their cause.\nMyanmar\u2019s government has not proposed a solution for the 800,000 Rohingya, who live in desperate conditions that resemble refugee camps and make up one of the largest groups of stateless people in Asia.\nThere are fears inside Myanmar that the clashes could widen into a broader religious conflict. In recent days, Buddhist and Muslim groups have held relatively small separate protests in Myanmar\u2019s main city, Yangon.\nIn one sign that passions are running high, the Web site of the Eleven Media Group, a publisher of one of the country\u2019s leading weekly newspapers, displayed a string of hateful comments about Muslims from readers.\n\u201cTerrorist is terrorist,\u201d wrote one reader who signed in as Maungpho. \u201cJust kill them.\u201d\nU Ko Ko Gyi, a former political prisoner who is helping lead efforts to ease religious tensions, said he was concerned by the \u201cemotional response\u201d to the clashes. \u201cWe have to calm down and find an intellectual solution to the problem,\u201d he said.\nMuslims leaders have urged calm in recent days, and the National League for Democracy, the party of the Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, issued a statement on Saturday calling on the government to restore order. About 90 percent of Myanmar\u2019s population is Buddhist; Muslims account for about 4 percent.\nFor now, the government appears to be confident that the clashes can be contained.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not likely that this will spread,\u201d said U Tin Maung Thann, the president of a research organization in Yangon who is helping lead the government\u2019s peace talks with other ethnic groups. \u201cThe Muslim community within Burma proper have long experience living with the Buddhist majority.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Thein Sein\u2019s government has faced protests in several cities over electric service that has been cut off, and there have been strikes at factories outside Yangon. The government\u2019s tolerance for these demonstrations has reinforced the idea that Myanmar is moving away from years of military dictatorship, but the protests also underscore the long list of challenges and demands facing Mr. Thein Sein as he tries to carry out his changes.\nThe violence in Rakhine State was set off by the rape and murder of a Buddhist last month, said Ms. Lewa, which prompted a series of \u201crevenge attacks.\u201d On June 3, 10 Muslim men were said to have been dragged from a bus and killed. On Friday, mobs of Muslim men attacked Buddhist villagers, leaving seven people dead, according to the Burmese news media.\nPhotographs over the weekend showed villagers in the affected area carrying swords and sharpened bamboo poles.\nIn this generally impoverished country, the Rohingya, many of whom who have been in Myanmar for several generations, are perhaps the most vulnerable minority, plagued by what one United Nations official has called a \u201cchronic crisis.\u201d\nThey are not allowed to own land, suffer frequent food shortages and are technically restricted from travel outside Rakhine, which borders Bangladesh. Thousands have fled the country by boat in recent years to seek work in Malaysia and other neighboring countries. There are also hundreds of thousands of Rohingya on the Bangladeshi side of the border.\nThe Rohingya issue stirs a strong nationalist response even among the most liberal members of Burmese society. Mr. Ko Ko Gyi, who spent 18 years in prison for opposing the previous military government, said that the Rohingya were not one of the country\u2019s accepted nationalities and that the \u201cinternational community\u201d must find a solution to the problem of their statelessness.\n\u201cThis a question of national sovereignty,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who wants Myanmar citizenship will have to learn one of Myanmar\u2019s national languages and learn about our culture.\u201d\nA United Nations survey in Myanmar in June 2008 found that more than half of the Rohingya were illiterate.\nThere is no hard-and-fast definition of what constitutes the Rohingya. Muslims living in the northernmost reaches of Rakhine State are generally called Rohingya regardless of their ancestry. Government officials often refer to them as Bengalis.",

    "text": "Canadian Police Search Construction Company in Montreal\n2012-04-14T00:30:23.000Z\nOTTAWA \u2014 The offices of SNC-Lavalin, the Canadian construction and engineering company that had close ties to the regime of Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan dictator, was searched by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Friday.\nEmployees were told by e-mail to evacuate the building, in downtown Montreal, as the police moved in with a search warrant. While leaving, some employees told reporters that the search appeared to be concentrated on a floor with the executive offices.\nIn a brief statement, SNC-Lavalin said that the search warrant was related to \u201ccertain individuals who are not or are no longer employed by the company.\u201d It added that it was cooperating with all investigations.\nA spokesman for the mounted police confirmed that the raid was under way but declined to discuss the investigation.\nLate last month, Pierre Duhaime, then the chief executive, left the company after an audit found that he had authorized 56 million Canadian dollars in unauthorized payments to unidentified agents. While the company does not know the purpose of those payments, it said that they did not appear to involve Libya.\nIn February, SNC-Lavalin fired the head of its construction unit and a senior financial executive in that operation and suggested that they had failed to \u201ccomply with our code of ethics and business conduct.\u201d St\u00e9phane Roy, the financial executive who was dismissed, hired Cynthia Vanier, a Canadian consultant, to travel to Libya, where the company was building a prison and other projects, to produce a five-page report that was critical of the NATO-led bombing campaign in support of Libyan rebels. \nIn November, Ms. Vanier was arrested in Mexico on allegations that she was involved in a plot to smuggle Saadi el-Qaddafi, the former Libyan dictator\u2019s son, into Mexico. She denies the allegations and remains jailed.\nThis month, SNC-Lavalin said its construction unit had been temporarily suspended from bidding on projects financed by the World Bank, relates to unspecified allegations about bidding on a bridge project in Bangladesh.",

    "text": "Aid for Children, Facilitated by Wings\n2012-12-25T00:34:02.000Z\nI\u2019M the president of the United States Fund for Unicef, and I travel for a lot of reasons. First and foremost, I go places so I can see firsthand the work that Unicef is doing on the ground. \nI need to go to Darfur, for example, so I can see what life is really like for a child in a camp, and talk to America about what I\u2019ve seen. Those are the most important flights because the children are the most important. But I also have to go to a lot of meetings and speaking engagements, so I\u2019m flying continually.\nI used to fly without thinking about it. But 9/11 changed my ideas about flying. I\u2019ve been flying for business in one job or another for the past 30 years. Nothing horrible has happened. But I fly so much I figure I\u2019m due. I am a white-knuckle flier now, but I really try and hide it. I need to fly. The work that we do demands it, and that\u2019s more important than me not really enjoying flying.\nI have missed my fair share of flights. But sometimes people will try and help out. I was out in Los Angeles and had to fly to Dubai and then take a connecting flight to Bangladesh. When I was in Los Angeles, I was giving a speech that ran a little long, and I hit the Los Angeles freeway in the middle of the day. \nTraffic was horrible. I finally made it to the airport only to discover the Emirates desk closes one hour before takeoff. I was 10 minutes late. I needed to get to Bangladesh, so I figured I had nothing to lose by asking for help.\nThere was a couple at the desk who were also late and they were going bonkers. The people at the desk started walking away, and I just went up to one of them and explained my situation.\nThe woman I was speaking with asked to see my business card to make sure I really was working with Unicef. The next thing I knew she went back to the desk and hand-wrote out my paper work. \nI was really grateful. I can\u2019t say the same for the couple that were still arguing. They didn\u2019t get on the flight. I thought that maybe I should explain my situation. But then I figured silence really can be golden, and just got on the flight.\nOccasionally, a flight can be fun for me. I was headed to Kenya on a British Airways 747 on loan. It was packed with supplies that were going to be distributed in East Africa. We were set to leave from our supply center in Copenhagen with tons of medical supplies and food.\nThe duke and duchess of Cambridge, also known as Prince William and Kate, helped pack the supplies. I had never met them before. I didn\u2019t know if I was supposed to curtsy or what, so I had to learn the proper protocol. I was laughing at myself because I was so gaga about meeting them.\nThe passenger portion of the plane only had 10 people, including myself, aid workers and journalists. All of the supplies were in the cargo hold, luggage compartment and overhead bins. There was a full flight crew because those are the rules. We were like a bunch of kids changing seats all the time and we all ate dinner together, just like at a dinner party.\nI found out that the crew donated their time, as did the crew from U.P.S., who also donated a flight on this same run.\nI do try and remember how good the airlines are to our organization every time I\u2019m on a flight. That still hasn\u2019t helped me pry my white knuckles off the armrest, though. But I\u2019m working on it.",

    "text": "Joining His Father, but Carving Out His Own Path\n2012-01-23T04:52:12.000Z\nWhen Francis Stephen arrived in the United States from Bangladesh two years ago, his father already had a career plan in mind for him, he said.\n\u201cThe first day I came to New York,\u201d Mr. Stephen, 24, recalled, \u201che said, \u2018Look for a job.\u2019\u00a0\u201d His father thought he should become a home health worker, maybe a nurse, he said. \n\u201cHe told me that if I graduate from nursing, I\u2019ll get a job faster,\u201d Mr. Stephen said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to become a nurse.\u201d\nIt was the blood that he did not think he could handle, as well as the other demands of the profession. But more important, Mr. Stephen said, he wanted to carve his own path.\nIn Bangladesh, Mr. Stephen, who says he speaks several languages, had struggled with the British-style educational system that is prevalent in that country. Although he did well in some subjects, doing poorly in others left him feeling so humiliated that he dropped out in the 10th grade, he said. He had great hope that the United States would provide the education that had eluded him.\n\u201cI always wanted to come here,\u201d Mr. Stephen said on a recent chilly morning, bundled up in winter clothing and drinking hot coffee in a White Castle in Astoria, Queens, near his home. \u201cI love the American education system,\u201d he added, almost tripping over his words in his rush to express himself.\nMr. Stephen\u2019s father had immigrated to New York decades earlier, when Mr. Stephen was a baby. His mother had not wanted to leave Bangladesh, he said, so she and his father divorced. His father, who is deaf, remarried.\nWhen Mr. Stephen turned 21, his father sponsored him to come to America, and he jumped at the chance. He now lives in a one-bedroom apartment with his father, in Long Island City.\nHis first order of business was to get his high school equivalency diploma. He picked up the phone and dialed 311, and was told about a free G.E.D. study program at the Jacob A. Riis Neighborhood Settlement House. While taking courses there, he volunteered to help with the 2010 census. His responsibilities included explaining to other South Asian immigrants, who often spoke only Bengali or Hindi, the importance of being counted even if they were undocumented, he said.\nMr. Stephen also volunteered as a tutor for other G.E.D. students, teaching them mathematical concepts and providing support and encouragement. \nAs he cast about for his next step in life, his counselor at the Settlement House steered him to the nonprofit East River Development Alliance in Long Island City in September 2010. There he attended a job-readiness workshop, where he learned office etiquette and how to finesse his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, among other things. He also sought further career counseling. \n\u201cWhen he came to us,\u201d said Shanna Castillo, the workforce development coordinator at the alliance, \u201che was confused or conflicted over whether his focus should be on school or work.\u201d \nMr. Stephen did not want to enter a field simply because others thought he should. He told his counselors that he wanted a career that fulfilled him and gave him a degree of personal satisfaction. \n\u201cHe made the decision to go to school,\u201d Ms. Castillo said. \u201cWe supported that.\u201d \nIn January 2011, Mr. Stephen passed his G.E.D. tests with high marks, and his confidence grew. Working closely with a career counselor, he registered at LaGuardia Community College in March. His tuition was covered by a Pell grant, but he needed help to buy textbooks and school supplies. \nThe alliance referred him to the Community Service Society of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and he received $566.56 to pay for a calculator and textbooks.\nNow, one of his biggest challenges is staying true to himself. He changed his major from nursing to criminal justice, and then back to nursing, he said, to please his father. But he is determined to seize the reins of his academic future. Next semester, he said, he will take a range of liberal arts, social sciences and humanities courses. \nMr. Stephen said he wanted to prove to anyone who might have had doubts about him that they were wrong.\n\u201cI want to prove to them that I can do something,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is my goal.\u201d ",

    "text": "3 Settings, 3 Countries and the World of Women Who Live by Their Bodies\n2012-04-26T23:41:17.000Z\n\u201cI picked up a client. He was 20 or 21 years old. After he was done with me, I had a one-legged man. After him came an old grandpa with a white beard. Right after the old man, I got another customer. He mishandled me, and I got very angry. I told him, \u2018You may never come back to my room.\u2019 More followed after that, about 10 clients all together.\u201d \nThe young woman describing her typical workday in a matter-of-fact tone is one of more than 600 prostitutes who ply their trade in a shabby, multitiered compound known as the City of Joy, in Faridpur, a district in central Bangladesh where prostitution is a vital part of the economy. Her base of operation is a cramped, brightly decorated room on the ground floor of a dirty brick building in a shadowy alley. \nThe City of Joy is one of three settings, each in a different country, visited by the Austrian filmmaker Michael Glawogger in \u201cWhores\u2019 Glory,\u201d his quietly powerful but dispiriting documentary, which compares the world\u2019s oldest profession as practiced from place to place. What does it say about the film\u2019s integrity that its subjects were paid for their participation? Unlike many contemporary films on the subject, \u201cWhores\u2019 Glory\u201d is not an outraged expos\u00e9 of human trafficking, although many of the women are bought and sold, some by their own families. \nLacking a narrator or any commentary, Mr. Glawogger\u2019s self-described \u201ccinematic triptych on prostitution\u201d takes a nonjudgmental attitude toward flesh peddling, wherever it occurs. The film, he writes in the production notes, is the third part of a trilogy that includes the previous well-regarded documentaries \u201cMegacities\u201d and \u201cWorkingman\u2019s Death,\u201d exploring labor in developing countries. \n\u201cProstitution is not to be condemned or defended,\u201d Mr. Glawogger writes. \u201cProstitution simply is. It is like war. War is.\u201d \nThe least oppressive setting is the Fish Tank, a massage parlor/brothel run by Thai-Chinese in Bangkok. Here sex workers are shown visiting a Buddhist shrine and praying for brisk business before punching a time clock and arranging themselves behind a glass window. Customers cluster there, as a manager pressures them to make a choice. When a woman is picked, she and the john disappear into an elevator. Strict guidelines determine how much time and how many activities the client will get for his money. \nRevealing scenes show the women comparing notes. Well-endowed men are not appreciated, because they often cause physical pain. One prostitute complains that African men are sadists and that Indian men stink. In their off hours some visit a bar, where they mingle with gigolos whom they pay for companionship, though it isn\u2019t clear to what degree sex is involved. \nThe most pungent Thai scene, seemingly caught by chance, shows dogs copulating on the street outside the Fish Tank. It reinforces the film\u2019s dispassionate view of sex work as an impersonal, animal transaction. \nIt is a sad leap from glittering Bangkok, where sex for money seems to carry little stigma, to Bangladesh, where the women are supervised by tough, demanding madams. One young john who patronizes the City of Joy says it serves a necessary function: without it men would be raping women on the streets and fornicating with animals.\nHere prostitution, though legal, is looked down upon. It is often a family business carried on from generation to generation. Many of the prostitutes save their money and eventually become madams who buy girls, if they don\u2019t have daughters of their own to train. For one woman, oral sex is taboo because she would be using the same mouth that prays to Allah. When they become too old to sell their bodies, many remain in the compound as cooks and maids. \nThe Mexican part was shot in the red-light district of Reynosa, a city of more than 600,000 across the border from McAllen, Tex. Here many of the women who work are addicted to crack cocaine and are fleeing the law for various crimes. Many pray to a deity called Lady Death for a smooth deliverance. \nThis segment includes the movie\u2019s only sex scene, in which a prostitute demands 300 pesos (roughly $23) to perform oral sex with a condom on a young man. It is enough money to buy only partial service in which there is no completion. The joyless encounter, in which the prostitute controls every detail, concludes a melancholy film that begins in an outer circle of hell and works its way to the depths. ",

    "text": "Grown in the Persian Gulf, Food Ventures Step Out Globally\n2012-09-05T19:41:55.000Z\nDUBAI \u2014 In the early 1990s, the Saudi owners of date farms near Riyadh found that their premium dates were being priced out of the market because costly farming and production methods, including a meticulous selection process and quality packaging, made them too expensive to sell through regular retail outlets.\nTo solve the problem, they decided in 1992 to set up a gourmet date shop to serve a niche clientele, creating the brand Bateel. The business has since expanded to include 51 boutiques and cafes with an international footprint. It has an outlet on New Bond Street and at Harrods, the luxury department store, in London and another in Kuala Lumpur.\n\u201cWe are no longer just a date company. Less than 25 percent of our sales comes from dates now,\u201d Ata Atmar, the managing director of Bateel, said during an interview in Dubai. \u201cWe realized from day one we needed to have more than dates to survive.\u201d \nBateel, the Arabic word for a young offshoot of a palm tree, now sells a range of products, from date syrup to extra virgin Italian olive oil, and serves an international menu in its cafes. It plans to add more than 78 shops and cafes from 2012 to 2016, mainly in the Gulf, Europe and Asia. This year it will open a store in Moscow, and it is in talks to have outlets in Turkey and Japan. \nThe company, which owns 50,000 date palms in Saudi Arabia, is also exploring the option of investing in farms in southern Africa, including South Africa and Namibia, to take advantage of inexpensive labor costs and to profit from a second date harvesting season in the southern hemisphere.\nGulf food businesses like Bateel are looking to expand their brand presence and capitalize on local products and cuisines that appeal to an international market and can compete with the global goliaths of the industry.\nThey are gaining expertise by observing the spread on their home turf of various international franchises, from the Starbucks dotting the corners of malls in the Gulf to fine dining at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Doha, Qatar.\nThe Gulf region\u2019s high per capita income has prompted many businesses and entrepreneurs to look at food as an easy sell in a region with a rapidly expanding young population that whiles away the hours in malls and hotels. The expanding expatriate community, especially in the United Arab Emirates, is another plus, bolstering sales locally and, by increasing familiarization, helping the marketing of local tastes and food concepts abroad.\n\u201cThere is consumer demand in recent years for different cuisines, such as niche and novelty, in the region,\u201d said Sana Toukan, research manager for the Middle East at Euromonitor International. \u201cIn the U.A.E., there are mostly international brands because Dubai is very cosmopolitan and, with its demographic makeup, international brands do better.\u201d \nAlthough international brands may have a marketing edge, local brands are challenging the status quo. Just Falafel is one. Starting from a one-shop hole-in-the-wall operation in Abu Dhabi in 2007 it has morphed into a mall-friendly chain that now sells its deep-fried patties in Italian, Greek, Mexican and other flavors to suit every palate.\nBased in the U.A.E, Just Falafel now has 22 shops, including 18 in the Gulf state, and one each in Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar and Oman. It has also sold over 400 franchises globally, from Britain to Australia, since the franchise concept was developed in March 2011. But the company has even larger ambitions for its brand, said Fadi Malas, the chief executive and a partner in the venture.\n\u201cWe are opening one store a week in 2012 and hopefully two a week in 2013, with an objective to go to one store a day at some point in the future,\u201d Mr. Malas, a former banker of Lebanese-British descent, said in Dubai.\nMr. Malas attributes the company\u2019s success to the vegetarian appeal of falafel and its global recognition as an Arab food staple, and to its decision to go into the franchising business in the middle of a recession. \nOperating in the U.A.E., where property prices have slumped about 60 percent since the real estate market crashed in 2008, has also helped.\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges in this business was to secure real estate, and that was one of the main reasons we decided this potentially is a plausible business,\u201d Mr. Malas said.\nThe U.A.E. also gives food companies a taste of the kind of competition they will face globally. The U.A.E. is the second-most targeted country by global retailers, including restaurants, after Britain, and Dubai is the second most-targeted city, after London, according to data from a 2011 survey by the property adviser CBRE. Saudi Arabia is ranked 10th in terms of targeted countries while Kuwait is ranked 12th.\nBut not all Gulf food ventures are focusing on local cuisine in their global expansion.\nThe hotel management company Jumeirah Group is busy not just enlarging its stock of luxurious properties, like the sail-shaped Burj al Arab hotel in Dubai and the historic Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul. The company, a unit of Dubai Holding group, owned by Dubai\u2019s ruler, is also franchising two international brands: The Noodle House, an Asian restaurant chain, and the Italian restaurant Urbano. \nWith 20 Noodle Houses already in nine countries including the U.A.E., Jumeirah Group plans to roll out about 10 new outlets by the end of this year, in countries including Britain, Russia and Morocco. It is also in final negotiations to enter Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, and is weighing expansion into Continental Europe and the United States. The company has one Urbano restaurant in the U.A.E. and will open soon in Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Turkey.\n\u201cWhen you look at a franchise brand you need to have a global appeal, and southeast Asian food has been a trend in the last ten years,\u201d said Phil Broad, managing director of Jumeirah Restaurants. \u201cIt is a massive growth sector.\u201d\n\u201cIn Dubai, we have got all nationalities we can test our products on,\u201d he added, \u201cto see if we can transfer the restaurants to other markets.\u201d",

    "text": "12 Foreign Stories From 2012 Worth Revisiting\n2012-12-31T23:42:21.000Z\nThere were hundreds of memorable foreign stories from Times correspondents in 2012. Here is a sampling of 12 from across the world in chronological order.\n1. For Congo Children, Food Today Means None Tomorrow\nKINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 Today, the big children will eat, Cynthia, 15, and Guellor, 13. Tomorrow, it will be the turn of the little ones, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, Josiane and Manass\u00e9, 3, 6, and 9.\n2. Dublin Journal: Not Worth the Paper It\u2019s Built On\nDUBLIN \u2014 As an emblem of the modern Irish condition, Frank Buckley is almost too apt. Dead broke, he lives in a house made of money.\n3. American Children, Now Struggling to Adjust to Life in Mexico\nIZ\u00daCAR DE MATAMOROS, Mexico \u2014 Jeffrey Isidoro sat near the door of his fifth-grade classroom here in central Mexico, staring outside through designer glasses that, like his Nike sneakers and Nike backpack, signaled a life lived almost entirely in the United States. His parents are at home in Mexico. Jeffrey is lost.\n4. Egypt\u2019s Everywoman Finds Her Place Is in the Presidential Palace\nCAIRO \u2014 Naglaa Ali Mahmoud wears an Islamic head covering that drapes down to her knees, did not attend college and never took her husband\u2019s last name, because that is a Western convention that few Egyptians follow. She also refuses the title of first lady, in favor of simply Um Ahmed, a traditional nickname that identifies her as the mother of Ahmed, her eldest son.\n5. A Superstar Televangelist in Pakistan Divides, Then Repents\nKARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 THE audience erupted as Aamir Liaquat Hussain, Pakistan\u2019s premier televangelist, darted around the television studio, firing off questions about Islam. \u201cHow many gates are there to heaven?\u201d he challenged.\n6. Elephants Dying in Epic Frenzy as Ivory Fuels Wars and Profits\nGARAMBA NATIONAL PARK, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 In 30 years of fighting poachers, Paul Onyango had never seen anything like this. Twenty-two dead elephants, including several very young ones, clumped together on the open savanna, many killed by a single bullet to the top of the head.\n7. Young Lives, Lost in the Fog of War\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 These days, Abdul Farhad tries to sleep with the lights on in his bedroom and his eyes wide open, because as soon as he closes them he is back in his shop in central Kabul and it is 11:30 a.m. on the eighth of September.\n8. Corruption Is Seen as a Drain on Italy\u2019s South\nREGGIO CALABRIA, Italy \u2014 Italy\u2019s A3 highway, begun in the 1960s and still not finished, starts outside Naples in the ancient hill town of Salerno and ends, rather unceremoniously, 300 miles farther south as a local street in downtown Reggio Calabria.\n9. Reporting a Fearful Rift Between Afghans and Americans\nSISAY OUTPOST, Afghanistan \u2014 How far is Kabul from the war? These days, if you drive south or west, no more than an hour and a half. You can go and be back for dinner \u2014 if you aren\u2019t kidnapped or blown up.\n10. Billions in Hidden Riches for Family of Chinese Leader\nBEIJING \u2014 The mother of China\u2019s prime minister was a schoolteacher in northern China. His father was ordered to tend pigs in one of Mao\u2019s political campaigns. And during childhood, \u201cmy family was extremely poor,\u201d the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, said in a speech.\n11. Long Retired, Ex-Leader of China Asserts Sway Over Top Posts\nBEIJING \u2014 In a year of scandals and corruption charges at the commanding heights of the Communist Party, a retired party chief some had written off as a spent force has thrust himself back into China\u2019s most important political decisions and emerged as a dominant figure shaping the future leadership.\n12. Horrific Fire Revealed a Gap in Safety for Global Brands\nASHULIA, Bangladesh \u2014 The fire alarm shattered the monotony of the Tazreen Fashions factory. Hundreds of seamstresses looked up from their machines, startled. On the third floor, Shima Akhter Pakhi had been stitching hoods onto fleece jackets. Now she ran to a staircase.",

    "text": "Up Front\n2012-04-26T20:51:35.000Z\nThis week, Mohsin Hamid reviews Nell Freudenberger\u2019s novel \u201cThe Newlyweds,\u201d about an American man and a Bang\u00adladeshi woman who meet over the Internet and, despite the geographic and cultural gulfs between them, decide to marry. Hamid, the author of two novels, is himself a traverser of borders, having grown up mostly in Lahore, Pakistan, where he now lives, with stints in London and the United States. In addition to writing fiction, he is a prolific essayist on culture and politics for publications including The Guardian of London, Time magazine and The New York Review of Books. \u201cI\u2019m a political animal,\u201d he told us via e-mail. \u201cHow the pack hunts, shares its food, tends its wounded \u2014 these things matter to me. So I write about them. Fiction and nonfiction are just two different ways of lying to try to get at truths. Fiction lies by fabricating what isn\u2019t there. Non\u00adfiction lies by omitting what is. Doing both is useful: it keeps me aware of sentences, a novelist\u2019s obsession, and the power of the void that surrounds them, a preoccupation of journalists.\u201d\nHamid\u2019s third novel, which he described as \u201ca love story and a meditation on the nature of fiction\u201d that \u201cpretends to be a self-help book about how to get rich in 21st-century Asia,\u201d is scheduled to be published next spring. At press time he was also preparing for the birth of his second child. How has fatherhood affected his writing life? \u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cMy 2-year-old daughter has started knocking on my door every day, coming in and sitting down in silence until I finally say, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 And she answers, \u2018I\u2019m working, Baba. Working.\u2019 She makes me laugh every time. To write, you have to deal with solitude. And to become a father, at least for me, is to have a powerful enchantment enter your solitude, a new smile you get to smile when you\u2019re alone.\u201d",

    "text": "The Crazy Things That Get in People\u2019s Heads. And Throats. And Eye Sockets.\n2012-09-07T23:49:53.000Z\n\u201cI Was Impaled\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily the type of television show I would choose to watch, let alone write about. Except for one thing: I was impaled!\nIt happened when I was 10 and living in what was then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), and I\u2019ve hardly stopped talking about it since. New acquaintances bring up the topic of gross childhood injuries at their own risk. It takes virtually no provocation for me to roll up my left sleeve and show off the lasting results of early 1970s third world surgery.\nSo the announcement of \u201cI Was Impaled\u201d on Discovery Fit & Health (why not Spike?) made me nostalgic, like a cross-dresser hearing about a screening of \u201cI Was a Male War Bride.\u201d It also got me thinking. My impalement story is complicated, involving an ornamental iron fence, a wager, a frantic Canadian expatriate, a Pakistan International Airlines flight crew and a hacksaw. Sometimes I can see people\u2019s attention wandering before I get to the part about my mother and the dish towel.\nMaybe the crew at Twofour, the British production company that made the show, could teach me something about streamlining the plot and punching up the dramatic bits. After all, the hourlong premiere episode of \u201cI Was Impaled\u201d on Saturday squeezes in four complete stories of nonhuman objects taking up residence inside humans.\nThe first thing I noticed was that the impalement narrative has recurring elements. Like me, my fellow impalees recall the initial puzzlement before the pain sets in, the surprising lack of blood and the importance of the rule set forth in the episode\u2019s title, \u201cDon\u2019t Pull It Out\u201d \u2014 an instruction I had to give to several would-be helpful adults. \nBeyond that, the stories diverge widely. The least useful to me is the case of the Georgia man who was nearly killed by a French fry that ripped an eight-inch gash in his esophagus. This seems like cheating, frankly \u2014 at no point was the French fry protruding from his body \u2014 but it is a home run from a reality TV standpoint, combining near death and mordant comic relief. \nAs a bonus, the man\u2019s wife ends the segment by saying that \u201cGod truly performed a miracle\u201d when he saved her husband from his happy meal. (For the record, the source of the French fry wasn\u2019t named.)\nTwo of the other segments, while less unusual, have an element that I quickly realized was crucial: grisly photographic evidence. While there are no images of the Scottish woman who impaled her head on a fence that were taken while her head was actually on the fence, there are shots taken at the hospital, showing the metal spike sticking out of her chin. \nThe real bonanza comes with the case of the 86-year-old Arizona man who fell on a pair of gardening shears. While the doctors figured out how to proceed, multiple photos were taken of the shears protruding from the eye socket they had embedded themselves in. No horror movie makeup person could have done better.\nUnfortunately, no one took any pictures while I was on the fence, or at the hospital afterward, so I\u2019ll never be able to do my story full justice, though I do have the iron spike lying around somewhere. There were other storytelling elements of \u201cI Was Impaled\u201d that I\u2019ll have to continue to do without, like the image of a ticking clock, generic hospital shots and animated-skeleton re-creations. One thing I might try, however: standing still and staring at the camera while holding a token (a fishing spear, a bag of French fries).\nI probably won\u2019t need to watch the show again, because it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone\u2019s story being more like mine than that of Kristy Scott in Scotland. The spiked iron fence, the misstep, the lack of pain and blood leading to a faulty appraisal of the circumstances \u2014 it\u2019s all there, right down to the hacksaw and the Indian doctor.\nOf course, she fell on her head and not her arm, and she has cool operating room photos, which is why \u2014 along with some ethical considerations \u2014 she was a better candidate for \u201cI Was Impaled.\u201d I\u2019ll keep waiting for \u201cI Was Yelled At by an Editor on Deadline.\u201d",

    "text": "Quakes Set Off Panic Among Indonesians, but No Tsunami in Indian Ocean\n2012-04-11T11:48:32.000Z\nBANGKOK \u2014 Two powerful earthquakes struck about two hours apart off the coast of Sumatra on Wednesday afternoon, spreading panic among residents of the Indonesian island and reviving memories of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami in the same area.\nThere were no reports of casualties or significant damage, and the tsunami warnings that were widely broadcast on television, cellphones and the Internet were called off again a few hours later.\nThe first quake, whose magnitude was measured at 8.6 by the United States Geological Survey, was centered about 200 miles offshore and was felt across a large area. Tremors were felt in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand as well as Indonesia. The second quake, measured at 8.2, was somewhat farther offshore.\nThough the quakes did not ultimately cause a tsunami, they tested the region\u2019s tsunami warning systems, as residents fled coastal areas for higher ground. In Banda Aceh, at the northern end of Sumatra, the hurried, spontaneous evacuation came after several minutes of heavy shaking.\nThe earthquake knocked out electricity and tied up cellphone service, according to Edo Iskandar, a 56-year-old driver who said he was drinking coffee at an outdoor restaurant when the earthquake struck in the midafternoon. \u201cPeople started running out into the street,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the people at the food stall, people from shops, houses, everybody was in the street panicking, running and looking for higher ground.\u201d\nTelevision footage showed patients wheeled from hospitals on gurneys and traffic-clogged streets in one direction \u2014 away from the sea.\nThe tsunami siren sounded, Mr. Iskandar said.\nIn southern Thailand, one witness described a more orderly move to tsunami shelters.\n\u201cThe evacuation went well, as planned,\u201d said Mitree Jongkraijak, the head of a tsunami response team in Baan Nam Khem, a village destroyed by the 2004 tsunami. \u201cAll of the volunteers were at their stations,\u201d he told a Thai television station.\nThe 2004 tsunami, caused by a giant magnitude 9.1 earthquake, killed 230,000 people in more than a dozen countries.\nWednesday\u2019s earthquakes were farther away from Sumatra than the 2004 quake, and seismologists said the horizontal motion of the strongest quake made it less likely to set off a large tsunami. The quake two hours later was the strongest of many aftershocks. \nIndonesia\u2019s president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, told reporters at a news conference in Jakarta that the earthquake had caused \u201ca little bit of panic.\u201d\nThe initial quake struck at a depth of 14 miles with an epicenter 269 miles southwest of Banda Aceh, according to the United States Geological Survey. The strongest aftershock was measured at a depth of 10 miles.\nResidents of Banda Aceh headed for higher ground following a tsunami warning in Aceh on Wednesday.\nResidents of Banda Aceh headed for higher ground following a tsunami warning in Aceh on Wednesday.\nPeople were evacuated from a shopping mall after a strong earthquake was felt in Medan, Sumatra island, Indonesia.\nOffice workers after evacuating their building in Medan.\nWomen embraced and prayed after an earthquake in Banda Aceh.\nBruce Pressgrave, a geophysicist with the survey, said the first earthquake was believed to have come from a \u201cstrike-slip fault,\u201d which would reduce the likelihood of a destructive tsunami. The wall of such faults moves horizontally with little vertical motion, he told a BBC news program.\n\u201cSince the motion is horizontal, it is not moving the water column, it is less likely to produce a destructive tsunami,\u201d Mr. Pressgrave said.\nOn the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the closest Indian territory to the earthquake\u2019s epicenter, officials and hotel managers said they felt the earth move around 2:15 p.m., but said there was no sign of a tsunami or even big waves nearly two hours later.\nCmdr. Bindu Prakash, an Indian Navy officer based on the islands, said there had been no noticeable rise in sea levels even past the estimated time that the tsunami was supposed to hit the islands. He said the official tsunami warning was still in effect as a precaution.\nDeepika Mandal, an employee at the Fortune Resort Bay Island hotel in the capital of Port Blair, reported nothing unusual. The sea was \u201cabsolutely calm,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "Horst Faas, Photographer Who Showed Horrors of War, Dies at 79\n2012-05-12T22:56:27.000Z\nHorst Faas, a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer who later was editor of The Associated Press staff in Saigon that produced some of the most haunting photographs of the Vietnam War, died Thursday in Munich. He was 79.\nHis death was confirmed by The A.P.\nMr. Faas covered wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Algeria in the late 1950s before being sent to Vietnam in 1962. Though seriously wounded in a jungle rocket attack in 1967, he remained in what he called \u201cthis little bloodstained country\u201d until 1973, shortly before the American military withdrawal.\nMr. Faas earned Pulitzers in 1965 for combat photographs from Vietnam and in 1972 for his coverage of the conflict in Bangladesh.\nAs celebrated as his own work was, the photographs that came to be most closely associated with Mr. Faas were two that he selected, as an editor, for transmission around the world. Because of their graphic nature and the unwritten rules of conventional journalism, neither might have ever been more than a dot on a contact sheet in a drawer. Instead, they became emblematic images of the tragedy of the American involvement in Vietnam.\nThe first, taken by the celebrated photographer Eddie Adams during a surprise insurgent attack on Saigon in 1968, showed a South Vietnamese official, his pistol at arm\u2019s length, executing a captured Vietcong soldier at point-blank range. The second, taken in 1972 by the South Vietnamese photographer Huynh Cong Ut, known professionally as Nick, showed the aftermath of one of the thousands of bombings in the countryside: a group of terror-stricken children fleeing the scene, a girl in the middle of the group screaming and naked, her clothes incinerated by burning napalm.\n\u201cThe girl was obviously nude, and one of the rules was we don\u2019t \u2014 at The A.P. \u2014 we don\u2019t present nude pictures, especially of girls in puberty age,\u201d Mr. Faas said in an oral history recorded in 1997 for The A.P.\u2019s corporate archive. Nevertheless, he set his mind on \u201cgetting the thing published and out.\u201d The photograph won a Pulitzer.\nIn that interview and others, Mr. Faas avoided grand statements about the power of photography to change public opinion. He was at times adamantly fatalistic on the issue.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we influenced the war at any time,\u201d he said in 1997. \u201cI don\u2019t think we helped to win it or helped to lose it. We didn\u2019t work on the outcome of the war.\u201d Making photographs about the suffering and horror of war, he said, is simply better than not making them.\nHorst Faas was born in Berlin on April 28, 1933, and like other young men of his generation, he told interviewers, was forced to join the Hitler Youth organization in his neighborhood. He said his overarching childhood memories were of food shortages, evacuations and \u201cthe fascinating spectacle of antiaircraft action in the sky\u201d as Allied planes dropped bombs.\nHis interest in photography was accidental, he said. There were few opportunities for education in postwar West Germany. He landed a job in the library of a local photo agency. The agency eventually \u201cneeded cheap help to take pictures,\u201d so he started taking them, he told The A.P.\u2019s archive. He joined The A.P. in 1956.\nMr. Faas was known at The A.P. for his role as a teacher and mentor. During the Vietnam War, he trained a cadre of young South Vietnamese men to take photographs, supplying them with cameras, film and daily marching orders. Some of them became successful professionals, including Nick Ut, who now works in Los Angeles.\nMr. Faas\u2019s survivors include his wife, Ursula, and his daughter, Clare Faas.",

    "text": "36 Hours in Queens, N.Y.\n2012-12-20T17:54:33.000Z\nREMEMBER old New York, where immigrants strived, cultures collided, grit outshined glamour and ethnic restaurants were filled with ethnic crowds, not Instagramming foodies? Before Manhattan commerce was diluted with H&M and Starbucks, and Brooklyn became half hipster playground, half suburb substitute? That city lives on in Queens, where the forces of gentrification have barely nipped at the edges of the city\u2019s most expansive borough, home to 2.2 million people, from (it seems) 2.2 million backgrounds. Though its coastal areas have only just begun to recover from the destruction of Hurricane Sandy, most of the borough\u2019s vast territory was untouched by the storm, and is full of sights and sounds unlike anything you\u2019ll find a short subway ride away in \u201cThe City.\u201d\nFriday\n 5 p.m.1. TINSELTOWN, ASTORIA\nHollywood gets all the P.R., but one of Queens\u2019s most energetic neighborhoods is home to Kaufman Astoria Studios, where the Marx Brothers shot \u201cAnimal Crackers\u201d in 1930 and where Big Bird still resides. One building is now the separately run and recently renovated Museum of the Moving Image (36-01 35th Avenue; 718-777-6888; movingimage.us), which is free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. (admission at other times is $12). The recently overhauled museum features not just television (Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable\u2019s sweater and Mork from Ork\u2019s spacesuit) and film (telegrams sent by Orson Welles, Winona Ryder\u2019s prosthetic legs from \u201cBlack Swan\u201d), but also digital entertainment, including functioning Donkey Kong, Space Invaders and Ms. Pac Man machines, and, until March 3, the exhibition \u201cSpacewar! Video Games Blast Off,\u201d celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first video game.\n 8 p.m.2. LITTLE EGYPT\nLong known as a Greek neighborhood, Astoria is now wildly diverse, with Colombians, Brazilians and Slavs, and a big Middle Eastern commercial district at the north end of Steinway Street known as Little Egypt. You are unlikely to find better, more simply prepared fish than at Sabry\u2019s Seafood (24-25 Steinway Street; 718-721-9010), an informal, popular seafood spot where whole snapper, bronzini or tilapia are grilled, fried or barbecued Egypt style. Start with the grilled calamari, and try an Egyptian lemonade. (No alcohol is served.) Dinner for two is around $50.\n 10 p.m.3. HOOKAH TIME\nLittle Egypt is filled with informal shisha bars, but for a more posh experience, head up the stairs to Layali Dubai (24-17 Steinway Street; 718-728-1492; layali-dubai.com), a lavish version of the hookah lounges on street level. The dress code for the mostly Muslim crowd is shocking in its range, from conservative to the near scandalous. Groups of men and women (often separated) sip mint tea ($3) and fruit juice ($5), smoke hookahs ($10 to $25) and take in live music and belly-dancing ($10 cover) until late.\n Midnight4. DECISIONS, DECISIONS\nDrink like a hipster or dance like a Dominican? Here are two choices for late-night partying. Option 1: Head to Dutch Kills (27-24 Jackson Avenue; 718-383-2724; dutchkillsbar.com), a fashionable cocktail hideaway in Long Island City, for a Rum Buck, Bloody Knuckle or \u2014 why not? \u2014 a Manhattan. (At $8 to $11, the specialty drinks are at least $4 cheaper than you\u2019d find at similar Manhattan joints.) Option 2: Dance to feverish merengue and bachata rhythms at Jubilee (23-04 94th Street; 718-335-1700; granrancho.com), a restaurant and club housed in a structure resembling a roadside Caribbean restaurant. Choose between the more informal live band in the restaurant (free entry) or the young crowd in the nightclub below ($10 cover).\nSaturday\n 10:30 a.m.5. EAT, DRINK, SHOP \nWalk out of the subway at Roosevelt Avenue-Jackson Heights, and you have entered a land of diversity you previously assumed was metaphorical. How else to explain a pharmacy sign that reads \u201cBangladesh Farmacia\u201d (to appeal to South Asian and South American constituencies) or a place where a Guatemalan shop closes and is fast-replaced by a Russian deli? Head north up 74th Street, stopping in Patel Brothers supermarket to ogle exotic produce; India Sari Palace to shop for saris; and Al Naimat to buy South Asian sweets. Take a right on 37th Avenue, Jackson Heights\u2019s main thoroughfare. Pick up a Colombian salpic\u00f3n, halfway between fruit salad and juice, at La Paisa Bakery (37-03 82nd Street; 718-779-2784) to tide you over until you reach La Gran Uruguaya (85-06 37th Avenue; 718-505-0404) for coffee and Uruguayan-Colombian pastries. (Don\u2019t miss the plain-looking finger-shaped \u201cvigilantes,\u201d sweet and buttery soft and only 75 cents.)\n\n11 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\n 1 p.m.6. CHEZ SATCHMO\nWhen famous people\u2019s houses become museums, curators often scramble to recreate appropriate period d\u00e9cor. Not so at the Louis Armstrong House Museum (34-56 107th Street; 718-478-8297; satchmo.net), which was more or less frozen in time when the jazz giant died in his sleep (in the bed you\u2019ll see) in 1971. His wife, Lucille, lived there until 1982, but left most things untouched, down to the reel-to-reel tape recorders in Satchmo\u2019s office-studio, the bottle of his cologne and the gilded bathroom fixtures. Why did a celebrity like Armstrong choose to live the last three decades of his life in a modest house in the working-class Corona neighborhood? That question is explored on the guided tour ($10).\n 3 p.m.7. PANORAMIC VIEW\nTake the No. 7 train two stops down from the museum to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and meander through the borough\u2019s biggest park, which hosts sporting events ranging from the annual United States Open tennis championships to hardscrabble immigrant cricket games. Walk toward the 12-story-high Unisphere sculpture, built for the 1964 World\u2019s Fair, and seek out the etched granite work nearby in which the artist Matt Mullican recounts the history of the park. Then head into the Queens Museum of Art (718-592-9700; queensmuseum.org), home to the Panorama of the City of New York, an astonishing scale model of the five boroughs with 895,000 houses and buildings. (There are even planes taking off from La Guardia Airport.) The museum (donation $8) is open despite construction that will double its size to 100,000 square feet, expected to be completed by next fall.\n 8 p.m.8. EAT UZBEK\nOf course, Queens has a restaurant specializing in Bukharan Jewish cuisine from Uzbekistan \u2014 need you even ask? Cheburechnaya (92-09 63rd Drive; 718-897-9080) is a dinerlike restaurant in Rego Park with food not like that of any diner you\u2019ve ever seen. The area\u2019s \u201cRussian\u201d Jewish community is largely from Central Asia, and those are the specialties here, including the namesake chebureki (from $1.65), which may look like the stuffed fried pockets of countless other cultures, but the Central Asian spice blend makes it clear these are no empanadas. Even better is the samcy, flaky savory pastries filled with pumpkin ($1.65) or ribs ($2). Ask for a typical beverage and you might get \u201csunny lemonade,\u201d which is really Brazilian guaran\u00e1 soda with a Russian label.\n 10 p.m.9. TASTE OF HOME\nDespite its international flair, Queens is situated (did you forget?) in the United States. Two subway stops farther down Queens Boulevard is Forest Hills, a suburban-feeling neighborhood where a buzzing night-life spot is, surprisingly, an American bakery that gets as packed on late evenings as it does for weekend brunch. Martha\u2019s Country Bakery (70-30 Austin Street; 718-544-0088; marthascountrybakery.com) serves cappuccino ($4.75) and tantalizing desserts, from red velvet cheesecake to absurdly scrumptious sour cream apple pie ($5.50).\nSunday \n 10 a.m.10. CHINESE MASSAGE\nNew York\u2019s most vibrant Chinatown, that of Flushing, Queens, is packed with massage parlors, some of which are fronts for more risqu\u00e9 businesses. Head up the stairs to the very legit Winnie Foot & Spa (135-05 40th Road, 2nd floor; 718-961-3599), where an aggressive 30-minute foot massage costs just $22, compared with the arm and a leg it would cost you in Manhattan. These reflexology practitioners know their way around the human paw, but don\u2019t expect much conversation unless you\u2019re fluent in Mandarin. Instead, listen to soothing music as you relax in old-fashioned recliners as if you were the fictional Queens resident Archie Bunker (though he may have scoffed at the Hello Kitty pillows).\n 11:30 a.m.11. UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS\nIt\u2019s difficult to spot a non-Asian customer in Grand Restaurant (136-20 Roosevelt Avenue; 718-321-8258), a mind-bogglingly huge dim sum palace on the third floor of the New World Mall, opened last year. Choose from delicate shrimp dumplings, sticky rice with chicken wrapped in lotus leaves, and tofu rolls stuffed with pork and mushroom, and you\u2019re unlikely to spend more than $15 a person. For more variety and even cheaper eats, visit the food court downstairs, where an equally Asian crowd chomps down on a continent\u2019s worth of noodles, soups and dumplings not just from mainland China but also from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and beyond (entrees from $5).\nIF YOU GO\nMost Queens hotels are near the J.F.K. or La Guardia airports and far from attractions; you\u2019d be better off staying in Midtown Manhattan and hopping the subway. But there are exceptions, including several in Long Island City, like the chic and decidedly out-of-place Z NYC Hotel (11-01 43rd Avenue; 877-256-5556; zhotelny.com). Rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the Manhattan skyline; from $170.\nThe Marco LaGuardia  (137-07 Northern Boulevard; 718-445-3300; marcolaguardiahotel.com) is even closer to the action. Billed as an airport hotel, it\u2019s actually just a few blocks from the No. 7 train in central Flushing. Rooms from $139.",

    "text": "Certified Safe, a Factory in Karachi Still Quickly Burned\n2012-12-08T02:40:46.000Z\nKARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 The century-old Central Jail here, a gritty repository of criminals, jihadists and sectarian killers, has a reputation for overcrowding and prisoner riots. But for Arshad and Shahid Bhaila, the industrialist brothers whose factory burned to the ground in September, killing at least 262 workers, there are some comforts. \nAs Category B prisoners, the Bhailas have a private room, a bathroom, a television and personally cooked meals. Those perks, to be sure, may prove only a short-lived solace once their trial begins next month and they face a possible death sentence on murder charges. \nYet their lawyer, in mounting a defense, is seeking to shelter the Bhailas behind a far greater source of comfort: an apparel industry certification system that gave their factory, Ali Enterprises, a clean bill of health just three weeks before the horrific blaze. \nDespite survivors\u2019 accounts of locked emergency exits and barred windows that prevented workers from leaping to safety, the Bhailas\u2019 lawyer says their SA8000 certificate, issued under the auspices of Social Accountability International, a respected nonprofit organization based in New York, proves they were running a model business. \n\u201cThis was a state-of-the-art factory that met international standards,\u201d said the lawyer, Amer Raza Naqvi. \u201cThe SA8000 is accepted all over the world. They have very strict rules before issuing any certificate.\u201d \nBut after the Karachi fire and the more recent factory inferno in Bangladesh that killed 112 people, that contention raises a crucial question: Does industry-backed \u201csocial auditing,\u201d which purports to safeguard the lives and working conditions of some of the world\u2019s poorest workers, really work? \nFor the past 15 years, retail giants like Walmart and Carrefour have helped create and champion numerous factory inspection systems. In embracing such monitoring, the companies are motivated by genuine concern for the workers at the bottom of their supply chain, but also by their own bottom line, worried that consumers might shun products made at factories where there are abuses. \nThese elaborate systems look good on paper, but the actual work is often delegated to largely unsupervised subcontractors eager to drum up more business. The company that certified Ali Enterprises, as in many other cases, never visited the factory, handing off the job to a local inspector it dealt with by telephone or at meetings outside Pakistan. \nFor labor groups, academics and some industry insiders, the recent fires confirm longstanding fears that the voluntary system is weak, opaque and inherently flawed. \n\u201cRight from the outset, there has been concern,\u201d said Philip J. Jennings, general secretary of UNI Global Union, a grouping of 900 labor unions that recently quit the board of Social Accountability International to protest what he said was the certification system\u2019s overall ineffectiveness in improving factory conditions and workers\u2019 lives. \nCertification systems like the SA8000, said Khalid Nadvi, an expert on monitoring at the University of Manchester in England, are \u201cvery patchy and in many cases totally ineffective.\u201d\n\u201cFactories often know when the inspectors are coming,\u201d Mr. Nadvi added. \u201cYou have workers being coached what to say. There may be two sets of books.\u201d\nThe certificate that Ali Enterprises boasts about is considered the most prestigious in the industry. It is the creation of Alice Tepper Marlin, a Wellesley College graduate and former Wall Street analyst who, after starting an activist group in 1969 to push for greater corporate responsibility, eventually settled on trying to make the world\u2019s sweatshops less horrid.\nFounded in 1997, Social Accountability International receives fees and membership payments from industry giants like Gap, Gucci and H&M, but it also obtains money from labor unions, governments, foundations and nongovernment organizations. It created the SA8000 to certify factories that meet basic requirements in eight areas, including health and safety, wages, working hours and child labor.\nToday, Ms. Tepper Marlin\u2019s modest-sized organization oversees a sprawling, often problematic empire. Its SA8000 stamp of approval has been given to 3,083 factories in 66 countries. Ms. Tepper Marlin said the catastrophic Ali Enterprises fire shook her deeply. After missing some crucial warning flags until it was too late, she and her organization are now rethinking their whole monitoring system. \nNonetheless, she still vigorously defends that system, saying that it has been vital to setting and safeguarding baseline standards for supply-chain workers in poor countries, particularly those with corruption-prone governments and weak unions.\n\u201cWe think we do make a difference,\u201d Ms. Tepper Marlin said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to help get a culture of compliance.\u201d\nThe various disasters have given fresh oxygen to critics who say industry-led certification should be abolished across the board and replaced with a more accountable system that requires the retailing giants \u2014 and their Western consumers \u2014 to help pay for needed factory improvements, even if that means higher prices for clothing. \n\u201cThese private codes have become a commodity that is bought and sold, but not rigorously enforced,\u201d Mr. Nadvi said. \u201cWe need to move beyond them.\u201d \nOutsourcing the Inspections\nThere was evidence that Ali Enterprises was flawed well before September\u2019s fire. Abdulrauf Shaikh, a longtime inspector, examined the factory three times, in 2010, 2011 and again this July, just two months before the fire. Each time he found a locked fire exit \u2014 as in the fatal 1911 Triangle shirtwaist factory fire in New York \u2014 minimum wage violations and other serious problems. \nMr. Shaikh was there on behalf of a European apparel company that was thinking of using the factory. When Mr. Shaikh confronted the Bhaila brothers over these problems, he recalled, \u201cThey said: \u2018We are SA8000-certified. Whether you pass us or fail us, that\u2019s your issue. We don\u2019t care.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nSocial Accountability International does not inspect the factories itself. It has a compliance affiliate that licenses firms to do the actual work. One such firm is RINA, an Italian corporation founded in 1861 to inspect ships. In Pakistan, the process was further subcontracted: RINA\u2019s local operations are run by RI&CA, which inspected Ali Enterprises last summer. \nThat Pakistani firm has a controversial reputation largely because of its unusually high rate of approvals, doing inspections that led to 118 SA8000 certificates between 2007 and 2012. In contrast, a larger auditing firm, Bureau Veritas, awarded 46 certificates in Pakistan over a period twice as long. \nRI&CA\u2019s flurry of accreditations worried a team of English monitors led by Vic Thorpe and Stirling Smith, who often went to Pakistan to check on inspectors\u2019 operations. \u201cIt seems very fishy,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019ve certified so many factories compared to the other players, so you wonder.\u201d\nMr. Thorpe said he conveyed his concerns to Social Accountability International. Its compliance arm did step up its oversight, but no further action was taken. Several monitors in Pakistan questioned why the local firm was able to do so many inspections for so many years with seemingly little oversight.\nBut it was not entirely surprising. Industry experts say that in the battle for market share, profit-making inspection firms are often tempted to be less rigorous because that makes them more attractive to apparel manufacturers eager for certification.\nRINA\u2019s certification business in Pakistan was bolstered by its partner\u2019s embrace of a controversial subsidy program. Since 2007, the Commerce Ministry has offered companies up to 400,000 rupees, or $4,100, toward the cost of an SA8000 inspection as part of a drive to promote the clothing industry.\nBut the program has a twist. The entire subsidy is payable only if the factory is awarded certification. This creates a conflict of interest that skews the process in favor of approval, critics say. \nMs. Tepper Marlin said these subsidies concerned her group enough that in 2011 it wrote to RINA and the two other firms accredited to perform SA8000 inspections in Pakistan, advising them to stop accepting the subsidies that the factories pass on to them unless they could demonstrate their impartiality. \nTwo firms stopped taking the government money, she said, but RINA\u2019s Pakistani partner continued. \nDespite these concerns and others, industry officials said RINA never sent employees to Karachi, instead conducting checkup meetings in the Middle East or by telephone. \u201cDid they even bother to visit the country?\u201d asked Zulfiqar Shah of the Pakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research.\nIn a statement, RINA said it had conducted \u201cperiodic internal audits and meetings\u201d with Adnan ul-Hasan, RI&CA\u2019s owner. But the firm declined to specify where and when those meetings had taken place.\n Certification, Then a Fire\nMr. Hasan\u2019s company inspected Ali Enterprises, a large plant with 2,000 workers in northern Karachi, between June 25 and July 5, records show. On Aug. 20 RINA awarded Ali Enterprises an SA8000 certificate.\nThree weeks later, around 6 p.m., fire erupted in the factory\u2019s storage department, among giant rolls of denim. At the time, its production was largely dedicated to making cheap jeans for KiK, a German retailer. \nThe blaze spread quickly, engulfing the main building where about 660 people were working. On the ground floor, some workers were burned alive. On the second floor, its windows barred, many suffocated from the smoke. In the basement, workers were trapped as hot water flowed from firefighters\u2019 hoses.\n\u201cThey boiled alive,\u201d said Mohiuddin Aziz Yousuf, a brother-in-law of Arshad Bhaila, one of the factory\u2019s owners, as he gave a tour of the burned-out factory. \nRINA has refused to release the inspection report that its Pakistani partner prepared in July, citing confidentiality requirements. But it is clear there were serious problems at the factory. \nIn interviews, workers said they worked 60 or more hours a week, sometimes in 24-hour shifts. Although most earned the statutory minimum wage of $83 a month, few satisfied the SA8000 requirement of a \u201cliving wage\u201d \u2014 one that met a family\u2019s basic needs. \nDespite management\u2019s claims of extensive safety training, there was much evidence to the contrary. \nMuhammad Ismail, a stitching supervisor at Ali Enterprises for 18 months, said he had never participated in a fire drill or received safety training. Managers put grilles on the upper-floor windows to prevent theft. He was told that 700 pairs of jeans had once been tossed out an upstairs window. \nBefore outside inspectors visited, Mr. Ismail said, managers erected first-aid boxes and had the plant cleaned. But once the visitors left, he said, the medical kits were stored away. \n\u201cThey said the workers might steal things from the boxes,\u201d he said. \nWhen Mr. Shaikh, the inspector, visited in July, managers presented him with forms supposedly signed by employees saying that they had received safety and evacuation training. But when he interviewed the employees, they told him they had never received such training or signed the forms. \nMr. Shaikh said he was shocked to learn that the factory was about to be awarded SA8000 certification. \n Soul-Searching After Disaster\nAs the Pakistani police investigate one of the deadliest factory fires in history, the Western certifying bodies are engaged in intensive soul-searching. \nSocial Accountability International and its compliance arm have begun an extensive review of its work with RINA. On Friday, they announced that RINA would no longer issue SA8000 certificates in Pakistan.\nRINA, in a statement, said it had suspended its relationship with its Pakistani affiliate, and was conducting spot checks on factories that had been certified in its name. The group, however, is resisting calls to rescind all its SA8000 certificates in Pakistan.\nRI&CA, meanwhile, has sought to distance itself from the fire. In a telephone interview, the Pakistani owner denied he even did apparel monitoring. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do Ali Enterprises,\u201d Mr. Hasan said. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen the factory.\u201d\nThe police, RINA and lawyers for Ali Enterprises flatly contradicted that statement. \nExtensive failings by the Pakistani state played major roles in the disaster. There was little enforcement of safety laws; labor unions, which experts say could provide a voice on working conditions, have been strangled for decades; the local fire department did not reach the factory until at least 75 minutes after the blaze erupted. \nA government investigation into the blaze, hastily convened to quell public anger, has not yet released its findings.\nIn the monitoring business, one of the most contentious issues is confidentiality, and whether inspectors should be obliged to inform the public about poor or perilous conditions, like locked exits. \n\n14 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\n\u201cThere is an issue here of basic moral responsibility,\u201d said Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a monitoring group in Washington. \u201cYou have an obligation to make sure other people know.\u201d\nAvedis H. Seferian, chief executive of Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production, another certification program, said a public blacklisting might only make things worse, causing Western customers to shun the factories and workers to lose their jobs. (His group had also certified Ali Enterprises, but that approval lapsed in late 2011.)\n\u201cIf your goal is to have a good factory,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re not achieving that by not giving them a chance to improve.\u201d\nMr. Nadvi recommended that the voluntary monitoring system be replaced by a government-run system developed in consultation with industry and the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency. \nBut Ms. Tepper Marlin warned that jettisoning certification programs could cause an exodus of apparel orders and jobs from Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\u201cThis type of trade and development has played an important role in bringing people out of poverty,\u201d she said. \u201cDo we really want to say that we should move away from it because there are some factories with problems?\u201d\n\u2018It Could Happen Again\u2019\nToday, the Ali Enterprises factory is a charred memorial to a national tragedy. A suffocating stench lingers over the deserted halls, now filled with soot, twisted metal and charred rolls of denim. Discarded plastic sandals, left by trapped factory workers, are piled near a door that was locked during the fire. \nThe exact death toll, originally estimated at 289, is in dispute. Court records confirmed 262 deaths. But families say 48 other people are missing, with many remains still not identified.\nThe Pakistani government and a wealthy industrialist have paid families $9,375 per death in compensation; KiK, the factory\u2019s main customer, has agreed to pay an additional $1,930 per head. \nMuhammad Siraj lost his 18-year-old son, Shah Nawaz, and 23-year-old daughter, Farzana. They worked in the stitching department, making $125 a month for long hours. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a lot,\u201d Mr. Siraj said, \u201cbut it provided lentils and bread.\u201d\nNow all that remains are a pair of six-year-old photos; in one, Shah Nawaz sits shyly beside his sisters, peeking from behind a shoulder. \n\u201cI feel nothing against the factory owners,\u201d said Mr. Siraj, a gently spoken scrap merchant. \u201cThey can\u2019t give me my son back.\u201d\nThe Pakistani police have brought fire-related charges against the Bhaila brothers, their elderly father, three factory guards and two managers. The brothers\u2019 supporters claim the men have been subjected to \u201ctrial by media\u201d and say the fire resulted from sabotage. \n\u201cThese safety regimes are not meant to deal with sabotage or terrorist activity,\u201d said Mr. Yousuf, the Bhaila brother-in-law. Police investigators said they had ruled out that theory.\nMs. Tepper Marlin\u2019s group has ordered a special round of fire inspections at every Pakistani factory with SA8000 certification.\nStill, there is deep skepticism about whether the wrenching tragedy will result in genuine improvements, even after all the inquiries. \n\u201cTwo months down the road, what has changed?\u201d asked Mr. Shah, the labor rights activist. \u201cNothing. It could happen again tomorrow.\u201d ",

    "text": "Where Koreans Go to Reunify (Hint: It\u2019s Not the Koreas)\n2012-01-18T19:50:24.000Z\nSIEM REAP, Cambodia \u2014 At a roadside restaurant here near the sprawling ancient ruins of Angkor Wat, busloads of South Korean tourists file in to witness an unexpectedly exotic spectacle: doll-faced North Korean women performing everything from saccharine ballads to a rousing number from Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen.\u201d\nOn the frosty Korean Peninsula, relations between North and South are perennially tense. But here amid the balmy breezes of this Cambodian tourist town, Koreans from both sides of the border are enthusiastically fraternizing at the North Korean restaurant as if reunification were just days away. \n\u201cEveryone is very excited,\u201d said Jung Myong-ho, a South Korean tour guide watching the show one recent evening. \u201cBack in South Korea, we don\u2019t have any opportunities to meet North Korean people.\u201d \nYou would not know that North and South Korea were technically still at war by the beaming faces all around, the loud applause for the North Korean performers and the frenzy of picture-taking afterward. Northerners and Southerners pose shoulder to shoulder, a moment of cross-border kinship captured with the latest South Korean gadgetry.\nThe restaurant, called Pyongyang after the North Korean capital, is part of an ambitious expansion plan that has established outlets in some unlikely places, with branches in Bangladesh, Dubai, Laos and Nepal, said Bertil Lintner, the author of \u201cGreat Leader, Dear Leader: Demystifying North Korea Under the Kim Clan.\u201d \nHe calls the restaurants, which have opened over the past decade, a \u201cNorth Korean capitalist experiment,\u201d where wine goes for $30 a bottle and meals can run $100 a person. \nIt is an awkward moment for such a venture. These are uncertain days in the real Pyongyang, where the death of the longtime leader, Kim Jong-il, and the succession of his son, Kim Jong-un, have raised fears of instability, creating an atmosphere in which the slightest deviation from hard-line Communist doctrine is an invitation to a lengthy prison term in a labor camp. \nMr. Lintner says the Pyongyang franchise is an attempt by the government to generate hard currency, a supplement to the country\u2019s sales of missiles and nuclear technology. There is no doubt it is desperately needed, to cope with food and fuel shortages, and a socialist economy in a state of collapse. \nIndeed, generating hard cash may be more critical now than at any time since the 1990s, when perhaps two million North Koreans died of famine. For along with endless economic woes, Kim Jong-il bequeathed to his son a propaganda campaign promising that 2012 would be, \u201ca year when an era of prosperity is unfolding.\u201d\nSouth Koreans fly thousands of miles for the temples, the shopping \u2014 and a little political d\u00e9tente in one of the two branches of the restaurants here with the North Korean staff. \nNorth Korean performers, dressed in hanbok, a billowing, traditional Korean dress, wear permanent smiles as they play a Western-style drum set, electric guitars and accordion \u2014 and demurely shuffle across the stage. When one performer spins like a dervish, her frilly polyester dress filling out like a parachute, the South Korean crowd erupts with cheers and passionate applause.\nOn the menu are specialties ranging from the obvious (kimchi) to the more obscure (dog meat casserole), all prepared by a team of five North Korean chefs.\nThe performers, who double as waitresses, say they come to the restaurant from North Korea for three-year stints. But when they are asked for details about the restaurant and its ownership, their faces turn vacant. They requested that a reporter and photographer, the only non-Asian clientele in the restaurant, delete photographs of the restaurant from their cameras.\nThere are reminders of North Korea throughout the place, which has the feel of a wedding banquet hall. The walls are covered with murals of what the staff says are scenes of North Korean mountains. Glass cases hold North Korean herbal remedies and tea. \nBut perhaps more notable is what is missing from the restaurant. There are no propaganda posters, no slogans and no portraits of Kim Jung-un, or his father or his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the previous great leaders. The waitresses avoid any discussion of politics.\nMr. Jung, the South Korean tour guide, said the restaurant was a kind of neutral ground for North and South Koreans to meet. Inside the restaurant \u201cpolitics disappear,\u201d Mr. Jung said. \u201cWe are one family.\u201d \nThe warm feelings seem to be helped along by ample orders of Cambodian beer and the fact that nearly all the South Korean patrons are in vacation mode.\nSouth Koreans visit Siem Reap in greater numbers than any other nationality, according to the Cambodian Ministry of Tourism. Last year, more than 260,000 of them came here, accounting for 16 percent of all foreign visitors.\nCambodia offers sunshine during the drab Korean winter, and food, hotels and golf courses at cheap prices.\nA meal at a Pyongyang restaurant is one of the more expensive in town. In a country where a bowl of noodles costs $1.50, a hungry customer can easily pay $100 for a simple meal of kimchi, beef shoulder, stir-fried squid and a bottle of wine. \nAs they depart the restaurant, South Korean patrons snap pictures with the waitresses and settle their bills with wads of dollar bills.\n\u201cDashi man nap shida!\u201d the North Korean performers say. \u201cSee you again!\u201d ",

    "text": "U.S. Pushes to Cut Emissions of Some Pollutants That Hasten Climate Change\n2012-02-16T00:25:01.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Impatient with the slow pace of international climate change negotiations, a small group of countries led by the United States is starting a program to reduce emissions of common pollutants that contribute to rapid climate change and widespread health problems.\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to announce the initiative at the State Department on Thursday accompanied by officials from Bangladesh, Canada, Ghana, Mexico, Sweden and the United Nations Environment Program. \nThe plan will address short-lived pollutants like soot (also referred to as black carbon), methane and hydrofluorocarbons that have an outsize influence on global warming, accounting for 30 to 40 percent of global warming. Soot from diesel exhausts and the burning of wood, agricultural waste and dung for heating and cooking causes an estimated two million premature deaths a year, particularly in the poorest countries.\nScientists say that concerted action on these substances can reduce global temperatures by 0.5 degrees Celsius by 2050 and prevent millions of cases of lung and heart disease by 2030.\n\u201cThis is very much in the win-win category \u2014 good on climate at the same time that it\u2019s good on health, food production and energy,\u201d said Todd D. Stern, the State Department\u2019s special envoy for climate change. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a negotiation over who takes what targets,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a voluntary partnership aimed at producing tangible results in a relatively short period of time.\u201d\nThe United States intends to contribute $12 million and Canada $3 million over two years to get the program off the ground and to help recruit other countries to participate. The United Nations Environment Program will run the project.\nOfficials hope that by tackling these fast-acting, climate-changing agents they can get results quicker than through the laborious and highly political negotiations conducted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or U.N.F.C.C.C. That process, involving more than 190 nations, grinds on year after year with incremental political progress but little real impact on the climate.\nAt the most recent United Nations climate summit meeting, in Durban, South Africa, negotiators agreed to try to produce a binding global climate change treaty by 2015, to take effect after 2020. Many scientists say that irreversible damage to the atmosphere will be done before then. \nSoot, methane and hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in foam and refrigerants, have a short life span in the atmosphere, measured in weeks or years. By contrast, carbon dioxide, the primary cause of climate disruption, persists in the atmosphere for thousands of years \u2014 and its effects are much more difficult to mitigate.\nResearchers have identified about a dozen ways to significantly control black carbon and methane emissions. Soot can be reduced by installing filters on diesel engines, replacing traditional cookstoves with more efficient models, modernizing brick kilns and banning the open burning of agricultural waste. Methane can be captured from oil and gas wells, leaky pipelines, coal mines, municipal landfills, wastewater treatment plants, manure piles and rice paddies.\nThe new initiative will provide money for developing countries to reduce short-acting pollutants and will try to raise additional public and private funds for new mitigation projects. Drew T. Shindell, a senior climate scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute on Space Studies, said that attacking short-lived climate agents could have immediate impacts. \n\u201cFrom a political point of view,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s really appealing about these measures is that a lot of the benefits are realized by those that take the action. If you reduce these emissions in the developing world, it\u2019s the developing world that gets most of the benefits, by stabilizing rainfall and improving public health.\u201d\nDurwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said that the initiative, if expanded and adequately financed, would have more impact on the climate than the United Nations climate change negotiations, at least in the near term. \n\u201cThis is a formal declaration that we\u2019re opening a second front in the climate war,\u201d said Mr. Zaelke, who has been agitating for action on fast-acting climate change agents for years. \n\u201cWe\u2019d be fools to count on the U.N.F.C.C.C. for our salvation, though I wish it well,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a complement, not a substitute.\u201d",

    "text": "Where Have I Seen You Before?\n2012-03-27T16:38:16.000Z\nADAPTATIONS, a k a blatant knockoffs, have always been a part of fashion, but they used to occur at a more civilized pace. Coco Chanel was famously relaxed about the issue; despite banding with Madeleine Vionnet to sue one particularly shameless copyist in the 1930s, when Paris was the undisputed center of the industry, she later authorized American dressmakers like David Kidd of Jablow to clone her signature nubby tweed suits for the common folk.\nI\u2019m quite sure, though, that Coco would go cuckoo if she walked into the new Zara flagship in Midtown, where a long black boucl\u00e9 knit cardigan with piping and \u201cstrass\u201d (crystals) currently retails for $129.90 Not because this particular item is so derivative of her designs (that horse left the barn a long time ago), and not because it\u2019s fortified with 40 percent polyester, but because of the barrage of colors and styles surrounding it. Other chains churn out fast fashion; Zara, which is based in Spain and is owned by the distribution group Inditex, attempts the mind-spinningly supersonic.\nAs expected, echoes from the spring 2012 runways are everywhere here: red pump with tailfin \u00e0 la Prada, yup; Pierre Hardyesque contrast clutch, sure; Navajo print in sequins on a miniskirt, mm-hmm. But could those also be next fall\u2019s collections peeping round the bend? Bid a feeble hola to an olive-green military parka with fur hood and snap-out vest inside; inauguration-appropriate sturdy sheath dresses; patchwork-plaid flannel shirts.\nA statuesque blond companion and I were but two of hundreds of women who had begun streaming through the store\u2019s doors on a warm March Friday at 5 p.m., as if released by a factory whistle. \u201cAre those supposed to be, like, Balmain?\u201d she said, examining a pair of studded booties. It was hard to say, absent footnotes. Also hard to hear, thanks to a thumping cover of Level 42\u2019s 1986 dance hit \u201cSomething About You\u201d playing; at Zara, even the music is a \u201ctribute.\u201d\nI doubt that the workers in Bangladeshi factories churning out clothes for the company are released at 5 p.m., but that\u2019s a topic for another time. Here the staff members were profuse, though not exactly helpful; they had their hands full, really full, tending to ravaged piles. One unfortunate employee had been charged with the Sisyphean task of running a mop over the pale-gray floors; its neon feathers, we couldn\u2019t help but note, exactly matched the blazers hanging nearby. She soon upgraded to a vacuum, adding to the decibel level.\nAfter a 10-minute wait for a dressing room lined with mirrors that turned fun house from a distance of five feet, my friend tried on, and liked, an Alexander Wangish motorcycle jacket made of leather pounded thinner than a veal paillard, but couldn\u2019t bring herself to buy it. \u201cIt smells like burning rubber,\u201d she said.\nShe further reported that Zara\u2019s jeans, whose many iterations (from $59.90) include the au courant \u201cwaxed\u201d finish, were labeled confusingly. A size 4, she found herself squeezing with some difficulty into what Zara calls a 36 but most buyers of American premium jeans have come to know as a 27.\nMe, I\u2019d come in seeking a simple white T-shirt: hard to locate, since Zara\u2019s Basics line is directed at the kind of woman for whom basics might include peach lace short-shorts ($49.90). The closest approximation bore the label \u201cspecial\u201d instead; when asked why, a salesman just shrugged helplessly.\nBut Zara\u2019s confusing taxonomy and slipshod customer service clearly don\u2019t matter to trendettes in search of bird prints, flapper fringe and peplums on the cheap. \u201cSad Victoria Beckham,\u201d my pal said, fingering one of the last. And then, espying a black ankle-strap wedge: \u201cTheyskens for Theory.\u201d Excepting the bin full of \u201cSex and the City\u201d flower barrettes (surely it\u2019s not yet time for a 2000 revival?), accessories here can be impressive. I admired a robin\u2019s-egg-blue suede tote \u2014 a rare combination of retro color with modern shape, and the thoughtful touch of protective gold feet on the bottom, for less than $100 \u2014 but was too \u201cstrassed\u201d out to wait in another line to buy it.\nEN route to the exit, I spied a beautifully detailed ecru lace top that reminded me of an Isabel Toledo suit that met an unfortunately dingy fate at a Barneys Warehouse Sale and was amused when it proved to be a misplaced dress from the children\u2019s department.\nWhat the heck, I thought, and wandered over there, where I encountered a family fresh from the American Girl doll store down the street.\n\u201cOh, look, Riley, these would be cute on you,\u201d the mother said, stopping before a table stacked with message T-shirts.\n\u201cWhat does that say?\u201d Riley asked, clutching her doll.\n\u201cIt says \u2018Je ...\u2019\u00a0\u201d her mother said, and then trailed off. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s French.\u201d Whatever that means, these days.\nZara\n666 Fifth Avenue; (212) 765-0477; zara.com.\nSPAIN A selection of rapidly changing runway-inspired clothing from a Spain-based but globally resourced retailing giant.\nCHAIN This three-floor, 32,000-square-foot store is now the largest (and most overwhelming) of seven in Manhattan.\nINSANE The foot traffic flowing from Rockefeller Center is heavy, and given the wide selection and harried staff members, it can be hard to focus on the merchandise.",

    "text": "In Changing South Korea, Who Counts as \u2018Korean\u2019?\n2012-11-29T18:39:56.000Z\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Jasmine Lee realizes just how Korean she has become when she breaks out in the language, forgetting that her Filipino mother on the other end of the phone can\u2019t understand her. But she is reminded of the limits of assimilation when Koreans, impressed by her fluency, comment, \u201cYou sound more Korean than Koreans do.\u201d\nMs. Lee, 35, who was born Jasmine Bacurnay in the Philippines, made history in April when she became the first naturalized citizen \u2014 and the first nonethnic Korean \u2014 to win a seat in South Korea\u2019s National Assembly. Her election reflected one of the most significant demographic shifts in the country\u2019s modern history, a change Ms. Lee says \u201cKoreans understand with their brain, but have yet to embrace with their heart.\u201d\nOnly a decade ago, school textbooks still urged South Koreans to take pride in being of \u201cone blood\u201d and ethnically homogeneous. Now, the country is facing the prospect of becoming a multiethnic society. While the foreign-born population is still small compared with that of countries with a tradition of immigration, it is enough to challenge how South Koreans see themselves.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to redefine a Korean,\u201d said Kim Yi-seon, chief researcher on multiculturalism at the government-financed Korean Women\u2019s Development Institute. \u201cTraditionally, a Korean meant someone born to Korean parents in Korea, who speaks Korean and has Korean looks and nationality. People don\u2019t think someone is a Korean just because he has a Korean citizenship.\u201d\nAmong the factors driving this development is the influx of women from Southeast Asia who have come to marry rural South Korean men, who have difficulty attracting Korean women willing to embrace country life. The number of marriage migrants grew to 211,000 last year from 127,000 in 2007, most of them women from Vietnam and other poorer Asian countries drawn to a better life in South Korea.\nIn industrial towns, young men from Bangladesh and Pakistan toil at jobs shunned by Koreans as too dirty and dangerous, providing cheap labor that South Korea\u2019s export-driven economy needs to compete with China. The number of such workers more than doubled to 553,000 last year, from 260,000 in 2007 \u2014 not counting those who overstay their visas and work illegally.\nOne of every 10 marriages in South Korea now involves a foreign spouse. Although the overall number of schoolchildren in South Korea has been declining \u2014 to 6.7 million this year from 7.7 million in 2007 \u2014 as a result of one of the world\u2019s lowest birthrates, the number of multiethnic students has been climbing by 6,000 a year in the same period.\n\u201cA multicultural society is not just coming; it\u2019s already here,\u201d Ms. Lee, a member of the governing Saenuri Party, said in an interview at her office in the National Assembly.\nStill, her election exposed how far South Korea remains from that ideal, suggesting a rough road ahead as it grapples with the demographic changes.\nAfter Ms. Lee\u2019s election, anti-immigration activists warned that \u201cpoisonous weeds\u201d from abroad were \u201ccorrupting the Korean bloodline\u201d and \u201cexterminating the Korean nation,\u201d and urged political parties to \u201cpurify\u201d themselves by expelling Ms. Lee from the National Assembly.\nPrime Minister Kim Hwang-sik has condemned such xenophobic outbursts as \u201cpathological,\u201d and he urged South Koreans to take the transition to a multicultural society \u201cnot as a choice, but as an imperative.\u201d\nThe role of ethnicity in South Koreans\u2019 self-image explains why they take such pride in the success of ethnic Koreans abroad, like the new president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, a Korean-American. It also explains why they considered it a national shame that a Korean-born American resident, Seung-Hui Cho, 23, killed 32 people in a shooting rampage at Virginia Tech in 2007 before killing himself, even though he had emigrated with his family when he was 8.\nGiven this cultural backdrop, Korean policy makers face a difficult task integrating multiethnic families while avoiding the social and economic turmoil for which immigrants are often blamed elsewhere.\n\u201cThey bring religious and ethnic strife to our country, where we had none before,\u201d said Kim Ky-baek, publisher of the nationalist Web site Minjokcorea. \u201cThey create an obstacle to national unification. North Korea adheres to pure-blood nationalism, while the South is turning into a hodgepodge of mixed blood.\u201d\nThe challenge for South Korea is whether it can \u201credefine the nation, embracing people who do not share the same blood into a broader Koreanness,\u201d said Chung Ki-seon, senior researcher at the IOM Migration Research and Training Center.\nMs. Lee has witnessed South Korea\u2019s demographic evolution firsthand.\nIn 1994, while a college student, she met her future husband, Lee Dong-ho, a second mate on a South Korean freighter, when he walked into her parents\u2019 shop in Davao, in the southern Philippines. He sent letters and gifts from ports around the globe. When they married in 1995, she was the only foreigner in their neighborhood in Seoul. (Her husband died in a drowning accident in 2010.)\nIn 1995, Ms. Lee had trouble finding an affordable institution in Seoul where she could study Korean as a second language. Now that the government has recognized a multicultural society as the country\u2019s future, it has introduced or sponsored programs and centers, now numbering more than 200, to assist migrants and their children. Instructors visit multicultural families to teach them Korean at government expense.\nAnd this year, for the first time, South Korea began accepting multiethnic Korean citizens into its armed forces. Before, the military had maintained that a different skin color would make them stand out and hurt unity.\nBut if government support has improved, Ms. Lee says, popular sentiment seems to have cooled. Korean men who sponsored foreign women as brides, only to find themselves abandoned by women who exploited them to immigrate to and work in South Korea, have organized against the government\u2019s multicultural policy. Meanwhile, low-income Koreans accuse migrant workers of stealing their jobs.\nThe government itself stands accused of fostering xenophobia by requiring foreigners who come to South Korea to teach English to undergo H.I.V. tests, but not requiring the same of South Koreans in the same jobs. Last year, an Uzbek-born Korean made news when she was denied entry to a public bath whose proprietor cited fear of H.I.V. among foreigners.\n\u201cBack in 1995, people adored me for saying \u2018hello\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019 in Korean, though that was practically the only Korean I knew,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cBeginning around 2000, however, people started looking at me suspiciously. On the bus, they\u2019d ask, \u2018Why are you here?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nMs. Lee, who has a son and a daughter, said she used to avoid parent-teacher conferences at her son\u2019s school for fear that he would be bullied if other students learned of his multiethnic roots. There were many news reports to justify her fear.\nMs. Lee says it was her desire to see her children live in a fair and open society that drew her first to television and then politics. Thanks to her language skills and looks, she landed roles in movies and became a regular on a TV program that focuses on multicultural families.\nBut Ms. Lee thinks South Korea still has a long way to go.\n\u201cIn a recent program supposedly aimed at fostering multicultural harmony, organizers divided participants into one bus for \u2018Koreans\u2019 and another bus for \u2018multicultural families,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cI envision a society that doesn\u2019t need a label like \u2018multicultural.\u2019\u00a0\u201d",

    "text": "Critics Question Record of Monitor Selected by Apple\n2012-02-14T02:01:33.000Z\nApple\u2019s announcement on Monday that an outside monitoring group, the Fair Labor Association, has begun inspecting its suppliers\u2019 factories in China rekindled a debate over how effective the group has been in eliminating labor abuses.\nThe association was founded in 1999, by universities and nonprofit groups, along with Nike, Liz Claiborne and several other American apparel companies that said they were eager to eliminate workplace abuses; at that time, anti-sweatshop groups were pummeling American apparel companies for abuses in overseas factories they used. \nSince its founding, the association has inspected more than 1,300 factories in Asia and Latin America, uncovering myriad violations. But despite these successes, many labor advocates say its efforts have barely made a dent in improving working conditions. \n\u201cThe Fair Labor Association is largely a fig leaf,\u201d said Jeff Ballinger, director of Press for Change, a labor rights group. \u201cThere\u2019s all this rhetoric from corporate social responsibility people and the big companies that they want to improve labor standards, but all the pressure seems to be going the other direction \u2014 they\u2019re trying to force prices down.\u201d\nStill, officials with the group \u2014 whose membership includes 34 companies, nearly 200 universities and more than 1,000 college logo licensees \u2014 say it has helped ferret out some of the worst abuses, whether in China or El Salvador. \nJorge Perez-Lopez, the association\u2019s executive director, said it had made major strides, largely eliminating child labor at factories in China and Latin America and mostly ending an improper discriminatory practice at Latin American factories in which female applicants systematically underwent pregnancy tests and were not hired if they were pregnant.\nAt its founding, the idea was that the group, which had the enthusiastic backing and blessing of President Bill Clinton, would set a floor to what many said was an unpleasant race to the bottom in which many American companies rushed to find low-cost suppliers in China, Bangladesh and other countries.\nBut in those early days, it was criticized by numerous labor unions and anti-sweatshop advocates as toothless and too cozy with its corporate members. Many of the objections made then were repeated Monday after Apple\u2019s announcement.\nIn announcing that the association had begun inspecting Foxconn factories in Shenzhen and Chengdu, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said, \u201cWe believe that workers everywhere have the right to a safe and fair work environment, which is why we\u2019ve asked the F.L.A. to independently assess the performance of our largest suppliers.\u201d\nCritics argue, however, that the association and its corporate members should not suggest that its inspections are independent.\n\u201cThe F.L.A. does some good work, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for them to call themselves independent investigators because they\u2019re in part funded by companies,\u201d said Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a university-backed factory monitoring group. \u201cIndependent monitoring means you\u2019re generally independent of the companies.\u201d\nMr. Perez-Lopez, though, said the inspections were independent, adding that the companies on the group\u2019s board had no say in what factories were inspected or when. He said the association\u2019s staff made those decisions fully independent of the board.\nThe association\u2019s monitors inspected 190 factories in 2010, out of the 4,703 supplier factories that its member companies use. While that represents 4 percent of the factories, each company is required to do an annual assessment of each factory.\nMr. Perez-Lopez said his association had had many notable successes. He pointed, for instance, to the Ocean Sky Apparel factory in El Salvador, where after receiving complaints from a women\u2019s rights organization, his association carried out inspections and ordered a corrective plan that sought to address verbal abuse of workers, forced overtime, contaminated drinking water and failure to record some working hours.\nBut Teresa Cheng, international campaigns coordinator at United Students Against Sweatshops, pointed to some problems. She noted that a Nike supplier in Indonesia, PT Nikomas, agreed to pay $950,000 in back wages for 600,000 hours of unpaid overtime that 4,500 workers accumulated over the last two years. \u201cIf they were doing thorough investigations, they would have uncovered such a serious problem,\u201d she said.\nAsked why the association had not uncovered such an illegality, Mr. Perez-Lopez said that the group did not inspect every factory, and that Nike had systems in place to identify and correct issues throughout its supply chain.\nA Nike spokeswoman, Erin Dobson, said: \u201cThe F.L.A. has had significant influence on Nike as we\u2019ve evolved our approach to working conditions in our contract factories. They have played a very important role not only in pushing for transparency into members\u2019 supply chains but also in leading multistakeholder innovation and engagement on core labor standards.\u201d\nTo Mr. Nova, the association has not done enough. \u201cThe only way at the end of the day to measure the success of monitoring efforts is whether things are getting better for workers, and we\u2019re not seeing this in the supply chain of the major brands,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not see improvements in workers\u2019 wages or in the disrespectful treatment by supervisors or in the right to organize or in forced overtime.\u201d ",

    "text": "For Movies, Some Immigrants Still Choose to Hit Rewind\n2012-05-29T00:18:01.000Z\nSouth Korean immigrants flowed into Hwang Jae Video in Queens on a recent afternoon, dropping off their rentals and picking up new ones. Beloved South Korean soap operas, including \u201cDumb Mom\u201d and \u201cDelicious Life,\u201d were especially popular.\nBut the customers were not dealing in DVDs. They wanted their movies and television shows on videocassette.\nThousands of the cassettes lined the store\u2019s shelves. Thousands more were stacked in neat piles on the floor. \n\u201cI\u2019m old-fashioned,\u201d Youngae Park, 66, said as she picked out three videocassettes, her weekly allotment. \nIn this age of online streaming and Blu-ray Discs, there is still a place where the bulky VHS cassette endures: the immigrant communities of New York City.\nThe survival of the format may speak to a frugal strain among some immigrants, particularly those who are older, who seem more reluctant to embrace the throwaway, ever-modernizing consumer culture of America. Why upgrade to today\u2019s technology? Those old cassettes do just fine.\n\u201cThe immigrant very much values what they did not have,\u201d said Orlando Tob\u00f3n, a leader in the Colombian community of Jackson Heights, Queens, who runs a travel agency and tax-preparation office. \u201cAnd if it still works, they still use it.\u201d\nIn Harlem, a Senegalese-owned store stocks cassettes with movies from the expanding African film industry, and at least two shops in Queens, one owned by a Pakistani and the other by a Bangladeshi, supply Bollywood films on videocassette to the borough\u2019s large South Asian population. Latinos with a lingering preference for the format shop at a Peruvian-owned store in Jackson Heights. \nIn interviews, the stores\u2019 owners said videocassette sales and rentals, though now only a small and shrinking slice of their business, were sustained in part by older immigrants who seemed less inclined than the young to adopt new gadgetry.\nA South Korean immigrant named Jesook Choi, 60, another customer at Hwang Jae Video, said she owned a DVD player but never used it.\n\u201cWhenever I want to watch, I cannot play it,\u201d Ms. Choi said, as she rented two tapes, both Korean television dramas. Anyway, she added, using videocassettes \u201cfeels like an old Korean tradition kind of thing.\u201d\nThe owner of Hwang Jae Video, Young Woo Kim, 52, opened his shop in Elmhurst soon after he arrived from South Korea in 1989, when videocassettes were still the reigning format. They now account for about 30 percent of his business, he estimated \u2014 a far higher percentage than at many other video stores that still stock videocassettes. Many of his customers come for a steady diet of new Korean television shows and films. Everything on cassette is also available on DVD, but many people prefer the old format, Mr. Kim said. He charges $1 for each weeklong rental.\nSensitive to the demands of immigrant life, he said, he does not charge late fees. \nAsked how he sustained a business at those rates, Mr. Kim smiled uncomfortably. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit hard now,\u201d he said. \nA few store owners said some of their videocassette clients believed that tapes were more durable than DVDs. \nBut the survival of the format among the city\u2019s immigrants appears to have as much to do with the store owners as with their clients. Though the proprietors complain of the burden of thousands of cassettes that clog store rooms and eat up valuable shelf space, and though they have trouble selling cassettes, even for as little as 10 cents apiece, they seem unwilling to take the easiest path to liberation.\n\u201cThrow them out?\u201d asked Mamadou Sangotte, 55, the owner of Yatt Ndyndory Video in central Harlem. \nSince 1998, Mr. Sangotte has operated his small shop on Lenox Avenue. The videocassettes, like \u201cTwo Bad Boys\u201d and \u201cBillionaires Club 3,\u201d from Nigeria, have been relegated to the hard-to-reach upper shelves. But the thought of tossing them out seems to perplex him. \n\u201cHow can I do it?\u201d he said.\nMr. Sangotte and other shop owners said that as long as there remained a possibility of eking out some revenue from their cassette stock, they would suffer the clutter. \n\u201cI\u2019ll have 20 and say: \u2018Give me $10 and take them away. Please!\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Rana Ghufran, 40, a Pakistani immigrant whose brother owns Bollywood Video, wedged in between two South Asian delis on Hillside Avenue in Hollis, Queens.\nAt Video Express on 30th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, the owner\u2019s loyalty to the format appears to be driven not by potential revenue, however slim, but by nostalgia. \n\u201cThe profit is practically nothing,\u201d said the owner, Constantine Matsoukas, 65. \u201cBut I will not throw them away. I will not do that.\u201d \nBorn and raised in Greece, Mr. Matsoukas came to the United States in the late 1960s and opened his first video store in 1979. He expanded the business to encompass a mini-empire of video stores around the city. But with the rise of online streaming and the demise of the rental industry, he has closed all but the shop on 30th Avenue. \nMr. Matsoukas is now saddled with about 40,000 videocassettes, a vast majority of which are stuffed into the boxes and garbage bags that clog the shop\u2019s basement. Others line bookshelves, or are stacked in blocks on the floor and the counter. \nThey take up a lot of space, Mr. Matsoukas acknowledged, and they are hard to sell, even when he offers them at 10 for $1, which he does from time to time. The last time he tried to donate some to the public library, he said, he was rebuffed. \nBut for him, there is no other option but to hold on. Like a patron saint of the videotape, he buys up the stock of other stores going out of business, including Blockbuster stores, most recently in October. \nMr. Matsoukas offered a practical reason for his devotion: not all tapes have been transferred to more modern formats, and among them may be a rarity, if not the only surviving copy.\nBut he also speaks of his videotapes as if they were old friends. \n\u201cI love movies,\u201d Mr. Matsoukas said, his voice tinged with melancholy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see a movie in any form go in the garbage.\u201d \n\u201cThey\u2019re not living things, but it\u2019s alive,\u201d he added, his eyes brightening. \u201cThere\u2019s something there. You put it in the VCR, and it comes alive.\u201d",

    "text": "Newly in Business, and Finding a Lifeline\n2012-04-02T00:59:38.000Z\nErica Molina was standing where she usually stands at lunchtime, in the middle of her 116 square feet \u2014 an irregularly shaped booth in the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side. She was talking about the $5,000 loan that had allowed her to buy the counter she was leaning on and the used refrigerator behind her when a delivery arrived. \nIt was a box marked \u201celectric griddle.\u201d\nThat, too. \u201cFor quesadillas,\u201d she explained.\nMs. Molina and her business partner, Jesse Kramer, turned to an unconventional source for the money to keep their Brooklyn Taco Company food stand afloat last year: Accion East, an arm of a nonprofit microlender that specializes in small loans to entrepreneurs who, like Ms. Molina and Mr. Kramer, have not been in business long. \nMicrolending, pioneered by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh, has surged in the United States in recent years. As credit markets seized up and the recession deepened \u2014 and as credit card companies tightened their rules, because many startups add substantial balances on the owners\u2019 credit cards \u2014 microlenders provided cash infusions to keep small businesses from going under. Gina Harman, the chief executive of Accion, the US Network, which is the parent of Accion East, said the typical loan totaled $7,000. \nMs. Harman said that Accion had arranged nearly 13,000 loans totaling more than $94.5 million in the New York region in the 21 years it has been in business. Roughly 80 percent of the money went to immigrants or minorities, Ms. Harman said. \n\u201cThese loans, on average, create two and a half jobs, which is consistent with the fact that the small business sector has been the only sector to contribute net increases in the last 10 years,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when a small business is supported, the business generates revenue, it becomes part of the tax base and it adds to the stability in communities and employment, which makes a $7,000 loan a pretty efficient tool for driving the economy.\u201d\nBy a bank loan officer\u2019s standards, $7,000 is almost microscopic \u2014 except, perhaps, as the unpaid balance on a much larger loan. But Ms. Harman has taken her small-business mantra to the heart of big business: On a recent Wednesday, she rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange as part of the announcement of a job-growth program called the NYSE Big StartUp. With it, Accion started a job-growth fund with a $1.5 million commitment from NYSE Euronext. The Big StartUp calls for bigger businesses to lend support and resources to startups and small companies.\nThe stock exchange program is aimed at opening doors, which is what Ms. Molina said Accion East had done for Brooklyn Taco. The loan, she said, \u201chelped us build credit and let other creditors know we are people who pay.\u201d\nBrooklyn Taco already owed JPMorgan Chase $10,000 from a loan with a 7 percent interest rate. Ms. Molina said that before she found Accion, she had sold her apartment and had been using that money to keep Brooklyn Taco going.\nLike all lenders, microlenders look at an applicant\u2019s credit score and history when deciding whether to approve a loan. Before the recession, the average credit score of an Accion customer was below 600, Ms. Harman said. In 2008, Accion set a minimum credit score of 575, in part to minimize the risk to Accion\u2019s own portfolio.\n\u201cIt was a way of focusing on businesses that could afford to take on additional debt and provide the right support sources for those who couldn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Harman said. \u201cThere needed to be a way to separate one from the other. The credit score helped us do that.\u201d\nIn fact, Ms. Harman said, Accion\u2019s borrowers had been more dependable than many bank borrowers. In 2011, she said, Accion\u2019s delinquency rate was 4 percent in New York City. \u201cBanks build their models on 25 percent,\u201d said Ms. Harman, who was a community advocate and a union organizer in her 20s before becoming the president of the consumer division of a company her father had started, Harman International, which included the Harman Kardon brand of audio equipment.\nUnlike many banks, microlenders like Accion happily make loans to home-based businesses, as Alicia Piller discovered when she started selling her costume jewelry and hand-painted clothing. \n\u201cIt\u2019s scary to me to get a loan from a bank,\u201d said Ms. Piller, who started her business in her apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and recently moved to Prospect Park South. \u201cBanks are like the scary monster.\u201d \nMs. Molina said her next dream was to open a restaurant in Vermont, or maybe in San Francisco.\nWhy Vermont? she was asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about two hours from Montreal,\u201d she said.\nMontreal? What is so special about Montreal? \n\u201cButter,\u201d she said. \u201cGreat butter. It\u2019s creamier. I just want to have it. We don\u2019t even use it here, but I have a personal preference for croissants.\u201d",

    "text": "36 Hours in East London\n2012-04-26T21:24:10.000Z\nKNOWN for its cutting-edge bars, offbeat galleries and ethnic restaurants, East London is by far the city\u2019s trendiest area (just ask Ralph Fiennes and Keira Knightley, who both live here), crowded with shoppers during the day and clubbers at night. Wear comfortable walking (and dancing) shoes to discover its neighborhoods east of the Tower of London, namely, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Hackney Wick and Dalston. You\u2019ll find some of London\u2019s best fashion, craft and design businesses, mostly in renovated historic buildings and warehouses off leafy squares and winding streets. Though the current crop of creative merchants echo the area\u2019s 18th-century history as a center for silk weaving and furniture making, East London\u2019s artists today hail from anywhere but the past.\nFriday\n5 p.m.1. GALLERY AND GAZING\nThe striking brick-and-glass gallery White Cube (48 Hoxton Square; 44-20-7930-5373; whitecube.com) is filled with well-known works by established contemporary British artists from Tracey Emin to Damien Hirst and Sam Taylor-Wood. The owner, Jay Jopling, was an early convert to serious art selling in East London, opening here in 2000 (there are two other locations in the city), and has been credited \u2014 or by longtime residents, sometimes berated \u2014 for making this area frighteningly fashionable. If it is a balmy evening, join the young painters and posers on the square\u2019s lawn in front of the gallery for memorable people watching.\n6 p.m.2. COCKTAILS WITH ART\nThe streets near Hoxton Square are chock-full of bars, clubs and galleries, but the Queen of Hoxton (1-5 Curtain Road, Shoreditch; 44-20-7422-0958; queenofhoxton.com) is all three in one, with live bands and D.J.\u2019s, art installations, photographic exhibitions, fringe theater and even film screenings. Mellow out during happy hour over a cocktail in the games room, take a Hula Hooping lesson or listen to a ukulele group jam on the rooftop terrace while watching the sun set. Signature cocktails \u2014 with names like Screwface and Nicky\u2019s Last Fling \u2014 are all \u00a36.50 (about $10 at $1.56 to the pound). Later, if you feel like dancing off your dinner, return to the nightclub.\n8 p.m.3. BASEMENT FOIE GRAS\nTerence Conran, the designer and groundbreaking London restaurateur of the 1980s and \u201990s, moved east to Shoreditch in 2008 to convert a Victorian warehouse into a development called Boundary (2-4 Boundary Street; 44-20-7729-1051; theboundary.co.uk). On the ground floor is the British-themed Albion, which serves shepherd\u2019s pie (\u00a39.5) and grilled mackerel (\u00a39.5) in its bright cafe and sells Lyle\u2019s Golden Syrup in its food shop. There\u2019s a hotel on the higher floors. But the main event is the Boundary Restaurant and Bar, which manages an air of elegant French dining in the high-ceilinged, brick-arched former basement. One week\u2019s menu included suckling pig, breast of veal and haunch of venison. Dinner costs about \u00a340 without wine.\nSaturday\n 9 a.m.4. ETHNIC BREAKFAST\nBrick Lane, one of London\u2019s most famous immigrant streets, is also one of its most fragrant. The lingering smells of cumin, cardamom and turmeric emanating from more than 50 Bangladeshi restaurants will no doubt wake you up, though the scent of baking bread and the sight of a long line will direct you to the Brick Lane Beigel Bake (159 Brick Lane; 44-20-7729-0616). This one-room shop is one of the last holdovers from the Jewish immigrant community that thrived here in the 1800s. Try the famous salt beef bagel sandwich with mustard and gherkins (\u00a33.5), and wash it down with a cup of sweet mint tea from a nearby North African cafe.\n10 a.m.5. SHOP TILL YOU DROP\nNot far from the top of Brick Lane is Cheshire Street, charmingly filled with eclectic shops. Browse for vintage British clothing (schoolboy scarves, tweedy jackets and Barbour coats) at Levisons (1 Cheshire Street) and for globally sourced home and kitchen design products at Mar Mar Co. (16 Cheshire Street; 44-20-7729-1494; marmarco.com). If it\u2019s a \u201950s prom dress you\u2019re looking for, head to Beyond Retro (110-112 Cheshire Street; 44-20-7613-3636; beyondretro.com), where you can pick through everything from military jackets to designer handbags.\n\n20 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nNoon6. FRENCH ACCENT\nBe sure to make a reservation at the cheese and charcuterie bistro Brawn (49 Columbia Road; 44-20-7729-5692; www.brawn.co), a popular offshoot of a well-known London wine bar, Terroirs, and a hit with the neighborhood hipsters. The serious \u201cpig\u201d menu includes everything from brawn to prosciutto, terrine and rillettes. Completed with a slice of the Hackney wild sourdough and a glass of merlot, lunch pays tribute to French Huguenots who occupied this area in the 1700s. For vegetarians, there are dishes like Cheltenham beetroot and m\u00e2che salad, but really, you\u2019re here for the scene as much as the salami. Lunch is about \u00a325 per person.\n2 p.m.7. YE OLDE HOUSE\nTake some lessons in seriously retro home decorating at the Geffrye Museum (136 Kingsland Road; 44-20-7739-9893; geffrye-museum.org.uk, free). The building, a sprawling 18th-century almshouse, is an artifact itself. Inside, 11 period rooms are set up with authentic furniture and objects to show how middle-class Londoners \u2014 those with the funds to stay comfortable with a bit of style \u2014 lived from 1630 (no slouching in those chairs) to the present, represented by a sleek London loft. Part of the fun is in the details: real playing cards from the 18th century on a table in the 1790 room; overwrought Victoriana in 1890; a tiny-screened but mod-looking television set in 1965.\n4 p.m.8. WATER WALK\nHead north on Shoreditch High Street until you hit Regent\u2019s Canal, nearing its 200th anniversary and once used to transport goods around the city. On the lively pedestrian and cycling path, walk under arched low bridges and take in the varied architecture. You\u2019ll see scenic locks, new residential buildings, abandoned warehouses and houseboats complete with floating gardens and outdoor fire pits. For a break, order a glass of wine at the bohemian Towpath Cafe, on Regent\u2019s Canal by Whitmore Bridge (44-20-7254-7606).\n8 p.m.9. NATIONAL TASTES\nHoxton Furnace (1 Rufus Street; 44-20-7613-0598; hoxtonfurnace.com), opened in 1999, proudly describes itself as one of Hoxton\u2019s oldest restaurants. The specialty is pizza, with toppings like mozzarella, basil, Gorgonzola, pear and radicchio (\u00a39.50). If you\u2019d rather stick to a nationalist theme, take a table at Rivington Grill (28-30 Rivington Street; 44-20-7729-7053; rivingtonshoreditch.co.uk), where the menu lists dishes like rabbit tarragon pie, deviled lamb\u2019s kidneys and\u00a0nettle soup; dinner costs about \u00a330. If you wish to hit the clubs, rest and then head out after midnight. Though the hottest East London club is always a moving target, you\u2019re safe starting explorations at Hoxton Square.\nSunday\n 9 a.m.10. GOOD MORNING, POLAND\nFamous for its perfectly swirled lattes and cappuccinos, Leila\u2019s Shop (17 Calvert Avenue; 44-20-7729-9789) in Shoreditch serves Polish fare and breakfast all day: eggs cooked in earthenware pots, pumpernickel toast, sausages; about \u00a310. It\u2019s also a store for foodies, with baskets of root vegetables and wheels of cheese, and cookbooks to peruse at communal tables.\n 11 a.m.11. FLOWERS AND FUN \nTo catch the beauty of East London market day, head to the Columbia Road Flower Market (columbiaroad.info/flowermarket.html), a colorful spectacle of stalls with blooms and plants and even banana trees. Sixty shops line the street, including art galleries, pastry and antiques shops and gardening stores. Spitalfields (www.spitalfields.co.uk), London\u2019s oldest market, is also out in force, with 110 stalls and plenty of adornments for budget-conscious fashionistas, as London\u2019s young designers head here to showcase their often still-drying prints and T-shirts, sold next to vintage handbags and cheap dangly\u00a0jewelry. (If you\u2019re here on Saturday, check out Broadway Market, broadwaymarket.co.uk, in an area where traditional \u201cpie, mash and eels\u201d shops rub shoulders with trendy bistros and bars.) Make a last stop at the Dove Freehouse (24-28 Broadway Market; 44-20-7275-7617; dovepubs.com), the oldest drinking establishment in the market. It specializes in Belgian beers, with more than 100 to choose from.\nIF YOU GO\nThe Boundary (2-4 Boundary Street; 44-207) 729-1051; theboundary.co.uk) has 12 rooms and 5 suites, each inspired by a different designer or design movement, like the Charles and Ray Eames and Bauhaus rooms, in Terence Conran\u2019s Boundary development. A rooftop bar, grill and garden offer panoramic views. Summer rates from about \u00a3220, or $340.\nTown Hall Hotel & Apartments (8 Patriot Square, Bethnal Green; 44-207) 871-0460; townhallhotel.com) offers individually decorated rooms with vintage furniture in a renovated Edwardian Town Hall with an Art Deco lobby and designer bathrooms and kitchens. Doubles from \u00a3148 this summer.",

    "text": "A Far-Off Island Where the American Dream Curdles\n2012-03-25T21:54:44.000Z\nThe main character in P. F. Kluge\u2019s stingingly funny new novel, \u201cThe Master Blaster,\u201d isn\u2019t a person. It\u2019s a location: Saipan, a very small island with a big, bizarre place in history. Saipan is one of the Northern Mariana Islands in the western Pacific, north of the Solomons and west of the Marshalls. It was a site of brutal fighting during World War II, grimly commemorated by one cliff nicknamed Suicide and another called Banzai. Its neighbor is Tinian, the island from which the Enola Gay took off to bomb Hiroshima.\nWhen Saipan became a United States Commonwealth in 1978, it took on a different kind of strategic advantage. The island was conveniently exempted from usual American tariffs, the minimum wage and immigration laws. And up sprung factories, exploiting low-paid immigrant workers. Cheap clothing manufactured there could be labeled \u201cMade in the U.S.A.,\u201d and was; tourism and the sex trade also thrived. \u201cThe Master Blaster\u201d begins in 2005, when the Saipan boom had begun to go bust.\nThe Master Blaster is a mysterious figure who runs a Saipan-disparaging Web site that runs a contest. (Look it up. There really is one.) The goal is to provide a slogan for Saipan, and the best of many entries is this: \u201cIt\u2019s not the heat, it\u2019s the cupidity.\u201d A runner-up: \u201cThe Other West Virginia.\u201d\nMr. Kluge, who went to Saipan as a Peace Corps volunteer in 1967 and has made repeated visits ever since, makes a fine alter ego out of the Master Blaster. Both the writer and his troublemaking character are seasoned ironists, expert connoisseurs of corruption.\nIn a book that is a long, bewitching love letter to an utterly maddening place, Mr. Kluge introduces a group of Saipan newcomers who don\u2019t yet know the lay of the land. They arrive on the same plane and make a bet about who will stay longest. Least likely to win this bet is George Griffin, a travel writer who has appeared in Mr. Kluge\u2019s fiction before. George is the best kind of hack: a smart one, able to understand lousy writing even as he cranks it out. George caters glibly to the kinds of travelers who leave home \u201cpicturing the moment they drive back up the driveway, pronouncing that there\u2019s no place like home.\u201d\nHe regards his readers with a beguiling blend of cynicism and affection, just as Mr. Kluge sees Saipan. \u201cMy people,\u201d George muses to himself. \u201cThey traveled scared, which somehow made them braver than the cocky adventurers who preceded them. They wrote postcards, not journals. They worried about what they ate. They tipped too much or too little because they never figured out the monkey bucks. Not a word of language, not a scrap of history, no more guidance than what I provided. God love them! It took guts to go out into the world without a clue.\u201d\nAlso on the plane is Stephanie Warner, an academic recruited for a college on Saipan. (What does it say about this college, she wonders, that its only advance meeting with her was conducted at the food court in a mall in Honolulu?) Then there\u2019s Mel Brodie, a real estate developer dispatched by Washington\u2019s most powerful lobbyist, nicknamed Maximum Lou. (He is a stand-in for Jack Abramoff, whose sticky fingers also reached as far as Saipan.) Last and least, status-wise, is Khan, a laborer from Bangladesh who will wind up in virtual slavery.\nOne site visited by Khan\u2019s work crew sounds like the abandoned home of Larry Hillblom, the runaway billionaire who indulged his every perverse whim on Saipan until he disappeared in a small plane that took off from there. In the likely event that \u201cThe Master Blaster\u201d prompts further curiosity about this part of the world, read James D. Scurlock\u2019s nonfiction \u201cKing Larry\u201d too.\n\u201cThe Master Blaster\u201d coalesces as the main characters explore the island and one another. Without a heavy hand Mr. Kluge makes their paths plausibly collide. George starts teaching at Stephanie\u2019s school. Mel gets the idea of building a retirement home for Americans with the moniker \u201cPatriot\u2019s Rest.\u201d But he does not understand exactly what land rights on Saipan entail. \u201cYou would need a genealogist, a DNA expert, a local historian, you\u2019d need a subpoena and a syringe of sodium pentothal to be absolutely sure about a title search,\u201d Mr. Kluge explains.\nThat voice \u2014 jaundiced, seasoned, amused and vibrant as it is \u2014 gives \u201cThe Master Blaster\u201d added allure. This is not a young man\u2019s book; it\u2019s the work of a writer who has seen the world, literally and figuratively, for a long time. \u201cThe Master Blaster\u201d is tinged with thoughts of mortality, but they are offset by a bon vivant\u2019s occasional flash of gratitude and beauty. When George thinks about clich\u00e9s and observes that \u201cwhat drum solos were for rock concerts, what dream sequences were for movies, sunsets were in nature.\u201d But he also says that \u201ca sunset, well watched,\u201d lasts as long as a whole feature film.\nOf course this story has a deeply somber side. Saipan\u2019s history as a bloody battleground is examined, most memorably when a visiting congressman decides to tour the caves where Japanese soldiers were trapped. Detritus left behind by the soldiers gives that scene gravitas, but the book also notes darkly that if the congressman were a senator, more aides would have been willing to follow him into these tombs. The scene is capped by one devastating detail, totally unexpected, that will change the congressman\u2019s self-image forever.\nMr. Kluge uses a shrewd local fixer called Big Ben to comment on the caves\u2019 import too. \u201cUntil Saipan, the Japanese tried to stop the Americans on the beaches,\u201d he says. But the Japanese yielded and retreated for this fight and let the invading Americans gain ground. \u201cIt\u2019s the way it is on the islands,\u201d Big Ben says. \u201cLet them land, settle in, raise their flag ...\u201d\nAnd then, when the intruders are entrenched? \u201cYou cannot prevent their coming,\u201d Big Ben says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way. But you can affect \u2014 how to put it? \u2014 the quality of their stay.\u201d",

    "text": "Glimpses of Urban Landscapes Past\n2012-07-26T22:54:20.000Z\nIn a recent essay the critic A. A. Gill gently dissuaded seekers of an authentic London experience: \u201cYou want stiff-lipped men in bowler hats and cheeky cockneys with their thumbs on their waistcoats and fish on their heads. I\u2019m sorry, but they\u2019re not here anymore.\u201d \nBut these types, and others visitors might want to meet, are very much present and accounted for in \u201cLondon Street Photography\u201d at the Museum of the City of New York. Arriving from the Museum of London, which presented it in 2010 and owns the more than 150 works on view, the show affords those of us watching the Olympics on TV a glimpse of an older, more eccentric city. It covers the Victorian era to the present, and is particularly rich in images from the mid-20th century: the golden age of street photography in England, as in the United States.\nA smaller companion exhibition, \u201cCity Scenes: Highlights of New York Street Photography,\u201d provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two very different modern cities as they grappled with war, the postindustrial era and various forms of social tension.\nThe images in \u201cLondon Street Photography\u201d also amount to a tour of the East End of London, lately revitalized with restaurants, galleries and, now, Olympic stadiums. Much of the exhibition still depicts a working-class enclave, as seen in John Galt\u2019s remarkable 1902 photograph of a man selling pet food, or \u201ccats\u2019 meat,\u201d from a pushcart.\nAnother cockney character, \u201cHookey Alf\u201d of Whitechapel \u2014 so named because he lost his hand in an industrial accident \u2014 enlivens a shot by John Thomson. Alf looks tough but fails to intimidate an inquisitive little girl who has wandered up to him.\nAs Jacob Riis did in New York, Thomson produced a photographic survey of London\u2019s poor (published in 1877 as \u201cStreet Life in London\u201d). You can compare Alf and his friends with the ruffians in a Riis photograph taken at a Mulberry Street address known as \u201cBandit\u2019s Roost,\u201d which is included in \u201cCity Scenes.\u201d\nEarly London photographers were limited by exposure times; they could not show people, or vehicles, in motion. City views by George Washington Wilson and Henry Dixon are essentially static and mostly depopulated.\nThat all changed around 1890, with the advent of the hand-held roll-film camera. Suddenly it was possible to show London Bridge choked with carriage traffic, or Bank teeming with top-hatted men.\nLondon, like Paris, was soon crawling with shutterbugs, many of them known to us only as \u201canonymous.\u201d They are responsible for some of the show\u2019s most dynamic images: a woman briskly crossing Hyde Park with skirts aswirl, a group of children splashing around in a water trough at Barnet High Street. One photographer with a strong sartorial eye took picture after picture of pedestrians along Sutton High Street \u2014 a 1930s version of a street-fashion blog, showing women in felt cloches and long tweed double-breasted coats.\n\n10 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nMarkers of class are everywhere, few of them handled with subtlety. In one anonymous shot, a real-life Eliza Doolittle hawks flowers from a stall. In others, by the Boer War correspondent turned society chronicler Horace Nicholls, the well-to-do while away the day at the Epsom Derby (Britain\u2019s richest, most prestigious horse race).\nMargaret Monck, with her Leica, straddled the divide. A privileged daughter of the viceroy of India, she demonstrated a candid, empathetic touch in photographs of the East End, Camden and Clerkenwell that were taken purely for personal interest. Her shots of children, in particular, hold up well against Helen Levitt\u2019s in \u201cCity Scenes.\u201d \nPhotojournalists are far more common in \u201cLondon Street Photography\u201d; their proximity to the pubs and presses of Fleet Street give the exhibition a slightly manic tone. A shot by George Davison Reid, taken from the slightly elevated vantage point of a portable ladder, shows a messenger boy for one of the newspaper agencies scurrying along a crowded sidewalk.\nThe film business also proved attractive to many photographers, among them Wolf Suschitzky (who became a cinematographer). His shots of Charing Cross Road are highly atmospheric, taken on dark rainy nights and in the type of dense smog known as a \u201cpea souper.\u201d\nAs the show moves into the war years, images of everyday life take on a new significance. The best are by Bert Hardy, who, while covering the blitz for the magazine Picture Post zeroed in on small acts of stoicism: a seamstress carrying on with her work in a shop with blown-out windows, for instance.\nPost-World War II, \u201cLondon Street Photography\u201d loses some of its momentum (at least when compared with the renaissance of American street photography seen in \u201cCity Scenes,\u201d from Garry Winogrand and Robert Frank to Bruce Davidson and Nan Goldin). This is partly because some major names, including Martin Parr and Paul Graham, are absent.\nBut it\u2019s hard to fault the curators (Mike Seaborne and Anna Sparham in London and Sean Corcoran in New York) for including seven photographs from the 1950s by Roger Mayne, a range that shows him growing more confident in his shots of gangs and gamblers. They\u2019re stylish images too, full of visual slang, with dapper \u201cTeddy Boys\u201d and a \u201cjiving\u201d girl.\nEqually of its time is Terry Spencer\u2019s 1969 shot of skinheads and hippies, the two groups passing within a stone\u2019s throw of each other in Piccadilly Circus. Tenser situations are evoked in Paul Trevor\u2019s 1978 photograph of a small boy pointing a toy gun at a row of policemen in the vicinity of Brick Lane (then the site of anti-Bangladeshi activity by the National Front). \nRecent images of the East End, some in color, approximate the vibrant, multiethnic London of novels by Zadie Smith and Monica Ali. But several other photographs from the past five years or so feel generically urban: these shots of A.T.M.\u2019s, pigeons and market stalls could have been taken in any neighborhood or in any major city.\nMaybe that\u2019s not all the fault of the photographers. London may well have become more like other major cities. But for most of this show, happily, it isn\u2019t.",

    "text": "Haitians Take Arduous Path to Brazil, and Jobs\n2012-01-07T02:30:02.000Z\nBRASIL\u00c9IA, Brazil \u2014 Of the odyssey that delivered him to this town in the Brazilian Amazon, Wesley Saint-Fleur could muster only a look of exhaustion and bewilderment. \nMonths ago, he boarded a bus in Haiti, before getting on a plane in the Dominican Republic, landing first in Panama and then in Ecuador. That was where his wife gave birth to their son, Isaac, he said, bouncing the 4-month-old infant on his knee and brandishing the boy\u2019s Ecuadorean identification card. Then they continued by bus yet again, through Ecuador and Peru. Next, they trekked by foot in Bolivia, where, he said, the police robbed him and his wife of their clothing and their life savings: $320 in cash. \n\u201cThen we finally got to Brazil, which I\u2019m told is building everything, stadiums, dams, roads,\u201d said Mr. Saint-Fleur, 27, a construction worker, one of hundreds of Haitians who gather each day around the gazebo in Brasil\u00e9ia\u2019s palm-fringed plaza. \u201cAll I want is work, and Brazil, thank God, has jobs for us.\u201d\nGambling everything, thousands of Haitians have made their way across the Americas to reach small towns in the Brazilian Amazon over the past year in a desperate search for work, including a surge of hundreds arriving in recent days amid fears that Brazil\u2019s government could slow the influx before it overwhelms the authorities here. \nTheir improbable journeys \u2014 from the rubble of their island homes to remote outposts here in the Amazon \u2014 say as much about the dire economic conditions that persist in Haiti two years after the earthquake as it does about the rising economic profile of Brazil, which is fast becoming a magnet not only for poor foreign laborers but also for growing numbers of educated professionals from Europe, the United States and Latin America. \nUpon arriving here and in other border outposts, the Haitians are often given vaccinations, clean water and two meals a day by the authorities. Many stay for weeks in Brasil\u00e9ia and other towns before being granted humanitarian visas that allow them to work in Brazil. \nBut with such a crush of new arrivals, others have not been so lucky. After traveling thousands of miles and overcoming countless obstacles, some crowd eight to a small hotel room or wind up sleeping on the streets, almost reliving the misery they had hoped to leave behind.\n\u201cI cannot allow the sadness to take over, since opportunity will follow this hard phase,\u201d said Simonvil Cenel, 33, a tailor awaiting a visa who leads animated evangelical prayer services for those stuck in limbo after enduring so much to get here.\nAbout 4,000 Haitians have immigrated to Brazil since the 2010 earthquake, often going first through Ecuador, a poorer country with lax visa policies. Brazil has made an exception for Haitians in contrast to job-seekers from nations like Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, who arrive via similar Amazonian routes but are usually expelled. \n\u201cHaiti is recovering from an extreme period of crisis, and Brazil is in a position to help these people,\u201d said Valdecir Nic\u00e1cio, a human rights official in the state of Acre, encompassing Brasil\u00e9ia. \u201cBefore getting here, they are at the mercy of human traffickers,\u201d he said. \u201cBrazil is big enough to absorb Haitians who just want jobs.\u201d \nWith the number of Haitians sharply increasing in recent days, the authorities in Brasil\u00e9ia and Tabatinga, a border city in Amazonas State, have warned of the strains of trying to feed and house the Haitians while visa applications are reviewed. Federal officials have responded by sending tons of food for the Haitians, who currently number more than 1,000 in each border settlement. \nDealing with an immigration crisis on its border is a new dilemma for Brazil, which until recently was more concerned with the outflow of its own citizens seeking opportunities in rich industrialized countries than responding to the arrival of thousands of impoverished foreigners. \nThough economic growth has recently slowed in Brazil, unemployment remains at a historic low of 5.2 percent, and many companies have trouble finding enough workers to fill vacancies. Wages have also climbed for those at the lowest rung of the job market, with the income of poor Brazilians growing seven times as much as the income of rich Brazilians from 2003 to 2009. \n\n6 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\n\u201cWe were experiencing a decline in our work force because so many Brazilians are going to work at the two hydroelectric projects,\u201d said Ana Terezinha Carvalho, the personnel management analyst at Marquise, a company in Porto Velho. The city lies in the upper Amazon River Basin, where Brazil is employing thousands to build two big dams, called Jirau and Santo Ant\u00f4nio. \nMs. Carvalho said her company quickly hired 37 Haitians who arrived last year, to collect trash in Porto Velho and take it to the city\u2019s landfill. Some make more than $800 a month, in a job that includes benefits like health insurance, overtime and paid holidays. \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough Brazilians, so we were happy to hire the Haitians,\u201d she said. \nThe authorities estimate that about 500 Haitians now live in Porto Velho and that about 700 are in Manaus, the largest city in the Brazilian Amazon. Hundreds more have made it to S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s economic capital. Companies like Fibratec, a swimming pool manufacturer in southern Santa Catarina State, have even sent managers all the way here to hire dozens of Haitians. \nIn addition to meeting demand for cheap labor, the effort to let Haitians work in Brazil speaks to the country\u2019s ambitions of wielding greater regional influence, by attempting to find ways of alleviating problems in the hemisphere\u2019s poorest nation. \nSince 2004, Brazil has sent troops to lead a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti. But there are now more Haitians in Brazil than Brazilian soldiers in Haiti. In September, Brazil announced that it would start drawing down its 2,000 troops in the Caribbean nation. \nMost of the Haitians hope to spend just a few weeks in Brasil\u00e9ia\u2019s immigration limbo, before moving on. Some, like Francisco Joseph, 25, make the most of the time here. He buys prepaid cellphone cards across the bridge in the Bolivian city of Cobija and sells them to fellow Haitians in Brasil\u00e9ia\u2019s plaza at a markup of about 30 cents a card. He makes as much as $10 a day. \n\u201cThis little bit of money gives me a little bit of dignity,\u201d he said. \nOthers, like Jacksin Etienne, 31, nurture bigger dreams. A polyglot who glides with ease between English, Spanish, French and Creole, Mr. Etienne said he hoped to work as a translator or in a hotel. \n\u201cI want to go straight to S\u00e3o Paulo, the New York of South America,\u201d he said. \u201cBrazil\u2019s a rising kind of place, and it needs people like me.\u201d ",

    "text": "Breeding Ground\n2012-10-19T14:23:21.000Z\nWhat a confounding summer it was. At agricultural fairs across the country, people gathered for the simple pleasure of devouring deep-fried Mars bars were coming down with a once-placid pig virus, a variant of H3N2 influenza. Over 300 cases have been confirmed so far, with at least one death. In Texas and elsewhere, pharmacy shelves are shorn of mosquito repellent thanks to the most serious outbreak of a mosquito-\u00adborne bird virus \u2014 West Nile \u2014 the country has ever seen. In Massachusetts, high school football games are being canceled for fear of yet another animal microbe, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, currently stalking the state\u2019s residents. \nThat is to say, David Quammen\u2019s meaty, sprawling new book, \u201cSpillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic,\u201d arrives not a moment too soon. Animal microbes are on the loose. Historically, some 60 percent of the infections that plague humankind, from influenza to H.I.V. and bubonic plague, originated in the bodies of other animals. (To be fair, like any decent fight, the exchanges go the other way too.) But nowadays, Quammen writes, we are \u201ctearing ecosystems apart,\u201d and animals and humans are rubbing shoulders in novel, unexpected ways. The steady drip of animal microbes spilling over into people quickens. \nBut for those ready to stock up on dehydrated meals and hide out in the basement, not to worry: most of the animal microbes portrayed here are unlikely to race across the earth felling millions, despite the book\u2019s suggestive subtitle. \u201cSpillover\u201d hardly touches on such pandemic-\u00adworthy animal pathogens as avian flu or multi-drug-resistant bacteria. What the book more fully describes is the unfolding convergence between veterinary science and human medicine, and how veterinary-\u00adminded medical experts discover and track diseases that spread across species. \u201cSpillover\u201d is less public health warning than ecological affirmation: these crossovers force us to uphold \u201cthe old Darwinian truth (the darkest of his truths, well known and persistently forgotten) that humanity is a kind of animal\u201d \u2014 with a shared fate on the planet. \u201cPeople and gorillas, horses and duikers and pigs, monkeys and chimps and bats and viruses,\u201d Quammen writes. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d \nMuch of the book details Quammen\u2019s prodigious, globe-trotting adventures with microbe hunters in the field, trapping bats in southern China and hysterical monkeys in Bangladesh. Over the course of some 500 pages, Quammen takes us to Australia, where a virus called Hendra has spilled over from bats into horses and from there into people, and to central Africa, where he learns of mass deaths of gorillas potentially connected to a spillover of Ebola virus. In Borneo, he shares a biryani lunch with Balbir Singh, an epidemiologist who investigates the spread of monkey malaria into people. In China, he feasts on the stinky durian fruit (\u201ctastes like vanilla custard and smells like the underwear of someone you don\u2019t want to know\u201d) and helps trap local bats, which in 2003 infected civet cats and then people with the virus that causes SARS. In upstate New York, he helps capture the white-footed mice that harbor the agent that causes Lyme disease. In Cameroon, he traces the putative path of H.I.V.-1, the principal form of the virus, and its first human victims. \nA vivid and erudite nature writer, Quammen is even better as a cheeky and incisive chronicler of the scientific method. He describes a scientist\u2019s archive of dried blood samples as \u201cDNA jerky,\u201d a genetic sequence as a \u201cchoking expletive\u201d and protective gear for fieldwork as \u201cgleaming white footie pajamas.\u201d His leisurely, discursive style, which worked so well in his books on biogeography and top predators, can feel a bit incongruous given the urgency of his topic, though. Dramatic narrations of outbreaks and scientific investigations \u2014 replete with regularly scheduled cliffhangers \u2014 turn out to be inconclusive, debunked or tangential to the central themes of the book. Whole paragraphs are taken up with lists of minutiae, like one that enumerates the gear he takes on a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, including \u201cseven stackable white plastic chairs\u201d and \u201cmedical gloves.\u201d Quammen doesn\u2019t mind repeating himself (he admits it outright, and yes, repeatedly) and can\u2019t resist detours into side obsessions, like taxonomy. But even when his writing is not entirely germane, it\u2019s almost always fun and morbidly entertaining.\nIn one of the most powerful passages in the book, Quammen describes a population boom of tent caterpillars that occurred in his town in western Montana in 1993. The caterpillars had \u201cmaterialized like a plague out of Exodus,\u201d he writes. \u201cOn those cool June nights, we could stand beneath a great tree and still hear the gentle crackle, like distant brush fire, of their excrement cascading down through the leaves.\u201d Then, as abruptly as they\u2019d appeared, they vanished.\nHe later learns that it was a pathogenic virus that led to the tent caterpillars\u2019 collapse. Are we humans, he wonders, due for the same fate? Like the tent caterpillars, we too are \u201cgrotesquely abundant\u201d on the planet, and our numbers continue to rise. \u201cWe are an outbreak,\u201d he writes, and prime fodder for a deadly, population-\u00adcrashing pandemic, the \u201cNext Big One\u201d (or \u201cN.B.O.\u201d in Quammen\u2019s parlance).\nScary stuff. And yet, while it\u2019s true that every time an animal microbe finds its way into a human it gets another opportunity to mutate and adapt to the human body, it\u2019s also true that most of the spillover microbes described here remain firmly tethered to their host animals, or have only limited abilities to spread between humans. And as Quammen points out, pathogens can\u2019t just rampage unconstrained. To survive, they must balance their disease-causing activities inside the body with their need for that same body to carry them into their next victim, whether it\u2019s by coughing, having sex or contaminating the drinking water. Get that balance between transmission and virulence wrong, and even the most infectious micro-organism will die out, never to be heard from again. That\u2019s why Ebola is limited in its pandemic potential. So was SARS, which wreaked its havoc by exploiting air travel, before it too burned itself out. \nThere\u2019s a lot more that could be said on this topic, but Quammen seems reluctant to bog down his exuberant storytelling with too much of that pointy-headed technical stuff. \u201cMathematics to me is like a language I don\u2019t speak though I admire its literature in translation,\u201d he writes. He often delves into an important aspect of the relevant science, but after impressing us with its technical complexity, he backs off for a side story or a biographical sketch, ending with something along the lines of \u201cnobody really knows\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s complicated,\u201d as if he would rather dazzle us with the difficulty of the science than help us comprehend it. He practically apologizes for having to describe fundamental concepts like the basic reproduction rate, or \u201cR0\u201d (the number of new infections caused by an initial case), critical community size (the number of susceptible individuals required to sustain transmission of an infectious disease) and the high mutation rate of RNA viruses. \nC\u2019mon. Kate Winslet explained R0 in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s film \u201cContagion\u201d in 20 seconds. As \u201cSpillover\u201d so richly details, we\u2019re talking about the potential end of the human race here. We can take it. ",

    "text": "Tutoring Spreads Beyond Asia's Wealthy\n2012-08-05T16:27:31.000Z\nSINGAPORE \u2014 On the second floor of a Singapore shopping center, five boys and two girls sat in a small room with the blinds drawn, a whiteboard the only object on the lime-green walls.\nJordan Goh, 12, who began receiving after-school tutoring two years ago, went up to the board to answer a math problem about time and distance, while Dr. Zhong Rui Wen, the founder of the Raffles EduHub, a tutoring center, gave pointers from the back of the room.\n\u201cThis place, it has been helping me a lot,\u201d said Jordan, who attends the center three afternoons a week. \u201cIt drills me on stuff that I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nEvery week, about 150 children attend this center, just a handful of the many students taking private tutoring across Singapore, where attending extra lessons after school has become the norm. \nOnce the domain of the elite, private tutoring has become widespread across Asia, according to a report released in July by the Asian Development Bank and the Comparative Education Research Center at the University of Hong Kong.\nThe report quoted studies, polls and other sources as saying that 97 percent of all Singaporean students, nearly 90 percent of South Korean primary students and about 85 percent of Hong Kong senior secondary students receive tutoring. \nPerhaps more surprising is the prevalence of tutoring in poorer countries. According to various studies, 60 percent of primary students in the Indian state of West Bengal receive tutoring, while a similar proportion of senior secondary students in Kazakhstan attend extra lessons. \nResearchers say that private tutoring, which they call \u201cshadow education,\u201d can help students academically, but they also found that the quality of instruction varied substantially. \nThe number of Asian parents spending heavily on extra lessons has increased, according to the report, \u201cShadow Education: Private Supplementary Tutoring and Its Implications for Policy Makers in Asia.\u201d\n\u201cIt is becoming a pan-Asian phenomenon and indeed a global phenomenon,\u201d Mark Bray, an author of the report and the director of the Comparative Education Research Center at the University of Hong Kong, said by telephone. \nMany Asian families devote vast sums to supplement government education. \u201cThe most dramatic number is Korea,\u201d said Mr. Bray, who is also a professor of comparative education at the University of Hong Kong, \u201cwhere households are spending the equivalent of 80 percent of what the government is spending.\u201d The report said that for students in government secondary schools in Bangladesh, an average of 41.9 percent of the total household cost of education was spent on private tutoring.\nTutoring can range from one-on-one sessions taught by neighbors or older students to classes at franchised centers, as well as over the Internet. \nThe report also described how \u201cstar tutors\u201d who can fill lecture halls have become a phenomenon in places like Hong Kong.\nIt cited two South Korean celebrity tutors: Woo Hyeong-cheol, who reportedly earns $3.9 million per year offering Web-based math classes to 50,000 students; and Rose Lee, \u201cthe Queen of English,\u201d said to earn $6.8 million per year, also through online classes. \nMr. Bray said increased job competition was one of several causes for the rise in demand. \n\u201cOne of the major factors is globalization, that families are no longer competing with their own neighborhood \u2014 they\u2019re competing with the region and the world,\u201d he said.\nIn some poorer countries, like Cambodia, perceived weaknesses in the school system could also prompt parents to turn to tutoring, Mr. Bray said.\nTeachers in Hong Kong and Singapore are not permitted to tutor their own students privately for additional pay. But teachers in other countries who do so for extra income may also be bolstering demand. \nPakistan, where 60 percent of the population lives on less than $2 per day, is example of a developing country where demand for tutoring has spread beyond wealthier, urban centers.\nIn the rural part of Lahore, 44 percent of private school students and 32 percent of government school students had private tutoring last year, according to the Annual Status of Education Report, a survey conducted by Idara-e-Taleem- o-Aagahi, or the Center for Education and Consciousness, on behalf of the South Asian Forum for Education Development. In the urban area of Lahore, that number rises to 60 percent. \n\u201cIt can be said that the incidence of private tutoring is lower in relatively poorer areas,\u201d Baela Raza Jamil, the director of programs at Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi, said by e-mail. \u201cHowever, it is definitely no more a phenomena limited to the wealthier families of the country.\u201d\nOver all, 24 percent of Pakistani students who attended private schools reported taking supplementary tutoring last year, while the figure was 7 percent among government school students.\n\u201cBecause of the increased competition for higher learning outcomes,\u201d Ms. Jamil said, parents who can afford it are providing supplementary tutoring for their children.\nThe Federally Administered Tribal Areas had the highest level of private tutoring in Pakistan, with almost half of private school students and a quarter of government school students receiving tutoring, a rate Ms. Jamil attributed to the fact those schools often close because of conflicts along the Afghan-Pakistan border.\nThe report found that tutoring could worsen social inequalities, cause stress for families and reduce the time students spent on other activities.\nA recent letter in The Straits Times, the biggest newspaper in Singapore, said that many parents wanted a more balanced education for their children and that social mobility might be affected by the heavy reliance on extra tutoring, also known as \u201ctuition.\u201d\n\u201cHow can we tell ourselves that all students stand an equal chance of moving up the social ladder when success in our education system is highly dependent on the extra tuition and enrichment lessons that wealthier parents can afford and poorer parents cannot?\u201d read the letter, by Wily Wan.\nResearchers say they are also worried about the impact tutoring is having on formal education.\n\u201cEven in societies where teachers are not allowed to tutor their own students,\u201d Mr. Bray said, \u201cif teachers think there is a safety net, they may be less concerned about working hard, about doing what arguably should be their job of helping children, of making sure the children understand and so on.\u201d\nThe researchers recommended that governments more closely monitor the tutoring industry and consider possible regulations. The report also suggests that policy makers look at improving mainstream education to make supplementary tutoring less desirable. \nBut it seems as if many parents in Asia still feel that tutoring is necessary.\nDr. Zhong, a medical doctor and child psychiatrist, said her tutoring center in Singapore was only for students whose grades are average or below average \u2014 children who she said often required more attention than they received in school. She says she believes that students can combine tutoring with other activities and that she does not want her students to neglect pursuits like sports.\nJordan Goh\u2019s mother, Judy Hii, sent him to the center to help him with the primary school final exam, which will determine which secondary school he attends.\n\u201cBecause of the limited time the teacher has with them, they really do need help,\u201d Ms. Hii said. \u201cThe school will say, \u2018Leave it to the school,\u2019 but somehow it\u2019s just not enough.\u201d\nShe thinks that the extra lessons have paid off because Jordan passed his last mock exam after 10 days of intensive drilling at the center.\nReferring to Dr. Zhong, Ms. Hii said, \u201cShe did some miracle work.\u201d",

    "text": "Like Mother, Like Child\n2012-11-21T17:30:48.000Z\nThe science writer Sandra Blakeslee has written seven books with eminent authors like the psychologist Judith Wallerstein and the neuro\u00adscientist V. S. Ramachandran. But her favorite collaborator to date has been her son, Matthew. \u201cThe way we worked together was perfect,\u201d she said about \u201cThe Body Has a Mind of Its Own,\u201d the 2007 book they wrote together. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll do Chapter 1, you do 2, I\u2019ll do 3, you do 4.\u2019 Then we started swapping them back and forth.\u201d No anger, no fights, no stepping on toes, she insisted. Never. \u201cOur different strengths would come to the fore. Matt is a beautiful writer, a better writer than I am, and I\u2019m a little better on structure.\u201d \nMatt, who was then in his mid-30s, said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t even occur to me I was doing this with my mother. It was more just neuroscience geek to neuroscience geek.\u201d \nBut seriously: writing a book with your mother? Collaborating is tricky enough. Is it worth the risk of damaging the mother-child bond (assuming it\u2019s strong enough even to contemplate such a venture)? \nApparently so, at least that\u2019s what many of us decide \u2014 and luckily we tend to come out the other end relatively unscathed. While the mother-child relationship could in theory complicate things, it seems more often to be exactly what\u2019s needed to make these co-authorships work. \u201cI think it would be harder to collaborate with someone who wasn\u2019t my mother,\u201d said the novelist Carol Higgins Clark, who since 2000 has written five mysteries with her mother, Mary Higgins Clark. \u201cI feel so comfortable saying this or that to her; there\u2019s no sense of anything being critical or one-upmanship.\u201d \nMother-child book collaborations, both official and unacknowledged, go back at least as far as the 1930s and Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s spectacularly successful \u201cLittle House\u201d books. Wilder\u2019s daughter, Rose, played an important part in the writing of the series, though whether as editor or ghostwriter is unclear; if she was a co-author, she never got the credit. Typing Wilder\u2019s manuscripts, Rose \u201creshaped and heightened the dramatic structure,\u201d the New Yorker critic Judith Thurman wrote. \u201cShe also rewrote the prose so drastically that Laura sometimes felt usurped.\u201d But the Wilders never seemed to address their relationship directly beyond a few passive-\u00adaggressive letters. \u201cYou know your judgment is better than mine,\u201d Laura said in one, which accompanied the draft of Book 4, \u201cso what you decide is the one that stands.\u201d\nAs with Rose and Laura, not all mother-child writing teams are overt. The team that wrote the best-selling \u201cWhat to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting,\u201d Arlene Eisenberg and her daughters Sandee E. Hathaway and Heidi E. Murkoff, got along partly because they played down that they were related. \u201cIf you start bringing in the mother-daughter stuff,\u201d Eisenberg, who died in 2001, told a Los Angeles Times reporter, \u201cyou\u2019ll never get anything done.\u201d The younger daughter, Heidi, always referred to her mother as \u201cArlene\u201d when they were working. \u201cIf I started saying \u2018Mom,\u2019 it would be very weird,\u201d she said.\nThe mother-child collaboration often begins as a gesture of generosity: a parent wants to let a child weigh in on what might well be considered the child\u2019s own story. When Anne Lamott\u2019s publisher asked her to write a sequel to \u201cOperating Instructions,\u201d the 1993 book she wrote about her son Sam\u2019s first year, her instinct was to worry about how Sam would feel, since it would be about becoming a grandmother to his son, Jax. She thought it only fair to involve Sam. \u201cI was in the middle of another book,\u201d she said, and not all that interested in a sequel. \u201cBut when I pitched it to Sam, he was so excited. He wanted Jax to have the same experience he had\u201d \u2014 growing up the subject of a detailed, loving account of his infancy, in Sam\u2019s case, in a book that remains in print. \nFor Barbara Kingsolver, the motivation to include her older daughter, Camille, in \u201cAnimal, Vegetable, Miracle\u201d stemmed from a similar urge: not to co-opt her child\u2019s story. The book, published in 2007, is a memoir of life on a family farm in Virginia, and Kingsolver wanted Camille to contribute because she had shared in the experience. Her agent wasn\u2019t happy with the idea. \u201cShe\u2019d seen co-\u00adauthorships damage a lot of relationships,\u201d Kingsolver said in an e-mail. To avoid potential pitfalls, like lawsuits for breach of contract, the agent strongly recommended financial equity, with every royalty check split evenly among the authors. So that\u2019s the way they arranged it: one-third to Kingsolver; one-third to her husband, Steven Hopp, an environmental biologist who contributed scientific sidebars; and one-third to Camille, then age 17, who wrote postscripts to each chapter, complete with recipes. (Kingsolver\u2019s other daughter, Lily, was too young to take part.) \nSometimes generosity can work in the other direction. Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9, author of the 1971 classic \u201cDiet for a Small Planet,\u201d was going through a tough time in 2000, she recalled, and her son and daughter advised her to go back to her first love: food politics. \u201cWe\u2019ll help you,\u201d they said. Her son became distracted by other projects, but her daughter, Anna, spent a year on the road with her mother \u2014 traveling with Lapp\u00e9 to Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Brazil and Western Europe \u2014 which led to their 2002 book, \u201cHope\u2019s Edge.\u201d \n\u201cOf my 18 books it\u2019s really up there in terms of my favorites,\u201d Lapp\u00e9 said. \u201cThe key to the book is the voices and intense experiences of the people we met \u2014 and the fact that we had access to that is a reflection of the mother-daughter team.\u201d It helped to be related, Anna added, when they would hike into a remote village and discover the only sleeping arrangement available was a single cot.\nIt\u2019s hard not to expect at least some friction along the way. Judith Martin collaborated with her daughter, Jacobina, on the 2010 \u201cMiss Manners\u2019 Guide to a Surprisingly Dignified Wedding.\u201d While promoting the book, Martin said, \u201cyou could see that behind all the questions was the assumption that we\u2019d had fights along the way.\u201d They had to disappoint their interlocutors.\nStill, there can be a tendency to fall back into mother-\u00adchild roles: the nagger and the nagee. \u201cSam had to be nudged and goaded and bribed and threatened and whatnot to get the work done,\u201d Lamott said, calling herself the nagging Boss Lady to Sam\u2019s Mellow Young Artist. Deadlines Lamott set for her son came and went, unmet. And then \u201cit was just bribes and threats and Unhappy Mommy Face and bitterness.\u201d\nBut the struggle was worth it, she said. She\u2019d be in a sweat waiting for Sam to send her his sections, second-\u00adguessing her decision to agree to such a \u201chopeless\u201d project. And then magically, an e-mail would appear full of \u201cthis wonderful stuff, from his own true heart, in the words of a young and unusual man, a 19-year-old daddy. And I\u2019d just be humbled.\u201d\nSome might grumble that the children in this arrangement have an unfair advantage, getting to write their first books not because they earned it but because they rode their parents\u2019 celebrated coattails. Outsiders\u2019 resentments occasionally erupt in questions from tactless journalists (perhaps someone with an unpublished manuscript in a drawer). \u201cHow does it feel to be in your mother\u2019s shadow?\u201d one interviewer asked Anna Lapp\u00e9 during the book tour for \u201cHope\u2019s Edge.\u201d To which she replied: \u201cI\u2019m not in my mother\u2019s shadow. I\u2019m in my mother\u2019s light.\u201d ",

    "text": "Asian Researchers Reach Out to One Another\n2012-10-14T10:07:24.000Z\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2014 Freshwater prawns are becoming an increasingly important component of the aquaculture industry in Asia, but farmers have to deal with problems related to disease, reproduction and climate change. \nSubha Bhassu, a geneticist and associate professor at the University of Malaya \u2019s Center for Biotechnology in Agriculture Research in Malaysia, believes that genome sequencing could help address these issues, along with the power of collective research.\nDr. Subha and her team have been working with researchers from the Beijing Genome Institute  and the Queensland University of Technology  in Australia since 2009. They have produced joint research papers, taken part in joint staff training and held student exchanges.\nThis year, she helped establish a Southeast Asian network of aquaculture researchers, with scientists from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam coming together every three months to share research and develop doctoral student exchange programs.\nDr. Subha, who communicates with her Asian counterparts every few weeks via Skype, is adamant that the most effective way to ensure a better and safer food supply is for scientists to pool their knowledge and resources.\n\u201cFor poverty, for the environment, for sustainability, we have to work together,\u201d she said.\nResearch released recently by the British Council found that many Asian universities had high international research collaboration rates and that researchers who collaborated across borders were likely to have their work cited more frequently.\n\u201cWith the economic integration that has already taken place in Asia, there\u2019s an incentive for scientists in the region to get to know one another much more intimately,\u201d said Gerard A. Postiglione, a professor with the education faculty at the University of Hong Kong. \nIn Southeast Asia, a region that has recorded impressive increases in research output in recent years, many countries have international collaboration rates above the global average, according to the study by the British Council and SciVal Analytics. \nThe study focused on Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam and examined articles published in academic journals in the past five years in fields related to medicine, science, engineering, technology, social sciences and the humanities. \n Janet Ilieva , a senior education adviser for the British Council who presented the study at a conference in Hong Kong last month, said that more than half of the research from the Philippines and Indonesia was the result of international collaboration.\nMore than 90 percent of the articles by academics in Laos, which produces a relatively small amount of research, involved foreign scholars. This contrasts with an international collaboration rate of 46 percent in the United Kingdom. \n\u201cI think countries that have a low research output and have very minimal or small research capacity, they can be very dependent on international collaboration,\u201d Dr. Ilieva said. \nEducation academics say that many Asian scientists also work with counterparts in the West and that greater collaboration within regions could also help tackle some of the major challenges facing the region, including urbanization, tropical diseases and climate change.\n\u201cMany collaborate with other non-Asean countries,\u201d Dr. Ilieva added, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \u201cThere\u2019s some Asean collaboration, but it seems to be mainly with a country from outside Asean.\u201d\nDr. Ilieva attributed this trend in part to greater research capacity in the West and the fact that many Asian researchers trained overseas.\n\u201cI can only assume that when they go back they carry with them the research links of the institution that they have studied at,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAt this stage quite a lot of the lecturers in East Asia that hold Ph.D.\u2019s are likely to have studied in a Western country because at the doctorate level, East Asia is still building their capacity,\u201d she added. \u201cBut as capacity develops, we are likely to see more collaboration between Asian countries.\u201d \nAgricultural science is one area where greater collaboration is already taking place among Asian nations.\n\u201cThis seems to be their strength,\u201d Dr. Ilieva said, citing research into rice production between countries like Thailand and Vietnam as an example. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of perhaps the economic priorities from 10 years ago, because the agricultural sector is a significant contributor to the gross domestic product of the country.\u201d \nMalaysia\u2019s research output has grown an average of 38 percent per year over the past five years, compared with a worldwide average of 3 percent. According to Dr. Ilieva, the country was trying to diversify its research portfolio beyond the agricultural sector by placing more focus on engineering, technology and the medical sciences.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an indicator of a country that is building up its research capacity and will one day be a major player,\u201d Dr. Ilieva said.\nDr. Postiglione, who is also director of the Wah Ching Center of Research on Education in China , said it was already common for top-tier Asian universities to collaborate with top universities in the West, while collaboration between Asia\u2019s best institutions was growing.\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s rising collaboration among China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore, among other places in Asia,\u201d he said.\nDr. Postiglione said that Hong Kong and Singapore were leaders in Asia in terms of international collaboration. He attributed this to the fact that English was widely spoken in both places and that they recruited many academics from around the world.\nBut Dr. Postiglione said that most Hong Kong research collaboration took place with mainland China or Western countries. Meanwhile, collaboration between top-tier Asian universities and less-established institutions in the region was lagging.\n\u201cUnfortunately, that hasn\u2019t yet taken off in a big way,\u201d Dr. Postiglione said, adding that economic integration across Asia had not increased regional collaboration in higher education research to the extent that could have been expected.\nDr. Postiglione said many Asian doctoral students still viewed top universities in North America and Europe as the places to aim for \u201cbecause of their research facilities, famous scientists, and academic and intellectual freedom and vitality.\u201d\nAccording to researchers, language differences, a lack of research capacity and insufficient funding are among the current barriers to greater collaboration within Asia.\nDr. Postiglione said that research needed to be done in English to have the greatest impact and that the lack of a common language could present difficulties in parts of Asia where English is not widely spoken. With a gap between established universities in Asia and newcomers, finding institutions with similar research capacities can also be challenging.\nBut there is plenty of incentive for Asian researchers to seek out collaborative opportunities.\nThe British Council research found that articles by international teams of researchers attracted about twice as many citations as research produced domestically.\nThe rate for some countries is even higher. For Indonesian researchers, for instance, articles produced with an international author attracted six times as many citations.\nDr. Ilieva said that other research showed that the number of citations increased as the number of collaborating countries rose. \nShe believed that internationally produced articles were likely to have a greater impact because of the perception that global problems were best addressed by international research teams.\n\u201cWe are likely to see a shift from bilateral types of collaboration to multilateral collaborations because the relevance of the research grows with the number of participating countries,\u201d she said.\nMok Ka-ho, chair professor of comparative policy at the Hong Kong Institute of Education , said that collaboration between academia and industry had also increased. For example, companies from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have opened research facilities in mainland China. \u201cThis is leading to more opportunities to engage universities in the China mainland,\u201d he said.\nDr. Mok is also the chairman of the East Asian Social Policy research network, which was established in 2005 to promote collaborative study in areas like social welfare and population growth. More than 300 scholars and doctoral students from mainland China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and European countries have joined the group. \nDr. Mok said that the researchers benefited from working on problems that affected the region. \u201cI think this is the way forward,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "Inspectors Certified Pakistani Factory as Safe Before Disaster\n2012-09-20T02:17:51.000Z\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 A prominent factory monitoring group heavily financed by industry gave a clean bill of health to a Pakistani apparel plant last month, just weeks before a fire engulfed the premises and killed nearly 300 workers, many of them trapped behind locked exit doors.\nIn August, two inspectors who visited the factory, Ali Enterprises in Karachi, to examine working conditions gave it a prestigious SA8000 certification, meaning it had met international standards in nine areas, including health and safety, child labor and minimum wages. The two inspectors were working on behalf of Social Accountability International, a nonprofit monitoring group based in New York that obtains much of its financing from corporations and relies on 21 affiliates around the world to do most of its inspections.\nWeeks later, a fire swept the plant on Sept. 12, trapping hundreds of workers in a building with barred windows and just one open exit, resulting in one of the worst industrial disasters in history \u2014 one that killed nearly twice as many workers as the landmark Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911 in New York. \nThe Karachi tragedy is a huge embarrassment to the factory monitoring system, in which many Western garment and electronics companies rely on auditing groups to provide a coveted seal of approval to their low-cost suppliers in the developing world. \nAs the blaze spread \u2014 much as the Triangle fire did a century earlier \u2014 some workers were forced to leap from upper-floor windows, suffering serious injuries; many more died of smoke inhalation and from searing temperatures inside the building. A German discount textile chain has said its jeans were being manufactured in the plant at the time. \nThe calamity has led to bitter recriminations in Pakistan, where textile exports play a vital role in a faltering economy. For international rights campaigners, the fact that the factory had been certified by a respected Western organization made clear the failings of a controversial 15-year-old industry initiative. \n\u201cThe whole system is flawed,\u201d said Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a monitoring group based in Washington that is financed by American universities. \u201cThis demonstrates, more clearly than ever, that corporate-funded monitoring systems like S.A.I. cannot and will not protect workers.\u201d\nSocial Accountability International said it had suspended work in Pakistan with the RINA Group, an Italian company that carried out the Ali Enterprises audit on its behalf. It added that it was engaged in a broad review of its entire certification process.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find out what went wrong,\u201d Eileen Kohl Kaufman, executive director of Social Accountability International, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s unimaginably horrible. The only thing we can hope for is clear answers so as to show how to take preventive action.\u201d\nThe three owners of the Ali Enterprises factory, who fled Karachi in the hours after the fire broke out, appeared this week at a courthouse in Larkana, 200 miles to the northeast. The State Bank of Pakistan has frozen the owners\u2019 bank accounts, which hold more than $5 million, according to news media reports. Their passports have been confiscated, and they may face criminal charges. \nOn Monday, a two-person government commission of inquiry started investigating the circumstances around the fire. It has already uncovered evidence of gross failings in Pakistan\u2019s regulatory system, which is riddled with corruption, political interference and poor management. \nDuring a hearing on Tuesday, electrical safety inspectors struggled to define the rules and regulations of their own department. One said they had formally stopped doing factory inspections in 2003. \nRecords showed that the Ali Enterprises factory had officially registered just 250 workers even though in reality as many as 1,000 people worked there, said Mirza Ikhtiar Baig, senior adviser on textiles to the prime minister. \u201cThere is an urgent need to review our safety features,\u201d he said. \nBut the disaster has also revived scrutiny of the procurement policies of the Western companies that have their clothes made in factories like Ali Enterprises. \nIn a statement about the fire, Social Accountability International said, \u201cThe enormity of this tragedy points to endemic issues in the apparel industry for decent working conditions.\u201d\nThe SA8000 certification, which was begun in 1997, is central to the work of Social Accountability International, whose stated mission is \u201cto advance the human rights of workers around the world,\u201d and which is supported by companies like Gap; Gucci, in Italy; and Groupe Carrefour, in France, as well as representatives of some labor rights groups. \nBased on International Labor Organization and United Nations standards, the group says on its Web site that the certification has \u201cimproved the lives of over 1.8 million workers in over 3,000 factories, across 65 countries and 66 industrial sectors.\u201d\nBut Richard M. Locke, a professor of political science at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management who has written extensively about monitoring, said the Ali Enterprises fire suggested that such claims were exaggerated. \n\u201cEven after a decade or more of such private monitoring efforts, these programs \u2014 no matter how well funded or designed or how well trained their auditors are \u2014 simply do not in and of themselves produce sustained and significant improvements in labor standards in most supply chain factories,\u201d Professor Locke said. \nThe RINA Group, which carried out the Ali Enterprises audit, has performed 540 factory certifications for Social Accountability International, according to the the international organization\u2019s Web site, including nearly 100 in Pakistan. \nAlthough Ali Enterprises was a well-established textiles plant, largely in the supply of denim products, so far just one of its Western customers has come forward publicly: the German textile discount chain KiK, which operates 3,200 stores in Germany, Austria and six Eastern European countries. \nKiK \u2014 an acronym for Kunde ist K\u00f6nig, which means the customer is king \u2014 has previously faced criticism for its supply-chain practices in Bangladesh. \nIn an e-mail, a company spokeswoman told European labor rights activists that it had obtained three independent audits of Ali Enterprises. The factory failed to meet fire safety standards during a 2007 check, but those problems were remedied by the time of a subsequent check in December 2011, she said. \nKiK said it had started a relief fund for the families of the dead and injured workers in conjunction with other Western producers that use the plant. But the identities of those producers remain a mystery. \nOne reporter found a pair of jeans bearing the Diesel brand on the factory\u2019s premises after the fire, but Diesel has denied any links to the plant. \nIn recent years, many factory monitors have come under criticism. For instance, various audits of Foxconn, which assembles iPhones and iPads for Apple in China, have been heavily criticized for failing to stop child labor, illegal amounts of overtime and dangerous conditions.\nMs. Kaufman of Social Accountability International said the two inspectors spent four days at the Karachi plant. She noted that because this was an initial audit for certification, the plant\u2019s managers had been warned of the visit. She said future inspections would have been without advance notice.\nTessel Pauli, coordinator for the Clean Clothes Campaign, a European antisweatshop group, criticized the audit process. \n\u201cWorkers are often told what to tell the auditor,\u201d she said. \u201cThe inspections are announced, and there is time to do things like open exit doors that other times are locked.\u201d\nAfter the Ali Enterprises fire, some surviving workers said they had been warned of a visit by inspectors and coached to lie about their working conditions, under threat of dismissal.",

    "text": "Dividends Emerge in Pressing Apple Over Working Conditions in China\n2012-03-07T02:23:13.000Z\nThe American sweatshop opposition movement was born the day we discovered how our Nikes were stitched together. Two decades later, we are discovering how our cherished iPhones are made, giving Apple a \u201cNike moment\u201d of its own.\nWorker suicides at Apple\u2019s main Chinese supplier, Foxconn, in 2010, followed by reports of forced overtime, child labor, minimum wage violations and unsafe working conditions at its suppliers, have contrasted with Apple\u2019s status as creator of hallowed devices and its spectacular $13 billion in profit \u2014 30 percent of sales \u2014 in the first quarter.\nThe reports have fueled a budding protest among students and labor unions who call for Apple to compel its suppliers in China to improve the conditions for hundreds of thousands of workers who assemble its products \u2014 workers whose wages contribute a mere $10 to the cost of a contract-free $549 iPhone 4.\nBut if the troubling conditions at Foxconn\u2019s assembly lines raise anew fundamental questions about the responsibility of corporations in this age of global capitalism, the outcry raises a basic question too. Does pressure by consumers and governments in the West to improve multinationals\u2019 behavior in poor countries do more harm than good?\nSweatshop opposition in the past offers limited hope. But Apple is different in some ways than the garment and shoemakers of earlier campaigns. Its high profile and deep pockets suggest that consumer pressure might indeed effect change for workers at Apple\u2019s suppliers in China.\nIn the 1990s, when the anti-sweatshop movement was going strong, Paul Krugman, before he became a columnist for The New York Times, wrote that \u201cas long as you have no realistic alternative to industrialization based on low wages, to oppose it means that you are willing to deny desperately poor people the best chance they have of progress for the sake of what amounts to an aesthetic standard \u2014 that is, the fact that you don\u2019t like the idea of workers being paid a pittance to supply rich Westerners with fashion items.\u201d\nToday, globalization has a decidedly better track record than its alternative. Countries that receive lots of multinational investment have grown faster. They report less poverty and less use of child labor.\nChina is an example of globalization\u2019s benefits. Foreign investment has surged over the last 20 years, driving spectacular economic growth. Wages in the nonfarm sector have risen 10 percent a year in real terms over the last decade, according to Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nThe nation\u2019s poverty rate, measured by the share of the population living on less than $1.25 a day, fell to 17 percent by the middle of the last decade, from 64 percent in the early 1990s, according to World Bank statistics. In Bangladesh, ignored by foreign capital, half of the population live in abject poverty, roughly the same share as in 1981. As Joan Robinson, a British economist, noted half a century ago, \u201cthe misery of being exploited by capitalists is nothing compared to the misery of not being exploited at all.\u201d\nThis poses a quandary for would-be activists in the West. They see their task as convincing multinationals like Apple that whatever the cost of improved working conditions at its suppliers\u2019 plants, it is less than the potential cost to its reputation of allowing workers to toil in sweatshop conditions. But they must not forget that the No. 1 priority for most of Foxconn\u2019s workers is to keep their job. While outside pressure might improve their lives, it could also persuade Foxconn to replace them.\nThe anti-sweatshop movement\u2019s origins can be traced to late 1980s Indonesia, a global hub of the apparel and footwear business. Reports of violations of workers\u2019 rights at Indonesian suppliers to big brands like Nike and Reebok led unions and human rights groups to press the United States to suspend Indonesian trade preferences. Articles about women stitching Nikes in dismal conditions for 91 cents a day appeared in the press, mobilizing campaigns against the apparel giant.\nFor a while it seemed that activism could win the day: the Indonesian minimum wage rose from less than 80 cents to about $1.80 a day from 1990 to 1996. Wages at factories for brand-name sneakers rose even faster, as the brands forced suppliers to comply with the wage floor. Nike issued a code of conduct requiring suppliers to adhere to labor, health and environmental standards. Many  other victories followed, with big brands repeatedly acceding to demands that they enforce better working conditions at their suppliers\u2019 plants across the third world.\nBut in time, many of the victories of consumer activism turned a little sour. Though Indonesian factories that stitched sneakers for big brands like Nike did add jobs in the 1990s, despite the sharply higher wages, economists reported significant job losses throughout the economy. Activists bemoan the fact that even when they persuade brands to press their suppliers to improve working conditions, victories turn to defeat when suppliers try to pass on the additional cost of higher wages, shorter hours or increased benefits.\n\u201cWhen brands get caught at one facility, and pressure is brought to bear, they can be forced to push for changes at that facility,\u201d said Scott Nova, executive director of the Workers Rights Consortium, which monitors working conditions at plants that make college-brand clothes. \u201cHowever, if those changes raise costs and slow delivery times, it is easy enough, a year or two down the road, for the brand to reduce orders at that factory in favor of others.\u201d\nThe most telling commentary on the effectiveness of the anti-sweatshop movement is the prevalence, years later, of dismal working conditions and illegally low wages at many suppliers of the world\u2019s large multinational brands\nApple\u2019s critics should not despair, however. Despite failures and drawbacks, activists have made progress.\nFor one thing, they have persuaded major brands and retailers to take responsibility for working conditions along their supplier pipeline \u2014 something unheard-of two decades ago. And the anti-sweatshop movement has contributed to improvements in workers\u2019 lives in concrete ways, forcing better compliance with health and safety norms and reducing the most egregious forms of harassment.\nBut the most promising consideration for critics is just how different Apple is from the companies singled out by the anti-sweatshop movement of the 1990s.\nFor starters, Apple\u2019s enormous profit margins \u2014 owing to the great popularity of the inimitable products it sells \u2014 vastly outstrip the thin margins prevalent in the garment and footwear industry and make it much easier for the company to absorb the cost of improving worker conditions at its suppliers.\nWhat\u2019s more, supplier contracts in the electronic industry tend to be much longer than the three-month terms common in the apparel business. This gives Apple a much bigger stake in the long-term success of Foxconn as a supplier, and makes it less attractive to cut and run to a cheaper option.\nAnd Apple\u2019s vaunted ability to make suppliers twirl on a dime to satisfy its most exacting specifications in the shortest possible time suggests the company would have little trouble imposing rules on wages or workers\u2019 rights.\nConsumer pressure and bad publicity have already led Apple to make some big changes. In 2005 it created a code of conduct for its suppliers, monitored regularly. Last month it became the first electronics company to join the Fair Labor Association, a group set up in 1999 by companies, universities and nonprofit groups to monitor working conditions at garment makers in the third world. Over the last two years, Foxconn has announced repeated wage increases at its plant in Shenzhen.\nThese are early days. Who knows, if activists keep up the pressure, they might help lead to significant improvements in the lives of Foxconn\u2019s workers and make us feel better about how our iPhones are made.",

    "text": "To Be Black at Stuyvesant High\n2012-02-25T06:31:23.000Z\nLIKE a city unto itself, Stuyvesant High School, in Lower Manhattan, is broken into neighborhoods, official and otherwise. The math department is on the 4th of its 10 floors; biology is on the 7th. Seniors congregate by the curved mint wall off the second-floor atrium, next to lockers that are such prime real estate that students trade them for $100 or more. Sophomores are relegated to the sixth floor. \nIn Stuyvesant slang, the hangouts are known as \u201cbars.\u201d Some years ago, the black students took over the radiators outside the fifth-floor cafeteria, and the place soon came to be known as the \u201cchocolate bar,\u201d lending it an air of legitimacy in the school\u2019s labyrinth of cliques and turfs. \nIt did not last long. This year, Asian freshmen displaced the black students in a strength-in-numbers coup in which whispers of indignation were the sole expression of resistance. There was no point arguing, said Rudi-Ann Miller, a 17-year-old senior who came to New York from Jamaica and likes to style her hair in a bun, slick and straight, like the ballerina she once dreamed of becoming. \n\u201cThe Asian kids, they\u2019re just everywhere,\u201d she said.\nWhen the bell rings and the school\u2019s 3,295 students spill out of classrooms into the maze of hallways, escalators and stairs like ants in a farm, blacks stand out because they are so rare. Rudi was one of 64 black students four years ago when she entered Stuyvesant, long considered New York City\u2019s flagship public school. She is now one of 40. \nAsians, on the other hand, make up 72.5 percent of Stuyvesant\u2019s student body (they are 13.7 percent of the city\u2019s overall public school population), a staggering increase from 1970, when they were 6 percent of Stuyvesant students, according to state enrollment statistics. Back then, white students made up 79 percent of Stuyvesant\u2019s enrollment; this year, they are 24 percent, and 14.9 percent systemwide.\nHispanic students are 40.3 percent of the system. Currently, they make up 2.4 percent of Stuyvesant\u2019s enrollment, while blacks, who make up 32 percent of the city\u2019s public school students, are 1.2 percent. \nNew York City has eight specialized high schools whose admission is based entirely on the results of an entrance exam, a meritocratic system that does not consider race or ethnicity. The top score on the exam is 800. In recent years, the cutoff for Stuyvesant has been around 560; Rudi scored 594.\nEarning a spot at Stuyvesant is unquestionably a badge of honor, sort of a secret knock to an exclusive club. As high school admissions decisions are revealed across the city in the coming week, many people are concerned that it is a club that black students \u2014 and, to a similar extent, Latinos \u2014 have an increasingly hard time cracking.\nNo one claims that the disparity is caused by overt discrimination. But in a school that is devised to attract the best of the best, parents and educators alike find the demographics troubling. It has become a question of perception as to who belongs.\nThe school\u2019s parent coordinator, Harvey Blumm, said that when he visited middle schools whose enrollments were overwhelmingly black and Latino, it was not uncommon to find students who had never heard about the specialized high school exam; or to meet students who had signed up for the exam, but had never thought of taking a practice test or prep course \u2014 something common among white and Asian students; or to have guidance counselors tell him that Stuyvesant \u201cisn\u2019t for our kids.\u201d\nRUDI, who lives in the Wakefield section of the Bronx, attended sixth and seventh grades in Jamaica, and eighth grade in Mount Vernon, a Westchester County suburb. Her father, Donovan Miller, a director of accounting at Bronx Community College, recalled asking a colleague for advice about enrolling Rudi, the youngest of his three children, in \u201cthe best New York City high school.\u201d The colleague advised Mr. Miller that he had to sign her up for the specialized high school exam and, if he wanted to improve her odds, to have her take some kind of test preparation program. \nMany Stuyvesant students start preparing for the exam months, even years, in advance. There are after-school, weekend and summer classes run by large companies like Kaplan and Princeton Review, as well as by neighborhood outfits like Aim Academy, in the predominantly Chinese enclave of Flushing, Queens, and the Khan\u2019s Tutorial branch in nearby Jackson Heights, home to thousands of families from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\nRudi took Kaplan\u2019s 12-week program, which met on Saturdays at Fordham University, at a cost of $750, the summer after seventh grade. (Students take the exam in October of their eighth-grade year.) Her tutor, a Stuyvesant graduate, persuaded her to make the school her first choice. \nHer mother, Annmarie Miller, a nursing assistant at a hospital in the Bronx, recalled a cousin\u2019s reaction when she mentioned Rudi\u2019s pick: \u201cYou have to be Chinese or Indian to get in there.\u201d A co-worker, also black, \u201csaid the exam is built to exclude blacks because it\u2019s heavy on math, and black people can\u2019t do math,\u201d Mrs. Miller said.\nRudi said she has never felt uncomfortable at Stuyvesant, but she has felt puzzled. She has been the only black person in most of her classes, and often goes hours without seeing another. The school\u2019s attendance sheets have names and pictures of the students, and she said teachers were quick to learn who she is; there are few others like her, she said.\nFor Rudi, being black at Stuyvesant has been a journey of self-discovery. In Jamaica, as in parts of the Bronx, it is not skin color that distinguishes people, she said, but the car they drive, the neighborhood they live in or the job they have.\nAt school, she embraced her racial identity, becoming president last May of the Black Students League, the smallest of the school\u2019s four diversity clubs, which usually draws fewer than 10 regulars to its weekly meetings. She had run unopposed.\nRudi said the league wasn\u2019t \u201cabout black power or anything like that,\u201d but to \u201cmake Stuy aware of our community and our culture.\u201d\nIt has been a frustrating task.\nAs part of Black History Month, the league screened an hourlong documentary, \u201cSlavery and the Law,\u201d which chronicles the status of blacks from colonial times through the civil rights era. There were 100 chairs in front of the pull-down screen at Stuyvesant\u2019s sixth-floor library; 15 students showed up.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just never had the numbers to make it work,\u201d Rudi lamented.\nRudi\u2019s paternal grandfather arrived in America in 1968 and ultimately became a citizen. He paved the way for her parents, who arrived in 2006 to build their future \u2014 in a house in the suburbs at first, then just over the city line in a suburban-seeming slice of the Bronx, on a street of children-at-play signs and matching brick homes. Rudi stayed behind in Jamaica to finish seventh grade, on a government scholarship at Campion College, a school her father described as the best in Jamaica, with her sister, Nadia, who was finishing college. (They have an older brother, who still lives there.)\nRudi landed at Kennedy International Airport on July 4, 2007, to live her parents\u2019 American dream. Nadia, who arrived a year later, gave modeling a try, and graduated from flight school before she discovered she was afraid of heights. Now she works at a bank and is considering medical school.\n\u201cHave you ever seen a doctor who\u2019s unemployed?\u201d Nadia, 25, asked their mother one night before dinner.\nRudi said, \u201cMy sister is definitely smarter than me.\u201d Nadia said Rudi worked harder.\nIn January, a week before her midyear exams, Rudi e-mailed a friend, \u201cI\u2019m STRESSED and SLEEP DEPRIVED! In fact, I won\u2019t be going to sleep tonight (second night in a row. ... Oh, well!)\u201d\nBy then, she had already been accepted via early admission to Yale, her first choice. Nadia could not understand why Rudi did not just coast until graduation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be an embarrassment to my teachers,\u201d Rudi said.\nShe has also had enough of the grumbling at Stuyvesant that black students do better in the college-admissions game because of their skin color.\nYEAR after year, certain middle schools in New York \u2014 Mark Twain Gifted and Talented in Coney Island, Brooklyn, and the Christa McAuliffe Middle School in nearby Bensonhurst \u2014 send dozens of students to Stuyvesant, according to Mr. Blumm, the parent coordinator. (Last year, 112 students from Mark Twain and 85 from Christa McAuliffe enrolled at Stuyvesant, he said.) But years can go by without a single student from District 7, in a poor and heavily immigrant section of the South Bronx, earning admission.\nSometimes, Mr. Blumm said, blacks and Latinos who do well enough on the entrance exam to get into Stuyvesant are lured away by prestigious private high schools, which offer them full scholarships and none of the issues that even elite public schools have to contend with, like tight budgets and overcrowding. Last year, 11 black students enrolled. Eleanor Archie, an assistant principal who is black, said it was the fewest she can recall in her more than 20 years at Stuyvesant. \n\u201cThat\u2019s what we keep worrying about,\u201d Ms. Archie said. \u201cIt keeps getting smaller and smaller.\u201d\nOpraha Miles, who was president of the Black Students League before her graduation from Stuyvesant in 2010, said she feared the club would disappear for lack of members and interest. She said she used to have to \u201chunt people down,\u201d dragging them from the chocolate bar to the league\u2019s meetings to ensure a quorum.\nMs. Miles, now 19 and a sophomore at Wesleyan University, remembered a discussion the league hosted when she was at Stuyvesant on the school\u2019s demographics, during which an Asian boy said, she recalled, \u201cSomething to the effect that it wasn\u2019t our fault, but that blacks aren\u2019t smart enough; they don\u2019t work hard enough\u201d to get in. \n\u201cIt still stings,\u201d she said.\nIn a separate discussion about their dwindling ranks, Ms. Miles said, a black student suggested, \u201cWhy not go to the middle schools people like us attend and tell the kids about Stuyvesant?\u201d \nStanley Teitel, the school principal, excused Ms. Miles and several others from class for a few hours so they could visit a school in Canarsie, Brooklyn, where the group spoke to an auditorium packed with sixth and seventh graders, fielding questions about what it was like to go to a school that was the stuff of legend, and if it was really that hard to get in.\nThe city does not track the race and ethnicity of students who take the specialized high school exam, only of those who receive offers from one of the schools, said a spokesman for the city\u2019s Education Department. In 2010, 28,280 students took the test; 5,404 scored high enough to earn a slot. The department did not have race or ethnicity information for 979 of those with sufficiently high scores because they came from private schools or from outside the city, and questions of race and ethnicity are not part of the exam application. But of the remainder, 47 percent were Asian, 23 percent were white, 6 percent were Hispanic, and 5 percent were black, according to city records.\nOver the years, there have been a host of efforts to increase the number of black and Latino students at Stuyvesant and the other large specialized high schools in the city, Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School, like making interviews and grade-point averages part of the admissions process. At Brooklyn Tech, 10 percent of the 5,332 students today are black \u2014 sizable in the realm of specialized high schools, but also a big drop from 1999-2000, when 24 percent were black. At Bronx Science, 3.5 percent of the 3,013 students are black, down from 9 percent in 1999-2000.\nThe number of blacks at Stuyvesant peaked in 1975, when they made up 12 percent of the school\u2019s enrollment, or 303 of the school\u2019s 2,536 students. In 1980, there were 212 black students; in 1990, 147; in 2000, 109; and in 2005, 66, state records show.\nLisa Mullins, who graduated from Stuyvesant in 1977 and is among the core members of its Black Alumni Association, suggested in an interview that the schools should automatically accept the valedictorian and salutatorian of every city middle school, an echo of the Texas program that grants admission to the state\u2019s flagship public university to the top 10 percent of graduates of every high school. Last week, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the Texas program from a white student who said she had been rejected because of her race.\nMs. Miles, for her part, said the city needed do a better job disseminating information about the test and the free preparatory programs available.\nThe city\u2019s Education Department has been offering such a program, with weekend and summer coaching sessions to promising but disadvantaged sixth graders \u2014 and, this year only, seventh graders \u2014 for more than 20 years. Its original mission was to increase the number of blacks and Latinos, but after a legal challenge in 2007, income became its main eligibility criteria. Since then, however, the program has shrunk \u2014 2,800 students attended in 2008, down from 3,800 two years before \u2014 and even among those who participated, black and Latino students were far less likely to take the entrance exam than Asians and whites. This year, Stuyvesant\u2019s Black Alumni Association started offering a more modest version of the tutoring program, benefiting about 100 students. (How they fared will not be known until this week\u2019s admissions letters are sent out.) The middle school visits by the Black Students League and others from Stuyvesant\u2019s diversity clubs have become an annual tradition.\nAbout 10 years ago, Stuyvesant opted out of a program established in the 1970s to give disadvantaged students with exam scores just below the cutoff level a chance to study over the summer and earn a slot at the school. \nMr. Teitel, the principal, declined to comment for this article, but explained his decision last year, at a forum that was held after a video by a group of white students rapping racist and otherwise offensive lyrics made its way to YouTube. He said that a change in Education Department policies meant he could take into the program only students who scored too low for admission to any of the city\u2019s specialized schools, but not those who missed Stuyvesant\u2019s cutoff and got in somewhere else. \nThat would have most likely meant that students in the target group would have tested 80 or 90 points below the lowest-scoring student Stuyvesant had admitted \u2014 a gap, he said, too wide for most of them to overcome.\n\u201cThey would find it incredibly difficult to succeed,\u201d Mr. Blumm, the parent coordinator, said in an interview.\nABOUT three-quarters of Stuyvesant\u2019s students are immigrants or children of immigrants. Yet \u00c1ngel Col\u00f3n, a portly Puerto Rican who serves as adviser to the schools\u2019 diversity and community-service student groups, said he realized one day that there was a problem with the colorful brochures the black students brought to the middle schools they visited: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a black or brown face in the crowd,\u201d he said.\nMr. Col\u00f3n, 44, whose formal education ended upon graduation from high school in the Bronx, has turned his office, on the seventh floor at Stuyvesant, into a kind of refuge for the school\u2019s gay, Latino and black students, drawing them partly with a generous supply of cookies and Rice Krispie Treats. The students seek him out for his simple wisdom \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be happy with who you are,\u201d he might tell them \u2014 and his nonjudgmental ear.\nA lot of black students, he said, have confided, \u201cIf I could do it all over again, I don\u2019t know if I would have come here.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s something very isolating,\u201d Mr. Col\u00f3n said, \u201cabout being one of the very few.\u201d \nRudi has never harbored regrets. There have been disappointing and enraging moments, she said, like when a good friend, the only black senior in Stuyvesant\u2019s esteemed speech-and-debate team, was given a book on rap lyrics as a holiday gift from a white boy she had been mentoring.\nLike many of her white and Asian classmates who make lengthy treks from the outer reaches of Brooklyn and Queens to Stuyvesant\u2019s campus near the site of ground zero, Rudi begins each day before dawn. She sets the alarm on her cellphone for 5:30 a.m., and puts it at the edge of her bed so she has to get up to turn it off. At 6:15, she rouses her father, who drives her to the Wakefield/241st Street stop on the No. 2 train to Manhattan.\nOne recent morning on the train, she rested her head on an environmental science book as thick and heavy as an encyclopedia volume, squeezed on each side by strangers drinking coffee and nodding off. Blue earphones piped in Bob Marley and U2 tunes, her antidote against the rattle of the hourlong ride. \nAfter exiting at Chambers Street, she quick-stepped west, then across a pedestrian bridge and into the exclusive club, book pressed against her chest like armor as she lost herself in a sea of arriving students. Hers was the only black face in sight.",

    "text": "Visiting Myanmar: It\u2019s Complicated\n2012-08-03T16:32:42.000Z\nTHE face towel was scented with lemon grass, and the welcome drink was fresh lemonade poured over crushed ice. Sultry breezes filtered through the open-air lobby decorated in colonial style, with wicker chairs, spinning ceiling fans, faux Southeast Asian antiques and pillars of solid teak. Footpaths wound past date palms, jasmine and frangipani; a swimming pool extended toward an artificial lake clotted with hyacinths. Beyond the lake lay one of the wonders of Southeast Asia: an arid plain speckled with 2,000 Buddhist temples.\nOn a scorching May morning, I had taken a break from touring these structures to drop by the finest hotel in Bagan, the ancient Burmese capital, an hour\u2019s flight north of Yangon, Myanmar. Opened in 2005, the Aureum Palace Hotel sprawls across 27 acres and encompasses a sushi bar, spas, fountains, more than 40 guest rooms and 72 villas. The best of these, the $1,090-a-night Island Villa, includes a lap pool, a sun deck with temple views and a personal valet.\nThere was only one problem with the Aureum Palace Hotel: its owner. The hotel is the property of U Tay Za, reportedly the richest man in the country \u2014 and a close associate of its former military dictator, Gen. Than Shwe. Owner of Air Bagan and Asia Wings (the country\u2019s biggest private airlines), five other luxury hotels and beach resorts in Myanmar, and the Htoo Group, a conglomerate that includes mobile-phone services and timber concessions, Mr. Tay Za has been described by the United States Department of the Treasury as a \u201cnotorious henchman and arms dealer.\u201d After the 2007 Saffron Revolution, when the junta killed dozens of pro-democracy demonstrators and arrested thousands more, the Bush administration froze his assets and blocked him and his family from traveling to the United States.\nIn the new Myanmar, though, Mr. Tay Za has apparently changed his ways. Following the lead of Myanmar\u2019s reformist government, this former crony of the junta is embracing philanthropy and what his son recently described to Reuters as \u201cfoundation work.\u201d And even though he remains on the Treasury\u2019s blacklist, it seems that Western tourists have begun to feel comfortable staying at his hotels. After struggling to fill its rooms for years, the Aureum Palace had an occupancy rate last winter of 80 percent.\nOver the past year, Bagan and other destinations in Myanmar have drawn an increasing number of tourists, following the encouraging actions of President Thein Sein. Since taking office in an election that was stage-managed by the military junta in November 2010, Myanmar\u2019s leader has freed hundreds of political prisoners, eased censorship laws and established a cordial working relationship with the Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Meanwhile, President Obama has eased most sanctions; in July, Mr. Thein Sein addressed American business executives gathered in Cambodia, urging them to invest in his country.\nFor the travel industry, the repercussions have been profound. Companies that once struggled to persuade clients to visit Myanmar have been deluged: Abercrombie & Kent saw a 90 percent increase in the number of Myanmar-bound tourists between the first quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012; Indochina Travel, headquartered in San Francisco, reported that its Myanmar business has grown from 15 percent of bookings to 35 percent over the past 18 months.\n\u201cWe believe that it will go up to three-quarters of our business,\u201d said Patrick Morris, a director, who described visiting the country as taking a step back in time. \u201cEven the most touristy place in Myanmar still feels authentic,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody there knows that they should be selling you a T-shirt.\u201d\nWith its lush landscapes, Buddhist culture and the mysterious allure of a country that for decades has had limited contact with the outside world, Myanmar has long held a special attraction for adventurous travelers. Tourists began trickling into this former British colony, bordered by China, India, Thailand, Bangladesh and Laos, in the late 1970s when the going was far rougher than it is today. Back then, the government usually issued one-week visas and restricted visitors to a prescribed itinerary. Today tourists typically receive visas that are valid for up to 28 days. Luxury hotels have sprung up, and only a few areas are inaccessible to travelers.\nYET the question of whether it is acceptable to visit a country long ruled by a brutal military dictatorship has not gone away. Two years ago the answer was clear; today, it is less so.\nEven though Mr. Thein Sein has ostensibly put the country on the path to democracy, Myanmar is hardly free from malign influences. The economy is largely controlled by individuals, like Mr. Tay Za, who amassed their fortunes through alliances with the dictatorship; hundreds of political prisoners remain locked up; and the army is still fighting rebels in northern Kachin State. In June, Buddhists in Arakan State, near the Bangladesh border, and Rohingyas, stateless Muslims who have long been discriminated against by the Burmese government, attacked each other after the rape and murder of a young Buddhist girl.\nI\u2019ve traveled to Myanmar three times in the past 30 years: as a backpacker in 1980, as a journalist in 2010 after the release of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest and last spring, in the wake of political and economic reforms. On my most recent trip, I spent much of my time in Yangon, Bagan and Inle Lake on the edge of restive Shan State. Throughout the trip I was keenly aware of the moral issues involved in traveling in Myanmar, and attempted to avoid patronizing enterprises that are owned by the country\u2019s corrupt elite.\nBut not everybody, I found, had the same pangs of conscience. Pa Pa Win, the desk manager at the Aureum Palace, told me that most clients don\u2019t care about Mr. Tay Za\u2019s reputation.\n\u201cWhen guests come here they are focusing only for relaxing,\u201d she said, pointing out that Mr. Tay Za provides employment to local people.\nBut U Bo Ni, my guide in Bagan, and a supporter of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy, advised tourists to think twice before staying there.\n\u201cIt is true that Tay Za has provided a lot of employment,\u201d said the former English teacher. \u201cOn the other hand, he collaborated with the military government, so we don\u2019t like him. He is a gangster.\u201d\nWhen I arrived in Yangon, I was eager to see how the atmosphere had changed since my last visit. Yangon has grown greatly in recent decades, but in other respects has barely changed: the downtown district beside the Yangon River is still filled with aging tenements, cracked sidewalks where used-book and betel-nut vendors ply their trades and crumbling colonial villas. The prosperous northern corner of the city is dominated by Inya Lake, site of the villa where Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi spent 15 years in house arrest and where she still resides.\nI checked into the German-managed Savoy, an intimate faux colonial place. From there it is a 30-minute walk up a steep hill to Shwedagon Pagoda, the city\u2019s most venerated landmark. Here Gen. Aung San, the beloved freedom fighter, celebrated Burma\u2019s independence from Britain in March 1947, months before his assassination by political rivals. Here, too, his daughter, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, rallied pro-democracy protesters during the blood bath of August 1988 and started her own political career.\nShwedagon is a Buddhist Disneyland, an exuberant confection of golden Buddhas and teakwood shrines laid out across a marble plaza. These are all mere accompaniments to the main attraction: a soaring gold-leaf-covered stupa said to contain several hairs of the Buddha in a sealed chamber.\nDuring my last visit, I had been followed by two inquisitive monks as I walked around the stupa; these men, I later learned, were probably undercover agents employed by the dictatorship to keep an eye on foreigners. This time, I was not followed.\nI was intrigued by another site that was off limits during my last visit: the home in which Gen. Aung San had lived between the end of World War II and his assassination two years later. (His widow and three children remained there until 1953.) The Bogyoke Aung San house museum was closed between 1999 and 2007, and then opened only once a year, on July 19, the anniversary of his murder. But the government lifted the restriction in March.\nOn a drizzly morning, I visited the 1921 structure with its circular verandas and elaborate turrets and got a glimpse of the Burma that existed in the hopeful days after the war. Here was the dining room table where the general\u2019s family gathered, upstairs the chamber with three cots where the toddler Aung San Suu Kyi and her two brothers slept. In the library, the general\u2019s bookshelves were jammed with volumes ranging from a small-arms training handbook to a history of the Anglo-Afghan wars. A black 1946 Wolseley sedan was parked in the garage.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s position on tourism in Myanmar has softened over the years. In 1995 she appeared to discourage all tourism, telling an interviewer, \u201cTourists better stay at home and read some of the many human rights reports.\u201d Then in 2011 she urged individual tourists \u2014 but not groups \u2014 to come to Myanmar, if they go about their travels \u201cin the right way, by using facilities that help ordinary people and avoiding facilities that have close links to the government.\u201d\nA FEW months ago, a spokesman for the National League for Democracy said that the opposition now welcomes all visitors, as long as they \u201cpromote the welfare of the common people and the conservation of the environment.\u201d\nI flew to Bagan on Air Yangon, a company on the United States\u2019 list of sanctioned firms in Myanmar. Although I felt some scruples about patronizing the airline, there weren\u2019t any satisfying options; the other airlines that fly to Bagan include Air Bagan and Asian Wings (both owned by the Tay Za-sanctioned Htoo Group), Air Mandalay, (partly owned by the Myanmar government) and Air Kanbawza (owned by the Burmese banker U Aung Ko Win, another confidante of the generals). I was reminded that, when dealing with hotels and airlines in Myanmar, it is difficult to find any that do not have some connection to the junta.\nDetermined not to stay at the Aureum Palace, I checked into the lodge where I\u2019d stayed once before, the Bagan Hotel River View, with lush gardens dominated by the ruins of an ancient pagoda. The place had some ragged edges: the cavernous lobby was dark, the rooms charmless. The place was owned by the Kaung Myanmar Association, a Burmese group with holdings in construction, agriculture, forestry and the hotel business, that, at least, does not appear on the Treasury\u2019s list of sanctioned individuals and companies.\nI rented a battered bicycle and pedaled through fields studded with temples. The spires of a pyramidal stupa near my hotel would serve as my beacon in case I got lost. In the distance I could see Mr. Tay Za\u2019s most controversial creation: a 200-foot-high viewing complex. With three restaurants and a conference center, the tower, which opened in 2005, is reminiscent of a grain silo, and it has been criticized by Unesco for blighting the landscape.\nAn hour into my tour, a thorn tree branch caught in my spokes and punctured my tire. I\u2019d lost sight of the stupa and had no idea how to get back. I saw a Burmese family encamped beside some ruins and, with their help, reoriented myself. Ninety minutes later I stumbled to a horse cart stand and headed back to my hotel.\nThe next day I went with Mr. Bo Ni to one of the grandest temples in Bagan: Dhammayazika, a 12th-century bell-shaped pagoda that towers above the plain. Dhammayazika was the favorite of Gen. Than Shwe\u2019s chief rival, Gen. Khin Nyunt, who served as chief of military intelligence and prime minister and lavished a fortune renovating the temple with jewels and gold leaf. Gen. Than Shwe deposed him in 2004 and placed him under house arrest and Dhammayazika fell into disrepair. \u201cKhin Nyunt lost his power, and his pagoda fell apart,\u201d Mr. Bo Ni told me, as gold flakes fluttered away in the breeze. But now Gen. Than Shwe has stepped down and Gen. Khin Nyunt, freed last January, recently visited Dhammayazika.\n\u201cHe felt very sorry to see his pagoda in that state,\u201d I was told by the caretaker, a gaunt man with gums stained black from chewing betel nut, and plans to cover it again in gold.\nIt\u2019s not just rehabilitated generals who are pumping money into Myanmar\u2019s attractions. Income from tourism is allowing hotels to undertake renovations and has made significant improvements in the lives of those tapped into the tourist economy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that foreigners connect with this country, spread their knowledge, assist the economy and observe what is happening inside Myanmar,\u201d I had been told earlier in Yangon by U Ba Dhat Aung, a democracy advocate who was recently released from prison and is now a leader of the 88 Generation, an organization of former prisoners.\nMr. Ba Dhat Aung, whom I accompanied to a rally of striking workers at a Chinese-run textile plant outside Yangon, added a few caveats. Some tourist revenue, he pointed out, inevitably ends up in the hands of the government, in the form of taxes and entry fees to tourist zones like Bagan and Inle Lake. Moreover, he said, hard-liners remain a force in Myanmar\u2019s government, and many of them seem determined to thwart Mr. Thein Sein\u2019s reforms.\n\u201cTourists should proceed cautiously, and think about where they are spending their money,\u201d Mr. Ba Dhat Aung said.\nA Western diplomat who asked to remain unidentified told me that \u201cmost of the owners of hotels, airlines and other parts of the travel industry are cronies\u201d of the former junta. The sanctioned figures include Mr. Aung Ko Win, the airline owner and associate of Myanmar\u2019s former second in command, Gen. Maung Aye; and U Tun Myint Naing, known as Steven Law, the son of a 1970s opium trafficker and the managing director of the Asia World conglomerate, which has a stake in Yangon\u2019s Traders Hotel, a favorite of well-heeled travelers.\n\u201cIf you have a sensitivity about these things you might want to think twice\u201d about patronizing such places, the diplomat said.\nHowever, U Myint Aung, who spent seven years in the regime\u2019s gulag for his role in the 1988 uprising, and who now runs the Former Political Prisoners\u2019 Association in Yangon, said he believed that it was time for reconciliation.\n\u201cLet the tourists go to Tay Za\u2019s Aureum Palace Hotel,\u201d he told me. \u201cThree years ago, we would have said, \u2018Don\u2019t go.\u2019 But now we say, \u2018Come, we have no feelings of revenge.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nAfter two days in Bagan, I flew east to Inle Lake and hired a taxi for the hour drive to Nyaungshwe, a ramshackle market town and the jumping-off point for motorized longboats that take visitors to the resorts that line the shore.\nInle\u2019s attractions are its floating markets, monasteries, golden-spired Buddhist temples and surrounding hills, populated by exotically attired tribal groups. I bypassed another of Mr. Tay Za\u2019s resorts, the Aureum Palace Inle, and spent the night at the Inle Princess Resort, owned by U Ohn Maung, an ethnic Shan and former political prisoner. Tucked on a hyacinth-dappled pond, the hotel consists of 46 chalets, each with teak furnishings and bamboo roofs.\n\u201cWe are now celebrating the Buddhist Lent period,\u201d read a note accompanying a pair of earplugs on my nightstand. \u201cThroughout the night you may hear the voices of monks praying.\u201d\nThe next morning, in a 30-foot longboat, with a young guide named U Min Min, I crossed the still waters of the lake. Inle was filled with fishing boats, propelled by oarsmen who balanced precariously on one leg, the other entwined around a paddle.\nFollowing a network of canals, the boatman threaded through the narrow sluice gates in bamboo dams. We docked and hiked for a mile to a deserted scene. Here, like a child\u2019s version of Bagan, stood more than 200 small pagodas, constructed by the Pa-O people hundreds of years ago. The jungle had all but consumed them. Weeds crawled over ornate lintels. A palm tree sprouted umbrellalike from a pagoda.\n\u201cAsia lost in time,\u201d was the way the photographer and journalist Gary Knight recently described Myanmar to me; the fragile ruins of the pagodas almost literally illustrated his comment.\nBACK on the boat, Mr. Min Min and I discussed recent events. Just one week before, the Shan State Army, which has been fighting for autonomy, signed a historic peace deal with the Myanmar government and agreed to help fight drug trafficking across the border into Thailand. It was, Mr. Min Min and I agreed, a sign of progress.\nStill, I thought, as I watched the shores slip by, there was reason for caution. From the fawning headlines in local newspapers about various generals, to the handsome villas of the junta cronies near Yangon, to the cautious statements of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, I was continually reminded that the new Myanmar remains a work in progress, and that, as a tourist, the debate over where to spend one\u2019s money remains relevant.\nAs for Mr. Min Min, he was pleased by the influx of visitors and the rise in his income, but was skeptical about recent developments, including the peace treaty.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will last,\u201d he said, as we made our way across Inle Lake.\nCHOOSING CAREFULLY\nIf you are a conscientious traveler intent on avoiding travel-related companies owned by the Myanmar government or its business associates, a little advance work is required. Before leaving for Myanmar, I contacted a reliable travel agency, SunBird Tours in Yangon (104-106 52nd Street; 95-1 293464, sunbirdtours@gmail.com, tintin@sunbirdtours.com.mm) and asked it to put together an itinerary that would be as free of government influence as possible.\nI immediately eliminated hotels like the Strand, a joint venture of the Myanmar government and a Singapore company. In some cases, like that of the Savoy Hotel in Yangon, ownership was not readily apparent. Those required phone calls to the establishment or, in this case, the hotel\u2019s marketing agent in Hamburg, Germany. The Savoy is owned by a Burmese woman with \u201cno connection\u201d to the government, I was assured. At the United States Department of the Treasury, the Office of Foreign Assets Control publishes a list of sanctioned individuals and companies that provides further clarification.\nThe German-managed Savoy Hotel (129 Dhammazadi Road, Yangon; 95-10 526289, 526298 and 526305; reservation@savoyhotel-yangon.com) is well situated between Inya Lake (site of the United States Embassy and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s residence) and downtown. It\u2019s a charming hotel with 24 rooms and excellent service; the Captain\u2019s Bar in the lobby is one of Yangon\u2019s favored expatriate watering holes. Prices for a double begin at 91,981 kyat, or $110 at 836 kyat to the dollar.\nJust across the Strand Road, right on the river, are my favorite restaurants in Yangon, the Golden Duck and the Junior Duck (95-1 249421, or 09-861-4554), serving excellent Chinese food at reasonable prices. Lunch or dinner for two costs 20,904 to 25,085 kyat.\nIn Bagan, I stayed at the Bagan Hotel River View (Near Museum, Old Bagan; 95-61 60316, 95-61 060317, 95-61 60032; baganview@kmahotels.com, sales@kmahotels.com). The sprawling complex along the Irrawaddy River has 107 rooms from 58,533 to 91,981 kyat a night.\nThe best hotel at Inle Lake is the Inle Princess Resort, with 46 chalets on a pond on the eastern bank of the lake (Magyizin Village Inle Lake; 95-81 209055, 95-81 209363, 4 and 5; inleprincess@myanmar.com.mm). A chalet, booked through SunBirds, costs 137,972 kyat a night. There\u2019s a fine bar and restaurant serving both Burmese and European food, with alfresco dining on a porch overlooking the lake. Dinner for two, with wine, costs about 66,895 kyat.\n\u00a0",

    "text": "Nigeria Tested by Rapid Rise in Population\n2012-04-14T18:42:29.000Z\nLAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 In a quarter-century, at the rate Nigeria is growing, 300 million people \u2014 a population about as big as that of the present-day United States \u2014 will live in a country\u00a0roughly the size of Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada. In this commercial hub, where the area\u2019s population has by some estimates nearly doubled over 15 years to 21 million, living standards for many are falling.\nLifelong residents like Peju Taofika and her three granddaughters inhabit a room in a typical apartment block known as a \u201cFace Me, Face You\u201d because whole families squeeze into 7-by-11-foot rooms along a narrow corridor. Up to 50 people share a kitchen, toilet and sink \u2014 though the pipes in the neighborhood often no longer carry water.\nAt Alapere Primary School, more than 100 students cram into most classrooms, two to a desk.\nAs graduates pour out of high schools and universities, Nigeria\u2019s unemployment rate is nearly 50 percent for people in urban areas ages 15 to 24 \u2014 driving crime and discontent.\nThe growing upper-middle class also feels the squeeze, as commutes from even nearby suburbs can run two to three hours.\nLast October, the United Nations announced the global population had breached seven billion and would expand rapidly for decades, taxing natural resources if countries cannot better manage the growth.\nNearly all of the increase is in sub-Saharan Africa, where the population rise far outstrips economic expansion. Of the roughly 20 countries where women average more than five children, almost all are in the region.\nElsewhere in the developing world, in Asia and Latin America, fertility rates have fallen sharply in recent generations and now resemble those in the United States \u2014 just above two children per woman. That transformation was driven in each country by a mix of educational and employment opportunities for women, access to contraception, urbanization and an evolving middle class. Whether similar forces will defuse the population bomb in sub-Sarahan Africa is unclear.\n\u201cThe pace of growth in Africa is unlike anything else ever in history and a critical problem,\u201d said Joel E. Cohen, a professor of population at Rockefeller University in New York City. \u201cWhat is effective in the context of these countries may not be what worked in Latin America or Kerala or Bangladesh.\u201d\nAcross sub-Saharan Africa, alarmed governments have begun to act, often reversing longstanding policies that encouraged or accepted large families. Nigeria made contraceptives free last year, and officials are promoting smaller families as a key to economic salvation, holding up the financial gains in nations like Thailand as inspiration.\nNigeria, already the world\u2019s sixth most populous nation with 167 million people, is a crucial test case, since its success or failure at bringing down birthrates will have outsize influence on the world\u2019s population. If this large nation rich with oil cannot control its growth, what hope is there for the many smaller, poorer countries?\n\u201cPopulation is key,\u201d said Peter Ogunjuyigbe, a demographer at Obafemi Awolowo University in the small central city of Ile-Ife. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take care of population, schools can\u2019t cope, hospitals can\u2019t cope, there\u2019s not enough housing \u2014 there\u2019s nothing you can do to have economic development.\u201d\nThe Nigerian government is rapidly building infrastructure but cannot keep up, and some experts worry that it, and other African nations, will not act forcefully enough to rein in population growth. For two decades, the Nigerian government has recommended that families limit themselves to four children, with little effect.\nAlthough he acknowledged that more countries were trying to control population, Parfait M. Eloundou-Enyegue, a professor of development sociology at Cornell University, said, \u201cMany countries only get religion when faced with food riots or being told they have the highest fertility rate in the world or start worrying about political unrest.\u201d\nIn Nigeria, experts say, the swelling ranks of unemployed youths with little hope have fed the growth of the radical Islamist group Boko Haram, which has bombed or burned more than a dozen churches and schools this year.\nInternationally, the African population boom means more illegal immigration, already at a high, according to Frontex, the European border agency. There are up to 400,000 undocumented Africans in the United States.\nNigeria, like many sub-Saharan African countries, has experienced a slight decline in average fertility rates, to about 5.5 last year from 6.8 in 1975. But this level of fertility, combined with an extremely young population, still puts such countries on a steep and disastrous growth curve. Half of Nigerian women are under 19, just entering their peak childbearing years.\nWomen Left Behind\nStatistics are stunning. Sub-Saharan Africa, which now accounts for 12 percent of the world\u2019s population, will account for more than a third by 2100, by many projections.\nBecause Africa was for centuries agriculturally based and sparsely populated, it made sense for leaders to promote high fertility rates. Family planning, introduced in the 1970s by groups like Usaid, was initially regarded as foreign, and later on, money and attention were diverted from family planning to Africa\u2019s AIDS crisis.\n\u201cWomen in sub-Saharan Africa were left behind,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Guengant, director of research at the Research Institute for Development, in Paris. The drastic transition from high to low birthrates that took place in poor countries in Asia, Latin America and North Africa has yet to happen here.\nThat transition often brings substantial economic benefits, said Eduard Bos, a population specialist at the World Bank. As the last large population group reaches working age, the number of adults in the labor force is high relative to more dependent groups \u2014 the young and the elderly \u2014 for a time. If managed well, that creates capital that can be used to improve health and education and to develop new industries.\nAnd that has happened elsewhere. Per-capita gross domestic product in Latin America, Asia and North Africa increased between three and six times as population was brought under control, Dr. Guengant said. During that same period it has increased only marginally in many African countries, despite robust general economic growth.\nIn Nigeria, policymakers are studying how to foster the transition, and its attendant financial benefits, here. In the ramshackle towns of the Oriade area near Ile-Ife, where streets are lined with stalls selling prepaid cellphone cards and food like pounded yam, Dr. Ogunjuyigbe\u2019s team goes door to door studying attitudes toward family size and how it affects health and wealth. Many young adults, particularly educated women, now want two to four children. But the preferences of men, particularly older men, have been slower to change \u2014 crucial in a patriarchal culture where polygamy is widespread.\nAt his concrete home in the town of Ipetumodu, Abel Olanyi, 35, a laborer, said he has four children and wants two more. \u201cThe number you have depends on your strength and capacity,\u201d he said, his wife sitting silently by his side.\nLarge families signal prosperity and importance in African cultures; some cultures let women attend village meetings only after they have had their 11th child. And a history of high infant mortality, since improved thanks to interventions like vaccination, makes families reluctant to have fewer children.\nMuriana Taiwo, 45, explained that it was \u201cGod\u2019s will\u201d for him to have 12 children by his three wives, calling each child a \u201cblessing\u201d because so many of his own siblings had died.\nIn a deeply religious country where many Roman Catholics and Muslims oppose contraception, politicians and doctors broach the topic gingerly, and change is slow. Posters promote \u201cbirth spacing,\u201d not \u201cbirth control.\u201d Supplies of contraceptives are often erratic.\nCultural Factors\nIn Asian countries, women\u2019s contraceptive use skyrocketed from less than 20 percent to 60 to 80 percent in decades. In Latin America, requiring girls to finish high school correlated with a sharp drop in birthrates.\nBut contraceptive use is rising only a fraction of a percent annually \u2014 in many sub-Saharan African nations, it is under 20 percent \u2014 and, in surveys, even well-educated women in the region often want four to six children.\n\u201cAt this pace it will take 100-plus years to arrive at a point where fertility is controlled,\u201d Dr. Guengant said.\nThere are also regional differences. The average number of children per woman in the wealthier south of Nigeria has decreased slightly in the last five years, but increased to 7.3 in the predominantly Muslim north, where women often cannot go to a family planning clinic unless accompanied by a man.\n\n12 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nThe United Nations estimates that the global population will stabilize at 10 billion in 2100, assuming that declining birthrates will eventually yield a global average of 2.1 children per woman. At a rate of even 2.6, Dr. Guengant said, the number becomes 16 billion.\nThere are signs that the shifting economics and lifestyles of middle-class Africans may help turn the tide, Dr. Ogunjuyigbe said. As Nigeria urbanizes, children\u2019s help is not needed in fields; the extended families have broken down. \u201cChildren were seen as a kind of insurance for the future; now they are a liability for life,\u201d he said.\nWaiting in a women\u2019s health clinic, Ayoola Adeeyo, 42, said she wanted her four children, ages 6 to 17, to attend university, and did not want more children.\n\u201cPeople used to want 6 or 7 or even 12, but nobody can do that now. It\u2019s the economics,\u201d said Ms. Adeeyo, elegant in a flowing green dress and matching head wrap. \u201cIt costs a lot to raise a child.\u201d\nDr. Eloundou-Enyegue worries that Africa\u2019s modestly declining birthrates reflect relatively rich, educated people reducing to invest in raising \u201cquality\u201d children, while poor people continue to have many offspring, strengthening divisions between haves and have-nots. \u201cWhen you have a system with a large degree of corruption and inequality, it\u2019s hard not to be playing the lottery because it increases the chances that one child will succeed,\u201d he said.\nIn Nigeria\u2019s desperately poor neighbor, Niger, women have on average more than seven children, and men consider their ideal to be more than 12. But with land divided among so many sons, the size of a typical family plot has fallen by more than a third since 2005, meaning there is little long-term hope for feeding children, said Amadou Sayo, of the aid group CARE.\nBabatunde Osotimehin, executive director of the United Nations Population Fund and a former Nigerian health minister, said he is optimistic for a turnaround if governments better support education for girls and contraceptive services. \u201cWe can see rapid changes, but that\u2019s up in the air, because you have to be aggressive and consistent.\u201d\nBirthrates have edged down to about four children per woman in Kenya, Ethiopia and Ghana.\nOne recent morning in Lagos, hundreds of patients waited at the Ketu district clinic for treatments like measles vaccines, malaria pills and birth control.\n\u201cOf course when the population grows so quickly, that stresses hospitals,\u201d said Dr. Morayo Ismail \u2014 although migration from rural areas has also swelled Lagos\u2019s population. A mother of one herself, Dr. Ismail said many poor women still want four or more children.\nThat evening at the clinic, Bola Agboola, 30, gave birth to her second child. After nurses swaddled the boy, dispensed with the placenta and declared Ms. Agboola well, they whooped, praising God.\nThen, as Ms. Agboola\u2019s husband entered, some started another chant: \u201cNow start another one. Start another one.\u201d",

    "text": "Some See Little Room for Large, Poor Families in Mayor\u2019s Housing Plan\n2012-10-20T00:58:23.000Z\nWhen Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced that the city was planning to develop new super-small apartments \u2014 called \u201cmicrounits\u201d \u2014 it represented another step toward his ambitious goal of building or preserving 165,000 homes for poor and moderate-income families across New York by 2014.\nBut some housing advocates, community leaders and elected officials say this latest proposal only highlights that one demographic group has been left out: large, poor families. \nThis group includes members as disparate as West Africans in the South Bronx, Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and Bangladeshi in Queens, who are united by their inability to afford the high prices for large market-rate rentals and their inability to find publicly subsidized alternatives even as the overall housing stock has swelled. \nSo Mahamadou Tounkara and his wife and six children squeeze into one room of a market-rate, three-bedroom apartment in the South Bronx that they share with two other families because they cannot afford the monthly $1,112 rent alone. Twenty more large families at their mosque are in a similar bind even as several new city-financed buildings have risen nearby.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to live like this,\u201d said Mr. Tounkara, who is a part-time auto mechanic. \u201cYou want more space, but if you don\u2019t have money, how are you going to pay for it?\u201d \nThe overwhelming majority of city-financed housing has consisted of smaller apartments \u2014 studios, one- and two-bedrooms \u2014 in part because city officials see the greatest need for them based on demographic patterns, and because many developers say the city provides subsidies for projects in a way that does not encourage building larger apartments. The shortage of housing for bigger families has been exacerbated because many of the existing apartments with three or more bedrooms in the city\u2019s public housing stock currently have only one or two occupants.\nThe struggles of these families come as those who have long applauded the efforts of the mayor, who has been credited with overseeing the city\u2019s largest expansion of affordable housing since the 1980s, look more closely at the results. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned as a community that having a big number to shoot for is important,\u201d said Bernie Carr, the coordinator for Housing First, a coalition of groups. \u201cBut if you focus too much on it, it can be easy to lose a sense of where are the specific needs.\u201d\nThe issue has also raised the question of whether it is fair to focus limited resources on a small minority. Just 11 percent of the city\u2019s 3.1 million households have five people or more, with the largest share in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, according to an analysis of census data by Queens College. Citywide, the average household size is 2.5.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the city\u2019s job to give open-ended subsidies and reward people for having more members in the family,\u201d said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. \u201cIt is responsible behavior not to have children until you can reasonably support them.\u201d\nWhen the city approved a plan in 2009 for a large percentage of multibedroom apartments in a new affordable housing complex in Brooklyn, a coalition of housing and community groups sued, arguing that the larger units would unfairly favor Hasidic residents over blacks and Latinos and that it was preferable to have more smaller units than fewer large ones. In 2011, a State Supreme Court justice issued an order blocking the plan. \nStill, Councilman Stephen T. Levin, who represents part of Williamsburg, said the city had an obligation to help large families living in overcrowded conditions. \n\u201cI\u2019ve had people come to me crying,\u201d said Mr. Levin, who receives a call nearly every day about this issue. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a way we can address the affordable-housing needs of large families. It\u2019s certainly not for the government to essentially discriminate against families because of their size.\u201d\nFor large families, ample space has long been hard to find in almost any price range. Of the city\u2019s 2.1 million rental apartments in 2011, which included both market-rate and subsidized housing, only 14 percent were three-bedroom units and 2 percent were four-bedroom units or larger, according to the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.\nMany of these are in aging housing projects that were built when large families were more common. Of the 178,889 apartments managed by the New York City Housing Authority, 22 percent were three-bedroom, and 4 percent were four-bedroom or larger. Those apartments, however, do not open up often, with three-bedrooms occupied for an average of 24.8 years, and four-bedrooms for 22.9 years, compared with 10.1 years for studios and 16.1 years for one-bedrooms. \nHousing authority officials said many of the multibedroom apartments were unavailable for large families despite being \u201cunderutilized\u201d; currently, one or two people occupy 14,597 three-bedroom apartments, 1,354 four-bedroom apartments and 159 five-bedrooms. They said that those tenants would eventually be moved to smaller apartments, but that the process was slow because even smaller units had long waiting lists: about 91,000 people for studios or one-bedrooms, 62,000 for two-bedrooms, and 14,000 for three-bedrooms or larger. \nThe city\u2019s expansion of affordable housing has been overseen primarily by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which has provided billions of dollars in subsidies to private developers who design and carry out projects that were reviewed by the agency. By the department\u2019s count, 124,418 of the 165,000 promised housing units had been completed through fiscal year 2011. Of those, 65 percent \u2014 81,393 units \u2014 were preservations of existing units, and 35 percent \u2014 43,025 units \u2014 were new construction.\nBut it is not clear how many of those units were three-bedroom apartments or larger because the department was unable to provide a complete breakdown of apartments by unit size. Instead, it supplied that data for only 65,796, units, or 53 percent, saying it had only recently started tallying such information.\nThe partial data showed that large units had been a low priority in new building projects: 3,660 three-bedrooms, 57 four-bedrooms, no five- or six-bedrooms. \n\u201cOur goal is to target our resources as efficiently and effectively as possible,\u201d a spokesman for the housing department, Eric Bederman, said in a statement. \u201cWhile data shows that households of four people or less make up the vast majority of the population, we have worked to ensure that we are balancing our city\u2019s needs while also serving a diversity\u201d of family sizes.\nMany developers said, however, that the city\u2019s longtime practice of awarding subsidies for affordable-housing projects based on the total number of units planned, regardless of size, had discouraged building larger apartments. A developer would receive more money by packing a building with studios or one-bedrooms than with larger apartments that take up more space but still count as single units. \nIn the Bronx, for instance, a 2008 project was originally designed with 28 units, of which 5 were to be three-bedrooms. But the developer, PWB Management Corporation, eventually eliminated the three-bedrooms to squeeze in more of the smaller apartments to bring the total unit count to 32. Peter Bourbeau, a co-owner of the company, said the additional four units netted another $240,000 in subsidies \u2014 at $60,000 per unit \u2014 and increased the rental income \u201cto put us over the hump in terms of making the financing work.\u201d\nDevelopers and current and former city housing officials said the practice of awarding money by number of units, and not unit size, was widely used. \nRuthAnne Visnauskas, a deputy housing commissioner, said the city was open to building larger units and could provide subsidies case by case, if needed. \u201cThese are complicated negotiations, and we do make exceptions,\u201d she said. \nChana Leibowitz said she had no choice but to continue living in the 880-square-foot, two-bedroom Williamsburg apartment where she married her husband, Michael, two decades ago. Now they share it with their six children. \n\u201cWe\u2019re trapped,\u201d Ms. Leibowitz, said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping every day for a miracle.\u201d\nMr. Tounkara, the father of six, who does not have a high school diploma, said he moved to the Bronx in 1996 for a better life than he had in his native Mali. His wife, Assetou, followed four years later, and they had six children. \n\u201cI like kids, so I make more,\u201d he said. \u201cMy culture has a lot of kids.\u201d \nThe Tounkaras, who together earn about $1,700 a month, said they had been on the waiting list for the city\u2019s housing projects for more than four years. For now, their family sleeps in one room the size of two parking spaces, with two children in their double bed, and two more on a blanket on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s too hard,\u201d Mrs. Tounkara said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d ",

    "text": "The Ecology of Disease\n2012-07-14T18:43:46.000Z\nTHERE\u2019S a term biologists and economists use these days \u2014 ecosystem services \u2014 which refers to the many ways nature supports the human endeavor. Forests filter the water we drink, for example, and birds and bees pollinate crops, both of which have substantial economic as well as biological value.\nIf we fail to understand and take care of the natural world, it can cause a breakdown of these systems and come back to haunt us in ways we know little about. A critical example is a developing model of infectious disease that shows that most epidemics \u2014 AIDS, Ebola, West Nile, SARS, Lyme disease and hundreds more that have occurred over the last several decades \u2014 don\u2019t just happen. They are a result of things people do to nature.\nDisease, it turns out, is largely an environmental issue. Sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases that affect humans are zoonotic \u2014 they originate in animals. And more than two-thirds of those originate in wildlife.\nTeams of veterinarians and conservation biologists are in the midst of a global effort with medical doctors and epidemiologists to understand the \u201cecology of disease.\u201d It is part of a project called Predict, which is financed by the United States Agency for International Development. Experts are trying to figure out, based on how people alter the landscape \u2014 with a new farm or road, for example \u2014 where the next diseases are likely to spill over into humans and how to spot them when they do emerge, before they can spread. They are gathering blood, saliva and other samples from high-risk wildlife species to create a library of viruses so that if one does infect humans, it can be more quickly identified. And they are studying ways of managing forests, wildlife and livestock to prevent diseases from leaving the woods and becoming the next pandemic.\nIt isn\u2019t only a public health issue, but an economic one. The World Bank has estimated that a severe influenza pandemic, for example, could cost the world economy $3 trillion.\nThe problem is exacerbated by how livestock are kept in poor countries, which can magnify diseases borne by wild animals. A study released earlier this month by the International Livestock Research Institute found that more than two million people a year are killed by diseases that spread to humans from wild and domestic animals.\nThe Nipah virus in South Asia, and the closely related Hendra virus in Australia, both in the genus of henipah viruses, are the most urgent examples of how disrupting an ecosystem can cause disease. The viruses originated with flying foxes, Pteropus vampyrus, also known as fruit bats. They are messy eaters, no small matter in this scenario. They often hang upside down, looking like Dracula wrapped tightly in their membranous wings, and eat fruit by masticating the pulp and then spitting out the juices and seeds.\nThe bats have evolved with henipah over millions of years, and because of this co-evolution, they experience little more from it than the fruit bat equivalent of a cold. But once the virus breaks out of the bats and into species that haven\u2019t evolved with it, a horror show can occur, as one did in 1999 in rural Malaysia. It is likely that a bat dropped a piece of chewed fruit into a piggery in a forest. The pigs became infected with the virus, and amplified it, and it jumped to humans. It was startling in its lethality. Out of 276 people infected in Malaysia, 106 died, and many others suffered permanent and crippling neurological disorders. There is no cure or vaccine. Since then there have been 12 smaller outbreaks in South Asia.\nIn Australia, where four people and dozens of horses have died of Hendra, the scenario was different: suburbanization lured infected bats that were once forest-dwellers into backyards and pastures. If a henipah virus evolves to be transmitted readily through casual contact, the concern is that it could leave the jungle and spread throughout Asia or the world. \u201cNipah is spilling over, and we are observing these small clusters of cases \u2014 and it\u2019s a matter of time that the right strain will come along and efficiently spread among people,\u201d says Jonathan Epstein, a veterinarian with EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based organization that studies the ecological causes of disease.\nThat\u2019s why experts say it\u2019s critical to understand underlying causes. \u201cAny emerging disease in the last 30 or 40 years has come about as a result of encroachment into wild lands and changes in demography,\u201d says Peter Daszak, a disease ecologist and the president of EcoHealth.\nEmerging infectious diseases are either new types of pathogens or old ones that have mutated to become novel, as the flu does every year. AIDS, for example, crossed into humans from chimpanzees in the 1920s when bush-meat hunters in Africa killed and butchered them.\nDiseases have always come out of the woods and wildlife and found their way into human populations \u2014 the plague and malaria are two examples. But emerging diseases have quadrupled in the last half-century, experts say, largely because of increasing human encroachment into habitat, especially in disease \u201chot spots\u201d around the globe, mostly in tropical regions. And with modern air travel and a robust market in wildlife trafficking, the potential for a serious outbreak in large population centers is enormous.\nThe key to forecasting and preventing the next pandemic, experts say, is understanding what they call the \u201cprotective effects\u201d of nature intact. In the Amazon, for example, one study showed an increase in deforestation by some 4 percent increased the incidence of malaria by nearly 50 percent, because mosquitoes, which transmit the disease, thrive in the right mix of sunlight and water in recently deforested areas. Developing the forest in the wrong way can be like opening Pandora\u2019s box. These are the kinds of connections the new teams are unraveling.\nPublic health experts have begun to factor ecology into their models. Australia, for example, has just announced a multimillion-dollar effort to understand the ecology of the Hendra virus and bats.\nIT\u2019S not just the invasion of intact tropical landscapes that can cause disease. The West Nile virus came to the United States from Africa but spread here because one of its favored hosts is the American robin, which thrives in a world of lawns and agricultural fields. And mosquitoes, which spread the disease, find robins especially appealing. \u201cThe virus has had an important impact on human health in the United States because it took advantage of species that do well around people,\u201d says Marm Kilpatrick, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The pivotal role of the robin in West Nile has earned it the title \u201csuper spreader.\u201d\nAnd Lyme disease, the East Coast scourge, is very much a product of human changes to the environment: the reduction and fragmentation of large contiguous forests. Development chased off predators \u2014 wolves, foxes, owls and hawks. That has resulted in a fivefold increase in white-footed mice, which are great \u201creservoirs\u201d for the Lyme bacteria, probably because they have poor immune systems. And they are terrible groomers. When possums or gray squirrels groom, they remove 90 percent of the larval ticks that spread the disease, while mice kill just half. \u201cSo mice are producing huge numbers of infected nymphs,\u201d says the Lyme disease researcher Richard Ostfeld.\n\u201cWhen we do things in an ecosystem that erode biodiversity \u2014 we chop forests into bits or replace habitat with agricultural fields \u2014 we tend to get rid of species that serve a protective role,\u201d Dr. Ostfeld told me. \u201cThere are a few species that are reservoirs and a lot of species that are not. The ones we encourage are the ones that play reservoir roles.\u201d\nDr. Ostfeld has seen two emerging diseases \u2014 babesiosis and anaplasmosis \u2014 that affect humans in the ticks he studies, and he has raised the alarm about the possibility of their spread.\nThe best way to prevent the next outbreak in humans, specialists say, is with what they call the One Health Initiative \u2014 a worldwide program, involving more than 600 scientists and other professionals, that advances the idea that human, animal and ecological health are inextricably linked and need to be studied and managed holistically.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about keeping pristine forest pristine and free of people,\u201d says Simon Anthony, a molecular virologist at the\u00a0Center for Infection and Immunity\u00a0at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. \u201cIt\u2019s learning how to do things sustainably. If you can get a handle on what it is that drives the emergence of a disease, then you can learn to modify environments sustainably.\u201d\nThe scope of the problem is huge and complex. Just an estimated 1 percent of wildlife viruses are known. Another major factor is the immunology of wildlife, a science in its infancy. Raina K. Plowright, a biologist at Pennsylvania State University who studies the ecology of disease, found that outbreaks of the Hendra virus in flying foxes in rural areas were rare but were much higher in urban and suburban animals. She hypothesizes that urbanized bats are sedentary and miss the frequent exposure to the virus they used to get in the wild, which kept the infection at low levels. That means more bats \u2014 whether from poor nutrition, loss of habitat or other factors \u2014 become infected and shed more of the virus into backyards.\nTHE fate of the next pandemic may be riding on the work of Predict. EcoHealth and its partners \u2014 the University of California at Davis, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Smithsonian Institution and Global Viral Forecasting \u2014 are looking at wildlife-borne viruses across the tropics, building a virus library. Most of the work focuses on primates, rats and bats, which are most likely to carry diseases that affect people.\nMost critically, Predict researchers are watching the interface where deadly viruses are known to exist and where people are breaking open the forest, as they are along the new highway from the Atlantic to the Pacific across the Andes in Brazil and Peru. \u201cBy mapping encroachment into the forest you can predict where the next disease could emerge,\u201d Dr. Daszak, EcoHealth\u2019s president, says. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to the edge of villages, we\u2019re going to places where mines have just opened up, areas where new roads are being built. We are going to talk to people who live within these zones and saying, \u2018what you are doing is potentially a risk.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nIt might mean talking to people about how they butcher and eat bush meat or to those who are building a feed lot in bat habitat. In Bangladesh, where Nipah broke out several times, the disease was traced to bats that were raiding containers that collected date palm sap, which people drank. The disease source was eliminated by placing bamboo screens (which cost 8 cents each) over the collectors.\nEcoHealth also scans luggage and packages at airports, looking for imported wildlife likely to be carrying deadly viruses. And they have a program called PetWatch to warn consumers about exotic pets that are pulled out of the forest in disease hot spots and shipped to market.\nAll in all, the knowledge gained in the last couple of years about emerging diseases should allow us to sleep a little easier, says Dr. Epstein, the EcoHealth veterinarian. \u201cFor the first time,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is a coordinated effort in 20 countries to develop an early warning system for emerging zoonotic outbreaks.\u201d",

    "text": "Feel the Loathing on the Campaign Trail\n2012-08-29T09:00:10.000Z\nSometime early last May, I began to have this goofy notion, which turned into a daydream and eventually became a recurring fantasy. It went like this: One morning, I would wake up to the news that the previous evening, with no advance warning to the media, Mitt and Ann Romney stopped by the White House at the invitation of Barack and Michelle Obama. No one was certain what happened while they were there or what they talked about or how it came together, though eventually some details would trickle out. The couples told funny stories from the campaign trail and shared pictures of their families. Mitt drank lemonade, and Michelle led a moonlit tour of her garden. Everyone ate hot dogs loaded with toppings, which inspired a cable christening of the \u201cSauerkraut Summit.\u201d\nI knew this would never happen. It was dumb, na\u00efve, unsophisticated and frankly out of character for me, someone with little patience for the Kabuki pleasantries of politics. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what drove the fantasy \u2014 a desire for less free-floating hostility in the campaign, I suppose, but that seemed too easy. Whatever the case, I was yearning for something that felt big, or at least different, even if it was just a social visit. Something that messed with what the political know-it-alls refer to as the Narrative. This spring, for the first time since I started writing about politics a decade ago, I found myself completely depressed by a campaign. \u201cHow am I ever going to get through it?\u201d is not the question you want to be asking yourself as you enter what are supposed to be the pinnacle few months of your profession.\nBut that\u2019s what I was doing to an alarming degree. Maybe it had to do with how bad off the country felt and how outmatched our politicians were by the severity of our problems and how obvious it was that the proverbial \u201ctone\u201d of Washington wouldn\u2019t change no matter who won. Or maybe it was because my daughters were getting older and starting to tune in more. When I drop them off at school, I sometimes watch them stare wondrously at the vice president\u2019s motorcade as it sirens past en route to the White House. It is a moment of fascination and reverence and one of the cool things about raising a family in what is otherwise the most disappointing city in America. I had also just been through a rough winter in which my 11-year-old suffered a head injury that brought some terrifying and unexplained side effects that incapacitated her for months. There\u2019s something about wondering whether your kid will ever be able to go back to school and live a normal life that makes a steady ingestion of super-PAC poison, talking-point Novocain and fund-raising spam a little harder to take.\nI couldn\u2019t shake the idea of this Obama-Romney evening at the White House. I found myself talking about it to people I have actual professional or quasi-professional relationships with. The first was Alex Castellanos, the Republican media strategist and CNN contributor, whom I ran into at a wedding over Memorial Day weekend (yes, the kind of incestuous small-town encounter that also goes with living here). He said he liked it, and then he went immediately into analyst mode, saying it would be \u201chelpful\u201d to whoever made the invitation and was thus \u201cseen as magnanimous.\u201d A week or so later I mentioned the idea to a top Obama aide, who called it \u201cinteresting\u201d and then listed all the reasons Obama does not like to mix personal time with work (see: golf invitation made to John Boehner after a full two and a half years in the White House). I started bringing it up casually to people I met at campaign events. They seemed more enthused. \u201cIt would be a sign that something nice is possible,\u201d said Bob Grandison, a retired technician for Ohio Edison whom I met at an Obama rally in Akron.\nThis isn\u2019t all a setup for one of those gauzy laments about how \u201cour politics have never been meaner\u201d or how \u201cwe\u2019ve lost our civility as a society\u201d and it would all be so much better if our leaders could just emulate the oft-invoked after-hours salons of Ronald Reagan and Tip O\u2019Neill (a tradition way overstated). Nor am I a member of the \u201cdeeply saddened and troubled\u201d club, like John McCain (or whoever tweets for him), who recently called this campaign the \u201cworst I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d This from someone who in 2000 had to field the race-baiting accusation that he fathered his adopted Bangladeshi daughter, out of wedlock, with a black woman.\nI am as cynical as any political reporter. And perhaps my recent craving for uplift was a sublimation of my own anger at being a small cog in a giant inanity machine. But I write and read and talk about politics because beneath that cynicism I understand that the stakes are high. On top of which, oddly, the job also keeps me patriotic, a byproduct of seeing \u2014 as I did at a Romney event in Ohio in July \u2014 things like a Korean War veteran in a wheelchair removing his insignia cap and struggling to his feet to salute the flag during the national anthem. (Immediately after which, I looked down at my BlackBerry to learn that the Democratic National Committee had just released a new ad ridiculing Ann Romney\u2019s dressage horse.)\nBut what\u2019s been completely missing this year has been, for lack of a better word, joy. Yes, it\u2019s always kind of fun to follow Joe Biden around and wait to hear what will come out of his mouth next, and who knows what Paul Ryan has hidden under his oversize jacket. But the principals don\u2019t seem to be experiencing much joy as they go through their market-tested paces. A kind of faux-ness permeates everything this year in a way that it hasn\u2019t been quite so consuming in the past. The effect has been anesthetizing and made it difficult to take any of the day\u2019s supposed gaffes, game-changers and false umbrages seriously. The campaigns appeared locked in a paradigm of terrified superpowers\u2019 spending blindly on redundant warfare. How many times do they have to blow up Vladivostok?\nWhere were the surprises, the pleasures of discovery and the true emotion of the newly vitalized? The volunteers who decided to get involved because so-and-so inspired them, not because the other guy (the socialist or the plutocrat) scared them? They seemed in such short supply. This might or might not be the most important election of our lifetime \u2014 as we are told it is every four years \u2014 but it really did feel like the most joyless.\nI wanted to find a moment in the muck that proved me wrong. So in mid-July I started circulating through campaign rallies and headquarters on a mission to find something that might make me feel, if not joyful, at least more at peace with the joylessness.\nMy first stop was a Romney town-hall gathering at a community center in Bowling Green, Ohio. An orderly, almost entirely white procession filed through metal detectors to Bob Seger\u2019s \u201cRamblin\u2019 Gamblin\u2019 Man,\u201d which of course immediately brings Mitt Romney to mind. The traveling media, which often refer to Romney among themselves as Mittens, was at the back of the room, ignored by the rest of the crowd, with the one sensational exception of Carl Cameron, the oval-headed reporter for Fox News. As is customary for any recognizable Fox personality at a Republican event, Cameron was a popular fuss-object \u2014 waved to and asked for photos and autographs, requests which he obliged with the flair of a seasoned senator. \u201cThank God for Fox News,\u201d one man yelled.\nRomney is better on the stump now than he was five or six months ago, and surprisingly better in person than he is on TV \u2014 more human-seeming, somehow, when seen head to toe. On screen, his hurried asides (\u201cI\u2019m running for office, for Pete\u2019s sake\u201d) and staccato laugh seem weirder and more pronounced. In person, there\u2019s a slightly awkward charm about him. But he still emits a kind of pretraumatic gaffe anxiety at all times. This is understandable, given today\u2019s hair-trigger media, but you sense that it runs deeper. His father and idol, the former governor of Michigan George Romney, saw his presidential hopes blown apart after he claimed to have been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d into supporting the Vietnam War (inspiring a classic insult by Senator Eugene McCarthy, who said that with Romney \u201ca light rinse would have been sufficient\u201d). The episode supposedly had a searing effect on Mitt, and people who know him say it sank a hypervigilance in him that has shaped his public demeanor for decades.\nAs Romney took questions, a self-described \u201cangry mom\u201d went on a rant about how her son\u2019s apparel business has suffered under Obama \u2014 \u201cthat monster,\u201d as she called the president. Some in the crowd laughed, and Romney closed his eyes and ducked his head, assuming a look of either pained meditation or quiet panic. I imagined the data-processing spasm in his brain as he weighed whether to disavow the remark immediately or risk seeming to have endorsed it. Romney clasped his hands at his waist and, after a few seconds, chose action. \u201cThat\u2019s not a term I would use,\u201d he said, and then, \u201cbut, but, but, uh, uh,\u201d before Kathye Zaper of suburban Toledo told her party\u2019s presidential nominee that, because of her status as a mother who was angry, she could call the president a monster if she wanted to.\nIn his speech, Romney asked everyone in the room who had started their own businesses to please stand. A few dozen people did, some holding signs that said things like \u201cI opened my own business\u201d and \u201cI created a business. Not the government.\u201d \u201cThese are fun; these are fun signs!\u201d Romney gushed. \u201cFor those who made those signs, thank you for reminding us who it is in America that creates jobs.\u201d\nAfter the event, I met one of these business owners, Wayne Michaelis, standing outside the auditorium. I knew he had opened a business, because his sign said so. He is a retired orthodontist. \u201cI build smiles,\u201d he said proudly. But he did not build his own \u201cI opened my own business\u201d sign. That was handed to him, as were many others, by the campaign.\nMichaelis admitted this to a reporter traveling with Romney and word spread fast within the press corps \u2014 a morsel of gotcha chum bobbing in the water. Other reporters approached Michaelis, seeking verification. \u201cThis is all the media is going to focus on for this event,\u201d Dick Motten, a financial planner who was standing next to Michaelis, said. He watched with some disgust as the reporters surrounded his friend. \u201cYou can see what\u2019s happening here,\u201d Motten said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care what Wayne has to say. They just want to know that he didn\u2019t make his own sign. And then they\u2019ll make a big deal of it.\u201d About that, he was right. The homemade-sign revelation was online within hours.\nThe political media are engaged in their own silly arms race. The treadmill existence of having to file articles around the clock, tweet nonevents as they happen and listen to the same canned speeches and campaign conference calls day after day, waiting for something, anything, to bust up the script so that you can pretend there\u2019s news here; this can be the definition of joylessness. Politics operates in \u201ccycles\u201d \u2014 news cycles, election cycles \u2014 one of those words that has come into fashion in recent years. There\u2019s even a political show on MSNBC called \u201cThe Cycle\u201d (which, as The Washington Post\u2019s Karen Tumulty pointed out in a tweet, was obviously not named by a woman).\nPresident Obama talks a lot now about how his hair is going gray. It\u2019s a useful tool of self-deprecation (the \u201cmy big ears\u201d of 2012) and a functional symbol of what his team calls the \u201cgrind it out\u201d election, as opposed to the Hope and Change of 2008. In early August, I went to see him speak at a midday rally in the center of Mansfield, in north-central Ohio, in front of the faded brick exterior of an out-of-business department store. Obama does his best to stir the old magic \u2014 droppin\u2019 his g\u2019s and talkin\u2019 straight about how his opponents think we \u201cshould be goin\u2019 back to what we were doin\u2019 that got us into this mess in the first place.\u201d But his appearances can give off the slightly musty air of Van Halen in the Sammy Hagar years.\nAfter he spoke, the president quickly worked the crowd near the front of the stage. He does a decent meet-and-greet but clearly lacks Bill Clinton\u2019s or Biden\u2019s draw-energy-from-the-adoring-throng gene. As with Romney, you can picture him grabbing for the Purell as soon as he escapes the rope line. His retail-politicking chores completed, Obama disappeared behind a thick black curtain next to an empty storefront, into something called the \u201cGood News Center\u201d \u2014 a place I was not allowed to go.\nI originally planned to see Obama at two events in Florida the previous week, but made it only as far as Atlanta, where I missed a connection and stayed in a Motel 6 and woke early the next morning to the ghastly news of the Colorado movie-theater massacre. The campaigns pressed pause. Sitting in the dark motel room, I got a sentimental yearning again \u2014 for something that might break with the predictable regiment that followed a Sobering National Tragedy. I knew there would be statements from the candidates and talk of national unity during this difficult time, and then some member of Congress would say something inflammatory (cue Louie Gohmert, the Texas Republican, who blamed the massacre on a lack of prayer) and then some reporter would wrongly say the shootings were politically motivated (cue ABC\u2019s Brian Ross, who initially suggested that the suspect was linked to the Tea Party); a cluster of Democrats would call for tougher arms restrictions, and the president would barely touch the issue, because to do otherwise would be to bang his head against political concrete. I craved something more this time, some real joint action, the two candidates meeting in Aurora as a show of unity that went beyond pro forma expressions of condolence and a brief ceasing of hostilities. Maybe they could issue a statement saying that while the shooting was not politically motivated, there is a lot of anger out there and they wanted to address it together. As the hiatus proceeded \u2014 a \u201chighly choreographed d\u00e9tente,\u201d as Zeke Miller from Buzzfeed called it \u2014 the campaigns were quick to advertise all the campaigning they were not doing. \u201cWe have asked affiliates to pull down our contrast advertising for the time being,\u201d Jen Psaki, an Obama spokeswoman, said.\nBy Monday, three days later, they were back to pulling down each other\u2019s Garanimals. David Axelrod ended the cease-fire with a pair of early-morning tweets about Romney\u2019s being \u201csecretive\u201d regarding his tax returns and business career and etc.\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s back on,\u201d Romney\u2019s communications director, Gail Gitcho, said when told of the truce-busting tweet.\nI was sitting in a bar later that day in Boston\u2019s North End with Gitcho and Eric Fehrnstrom, Romney\u2019s longtime press secretary. \u201cOver the weekend, we were constantly assessing when we could return to campaign activities,\u201d said Fehrnstrom, a former Boston Herald reporter with chubby cheeks and a jittery bearing. He goes to bed every night at 11:30, wakes at 3, checks his BlackBerry and then tries to get another hour or so of \u201cnot exactly quality REM sleep\u201d before starting the day. He and Gitcho described how restless they felt during the Aurora armistice, and like a couple sharing the same pheromonic response to the news cycle, they both began quivering their knees under the table at precisely the same time.\nRomney\u2019s campaign staff is known in political shorthand as \u201cBoston,\u201d and Obama\u2019s is \u201cChicago\u201d \u2014 like the Russians used to be \u201cMoscow\u201d and the Americans were \u201cWashington.\u201d Owing to valid security concerns, Romney\u2019s North End headquarters feel like a fortress, with no external signifiers that a presidential campaign is being run there. (Obama\u2019s headquarters in Chicago are like this, too.) Receptionists in the lobby greet visitors from behind thick glass similar to what you\u2019d find at a gas station in a rough neighborhood. Inside, big framed pictures of Ronald Reagan and George Romney dominate walls, along with prominent renderings of Mitt and Ann. A lone photo of George W. Bush hangs crooked next to a darkened office in a far corner. (The former president and Laura Bush would stop by the headquarters on a visit to Boston the day after I was there, and I imagined young campaign workers scrambling to put up more Bush pictures.)\nGitcho is a forcible presence who wakes most mornings before 5 for \u201cboot camp\u201d training at a North End gym. She referred to the Obama staff as \u201cthe defending champs\u201d three times in a half hour and kept pointing out that as of that day, the Obama re-election campaign had 778 people on its payroll to Romney\u2019s 272 (though the Romney staff grew considerably when Paul Ryan joined the ticket). Stuart Stevens, Romney\u2019s chief strategist, said the media\u2019s trivial focus on things like Romney\u2019s gaffes and his tax returns wouldn\u2019t amount to anything next to the ravages of the Obama economy. He wanted me to understand that none of the news-cycle fodder amounted to anything. \u201cIf Steinbeck was alive today,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cyou think he would be writing about tweets?\u201d\nOfficials in each camp like to praise one another in the classically backhanded language of politics. \u201cObama is a good salesman trying to push a defective product,\u201d Fehrnstrom said, to which Gitcho replied, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good one.\u201d Fehrnstrom looked pleased. \u201cYou see where I mixed in something nice with something bad?\u201d\nFehrnstrom accuses Axelrod of having \u201can entire staff of people who tweet for him\u201d (not true), and he makes sneering references to the foosball table at Obama HQ (it\u2019s a Ping-Pong table). The intention is of course to contrast the lean, no-nonsense approach of Boston with the indulged, big-government-like behemoth of Chicago. Fehrnstrom was on a roll, seeming eager to dispense a little wisdom about how the political magic happens. \u201cI used to work for an ad agency,\u201d he said, \u201cand I always thought the best place to be was on the creative side, because they could get away with anything.\u201d He added, smirking: \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the creative process, I guess. If someone happened to be taking a nap under their desk in the afternoon, you weren\u2019t supposed to disturb them, because it\u2019s all part of the process.\u201d\nAs it did four years ago, Team Obama often pats itself on the back for basing its campaign in Chicago, far away from the silliness of Washington. The implication is that they are situated among real Americans with real concerns \u2014 in the heartland of Michigan Avenue. (Whereas \u201cChicago\u201d is used as an epithet by the Romney folks, who like to refer disdainfully to Obama\u2019s \u201cChicago-style politics.\u201d) For the Obama staff members, \u201cChicago\u201d has an almost talismanic connection to the full-swagger days of 2008, time that political followers, especially those with press credentials, have spent a good part of this campaign longing for. The Ghost of the Last Campaign looms heavy over this one like a dearly departed sibling. One of the more anticipated cultural events of the Washington winter was the premiere of \u201cGame Change,\u201d the HBO adaptation of the best seller about the 2008 \u201ccampaign of a lifetime,\u201d by the journo-pundits Mark Halperin and John Heilemann. The red-carpet opening featured the executive producer, Tom Hanks; the star, Julianne Moore (who played Sarah Palin); Brangelina (i.e., Halperin and Heilemann); Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski; and swarms of White House officials, Congress members, lobbyists and journalists parading into the Newseum on Pennsylvania Avenue, where they grazed a buffet of salmon and marinated hanger steak with Maui onions. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to go back in time,\u201d said McCain\u2019s chief strategist, Steve Schmidt (played by Woody Harrelson), in the film. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to have do-overs in life.\u201d No do-overs, indeed, but you can help shape events retroactively: Schmidt, who presided over the dysfunctional McCain campaign and is credited/blamed with encouraging the candidate to pick Palin, has emerged fine from the fiasco in the proud political tradition of failing upward. He scored a pundit gig on MSNBC and a TV studio outfitted in his home on Lake Tahoe, and he was portrayed as a tortured hero in the film. (One of my recurring suspicions is that every operative I talk to this year is secretly contemplating how he\u2019ll come off and who will play him in the next \u201cGame Change\u201d \u2014 which of course Halperin and Heilemann are busy reporting.)\nThe film also sent Palin into a tizzy, complaining about its \u201cfalse narrative.\u201d The complaint brought to mind a line I highlighted years ago \u2014 in 1993 \u2014 from a profile in this magazine of David Gergen by Michael Kelly. \u201cPolitics is not about objective reality, but virtual reality,\u201d Kelly wrote. \u201cWhat happens in the political world is divorced from the real world. It exists for only the fleeting historical moment, in a magical movie of sorts, a never-ending and infinitely revisable docudrama.\u201d\nLike their opponents in Boston, Obama\u2019s team prides itself on being grounded in \u201cobjective\u201d campaign realities rather than the \u201cvirtual\u201d ones spat forth by the news cycle. They knew Romney would be their opponent all along, they said. They knew the economy would be rough and they would be facing \u201cheadwinds.\u201d They also knew that they would have to \u201cgive some definition to Romney,\u201d as Axelrod put it, which is another way of saying they would have to caricature the former Massachusetts governor as a cold private-equity vulture with a penchant for secrecy and an indifference to the needs of the middle class as well as the gastric distresses of his long-dead dog. There is very little \u201cplay in the electorate,\u201d Axelrod told me, meaning far fewer persuadable voters than there were four years ago.\nWhen I visited the Obama headquarters in late July, I was asked to present two forms of identification before entering the offices, which are in a downtown office building on a floor the campaign asked me not to divulge, for security reasons. The nerve center is a sprawling room filled with hundreds of campaign workers, most of them under 25, many sitting under their college pennants. Like many campaigns \u2014 and tech companies \u2014 it is also something of a sweatshop (this is even more pronounced in the swing-state field offices), where 100-hour weeks are expected, outputs are closely monitored and discipline enforced. For every kid organizer whose political fervor is ignited on the Obama campaign, there is another \u2014 and probably more \u2014 who is not making his phone bank numbers, lagging behind ambitious co-workers bucking for administration jobs and resenting the revenge-of-the-nerds arrogance of his bosses. Still, the feel of youthful political energy was palpable as I passed row after row of desks en route to the men\u2019s room \u2014 an unauthorized foray, it turned out, as all visitors require chaperones at all times. In a far corner was an area dedicated to the memory of Alex Okrent, a 29-year-old staff member who died earlier this summer after collapsing at his desk. Okrent, a veteran of two previous Obama campaigns \u2014 2004 and 2008 \u2014 was a beloved figure here, and many of the Post-its affixed to the shrine were in the vein of \u201cWin It for Alex.\u201d Okrent\u2019s death hit the campaign hard; Obama called the staff from Washington, and Romney tweeted a message of condolence.\nOn this day, the Obama team was particularly giddy over Romney\u2019s mishaps on his recent tour of Europe and the Middle East. (\u201cMitt the Twit!\u201d the press secretary Ben LaBolt read aloud from his BlackBerry, quoting a London tabloid headline.) I met with four top officials in the office of the campaign manager, Jim Messina. They included Messina, LaBolt, Axelrod and the deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter. On a few occasions, I looked up to see all four simultaneously typing on their BlackBerries. They are wary of speaking on the record, for fear of compromising their message of discipline. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be telling Matt Rhoades everything we\u2019re doing,\u201d Messina told me, referring to his counterpart on the Romney campaign. When he did speak on the record, it was often with a mouthful of string cheese, around which he spewed a litany of poll data (\u201cUnivision says we\u2019re up 70-22 with Hispanics\u201d), tech stats (\u201cFacebook was one-ninth the size in 2008 than it is now\u201d) and demographic trends (\u201cthe fastest growing population on Facebook is people over 50\u201d).\nI then headed down the hall for a brief separate interview with Cutter, whom I\u2019ve known for years, going back to when she was John Kerry\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cHow are you?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cAre we on the record?\u201d she replied.\nNine days after Romney announced his selection of Paul Ryan, his aides were marveling at how much \u201clooser\u201d he had become. It was as if \u201crapport\u201d was their approved theme of the week, and everyone was on message at all times. When I attended a joint Town Hall meeting on the quad of St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., a week before the start of the Republican Convention, Romney looked as if he was enjoying himself rather than following some \u201clook as if you\u2019re enjoying yourself\u201d stage direction. He sat in a chair a few feet away and cast an adoring gaze upon his new running mate. \u201cWe\u2019re going to elect leadership,\u201d Ryan said, and then the bells of the campus church tolled to signal it was 11 a.m. \u201cAt the 11th hour,\u201d Ryan quipped, a deft ad-lib that had the crowd laughing and cheering for several seconds. A few minutes later, Ryan said what will no doubt be a standard part of his stump repertory: when he and Romney win, he said, they will have \u201cthe moral authority and the mandate\u201d to enact their agenda. \u201cMoral authority\u201d is one of the most depressing terms in politics, made more so by the fact that whoever wins will likely do it with barely more than 50 percent of the vote.\nWhen I asked Obama\u2019s top aides in Chicago how the president\u2019s re-election would make Congressional Republicans any more likely to work with them, their response was: \u201cOur winning will teach them a lesson. It will make them look at themselves and realize that their positions are untenable. It will, finally, break the fever.\u201d\nI thought about this as I walked through the St. Anselm parking lot after the Romney event, past gridlocked cars, several of which loudly played the affirming sounds of conservative hosts on their radios. On this day, the feedback loop was atwitter over remarks by the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri, Todd Akin, and his bizarre comments about \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d plus the report in Politico about the drunken, skinny-dipping escapades of a congressman in the Sea of Galilee. A few days later, the evangelist Rick Warren would cancel his \u201ccivil forum,\u201d after neither campaign would sign on to participate. Two days after that, Romney would trot out the old birther canard in front of a cheering crowd in Michigan. So much for the campaign of \u201cbig ideas\u201d we were promised when Ryan was announced as Romney\u2019s running mate.\nMy best moment in New Hampshire came when I met Jim Preisendorfer, a semiretired salesman from Concord. He had a white Fu Manchu and wore a big crucifix dangling over a \u201cPro-life to the max\u201d T-shirt. I waited for him to get in my face about liberal media bias, something that happens a fair amount at Republican events, but he could not have been nicer or more thoughtful \u2014 a Catholic, active in his church, completely despairing about politics. I couldn\u2019t help it, and trotted out my ridiculous Sauerkraut Summit idea (which a few minutes earlier I proposed to a longtime Romney spokesman, Kevin Madden, who looked at me as if I had sauerkraut between my ears). Preisendorfer liked the idea. But of course Obama and Romney would never do it, he said. Why? \u201cIt\u2019s pride in themselves and fear in one another,\u201d Preisendorfer said. I think I knew what he meant. But if it did happen? \u201cIt would be awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cJust for them to sit down and be human beings. It would give me hope. That would make me so proud.\u201d",

The fast-moving fire in the Tazreen Fashions building trapped people on upper floors, forcing some to jump to their deaths, as had the fire in New York City.\nIn researching the Triangle blaze for my novel \u201cCity of Slaughter,\u201d I found that garment factory fires seem to be symptomatic of the struggle of organized labor to find a unified voice in workplace safety.\nBoth the textile factory fire in Pakistan earlier this year and now this one reinforce the adage that those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\nCYNTHIA DREW Weaverville, N.C., Nov. 26, 2012",

    "text": "Sunday Dialogue: Pakistan-Afghan Options\n2012-11-03T16:30:30.000Z\nIs Pakistan friend or foe? What does that mean for the region?\nTo the Editor: \nIn a recent editorial, you said, \u201cIf there was ever a chance of \u2018victory\u2019 in Afghanistan, it evaporated when American troops went off to fight the pointless war in Iraq\u201d (\u201cTime to Pack Up,\u201d Oct. 14).\nThe possibility of victory was in fact precluded when both the Bush and Obama administrations made it dependent on the support of Pakistan, which, as you put it so well, \u201csupports jihad in Afghanistan, Kashmir and Indian cities\u201d \u2014 and has been doing so for over 40 years.\nThe deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan has been the inevitable result of America\u2019s continuation of the very dynamic that led to the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 hefty, decades-long military assistance to Pakistan, which it used to incite proxy militants to crush socioeconomic reform at home and commit aggression against its neighbors.\nViewed in this historical perspective, your call for a precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan is quite simply a forfeiting of the game to Pakistan. Why should the Afghan people have to pay for the United States\u2019 insistence, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that Pakistan is an ally when it is in fact an enemy? And how will the American people emerge more secure if we leave behind the Pakistani-fostered jihadist safe havens that inflicted such agony on our nation?\nBoth presidential candidates sidestepped this issue in their final debate. Mitt Romney\u2019s pledge to encourage the Pakistanis to \u201cmove to a more responsible course\u201d ignores the reality that this tack has long been pursued with utter failure. President Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cwe have stood on the side of democracy\u201d in the region evades the truth that funding Pakistan\u2019s army serves to smother civil society.\nContinued military and diplomatic engagement in South-Central Asia, with a truer aim of containing Pakistan\u2019s ability to destabilize its neighbors and effecting a transition to real civilian rule there, is our best option. Such a policy would proceed not from triumphalist myopia but from tragic recognition, and is the only course that will bring peace and security to Afghanistan, the region and America.\nVANNI CAPPELLI Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Oct. 29, 2012\nThe writer, a freelance journalist, is president of the Afghanistan Foreign Press Association.\n\nReaders React\nFew countries understand Afghanistan\u2019s pain better than Pakistan. If Pakistan is barely recognizable from the country it was in the late 1970s, the reason, according to most Pakistanis, is Afghanistan.\nPakistan has made enormous sacrifices and paid an incalculable price in blood and treasure in the fight against terrorism over the last decade, and earlier, during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which forced more than three million Afghans to seek refuge in Pakistan. We have hosted, housed, fed (at one point releasing supplies from our strategic food reserves) and educated these refugees for more than 30 years at a cost to us of billions of dollars. Pakistan is proud to have been of assistance to our Afghan brothers and sisters, and we look forward to the day when the refugees can return to their homeland in honor and dignity.\nPakistan has lost over 37,000 innocent civilians and 7,000 military and police personnel to terrorism. Terrorism claimed our most charismatic and popular leader, Benazir Bhutto. Every day Pakistanis make the supreme sacrifice against terrorism. There was one suicide bombing in Pakistan before 9/11, 300 since then. Our economy has been shattered by violence that was previously unknown in Pakistan.\nTerrorism in our region and around the world is not financed through American military assistance, as alleged by Mr. Cappelli. Terrorism is financed by the unrestricted production and sale of illegal drugs.\nPakistan wants nothing more than a stable, peaceful and economically viable Afghanistan. These goals will be achieved only through Afghanistan\u2019s transition to a real and functioning democracy. Pakistan is committed to helping Afghans realize this goal.\nTo roll out tired clich\u00e9s rather than focus on the problems confronting Pakistan and Afghanistan amounts to a disservice to the countries and their citizens. This is not the time for recriminations but for resolve to work together and defeat our common enemy.\nNADEEM HOTIANA Press Attach\u00e9, Embassy of Pakistan Washington, Nov. 1, 2012\n\u00a0\nAssuming that Mr. Cappelli is correct about Pakistan\u2019s true motives, the interminable military commitment necessary to thwart its objectives, on top of 11 years of fruitless effort in Afghanistan, is far beyond our political and popular will, not to mention our financial capacity.\nPerhaps we are being \u201cplayed\u201d by our purported ally, but we are forced to pursue a policy toward nuclear-armed Pakistan that offers the best chance of influencing its conduct in a way that does not increase tensions and instability in the region. Declaring it an enemy, as Mr. Cappelli appears to suggest, is probably the worst of our bad alternatives.\nROBERT OKSNER Winter Park, Fla., Oct. 31, 2012\n\u00a0\nThere can be no peace and stability in Afghanistan and Central Asia at large, within Pakistan and in Kashmir until Pakistani generals stop interfering in Afghanistan and in other parts of their region and in their own country\u2019s constitutional dynamics. And they will not do so until they are stripped of the basis of their arrogance: their nuclear weapons. Because of this trump card, they feel emboldened to act dangerously and have become accustomed to getting their way at the expense of other countries and the people of Pakistan.\nThe generals developed their nuclear toys while America was under the illusion that the army-controlled \u201cPakistan is an ally when it is in fact an enemy.\u201d Even if America is no longer under this illusion, it now has no choice but to dance to the generals\u2019 tune.America must find a way to neutralize this nuclear tinderbox. This is a prerequisite for peace in the region and for a fair sociopolitical order for the people of Pakistan.\nBut is America ready to defang the nuclear-armed Pakistani coterie? Considering the comments on Pakistan by both presidential candidates in the debate on Oct. 22, the answer is a resounding no.\nSIDDIQUE MALIK Louisville, Ky., Oct. 31, 2012\n\u00a0\nMr. Cappelli is absolutely right that Pakistan has played a destabilizing role in Afghanistan from at least 1994, when it essentially created the Taliban, to this day. We should recognize that the principal reason for this continuing Pakistani policy has been its relationship with India.\nJust as Pakistan has used terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba to attack targets in India itself, so, too, it has used the Taliban to attack targets in Afghanistan such as the Indian Embassy in Kabul, twice. This reflects the Pakistani fear that India, through its support of the Karzai government, will somehow succeed in creating a position of influence in Afghanistan that would further weaken Pakistan in its confrontation with India.\nThus the solution to the crisis in Afghanistan, if there is one, has to be sought in the Pakistan-India relationship, beginning with the long-festering Kashmir issue. As long as the Pakistani Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence sees the Taliban as part of its defense against India, all of our demands that Pakistan cease its support of the Taliban will fall on deaf ears.\nTHOMAS NILES Scarsdale, N.Y., Oct. 31, 2012\n\u00a0\nAs one who lobbied on behalf of the Afghan cause at the 1980 Republican Convention, I was sorely disappointed when the moderator in the third debate let both candidates get away with not answering his well-thought-out question on the future of Afghanistan.\nThe question of what we should do in 2014 if the Afghans, as is likely to be the case, are not yet able to successfully defend their country against the Taliban is a vital one, needing serious discussion. And the question of what to do about Pakistan is surely no less serious.\nWe owe the Afghan people a great debt for helping, at great costs to themselves, to remove the Soviet threat. Allowing the Taliban to recapture control in Afghanistan is not only selling out the Afghans once again, but also risks an even worse situation in Pakistan. The likely resulting Talibanization of Pakistan will surely metastasize into an even more dangerous threat against us all.\nIn such circumstances, can our next president ensure that this will not be an ever greater threat than the Soviet one, given the virulent anti-American ideology that group shares with other jihadists and Pakistan\u2019s possession of nuclear weapons?\nJOHN HOWARD WILHELM Ann Arbor, Mich., Oct. 31, 2012\n\u00a0\nOne can agree with Mr. Cappelli that it was a strategic mistake for the United States and Pakistan to arm and train the anti-Soviet mujahedeen in the 1980s. They morphed into the Taliban and created conditions for the emergence of Al Qaeda. The rest of Mr. Cappelli\u2019s thesis, however, reflects the fictions popularized by a discredited Kabul elite that assigns blame to all except itself for its country\u2019s plight.\nThe Pakistani \u201cjihadists\u201d were born in the triumphalist aftermath of the anti-Soviet war. There is no evidence to suggest that either the military or civilian leadership in Islamabad has any interest any longer in supporting the jihadists against India or Afghanistan.\nIt is Pakistan that should rue its repeated unequal alliances with the United States and its generosity toward the millions of Afghan refugees, most of whom, including the families of some of the elite, remain in Pakistan. The Taliban are indigenous to Afghanistan, not Pakistan, to which they fled from American military action. Pakistan\u2019s post-9/11 alliance with the United States made it the target of Al Qaeda and \u201cPakistani Taliban\u201d terrorists, leading to 30,000 civilian and military fatalities, a disrupted economy and a destabilized polity.\nThe United States should aim to leave Afghanistan in conditions of peace by promoting political and ethnic reconciliation by 2014. This can be achieved through Pakistan\u2019s cooperation. Likewise, preventing cross-border attacks by the Taliban, which are taking place in both directions, can be realized only through a cooperative and reciprocal process among Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United States and NATO. Attempts to \u201ccontain\u201d Pakistan will prove counterproductive, if not disastrous, for Afghanistan and the region.\nGiven the failure of nation-building in Afghanistan, suggestions that America impose specific governance structures on Pakistan are delusional.\nMUNIR AKRAM Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Oct. 31, 2012\nThe writer was ambassador of Pakistan to the United Nations from 2002 to 2008. \n\u00a0\nMr. Cappelli argues that departing Afghanistan precludes \u201cthe possibility of victory\u201d and that continued engagement \u201cis the only course that will bring peace and security to Afghanistan.\u201d I disagree.\nThere will be no peace in Afghanistan until its own people forge peace. Our engagement with Pakistan will continue on many parallel fronts. We will be engaged commercially, militarily and diplomatically. For those parallel lines to meet, Pakistanis, like the Afghans, will have to create a way to unite on their own. We do not have a good track record intervening in fractured societies.\nHERBERT S. GROSS Rockville, Md., Oct. 31, 2012\n\nThe Writer Responds\nThe readers underestimate the historical and existential depth of this problem, and the degree to which Pakistan is what American military assistance has made it.\nIn a brilliant essay in The Times in 1970, Chester Bowles, a Kennedy-era under secretary of state, prophesied that arming Pakistan would come to be counted \u201cas among our most costly blunders.\u201d He outlined the enduring contradictions of the American-Pakistani relationship: It is based on false assumptions, Pakistan uses military aid for its own ends, this aid enables the guns-not-butter paradigm of its ruling generals and America never learns from its mistakes in the region.\nViewed within this framework, Mr. Hotiana\u2019s denial of Pakistani support for terrorism is negated by the continuity and logic of this behavior. The army has successively deployed militants since the 1970s in Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Kashmir under the cry \u201cIslam in danger\u201d to effect the crushing of socioeconomic reform at home while expanding its power abroad.\nGiven the tragic role of American money in enabling all this, Mr. Oksner\u2019s claim that we lack the resources to reverse it rings hollow. Chester Bowles warned over 40 years ago that our policies toward Pakistan did not serve \u201cthe interests of the American people in Asia. Or the cause of world peace. Or the welfare of the people of Pakistan, who need tractors, not tanks.\u201d\nEven in the wake of Sept. 11, America has yet to realize that it must compel the beating of swords into plowshares across South-Central Asia. My containment strategy is a first step toward that necessity for our security.\nVANNI CAPPELLI Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Nov. 2, 2012",
