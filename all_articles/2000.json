    "text": "Floods Can't Dampen Bangladesh Ambition\n2000-05-29T05:00:00.000Z\nRain delays are infuriating in any cricket context. Even so, few frustrated observers can have suffered quite as much as Bangladesh's players and officials looking at the flooded Bangabandhu Stadium in Dhaka on Sunday.\nThe early monsoon washed out Bangladesh's home game against Sri Lanka, the opening match of the Asia Cup, which also involves India and Pakistan.\nThe two teams were due to try again Monday, but there are fears that the\nwhole seven-match, 11-day competition is in jeopardy, depriving Bangladesh of the last chance to impress as cricketers and organizers before the International Cricket Council meets next month.\nThe ICC meeting in London will consider Bangladesh's application to become the 10th full test-playing country \u2014 placing it on a level with established such countries as England, Australia, India and Pakistan. This would be significant for the game as well as the aspirants. While the number of test-playing countries has grown from six since World War II with the admission of Pakistan in 1952, Sri Lanka in 1982 and Zimbabwe in 1994, Bangladesh is likely to be the last for quite a while. Kenya, next in line, is a long way off the standard and infrastructure needed to qualify.\nFull test status confers equal voting rights with the other nine full ICC members. So there is a political dimension to Bangladesh's election, with the existing members calculating its impact on the balance of power. England and Australia, whose traditional control of the game is challenged by an India-Pakistan alliance that has held together despite national political enmities, will inevitably be less enthusiastic than the Asian countries. South Africa has already declared its support for Bangladesh, while John Anderson, New Zealand's man on the ICC executive, has also been reported as favoring its bid.\nBangladesh is likely to struggle in the five-day test matches played by the full members. It has played 37 one-day internationals, winning three. Only one, against Pakistan in the World Cup last year, was against one of the big nine. Even this has been subject to allegations of match-fixing. Bangladeshis are not in demand as professional players for English clubs in the way that Sri Lankans were before their elevation to full status.\nAll new countries struggle. New Zealand was admitted in 1929, but did not win a match until 1955. Zimbabwe has just provided much-needed therapy for England. England won the test between the two by the massive margin of an innings and 209 runs.\nThose with the potential to develop rise eventually. Sri Lanka won the World Cup within 15 years of its admission and is ranked third at test-match level. West Indies lost its first three matches to England by an innings each, but within seven years had beaten the English in a four-match series.\nThere is no doubt Bangladesh has the potential. Its population of 120 million is second only to India among cricket countries. Popular enthusiasm is possibly even greater than in India and Pakistan.\nMatthew Engel, editor of England's Wisden Cricketers Almanac, reported of the 1998 Mini World Cup, played in Bangladesh: \"The real stars were the population of Bangladesh. In villages without electricity, people huddled around radios listening to commentary and kids began playing, Sri Lanka-style, with makeshift kit wherever there was a space. The moment Bangladesh gets a national team which does them credit, it will be cricket's boom country.\"\nA national first-class competition was created last year and a professional chief executive is to be appointed by the national cricket board. A five-year development plan, with some ICC funding, is in place. Bangladesh already has one proven test venue \u2014 the Bangabandu Stadium was Pakistan's first test ground in 1955 and staged seven matches before Bangladesh \u2014 then East Pakistan \u2014 seceded in 1971. In the last two years, it has also staged the Mini World Cup and the final of the Asian five-day test championship last year, in which Pakistan beat Sri Lanka.\nThe Asia Cup is oddly structured, because Pakistan does not conclude its test series in West Indies until Monday. Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka play each other in the first three qualifying matches, then each in turn plays Pakistan in the space of four days starting Friday. The top two will contest the final June 7. If it ever stops raining, Sri Lanka, currently top Asian country in both one and five-day formats, should start as favorite.",

    "text": "400 Dead in Worst Flooding in India in Years\n2000-08-26T05:00:00.000Z\nTorrential monsoon rains and raging rivers have caused the worst flooding in decades across broad swaths of north India over the past two months, wreaking havoc in the lives of four million to five million people. And this week, sudden violent downpours caused piteous scenes of suffering in south India, as well.\nOfficials in an Indian Air Force rescue helicopter hovering over the swollen Kandu River on Thursday in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh spotted a woman in swirling, chest-high flood waters. Her baby and young son were clinging to her.\nThe rescuers lowered a large bucket to her, then watched helplessly as first the older boy, then the infant, slipped through her arms as she struggled to lift them to safety. Then she, too, fell into the turbulent waters. All were swept away.\n''The lady could not hold her sons properly, and they slipped from the bucket,'' Adhar Sinha, the civil servant in charge of the Cuddapah district, said in an interview today. ''Then the lady also fell in the flood waters. They all drowned.''\nThough the rains largely stopped today, and the flood waters slowly receded, the flooding has killed 120 people over the past three days and left a trail of heavily damaged rice paddies, washed-out roads and thousands of heavily damaged homes, state officials said.\nThe rains in Andhra Pradesh, which dumped a record 9.4 inches of water on the capital, Hyderabad, on Thursday, shocked state officials because weather forecasts had been for only half the amount of rain that fell.\n''It just poured,'' said Randeep Sudan, an adviser to Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, the state's governor. ''The roads were like rivers.''\nWhile the deluge in Andhra struck with sudden ferocity, northeastern India has endured flooding since late June. From Himachal Pradesh and Bihar into West Bengal, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, heavy, persistent rains have caused devastation. Assam, already one of the wettest places on earth, has been hardest hit. More than 300 people have died in north India, officials say.\nBut the rains are not the only culprit in flooding in India and Bangladesh. Relief officials say they believe other factors, including global warming and deforestation, have worsened the problem in recent years. Global warming may be increasing the snow melt from the Himalayas that is carried into India by the rivers.\nThe cutting of forests has increased soil erosion. That earth has then flowed into the mighty Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, among others, settled and raised the level of the river bottom -- and the waters.\nEmbankments built to contain the rising waters have been more easily breached as a result. The embankments also prevent the rivers from spreading into the broad flood plains where they used to deposit rich soil that fertilized the land. That, in turn, deposits yet more silt on the river bottom. And when these gushing rivers, squeezing between embankments, reach areas without embankments, they are moving even faster and more ferociously than before, causing massive erosion of river banks.\n''Whole villages are crumbling into the rivers,'' said Patrick Fuller, spokesman for the International Federation of the Red Cross in South Asia, based here in Delhi.\nMr. Fuller said the Red Cross had so far raised only about a fifth of the $3.5 million requested in an appeal two weeks ago for flood relief in India.\n''People think: 'Oh, floods in India again. It's a perennial problem,' '' he said. ''But so many people are affected, and they have no choice but to live in these areas. It doesn't take much to tip people into debt. And that's a very difficult cycle to break out of.''\nOver a million people in Bangladesh have been affected by flooding, but the problem has not been as serious as in 1998.",

    "text": "Big Day Spoiled for Bangladesh Villagers\n2000-03-21T05:00:00.000Z\nOf all the distant villages, in all the poor countries, in all the third world, President Bill Clinton was supposed to visit theirs.\nAnd, sitting on a cane stool under a 150-year-old banyan tree, with songbirds trilling and the press taking notes, he was to talk with the peasants of Joypura.\nIt was to be Mr. Clinton's rare chance to hear from people of the Bangladeshi soil and, in turn, their implausible opportunity to rub elbows with a man of global power.\nBut at the last minute, today's visit was canceled -- and the villagers, plucked from obscurity only to be thrust back again, were crushed.\n''It is terribly sad because we were expecting so much,'' said Rokeya Begum, a young mother. ''We thought he would talk to us, and we would get to know each other. We thought he would hear our problems and he would tell us the solutions.''\nThe bad news arrived before dawn as people were doing the final preening after weeks of preparation. Security was said to be to blame. The United States Secret Service had decided that the 28-mile excursion from Dhaka, the capital, by helicopter, would be dangerous. ''We had specific information which led us to conclude that travel to the village was inadvisable,'' said Samuel R. Berger, the White House national security adviser.\nMr. Clinton also canceled a stop to the National Memorial where world leaders traditionally pay homage to the three million people killed in Bangladesh's war of independence against Pakistan in 1971. Despite the American claims of security problems, Bangladeshis are likely to be insulted by the perceived slight.\nThis sudden shift in scheduling provided an ominous start to the president's five-day visit to South Asia. Bangladesh was supposed to provide an untroubled destination before the president went on to India, where he arrived tonight, and Pakistan.\nBut if Bill Clinton could not go to Joypura, the Americans enthusiastically counterproposed, Joypura could come to him. Buses with hundreds of villagers -- mostly women and children were brought to Dhaka. The people were happy for the journey, but it was not the same.\nIn the last few days, 10,000 people had flooded into Joypura -- four times the village's population. It was simply amazing for them all to imagine the president of the United States actually among them, walking beside the haystacks and the cow sheds and the duck ponds.\n''I am so sad now,'' said Alam Ali, who was using a crowbar to tear down a modest grandstand that had been built near the banyan tree. ''This whole area would have grown rich. Bill Clinton could have made this happen. He is a very great man, you know.''\nThe president is presumed to be the bearer of the magic wand of American wealth. And, indeed, before the day was over, he announced several aid packages to Bangladesh, including $97 million for food and $8.6 million toward the reduction of child labor. People in Joypura seemed to believe that he would hear their hopeful words and see their hard work and come away determined to rescue them from the undertow of poverty.\nMuhammad Yasin Sheik, 45, had trekked from a nearby village, holding the useless deed to his perished land. Last year, the mighty Jamuna River had changed course and swallowed his farm. He hoped that Mr. Clinton would take pity and give him money. ''We are starving,'' he said plainly. ''Bill Clinton can do something about that.''\nUnlike most others, who spoke only Bangla, Mr. Sheik knew some English. He pointed to the white prayer cap on his head, showing he was a religious man.\n''We always pray to Allah that Bill Clinton remains in good health,'' he said eagerly. ''And we also pray that his wife, who is in an election, wins a great victory.''\nJoypura had been selected for the president's first visit to Bangladesh because there were success stories here. This is a storm-ravaged nation of 128 million people with a per capita income of only $289. But the nation's war against poverty is not without its share of victories -- and many of them are owed to some of the world's most innovative strategies.\nThe Grameen Bank pioneered the idea of microcredit, small loans given to the poor without a demand for collateral. The amounts are usually $200 or less, and they are generally used to start up a simple home business like as the purchase of a milk cow.\nGrameen began in 1983, the idea of a Bangladeshi economist, Muhammad Yunus. Today, it has 2.4 million borrowers, mostly women, in 39,000 villages. The repayment rate is 98 percent.\nIn 1986, Mr. Yunus was invited to Arkansas by Bill Clinton, who was then its governor. He wanted to set up a similar banking scheme in the state. The two became friends.\nJoypura has several dozen Grameen customers, among them Nasima Akhter, who last borrowed $160 to buy a rice paddy, which she then sold at a $60 profit.\n''I wanted to tell President Clinton of my success,'' she said, holding her 7-month-old baby in her arms and standing in a home with walls of corrugated metal.\nThe Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee is one of the world's largest nongovernmental organizations -- and it too is busy in Joypura, starting a school.\nThe children had been eager for the president to visit so he could hear them recite, to watch how they were the first in their families going up the staircase to an education. The school had been scrubbed. A new toilet had been built with a shiny blue metal door. It was padlocked, yet unused, with a virgin urinal awaiting distinguished guests.\n''I am very utterly disappointed that Mr. Clinton will not see all that we have done for our village,'' said Harun ur-Rashid, a gaunt, clean-shaven man. ''We have installed electricity. We have become people of the world. Mr. Clinton should see this.''\nIndeed, it is Mr. Clinton's loss, for Joypura, like most Bangladeshi villages, is stunningly picturesque. The trees are what make these hamlets so special, the lush mix of bamboo and palms and mangoes and banana. Gauguin would have been inspired here.\nOsman Ghani, a young farmer in a green shirt and skirtlike wrap garment, was another who bemoaned the fickle destiny that kept the president away. He had walked seven miles in the morning to be here when the big moment arrived. He had thought of little else for weeks.\n''Bill Clinton is the most important man in the world,'' Mr. Ghani said emphatically. ''It would been the most memorable event in my life to see this great man.''\nThis remark led to an obvious question. What then instead would have to serve as unforgettable? The farmer thought this over until finally the answer came to him. He looked at the other villagers at his side as if they too knew his mind. He spoke with certainty.\nHe said, ''For me, the most memorable event in my life was the day I walked seven miles and almost saw Bill Clinton.''",

    "text": "Shards of Misery, Not Far From Clinton Stop in Bangladesh\n2000-03-20T05:00:00.000Z\nThe wretched squatter colony known as the Kawran Bazaar Bustee straddles Dhaka's main railroad line, the relentless iron wheels of the trains rolling within feet of the flimsy hovels of scrap metal, thatch and muslin.\nThe slum's only open space is the narrow lane between the two tracks, so working parents often think it wise to tie up their small children rather than to let them wander. Three months ago, Hanufa, age 3, was slow to heed the dangerous chugging of an oncoming engine. Her head wounds have since healed but her right hand was torn off at the wrist.\nAsiya Khatun is the girl's grandmother. She has lived beside the trains for 20 years, making her home in a filthy lean-to barely a yard square. A small crowd huddled near her on a recent day as she assessed her life. ''We have nothing, and we are nobodies,'' she concluded, with the others nodding in agreement as if they had just heard a concise rendering of perfect truth.\nAbout a third of Dhaka's nine million people live in some of the world's most miserable slums, grafting themselves to empty patches of precious land. The Kawran colony is unusual in that it is not only near a busy railway but also within 200 yards of a five-star hotel, the place where Bill Clinton and the American entourage will freshen up when they arrive here on Monday. He will be the first American president to visit Bangladesh.\nExcept for televised images of its reiterating and incomparable floods, this nation -- the eighth-most-populous on the planet -- does not often come to America's attention. It is perhaps best known as the pet cause of George Harrison, the former Beatle, who in 1971 had a hit song with the unusually sober rock lyrics: ''Bangladesh, Bangladesh/ Where so many people are dying fast/And it sure looks like a mess/ I've never seen so much distress.''\nThat lament accompanied the country's difficult birth after a war of independence against Pakistan. Three decades later, Bangladesh remains one of the world's poorest nations. The per capita income is $289. A million villagers each year lose their homes to fickle rivers that engulf their land. Democracy suffers prolonged malfunctions, in part because the two women who run the main political parties hate each other down to the bone.\nAnd yet in most ways Bangladesh is now decidedly in less of a mess, with the poverty rate drifting down and economic growth rates inching up.\nIndeed, many here fear that President Clinton is coming not just to shake hands but to make money. It seems that Bangladesh is sitting on a small fortune in natural gas.\n''We're calling this the Persian Gulf East,'' said Forrest E. Cookson, an American economic consultant who has been involved in a study of the potential profits from the gas.\nThat is hyperbole, but initial exploration by foreign oil companies does show that Bangladesh may have not only enough gas for its own needs but a sizable surplus as well. The amount of the abundance is uncertain, however -- and that poses a problem. Big corporations are willing to bore more wells, but in turn they want guarantees that they can maximize profits by selling any oversupply to gas-needy India, the colossus next-door.\nBangladeshi leaders are wary of such deals. Their own experts guess the gas reserves to be modest. And if a glut does exist, they argue that it should be used at home, converted into fertilizer or electricity rather than sold to a neighbor thought to be overbearing. The United States government, it is presumed, sides with its oil giants.\n''Colonial exploitation is a fact of our lives,'' said Serajul Islam Choudhury, an English professor and well-known social commentator. ''People here think America is the new East India Company. Mr. Clinton is the company's big man.''\nAmerican officials quietly insist otherwise, saying Mr. Clinton is simply making a day trip here while in the neighborhood in advance of five days in India and a short pause in Pakistan.\nBut the apprehensions are understandable. A recipient of $1.5 billion a year in international aid, disaster-prone Bangladesh is used to being treated as a beggar and not courted for its purse.\nMother Nature has exhibited the full arc of her mood swings in this country. On one hand, Bangladesh possesses the world's largest delta landscape with bountiful rivers that crisscross in lengthy braids. The earth is ever-enriched by alluvial silt. The greenery is lush. Farmers manage to feed 128 million people -- almost half the population of the United States -- packed into a country slightly smaller than Wisconsin.\nBut the water knows no master and is often a deadly conduit. Bacteria in ponds have been prolific killers. In response, the government and Unicef and other aid groups convinced villagers to sink tube wells to tap the underground aquifer. But that drinking water now turns out to be tainted with dangerous levels of arsenic. Millions of people are slowly poisoning themselves sip by sip, with the authorities confounded about what to do.\nIn the long, wet summers, snow melt from the Himalayas and monsoon rains hits the rivers with such force that it alters the contours of the channels, and then the Darwinian laws of real estate take effect. Where the poor once had homes, there is now river. And where there was once river, there is now virgin land, inevitably gobbled up by the rich.\n''Look out there,'' said Abdul Ahad, a bony, bare-chested man covered from the waist down in a skirt-like wrap called a lungi. He was pointing into the brown calm of the Jamuna River at a spot about a quarter mile offshore. ''Four years ago, that's where my home was, mine and 200 others and a school too. The river ate them.''\nHis village is Jafarganj, a place with houses of thatched walls and cement floors located about 60 miles west of Dhaka. Each summer, the vagabond river swallows more of the village, although the size and timing of the bites are hard to predict. Some people who think they are safe for another year suddenly see their homes licked away by the current.\n''Who wants to live with such uncertainty?'' asked Rowshan Ara, a woman with three young children at her side. ''But we cling to what we have for as long as we can.''\nVictims of the rivers take refuge with relatives or settle along the fringe of the dirt roads. Or they go to Dhaka, the capital, living in slums like the Kawran Bazaar Bustee, some clinging to deeds for land that has been submerged for generations.\nShirin, who uses only one name, says she was brought to Kawran when she was 6 months old. She is unsure of her own age, but her two daughters are 2 1/2 and 1. She lifted a blue plastic curtain to display a tiny cave of a home with walls of blankets and burlap. Flies were doing their primitive dance above a husk of coconut.\n''I can sometimes get work as a maid,'' she said. ''But when I am gone, I worry about my children. My cousin is here, but she is busy.''\nThere is a fish market near the slum, and the odor of the rotting catch is powerful. For income, people sometimes buy a few fish, cut them up and try to sell the pieces for a profit. Others pull rickshaws, earning about $1 a day.\nBetween the train tracks, mothers cook over fires fueled with wood chips. Children play games of carom. There is water to fetch, but it is expensive at 4 cents a pitcher. The privacy of an outhouse costs about the same.\nOn Feb. 23, there was a police attack on the squatter colony, part of the government's occasional effort at slum clearance. ''I asked them where they expected me to go,'' said Beauty, an old woman with a squint that made her eyes look like two brown peepholes. ''They told me to go back to my village, but I am from Laskshmipur and everything there was taken by the river. The only thing left are small islands of sand. What should I do, eat the sand?''\nLife is a day-to-day struggle, and yet many in Bangladesh are escaping poverty. The nation has become known for its plenitude of nongovernmental organizations, many made rich by foreign donors, which are credited with impressive gains in health care, population control and the empowerment of women. They have helped peasants buy income-producing farm animals.\nThe government itself has made sincere efforts, though most analysts say political leaders are easily distracted by self-interest. ''You can say this is the kind of nice Islamic country that America likes -- doesn't host terrorists, doesn't force women to wear veils -- but the political parties are corrupt Tammany Hall patronage machines,'' a Western diplomat said.\n''The purpose of the parties is to make sure their businessmen get the contracts and the loans -- and to make life impossible for the political opposition.''\nThe Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have little in the way of policy disagreements, and yet they steadfastly attack each other with profanity, street violence, general strikes and boycotts of Parliament.\n''This country is accomplishing many things, and the future has such promise, but this is despite the politicians and not because of them,'' said Muhammad Yunus, the managing director of the Grameen Bank. ''Our politicians are stuck with their own history and are always settling scores.''\nThe leader of the Awami League is the current prime minister, Sheik Hasina, daughter of the nation's first elected leader, Sheik Mujibur Rahman. He was gunned down in his home by a handful of renegade army officers in 1975 along with his wife, brother, three sons, two daughters-in-law, a grandson and several other close relatives.\nThe leader of the Nationalists is Khaleda Zia, the widow of Gen. Ziaur Rahman, a military dictator who praised and rewarded the confessed killers of Mrs. Hasina's father. The dictator was assassinated by army officers in 1981.\nAfter 16 years of military rule, democracy returned to Bangladesh in 1991. The Nationalists won that year's election, but Mrs. Zia's ability to govern was limited when the Awami League took to the streets in a prolonged campaign of agitation.\nMrs. Hasina became prime minister in 1996 and now faces the same tactics. The Nationalists and several smaller parties are boycotting Parliament. General strikes are enforced by thugs who pull people from their autos as they try to get to work.\n''It's the politics of tit for tat, the country be damned,'' said Mahfuz Anam, editor of the English language newspaper, the Daily Star.\nMrs. Zia, 54, takes issue with such remarks, refusing to share any blame for the country's troubled governance. She is not a taciturn woman. Asked about the state of democracy in Bangladesh, she replied with a 67-minute filibuster against her opponents.\nLater, she admitted to hating Mrs. Hasina, but stressed that this deep loathing was nothing personal. She disagreed with those who suggest the welfare of the impoverished nation suffers because of a private feud.\n''My differences with Hasina are all political,'' she said, sitting before a huge portrait of her late husband. But then she thought a while longer. And anger rose in her throat.\n''I went to her daughter's wedding when I was prime minister and I was not properly received,'' she said bitterly, waving her index finger. ''She did not even come and sit with me.''\nMrs. Hasina, 53, likewise declaimed the notion of a private grudge. ''Why should I hate her?'' she said, sitting in an office decorated with paintings of her father. Her government has successfully prosecuted many of her father's killers. She has renamed an extraordinary number of public structures in her family's memory.\n''There is no personal clash or enmity with Khaleda,'' the prime minister repeated, sloughing aside the very suggestion. ''I am the daughter of the father of the nation. Who can match that? When my father was head of the country, her husband was just a major.''",

    "text": "As the Earth's Ice Cover Melts, It Brings Floods and Famine\n2000-09-08T05:00:00.000Z\nIf any explorers had been hiking to the North Pole this summer, they would have had to swim the last few miles. The discovery of open water at the Pole by an icebreaker cruise ship in mid-August surprised many in the scientific community.\nThis finding, combined with two recent studies, provides more evidence not only that Earth's ice cover is melting, but also that it is melting at an accelerating rate. A study by Norwegian scientists projects that within 50 years the Arctic Ocean could be free of ice during the summer. Its ice sheet has been reduced by nearly half over the last four decades. The other, a study by U.S. scientists, reports that the vast Greenland ice sheet is melting. It is experiencing a net loss of water each year equal to the annual flow of the Nile River.\nThe Antarctic is also losing ice. Huge icebergs that have broken off are threatening ships in the area. Scientists attribute the accelerated ice melting to a regional temperature rise of some 2.5 degrees centigrade (36.5 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1940.\nThese are not the only examples of melting. The mass of ice and snow is shrinking in the world's major mountain ranges: the Rocky Mountains in the United States, the Andes in South America, the Alps in Europe and the Himalayas in Asia.\nIn the Alps, the shrinkage of the glacial area by 35 to 40 percent since 1850 is expected to continue. These ancient glaciers could largely disappear over the next half century. Shrinkage of ice masses in the Himalayas has also accelerated alarmingly.\nThis melting should not come as a surprise. There have been many warnings from researchers. A Swedish scientist, Svante Arrhenius, cautioned nearly a century ago that burning fossil fuels could raise atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, creating a greenhouse effect.\nAs carbon dioxide concentrations have risen, so too has Earth's temperature. From 1975 to 1999, the average temperature increased from 13.94 degrees centigrade to 14.35 degrees. The warmest 23 years since record keeping began in 1866 have all occurred since 1975.\nResearchers are discovering that a modest rise in temperature of only 1 or 2 degrees centigrade in mountainous regions can dramatically increase the share of precipitation falling as rain, while decreasing the share coming down as snow. The result is more flooding during the rainy season, and less melting snow to feed rivers during the dry season.\nThis will affect the water supply for cities and for irrigation in areas dependent on melted snow to feed rivers.\nThe mass of ice and snow in the Himalayas is the third largest in the world after the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. If the Himalaya mass continues to melt, it will affect the water supply of much of Asia. All of the region's major rivers, the Indus, Ganges, Mekong, Yangtze and Yellow, originate in the Himalayas.\nAs the ice on land melts and flows to the sea, the level of the sea rises. Over the last century the sea level rose by 20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches). During this century, climate models indicate that it could rise by as much as one meter.\nSuch an increase would affect the low-lying river floodplains of Asia, where much of the region's rice is produced. According to a World Bank analysis, a one-meter rise in sea level would cost low-lying Bangladesh half its riceland. Numerous low-lying island countries in the Pacific and Indian oceans and Asian waters would have to be evacuated.\nThe residents of densely populated river valleys of Asia would be forced inland into overcrowded interiors. Rising sea level could create millions of climate refugees in countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines.\nWe don't have to sit idly by as this scenario unfolds. There may still be time to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide levels before continuing carbon emissions cause climate change to spiral out of control.\nThe world has access to more than enough wind, solar and geothermal energy that can be economically harnessed to power the economy. If we were to incorporate the cost of climate disruption in the price of fossil fuels in the form of a carbon tax, investment would quickly shift from fossil fuels to these climate-benign energy sources.\nLeading automobile companies are working on fuel cell engines. Daimler Chrysler plans to start marketing such an automobile in 2003. The fuel of choice for these engines is hydrogen. Even leaders within the oil industry recognize that we will eventually shift from a carbon-based energy economy to a hydrogen-based one.\nThe question is whether we can make that shift before Earth's climate system is irrevocably altered.\nThe writer is chairman of the Worldwatch Institute, which analyzes environmental issues. He contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]",

    "text": "MEANWHILE : Asian Nations Threatened By Environmental Crises\n2000-11-16T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Sundarbans in Bangladesh, the world's largest mangrove forest and tiger reserve, is under threat. If a pending deal to exploit petroleum reserves beneath the forest goes through, a rich ecosystem will be severely damaged, affecting 2 million people who depend on it for survival.\nThe 6,000 square kilometer (2,400 square mile) forest is both home and a source of food for people, animals, birds, insects and marine life. The forest stabilizes the coastline and enriches soil and aquatic environments. Eroding this ecosystem will make the communities living there poorer. It is better for society to develop the forest through community-based enterprises than exploiting it for petroleum.\nBangladesh is one of many Asian countries facing a choice between economic growth and a broader development agenda. Exploiting natural resources can spur growth. But development includes wider benefits such as social equity and environmental stability. Pursuing economic growth\nabove all else could yield short-term gain but sacrifice society's long-term well-being.\nThe burning of Indonesia's forests in recent years is an example of long-term benefits being given up for short-term gain. Entrepreneurs, most of whom live outside Indonesia, are clearing large tracts of forest by burning trees and undergrowth. Driven by profit and aided by weak law enforcement, they are destroying irreplaceable biodiversity and causing smoke and haze pollution that adversely affect the health of Indonesians and people in neighboring countries. In 1997 and 1998, such burning devastated more than 9 million hectares (22.2 million acres), causing an economic loss of more than $6 billion\nAsia's devastating floods of the past decade, repeated in recent weeks in South Asia, China and Southeast Asia, are another illustration of environmental mismanagement. Most authorities blame bad weather for the disasters. But while nature provides the trigger event, it is man's misuse of natural resources that changes the environment and influences the severity of the floods.\nSuch man-made factors include deforestation, inappropriate engineering infrastructure to control floodwaters and mismanagement of watersheds.\nIf Asia's governments do not take action to halt the region's rapid environmental degradation, it may soon be too late to reverse the trend. Governments need to implement policies to change individual and institutional behavior to address the root causes of environmental degradation.\nThe causes include: growing populations, which need more energy and materials; affluence, which increases material consumption and waste; poverty, which limits choices on how to use the environment; technologies which use energy and dispose of waste inefficiently; and institutions and policies that avoid addressing the most pressing problems and exclude stakeholders, especially women and the poor.\nThree things must change to reverse the region's environmental decline. First, environmental objectives should be fused from the beginning into development planning and processes. At present, the battle is being fought \u2014 and lost \u2014 through rearguard actions by national environmental agencies. Moreover, environmental goals can be achieved only in concert with financial and economic development institutions and private sector interests. Policy integration is the key.\nSecond, political will is needed to turn rhetoric into action and achieve environmental compliance. This means allocating enough money and trained people to deal with the crisis.\nThird, developing countries must have unhindered access to modern technologies that use materials and energy efficiently and with minimum waste. In this respect, public access to information is critical.\nCreating these new conditions is a challenging task with a high price tag. But the price of not doing enough may be far higher.\nThe writer is a senior environment specialist at the Asian Development Bank in Manila.

    "text": "In America; Cold Facts Of Global Warming\n2000-07-10T05:00:00.000Z\nThose inclined to tout the potential benefits of global warming would do well to take a look at the news items about the frightening weather in southern Europe last week.\nAll week there were stories about the extreme heat and the raging wildfires it triggered. Temperatures reached as high as 120 degrees and dozens of people died. In some places the problems were worsened by drought. According to The Associated Press, ''The sizzling weather accompanied the worst drought to strike the Balkans in 50 years, which has already caused record crop losses since it began in late May.''\nAmbulances patrolled streets in southern Romania to pick up some of the many individuals who fainted in temperatures that were well over 100 degrees. Soldiers were deployed in western Bulgaria to fight a major forest fire. At least 10 people were reported dead from the heat in Turkey. Intense fires raged on a number of islands in the Aegean. And wildfires in Italy consumed hundreds of acres of forest in the southern Gargano region.\nNo single weather event can be attributed to global warming. But this is the kind of terrible weather that scientists have long predicted would accompany the warming of the planet. That warming is not only well under way, it is accelerating.\nThere will be some benefits for some people from global warming. A study commissioned by the federal government said, for example, that the U.S. could see increased crop yields in some parts of the country and that they could lead to falling food prices. But that modest benefit would almost certainly be overwhelmed by the potentially devastating aspects of the warming that will occur here and around the world if nothing substantial is done about the buildup in the earth's atmosphere of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.\nThat same federal study, released just last month, warned of destructive storm surges, chronic erosion of the U.S. coastline, extreme water shortages in some places, and frequent and severe flooding in others. The authors of the study said it is very probable that continued thawing of the permafrost and melting sea ice in Alaska would cause continued severe damage to its forests, buildings, roads and coastlines.\nA word of caution is in order for anyone who thinks global warming is a good thing: be careful what you wish for.\n''People who argue that global warming will be beneficial are missing two central points,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist of Environmental Defense, a national research and advocacy organization. ''First, until the greenhouse gases are brought under control, the climate is going to continue to warm, so you're never going to be at your optimum climate for very long. If the balance of milder winters versus hotter summers is struck in a direction that's favorable to somebody at some particular time -- well, just wait. The benefits will be ephemeral because it's going to get warmer. In that situation, today's winners are very likely to be tomorrow's losers, which means nobody wins over the long term.''\nThe second point, said Dr. Oppenheimer, is the more important one. ''Global warming is a problem that cannot be looked at from the point of view of a few individuals in a few isolated places. We are now one globalized world. If the climate in general is hurting large swatches of humanity, there is no way any particular group that thinks it's benefiting can escape from what is happening in the world as a whole. We are too interconnected for that.\n''For example, it's been projected that declines in agriculture, particularly in low-latitude areas, could create large masses of environmental refugees. The rest of the world will be affected by those movements of human populations.\n''The same thing can happen as a result of sea-level rise. Bangladesh is having terrible problems in this area. It has a population of about 120 million in an area the size of Wisconsin, and there is already border tension between Bangladesh and India. A significant chunk of Bangladesh is projected to go underwater in the next 100 years. Where are those people going to go? There's no room left.''\nIt is possible -- not easy, but possible -- to mount an international effort to cut the emissions of greenhouse gases to an extent that would ward off a global catastrophe. It's possible. But there is not a lot of time left.",

Borosage:\nThe article addresses the International Monetary Fund's mandate with uncommon sense. Foisting First World economic theory on Third World nations is like sending a carpenter to fix your plumbing. You might get results, but don't raise your hopes. These men have never run businesses let alone countries, and to prescribe economic medicine without a knowledge of the patient is as likely to worsen the situation as help.\nWhat is necessary? IMF conditionality needs to emphasize the importance of primary education, basic health care and nutrition, clean water and sanitation. The IMF imposes rigid conditions on less-than-stable governments, and when problems develop it is the uneducated, the disenfranchised, who pay \u2014 with ever deeper poverty, disease and misery. If it's hard to bring everyone up to speed in a country as wealthy as today's America, enjoying the greatest burst of prosperity in history, imagine what it's like in Bangladesh where some regions flood yearly, where classrooms I've seen are filled with a hundred students.\nAccording to a recent report from Harvard University's Center for International Development, Africa's economy would be up to $100 billion richer today if malaria had been conquered three decades ago, but instead this devastating disease is one reason many African nations remain trapped in poverty. Calculate social losses into your ledgers, oh mighty economists of the IMF, then take the necessary steps to handle these problems and put developing nations on the path to a more stable economic and social footing. You won't achieve one without the other.\nD. BRUCE WALKER\nTokyo.",

    "text": "The Star of Bangladesh; In New York, Don't Take 'Indian' Food Too Literally\n2000-04-07T05:00:00.000Z\nFarasath Ali, who owns the Great India restaurant on Second Avenue at East 82nd Street, doesn't come from India. Neither does Mohammed Karim at the Indian Spice House, a definitive Asian grocery store on East Sixth Street. The Spice House anchors a block of restaurants with names like Taj Mahal, Gandhi, Kohinoor and Windows on India.\nIndians do not own any of those either, or any of the rest of the 27 Indian food businesses on that block between First and Second Avenues, or most of those in similar pockets all over New York City (not to mention London).\nBehind such ''Indian'' restaurants, behind such signature ''Indian'' dishes like tandoori chicken and seasoned spinach with cheese, are Bangladeshi owners, Bangladeshi cooks, and probably Bangladeshi waiters and busboys. Over a quarter of a century, Bangladeshis have all but cornered the market in neighborhood ''Indian'' restaurants popular with diners on modest budgets.\n''I'd say 95 percent of New York's Indian restaurants belong to Bangladeshis,'' said Akbar Chowdhury, a daytime manager of Great India.\nBut it doesn't end there. Almost all of those Bangladeshis come from one sliver of Bangladesh: Sylhet, a region of emerald green ricefields and dense tea gardens on the country's eastern border, where the Gangetic plain meets the rugged hills of the isolated Indian Northeast and Myanmar.\nSo why not Windows on Bangladesh or the Great Bangladesh restaurant?\nFor the Bangladeshi immigrants who came to New York for a fresh start, the choice of names was both a matter of marketing and a bit of insecurity. Among the nations encompassed in the vast Indian subcontinent, only India became the stuff of romance: the pink palaces, the Taj Mahal, the caparisoned elephants. As for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, their images became negative ones: wars, unbelievable natural catastrophes, poverty on a grand scale. Bangladeshis remember with pain how long they were known as Asia's ''basket case.''\n''We give our restaurants Indian names,'' the Bangladeshi manager of another Indian restaurant said, ''because people in America know about India, and maybe they wouldn't come if we said we were from Bangladesh.''\nWhile true epicures would scoff at the thought that the foods of South Asia were similar enough to be interchangeable, the Bangladeshi restaurateurs who came to New York simply adopted what would be loosely described as North Indian food, heavy on oven-cooked meats and breads, and gave their small restaurants names from India to go along with the recognizable dishes.\nSylhet (pronounced sil-LET) is an area known less for its fine cuisine (although local cooking is considered good) than for its adventurous, inventive people, quick to seize the chance to try something new. When Bangladesh went through a series of political upheavals -- the end of British India in 1947, a spell as East Pakistan, followed by a battle against West Pakistan for independence in 1971 -- many Sylhetis took off for Britain, especially London, in search of stability and work.\n''Eventually they ended up opening restaurants,'' said Shamsher Wadud, the owner of Nirvana, an upscale penthouse restaurant on Central Park South. ''And then in the early 1970's, gradually more people from Sylhet were coming to New York. They saw the opportunities in America. They thought they'd do well because they did well in England.''\nTheir timing seemed perfect. Not only were they able to capitalize on the changing appetites of native New Yorkers, but also the yearnings for familiar food of South Asians, who began settling in New York in greater numbers in the 1970's and 1980's.\nOn East Sixth Street, Hussain Ahmed, owns the Sonargaow restaurant, which advertises ''exotic Indian'' food and is a favorite of students from New York University. He said that his kitchen could prepare a range of subcontinental dishes taking in tastes from Afghanistan across Pakistan and India to his own lush, tropical homeland, where fish and rice dishes prevail. Sonargaow serves North Indian food cooked in tandoor ovens, but adds choices of brook trout and shellfish to the standard chicken, then ladles on the fragrant sauces.\n''There were a lot of Indians living here with no eating places,'' said Mr. Ahmed, who saw Indian customers as his main market when he arrived in 1974. But as the clientele broadened, the seasoning inevitably changed.\n''We cook a little different than we would in Sylhet, without the hot spice,'' he said. ''But of course if anyone wants the spice we can add it. Every single spice is now available in New York and we can cook every dish without imports.''\nMr. Wadud of Nirvana has his roots in Bangladesh, too. ''But I'm not from Sylhet; I'm from Dhaka,'' he said, and much of his own experience was different from that of the immigrant Sylheti restaurateurs in the city's less glamorous neighborhoods. Born in Dhaka, then an imperial British city and now the Bangladeshi capital, he was the son of a college professor from Calcutta whose family owned a hotel there called the Biltmore.\nMr. Wadud first came to New York in the late 1960's as a 16-year-old American Field Service exchange student and was assigned to a comfortable home in Fairfield, Conn., and ''parents'' -- Elroy and Claire Blair -- who showed him New York, including an Indian restaurant called Kashmir on West 45th Street. Its owner was a Bangladeshi, naturally.\nYoung Shamsher was underwhelmed by both the kitchen and the service. ''Not humble, like in Bangladesh,'' he said of the waiters. An idea occurred to him: He could do better. A few years later he was back in this country, abandoning plans for a technical education to learn the rudiments of American-style customer service. In his early 20's, he opened his first Nirvana in 1970, a little place on Lexington Avenue and 81st Street.\n''In the 1970's, people were not that familiar with Indian food,'' Mr. Wadud said. There were a few ''hole in the wall'' places, he recalled, and a few splashy corporate-owned restaurants, now gone because, he said, they lacked the personal touch.\nThe present, larger Nirvana opened within a year with a private party for George Harrison of the Beatles and Ravi Shankar, the Indian musician, to celebrate a film they had made together. Big names never stopped coming. Early this year, Salman Rushdie, who rarely dines out, came for dinner.\nBut however different his means, Mr. Wadud's instincts were the same as those of the immigrant Bangladeshis who arrived with less money and attracted no stars for friends, and had only their Sylheti connection. As time passed the Bangladeshis, virtually all Muslims who speak a national version of Bengali they call Bangla, were joined in the restaurant business by a few South Indian Tamils specializing in vegetarian dishes, who now figure in the culinary mix of the Little India along Lexington Avenue in the upper 20's.\nA heady mix it can be. The New Madras Palace, on Lexington between 27th and 28th Streets, is owned by Indian Muslims but is vegetarian (and thus acceptable to Hindus) as well as kosher. The manager, Abdul Rahman, said that Hindu or Muslim, it was all the same to him when it came to cooking hot South Indian food.\nShashi Tharoor, an Indian writer who is Secretary General Kofi Annan's communications director at the United Nations, has kept an eye on the South Asian restaurant scene for a few years. He has noticed that even when Bangladeshis do not own the place, they are probably working as waiters. He has also noticed that in the last decade or so, wealthier Indian Punjabis have got into Manhattan's South Asian restaurant mix and created the more expensive Midtown places specializing in pure North Indian food -- the Bukhara Grill, Diwan and Jewel of India among them. But that is another story.\nAnyway, Muslims have traditionally been the Indian subcontinent's cooks, said Burhan Ahmed, Hussain Ahmed's brother and his partner at Sonargaow. The predominant religion in India is Hinduism, ''and Hindus don't want to handle the meat,'' he explained.\nThe Sonargaow, with its Bengali name, is one of a very few places to advertise its ethnic roots. The name was not hard to choose, said Hussain Ahmed, as he surveyed East Sixth Street.\n''Sonargaow means a golden village,'' he said. ''And this village is a village of gold.''",

    "text": "Split Over Bangladeshi Event Believed to Prompt Threats\n2000-08-04T05:00:00.000Z\nFor almost all of New York's handful of Bengali-language newspapers, Tuesday was a harrowing day involving the city police, the postal police, F.B.I. agents, hazardous materials experts and, for some, showers in tents set up outside their evacuated offices. Yesterday, they were left wondering what the fuss had been about.\nThe excitement came after five Bangladeshi-American newspapers, one in Manhattan and the rest in Queens, and one cultural organization, also in Queens, received envelopes containing threatening letters and a mysterious brown or white powder, prompting an investigation by the city's joint task force on terrorism, which includes police officers and federal agents.\nAs best Abu Taher, the executive editor of Weekly Bangla Patrika, could remember, the letter he received began ''Fobana Alert: Take the sweet taste of nerve gas.''\nFobana, which stands for Federation of Bangladeshi Associations of North America, is the name of an annual Bangladeshi convention to be held in New York on Labor Day weekend.\nKowshik Ahmed, the editor of The Weekly Bangalee , said an employee had opened a similar letter and placed it in another envelope. Shortly afterward, he arrived in the office and got a call from the police. They asked him if he had received a suspicious letter, and when he said yes, they told him to drop it on the floor and leave the building.\nNo one who came into contact with the powder was injured or became ill, said James Margolin, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He said the powder was being analyzed at a lab. But, he said, sending the letters could have been a criminal act no matter what the powder contained, and no matter what the intention of the sender.\n''The use of the federal mail to transmit a threat is illegal whether the threat is terrorist or not,'' Mr. Margolin said.\nMr. Taher said he had no idea what could have prompted the threats. But he and others who received the letters suspected that they had less to do with the machinations of international terrorists, and more to do with a controversy within the Bangladeshi-American community over Fobana 2000.\nThe annual convention, which includes seminars and cultural events by artists from Bangladesh, has long been troubled by splits and factions. This year, there will be three Fobanas.\nThe squabbling over who has the rights to the official Fobana began last year, when two Fobanas were held in Atlanta. One convention designated a Bangladeshi organization in Toronto to be the host of this year's Fobana, which it plans to do. Then, the other convention designated a New York organization to handle this year's convention. Two organizations are claiming that honor. One will hold Fobana 2000 at the Pier 92 convention center on Sept. 1, 2, and 3. The other will hold Fobana 2000 at Madison Square Garden the same weekend. The organizers of both conventions said they believed the letters were connected to the dueling conventions. Both condemned the threats.\n''It is a very sad thing such a nasty thing can happen,'' said Shelley A. Mubdi, the organizer of the Pier 92 convention. ''It shocks us. I have a hunch why it is happening.''\nMr. Mubdi went on to explain that the Atlanta convention had designated his organization, the Bangla Desh League of America, to be the host of this year's Fobana. But because he was not present, another New Yorker, Saidur Rab, the owner of The Weekly Thikana, had accepted on his behalf. Then, according to Mr. Mubdi, Mr. Rab incorporated his own organization, the Bangladesh League of America, New York, and proceeded to organize his own convention.\nMr. Rab said he had been involved in his organization for 17 years. But according to state records, his organization was not incorporated until after the Atlanta convention, while Mr. Mubdi's was incorporated in 1947. He added that most of the newspapers that received the letters, except Mr. Taher's, were sponsors of his convention.\nMuhammad Alam, a staff reporter at The Weekly Bangladesh in Jamaica, Queens, which did not receive a letter, said the fight over the biggest convention in a small community -- there are an estimated 200,000 Bangladeshi-Americans in New York -- was one of egos, not politics or ideology.\n''There is some ego problem in people,'' he said. ''That's terrible.''",

    "text": "Partnerships Can Stand Up to Natural Disasters\n2000-02-04T05:00:00.000Z\nNatural disasters have become recurring events for the world's poorest countries. There have been floods in Venezuela and Bangladesh, cyclones in India and Vietnam, earthquakes in Turkey, Greece, Taiwan and Armenia, plus hurricanes Mitch, Andrew, Georges and Joan in Central America and the Caribbean, and the ravages of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a from Peru to East Asia.\nJust as the emergency response stage of one catastrophe winds up, another earthquake, cyclone or hurricane hits. Disasters killed more than 60,000 people in 1999. Many more lost homes and livelihoods and are still rebuilding months later, as the global community's attention shifts elsewhere.\nIn every disaster the poor suffer most. Most of the more than 18,000 people killed in the Aug. 17 earthquake in Turkey were poor. In Venezuela, where the toll includes up to 50,000 dead and 200,000 homeless, the victims are mostly poor. Many were swept away in a sea of mud.\nDonors and humanitarian agencies spring into action; individuals reach into their pockets with every new disaster. But how many of these losses could have been prevented? How many lives could have been saved?\nCyclones and earthquakes will always occur. While we need strong, effective emergency management, we also need to look at other ways to put disaster prevention and mitigation at the forefront of development work.\nPrevention and mitigation measures are needed to reduce the impact on the poor and thus provide a better chance of breaking out of the poverty cycle.\nWe must strengthen construction codes and make sure that the poor are not forced to build flimsy shelters on deforested hillsides.\nGovernments need to set up emergency response systems, with trained personnel to implement them.\nInsurance and reinsurance companies should work with developing countries to transfer disaster risk to capital markets by using \"catastrophe bonds\" and weather-indexed insurance derivatives.\nIn Central America, after Hurricane Mitch, governments and development agencies have been working to set up emergency warning and response systems, improve building codes and their enforcement, and identify environmental measures that would reduce the impact of natural disasters.\nA similar joint effort is under way in the small states of the Caribbean, to protect power systems, roads and other vital services, improve emergency management and increase the involvement of the private insurance industry in sharing disaster-related risks.\nOn the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia, for example, most government buildings are not insured. When hurricanes strike and schools and offices are destroyed, people have no choice but to pick up the pieces and rebuild them. We must break this cycle.\nWhile considerable resources are mobilized to respond to disasters, none of us can adequately address the severe problem of disasters on our own. We can only succeed in partnership with others in the development community, including civil society and the private sector.\nSo we are proud to announce the birth of just such a partnership: the ProVention Consortium, which has been launched in Washington this week. With partners such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the United Nations, Goldman Sachs, the World Conservation Union and two leading insurance companies, Munich Rae and Swiss Rae, the new global alliance will form a dynamic coalition with governments to help them take charge in identifying and reducing the risks they face.\nThe consortium will form a coalition with communities to mobilize grassroots support to promote disaster preparedness and mitigation. It will join forces with the private sector, which can raise awareness of risks and promote prevention, advance emergency planning and risk financing.\nThe consortium will promote examples of best practice, such as a recent World Bank reconstruction loan to Turkey that included measures to update and enforce building codes. Poor quality construction was responsible for many of the lives lost during the devastating Marmara earthquake in August. The reconstruction program will introduce better planning for land use, require compulsory insurance for housing, and help upgrade Turkey's emergency response management.\nThe ProVention Consortium has a straightforward and achievable goal: to reduce the losses caused by natural and technological disasters in developing countries. By doing so, we will be contributing greatly to the fight against poverty, and the struggle for equality and security for all.\nThe message is simple. Together, we can do it. Certainly hazards exist and disasters will continue to occur, but we have the technological and institutional capacity to identify and prevent many disasters, and ease the impact of most.\nMr. Anthony is prime minister of Saint Lucia. Ms. Kreimer is manager of the World Bank's Disaster Management Facility in Washington.

    "text": "THE PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE: THE OVERVIEW; Clinton Moves to Give Northeast Aid With Fuel Oil\n2000-02-17T05:00:00.000Z\nPresident Clinton today pledged even more money for Northeasterners grappling with the soaring cost of home heating oil, even as he acknowledged that federal heating assistance funds may not be adequate to help low-income families endure the winter.\nAlso today, at a meeting with consumer groups and industry leaders in Boston, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the federal government had been caught by surprise by the heating oil problem. ''We were caught napping,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''We got complacent.''\nIn his first news conference of the year, Mr. Clinton touched on the political campaigns of his wife and his vice president, and he left the door open to a visit next month to Pakistan, a nation in the middle of a domestic crisis and a nuclear standoff with India.\nBut Mr. Clinton focused much of his attention on the big increase in heating oil prices, saying he would order that the remaining $125 million in a Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program be made immediately available -- on top of $200 million already released -- and would seek from Congress $600 million in additional emergency funds for states hardest hit by the cold.\n''Over the last seven years, we've stood to help the victims of earthquakes in California, of the farm crisis and a 500-year flood in the Middle West,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Now the families in the Northeast need our help, too, and we must act.''\nAlong with the funding increases, Mr. Clinton also called on the states to liberalize the income limits so more families could receive the federal aid.\nMr. Clinton stopped short of ordering any release of oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, even though a growing chorus of officials in the Northeast have urged that the oil be put on the market to depress prices. But the president said he had not ruled out tapping into the emergency reserve later.\nMr. Clinton fielded 20 questions in an hour. He insisted he did not want to involve himself in either the presidential race or his wife's run for senator from New York, but he could not help himself.\nAsked how it felt to be used as a rhetorical punching bag by Republican presidential candidates, Mr. Clinton said he was not surprised that the Republicans were eager to attack him personally.\n''They can't run against the longest economic expansion in history, or the lowest crime rate in 30 years, or the lowest welfare rolls in 30 years,'' he said, ticking off his familiar litany of statistics and expressing ''sympathy'' for the position the Republicans found themselves in.\nOn foreign policy, Mr. Clinton held out the possibility that he would extend a trip to India and Bangladesh next month to include a stop in Pakistan -- a move that would put him at the center of a tense nuclear standoff. Mr. Clinton had originally hoped to visit both India and Pakistan, but the military coup in Islamabad led to the conclusion that he could not appear to be giving legitimacy to military leaders who had overthrown a democratically elected government.\nBehind the scenes, the administration has told the Pakistanis that if they want Mr. Clinton to visit -- a trip the Secret Service has insisted ought to last only a few hours -- they must set a timetable for a return to democratic elections and some steps toward curbing terrorism.\n''I will make a decision about whether to go based on what I think will best serve the long-term interests in nonproliferation and trying to stop, particularly, a nuclear arms race,'' Mr. Clinton said today. ''The very real danger that a conflict between India and Pakistan not contained is one of the most significant security threats to the interest of the United States in this new century.''\nMr. Clinton said the United States would step in to act as a mediator in the territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, but only if both countries asked. ''Unless we are asked by both parties to help,'' he said, ''we can't get involved.''\nMr. Clinton also pressed Congress to move quickly on granting China permanent trading status with the United States, under the deal struck late last year to permit China into the World Trade Organization. For the last two decades Congress has extended that trading status year-by-year and used the run-up to those votes to highlight Chinese human rights violations, trade barriers to American goods and military threats to Taiwan.\nBut the debate has become an empty one. Each year Congress has given in to overwhelming pressure from American businesses, which say they would lose billions if the trade status is not extended. Under the World Trade Organization's rules, Congress would no longer have a choice. It could not keep China on a year-by-year string, constantly threatening to yank its trading privileges.\nMr. Clinton tried today, as he has in private meetings this week with members of Congress, to make a broader case. ''This is a huge national security issue,'' he said.\n''This trade agreement offers no increased access to the American markets by China, but gives us dramatically increased access to their markets. Moreover, it means we can get access to their markets without having to transfer technology or agree to do manufacturing in their country.''\nNonetheless, American officials say they expect that, as a practical matter, China will continue to get technology and more American manufacturing presence.\nOn the domestic front, Mr. Clinton repeated his call for Congressional action on gun control legislation this year and said he saw no reason for the federal government to follow the state of Illinois in calling a temporary halt to executions.\nAlso, by providing more heating oil money, Mr. Clinton sought to dampen the growing calls for more expansive action. Those pushing for a release of some of the country's oil reserves include members of both parties. One is Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Hillary Rodham Clinton's rival in the New York Senate race, who has been running television commercials on the issue.\nImmediately after the president's announcement, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, criticized Mr. Clinton's action for not going far enough.\n''This will help the one million New Yorkers who benefit from this program,'' Mr. Schumer said.\nBut he added that dispensing more money from the oil fund ''will not provide long-term relief for the price hikes that we are seeing in heating oil bills and will soon see at the gas pump.''",

    "text": "Ideas & Trends; Doomsday, Schmoomsday. After Y2K, a Cosmic Yawn.\n2000-05-14T05:00:00.000Z\nMILLENARIANS, mark your calendars. Wednesday, May 17, may be the last chance for the destruction of planet Earth.\nLet's face it. Y2K was a bust. For all the headaches caused by computers choking on the double zeros of the new century, civilization remained stubbornly intact. The millennial leap year on Feb. 29 was also supposed to create computer havoc. But that too was a disappointment, as was May 5, when Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn lined up with the Moon and Sun, promising, for the scientifically impaired, calamitous gravitational effects on Earth.\nWith the Year 2000 almost half over, the opportunities for a millennial end time are narrowing. In fact, the last big chance may come this Wednesday, when there will be another planetary alignment. This time the Sun and five planets (but not the Moon) will form an even tighter grouping than they did earlier in the month.\nIf anything calamitous does happen, it will not be explainable by physics. For one thing these alignments are far from exact: next week's is really a clustering within a 19-degree arc of the sky. But even a perfect alignment would be no cause for alarm. Gravity weakens so rapidly with distance that the tug exerted on Earth by all nine planets is vastly less than that of the Moon. And in this month's celestial events, the planets are lining up on the far side of the sun.\n''With the planets on the opposite side of the Sun,'' reassured a NASA Web site (nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/\nplanetary/alignment.html), ''the force from each body will actually be at its absolute minimum.'' And with the Sun in the way, astronomers will not even be treated to a good celestial show.\nThe real action is not in the sky but on the Internet, where a smattering of sites are devoted to the astrological, biblical and monetary possibilities of the nonevent.\nA business called the Survival Center has a Web page, ''Earth Changes Update'' (www.zyz.com/\nsurvivalcenter/echange.html), that warns of earthquakes, tidal waves and winds as intense as 2,000 miles per hour -- perfect conditions for hawking its supply of gasoline generators, solar radios and six-day candles. The site also sells a book titled ''5/5/2000 Ice: The Ultimate Disaster,'' in which the author, Richard Noone, predicted that the alignment would cause the poles to melt, unleashing a flood of Noachian proportions.\nAll this may sound familiar to those who remember ''The Jupiter Effect,'' a 1974 book in which two scientists, John R. Gribbin and Stephen Plagemann, forecast that a planetary alignment in 1982 would upset the Sun, setting off a complex chain of events that would result in a devastating California earthquake. ''There is no question about the implication,'' the authors wrote, evoking the hit tune ''Age of Aquarius'': ''In 1982 'when the Moon is in the Seventh House, and Jupiter aligns with Mars' and with the other seven planets of the Solar System, Los Angeles will be destroyed.''\nThe book was followed by a sequel: ''The Jupiter Effect Reconsidered.''",

    "text": "THEATER; Together, as One, They Live, Work and Perform\n2000-10-22T05:00:00.000Z\nIN every art there are individuals who may not be known to the public at large yet are admired and even emulated by other artists in the same field. One might call them celebrities' celebrities.\nRatan Thiyam (pronounced RAH-tahn TEE-yum), the soft-spoken, 52-year-old director of the Chorus Repertory Theater of Manipur, a state in the remote northeast of India, is one of these. Since the 1970's, he and his company have been staging dramatic spectacles, drawing on Indian literature and iconography, that have attracted the attention of eminent Western directors like Peter Brook, who made a pilgrimage to Manipur when he was preparing his theatrical epic ''The Mahabharata''; Eugenio Barba, and Ariane Mnouchkine.\nBeginning Wednesday, Mr. Thiyam and his Chorus Repertory Theater will present three performances in the Howard Gilman Opera House at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the academy's current Next Wave Festival. The New York debut, the company's final stop on its first American tour, is being co-presented by the Asia Society.\nAmong Mr. Thiyam's longtime champions is Christopher Martin, the founding artistic director of the Classic Stage Company and the founder of ART/NY (Alliance of Resident Theaters). In 1989, Mr. Martin -- now a freelance director, designer and composer working primarily abroad -- first saw a Thiyam production. It was part of a festival of drama in New Delhi.\n''We were knocked over by it,'' Mr. Martin said the other day. ''If you go back and look at Ariane Mnouchkine's Shakespeare productions of the mid-1980's, you'll see that she was highly inspired by what he had done. He is a master of theatrical expressiveness. It's the energy and commitment of the actors. It's phenomenal to see this incredible, disciplined work, completely unified and emotionally grounded. So many other theater acrobatics seem empty inside.''\nPerhaps it is not surprising. As a collective, members of the Chorus Repertory Theater eat, farm, build, and practice traditional as well as Western performing arts together pretty much from sunrise until deep into the evening. The teamwork of their daily lives is reflected in their physical vitality and group precision onstage.\nAt the Kennedy Center in Washington, where the company performed in September, Mr. Thiyam said, audiences were not even aware of at least one aspect of that teamwork: each time the actors made an exit, they would take on another role and become members of the orchestra, which played behind a screen. For the performers, there was no idle time.\nThe program at BAM, as at the Kennedy Center, consists of one work: the 1996 spectacle ''Uttar-Priyadarshi'' (''The Final Beatitude''). The script, in Manipuri, is based on a Hindi poem in blank verse by the 20th-century poet S. H. Vatsyayan, known popularly as Ajneya. (There will be English surtitles during the performances.)\n''Uttar-Priyadarshi'' (pronounced OO-tahr pree-yuh-DAHR-shee) recounts an episode in the life of the second century B.C. emperor Ashoka. He is seen briefly as a child before the story begins with the adult emperor's victorious return home from war. But instead of celebration, he finds keening war widows and accusing monks who prompt him to reflect on the blood he has spilled. As an act of defiance, Ashoka creates a Kingdom of Hell and appoints the hideous Ghor its ruler. Ghor tortures the monks but then turns around and tortures Ashoka, too, forcing the emperor to reconsider the devastation the war has brought his people. In a spiritual transformation, he decides to overcome earthly woe by adopting the eight-fold path of Buddha. The title ''Uttar-Priyadarshi'' literally means ''the later life'' (''Uttar'') of ''one who looks with compassion'' (''Priyadarshi''), and Ashoka was subsequently known as Priyadarshi.\nIn an interview last spring, when Mr. Thiyam was in New York working out details of his company's forthcoming tour, he cautioned against paying too much literal attention to the story. Speaking in precise British-inflected English, he said: ''This is not a piece dependent on a plot. The philosophical idea is much more important.''\nDescribing how he works, he said at the time: ''I do the scenery, paint the props. I make the entire scene. Then I erase it, and the stage is once again blank.'' At that point, he begins work on the next scene.\nThe specific forms of torture he uses to represent Hell -- a garroting chair, a guillotine, a gallows -- were based on research he did of the French Revolution during a trip to France and are part of his effort to appeal to the imaginations of a modern audience. ''The more civilized we become,'' he said dryly, ''the more things we have for creating violence: AK-47's, bullets, more arms.''\nMr. Thiyam said that his concern with violence is also related to the unrest in his home state. Manipur is in an area that at some points borders Myanmar, Bhutan and Bangladesh, and the region has been plagued with ethnic-based insurgencies. Over the years, according to officials and human-rights advocates, there have been widespread human-rights violations by both troops and insurgents.\nMr. Thiyam emphasized, though, that his interest in the theatrical representation of war is wider. ''The same thing happens around the world everywhere,'' he said. ''My concern is with many places where the same thing is going on. I always felt one should try to stop this kind of violence, which is affecting the next generation. As a man of this century, I cannot be isolated by these problems.''\nDespite the gravity of his themes, Mr. Thiyam said he is committed to the play of thought and to the craft that goes into the theater. In the course of ''Uttar-Priyadarshi,'' his troupe recreates a procession of warriors surrounding Ashoka, who is mounted on an elephant; the whirlwind of blood that was the war they fought, and the cosmic image of the Wheel of Time, to which humanity is bound. The props are simple -- a painted shield-form or a scarlet cloth. Although dance steps occasionally surface, the overall result is not dancing but rather highly ceremonial. The show looks like theater, sometimes sounds like a street fight and feels like prayer.\nMr. Thiyam's own training in the theater has a strong Western influence. One of four children born to a pair of dancers, he grew up hating the performing arts, owing to the hardships that his parents' touring caused him as a child. He wanted to be a writer or a painter, not to work in theater, he said, and early on he published several novels, collections of short stories and poetry, all in Manipuri. (The themes of most of his writings concern the complexities of modern life.) However, during his early 20's he enrolled in the National School of Drama in Delhi, where the director, a native of Kuwait, was a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.\nAT drama school, Mr. Thiyam began to fall in love with the theater, studying Western drama and performance techniques, in addition to classical theater and dance traditions from various parts of Asia. After he graduated, he became the director of the school. In 1974, he initiated a two-year selection process for actors for his own company, and in 1976, his team in place, he returned to his native Imphal, the capital of Manipur, to make his dream a reality.\n''When we started this,'' he said, ''I had an idea of running a professional company with productions of high quality. I ran a lot of theater workshops in different areas of Manipur, then asked actors to join. We started with a handful of very good actors because the selection process was done over two years. By the 1980's, we were getting support from the central Indian government but not from the state government. The central government still helps us, but the production costs are getting very high.''\nSince its founding, the company has survived a number of hardships, including several inundating floods that damaged its buildings and land (about 2.75 acres a short distance from the center of Imphal). The collective's members persevered, and today they enjoy a brand-new, 200-seat home theater, designed by Mr. Thiyam and built by the troupe. Although Mr. Thiyam's three teenage children do not participate in the theater, his wife works there as an administrator.\n''The theater is our religion,'' he said, speaking of the collective.''But I am not a messiah for all this work. I share my experience of the good and bad things in this so-called civilized world, where we are losing our spirit and balance. As an individual, I feel I must get control. I share the kind of power games we play, the factors that brew inside me, inside everybody, the way modern man feels in his way of life. Through theater, I try to share it with my audiences, as if to say, 'Let's think together.' ''",

    "text": "ART/ARCHITECTURE; Good Buildings, And Good for You\n2000-04-16T05:00:00.000Z\nTEN Shades of Green,'' the new architecture show at the Urban Center, should not just be seen. It should be enacted into law. All those pols who march on St. Patrick's Day each year would perform a public service by lining up for this Green parade. Especially if non-attendance were construed as a tacit attack on the right to breathe.\nThe subject of the show is sustainable architecture, energy-efficient buildings that reduce air pollutants and cut dependence on fossil fuel. Buildings produce half of all greenhouse gases, the chemicals that are thought to cause global warming. Global warming is an imminent problem, not a distant one. In Great Britain, engineers are designing sea walls to surround nuclear reactors, in anticipation of the day the icecaps melt. In Bangladesh, the flood levels. . . .\nBut it is depressing and probably futile to introduce this compelling show with the sort of alarm bells that Americans long ago learned to tune out. Perhaps it would be more productive to say that ''Ten Shades of Green'' presents the 10 Most Beautiful recent European buildings, that it includes work by Famous Architects and a handful of Hot Young Stars. It includes a miniature village of Fabulous Beach Bungalows for exotic South Pacific living, and an indoor, palm-lined Promenade des Anglais that allows German students to bask in a balmy Riviera climate.\nAll this is true. And it does not distort the message to say that the 10 projects are packed with style. Organized by the Architecture League, with Peter Buchanan as guest curator, the show sets out to demonstrate that environmental priorities are not antagonistic to the highest aesthetic standards, as they are often presumed to be. Personally, I would not think of watching a network TV show about global warming unless Leonardo DiCaprio was the guest host. He knows how important it is to look your best on sinking ships. The projects presented in ''Ten Shades of Green'' may be no more than lifeboats. But they're fine-looking lifeboats, every one.\nSuccess in architecture, as in television, is mainly a matter of getting other people to show up. Green design is concerned as much with the comfort of a building's inhabitants as with the state of the ozone layer. In corporate and commercial buildings, physical and psychological comfort can translate into slower turnover rates and less absenteeism among employees. You may want to move into the Commerzbank headquarters in Frankfurt, Europe's tallest skyscraper, designed by Norman Foster. A three-sided tower with a hollow core, the building features a series of triangular sky gardens that spiral around the building vertically at four-story intervals. Handsomely landscaped and furnished, illuminated with natural light, they are refreshing spaces to gaze upon as well as relaxing oases to visit.\nThe project makes several key points about the design process. Green architecture demands close collaboration between architects and engineers. You don't hire an architect to make a shape and then retain an engineer to prop it up. A building's environmental components are not bolted-on attachments, like off-the-peg solar collectors or windmills on stilts. They are designed for particular climate conditions and client needs. Architecture, accordingly, is not just a decorative skin to be draped over an armature devised by developers and space planners. It is a process of integrating aesthetic, structural, social and environmental factors into an organic whole. The integrity of architecture is the most valuable lesson ''Ten Shades of Green'' has to teach.\n''Energy is pure delight,'' William Blake believed. Energy-efficient buildings can be completely radiant, too. The Beyeler Museum, in Basel, Switzerland, designed by Renzo Piano, has been acclaimed for the classical serenity of its design, but it is also an efficient green machine. Perforated metal panels and a translucent glass roof modulate light in the galleries. They also create a thermal buffer that reduces fluctuations in temperature. The Gotz headquarters in Wurzburg, Germany (Webler und Geissler Architekten), and the Mont-Cenis Training Center in Herne-Sodingen, Germany (Jourda et Perraudin Architectes, and Hegger Hegger Schleiff), are rigorously delightful essays in neo-classical style.\nThe Dutch firm Neutelings Riedijk Architekten holds up the Surrealist shade of green. Its Minnaert Building in Utrecht, which houses a university geophysics department, is a warm, fuzzy structure in which Teletubbies would feel at home. From outside, the laboratory building appears to be molded from Jell-O chocolate pudding, an effect created by spraying the exterior walls with the concrete insulation usually concealed behind them. At the corner entrance, the name is spelled out in giant steel letters that provide structural support.\nThe Minnaert Building is another instance in which architecture is used to aestheticize infrastructure. Rainwater, collected on the roof, drips into a pool in the building's central hall, a dramatic interior with bright red booths for seating carved into drab concrete walls. In summer, the building is cooled by pumping the rainwater onto the roof and letting it circulate through the floors on its way back to the pool. In winter, it is warmed by heat generated by computer equipment in the labs.\nThe Cotton Tree Pilot Housing complex in Queensland, Australia, is the most romantically utopian project on view. It is a mix of private houses and low-income rental units within walking distance of the local beach. These buildings have sand in their shoes. The site plan organizes the units in a series of transitions from public to semi-public to private space. Balconies, windows and a communal garden extend the transitions vertically. Overhanging roofs create shade from the subtropical sun and capture breezes that circulate between walls and through stairwells. The breezes also seem to have a deforming effect on the roofs, which are slightly askew and fitted with tilted drain pipes. The effect lies somewhere between shantytown and Club Mediterranee.\nThe most utopian aspect of this project is its atmosphere of social and spatial informality. It picks up on the direction in which American architects were headed in the postwar years, when California's Case Study Houses, designed by Charles and Ray Eames and others, wove spare, modern design into the West Coast landscape. Today, Americans are lightening up their office wardrobes but want to live in ponderous remakes of period-style houses. Why should the Australians run away with a style of living that began with Frank Lloyd Wright?\nRemember the long lines of cars at gas stations in the 70's? Even with the latest round of threats from OPEC, many Americans may find it difficult to recall these events. But for Europeans it was a different story. They couldn't afford to forget the high cost of oil dependence. That's why European architects have been practicing energy-efficient design for a generation. Gas guzzling wasn't an option.\nAmericans have allowed themselves two choices: plugging in or checking out; the power grid or the Unabomber shack. Bill McKibben called ours ''The Age of Missing Information'' because the media deprive us of the contact with nature that was once taken for granted. But ''Ten Shades of Green,'' which continues at the Urban Center, 457 Madison Avenue, through May 13, supplies information that could help break down this dichotomy between rural isolation and urban artifice. Whether Americans want to hear it is another matter.\nThe greatest resistance to green design comes from architects themselves. With a few exceptions, like the Croxton Collaborative, architects are unfamiliar with environmental technology and have formed few durable alliances with engineers who practice it. They are in no position to educate their clients, who incorrectly assume that green design must cost more green. All those sky gardens taking up rentable space. Those attractive sun screens requiring constant maintenance. Add high-end design, and the prospect can appear suicidal.\nThings are even worse in architecture schools, where green design is routinely demonized. The epithet ''eco-fascist'' is occasionally heard, usually spoken by academics who fear that their authority will be undermined by exposure to information they haven't bothered to learn. Scholarly papers are devoted to proving that nature is a cultural construct, which no doubt it is. Retribution is often meted out to the frivolous.\nWHAT ''Ten Shades of Green'' makes clear is that sustainable design can help advance the causes many architects have been working toward on a formal and philosophical level. For one thing, green design makes it impossible to equate architecture with building skins. It discourages the practice of mistaking exterior decoration for architecture that deals with wholes. Exterior decoration can be as wonderful as the interior kind, but you can get too much of a bad thing.\nFurther, at a time when many architects are preoccupied by the idea of tradition, green design offers an opportunity to extend historical awareness beyond the use of reassuring images to evoke the past. Throughout history builders have used sophisticated if low-tech methods to control heat, ventilation, light and other factors affecting human comfort. The show includes several residential designs that draw on local vernacular to enhance their quotient of green.\nBut it is on the philosophical plane that the meaning of these 10 projects resides. They should be seen as paths that extend contemporary interest in the interplay between subjective perception and objective reality. Nature, in these buildings, is simultaneously ''out there'' and ''in here.'' It is not held at bay by walls, any more than perception is confined within the membrane of the skin. The metaphoric and material realms merge in this exhibition. It contemplates the physiognomy of breath.",

    "text": "The High Road to Hunza\n2000-04-16T05:00:00.000Z\nWE sat in the Internet cafe of the desert oasis town, mulling over the politics of this Silk Road region. His name was Surkat, and he wanted to make sure that his American guest knew a few things: His people were descendants of Turkic clans who had settled in this arid land 1,200 years ago. They worshiped Allah. Most important, they wanted independence from their Chinese rulers.\nI met Surkat while I was waiting to check my e-mail in Kashgar, one of the most remote cities in western China. The young man had piercing green eyes that revealed his Central Asian lineage. He and his people were Uighur (pronounced wee-gur), the most populous ethnic group in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.\nThey had built Kashgar, which seemed little changed from the days when silk and spice caravans plodded through en route to the Roman Empire. Donkey carts trundled past us in the warm summer night. Thick-bearded men wearing skullcaps and sheathed daggers haggled for melons at dusty roadside stands. Marco Polo apparently witnessed such sights, as did spies and mercenaries engaged in the 19th-century Great Game between Britain and Russia.\nBut Kashgar's aura of timelessness was an illusion. The three Internet cafes near my hotel were an obvious sign of modernity. So was my conversation with Surkat, which revealed how 20th-century politics, particularly the clash between nationalism and ethnic loyalties, had imprinted itself on the hinterlands.\nI should not have been surprised. After all, Kashgar lay at one end of the Karakoram Highway, one of the highest roads in the world and an engineering feat born of modern politics. Built in the 1960's and 70's by thousands of Chinese and Pakistani engineers, the 930-mile road symbolized the close ties between the two nations. More than 400 builders had died carving it out of mountain flanks in this remote corner where peaks in the Pamir, Karakoram and Himalaya ranges soar over 26,000 feet.\nNear the other end of the highway lay Islamabad, capital of Pakistan. The country was created in 1947 when the departing British declared this part of their colony a Muslim nation separate from India. That violent split down the ''line of control'' still reverberates today, as India and Pakistan battle over the mountain state of Kashmir. In consolidating its territory, Pakistan also annexed once-independent kingdoms now divided by the Karakoram Highway.\nDespite fighting in and around Kashmir, I planned to travel last August for two weeks along the highway, catching local buses, jeeps and trucks from Kashgar to Gilgit, a town in northern Pakistan. From there, I would leave the road to head west toward the lawless border with Afghanistan.\nThe journey was one leg of a three-month overland trip I was making from Hong Kong to New Delhi. My motivation was partly to trace the footsteps of my father, who lived in western China for much of the 1950's while serving in the People's Liberation Army. I was producing a documentary film on those years when he embraced Communism under Mao Zedong in hopes of forging a better future for his homeland. (He later became disillusioned with the revolution and left for Hong Kong.)\nShortly before he arrived in Xinjiang, my father said, Chinese and Uighur troops had fought together near the border to repel Russian soldiers. But the people of the region had a long history of bucking Chinese imperial rule. In recent years, Uighur separatists have set off bombs in Beijing, more than 2,000 miles away.\nKashgar certainly felt closer to Istanbul. The yellow-tiled minarets of the Id Kah Mosque dominated the central square, while kebab grillers huddled in the building's shadow. Women draped head to toe in brown cloth drifted like phantoms through the streets. Alleyways led through a sprawling bazaar where blacksmiths hammered away at horseshoes, and merchants sold everything from gold necklaces to dyed silk cloths to dried reptilian carcasses (for medicinal purposes). On Sundays, thousands of people converge in a frenzied market filled with the cacophony of loud bartering and bleating animals.\nAfter witnessing the shopping orgy, three travel companions and I began our journey on the Karakoram Highway. I had met Vanessa, a French expatriate, and Kevin, a British backpacker, in southern China. A friend from home, Dune, was traveling with me for one month. We tied our backpacks to the roof of a bus that ascended to Karakul Lake, nestled high in the Pamirs. Floods had washed away parts of the highway, and our driver was forced onto narrow dirt tracks several times.\nBy the lake, horse-mounted Kirghiz herdsmen led chains of camels across the windswept plateau. The white crown of 24,760-foot-high Muztagata loomed as the backdrop. A family with three children invited all four of us to sleep in their yurt in exchange for $7 and a cheap Walkman that Dune had brought with him. Our hosts boiled salted tea and cooked up a pot of warm noodles. Before climbing under thick blankets that served as her bed, the mother kneeled on a wool rug and prayed facing Mecca as a sharp wind whistled beneath the stars.\nTwo days later, Dune and I said goodbye to Vanessa and Kevin, who decided to stay in China. We caught a Pakistan-bound bus from the one-street Tajik town of Tashkurghan, where Pakistani traders regularly stopped to buy pungent Chinese liquor. The bus passed three military checkpoints and slowly climbed up to the Khunjerab Pass, which at 15,500 feet was high enough to induce altitude sickness. In a local dialect, its name translates to Vale of Blood, a reference to the days when bandits plundered merchant caravans. These days, there was a bit more security: a Pakistani guard with rifle and black beret waved our bus into his homeland.\nWe briefly enjoyed a view of snow-capped peaks that stretched away in every direction. Then we descended from the heights of China to one of the most dramatic gorges in the Indian subcontinent. The highway here had been blasted from the side of a sheer cliff wall. A chasm plunged down to the Hunza River, which churned with glacial melt.\nAt the border post of Sust, we squeezed into a minivan for the ride into the legendary Hunza Valley, where glaciers tumbled to the roadside and farmers tended to their apricot orchards. Myths abound about the origins of the valley's fair-skinned, blue-eyed villagers. The wildest rumors claim they were descendants of a lost branch of Alexander the Great's army, and that they live well past 100 years. Some said that the valley was the inspiration for the mythical Shangri-La in James Hilton's novel ''Lost Horizon.''\nWhile the men wore the muted knee-length shirts and loose trousers common throughout Pakistan, the women sported bright pillbox hats and eschewed the face coverings seen in more conservative villages. They sat on rooftops watching over apricots drying on blankets. Children waved to our van as it sped by.\nWe checked into the austere Batura Inn outside the village of Passu, at the valley's northern mouth. The white building stood on a bank of the Hunza River and across from the serrated cathedral peaks of the brown massif called Tupopdan. Our room was not quite as breathtaking: its bare concrete walls resembled those of a monastic cell, and we had to enter other guests' quarters to use their squat toilets.\nThe inn's owner, Izutullah Baig, told me that he built his lodge in 1974 to house Chinese laborers working on the highway. Ali Qurban, a schoolteacher whom I met in the village, also recalled those days with nostalgia: ''I was just a little boy when they came,'' he said. ''They came to us and said Mao this and Mao that. Mao was great. And I believed them.''\nPassu is known among travelers for its trekking. Our first excursion took Dune and me to overlooks with sweeping vistas of the jagged white ice of Passu and Batura Glaciers. The latter is one of the largest glaciers in the world outside of polar regions, stretching for 35 miles. In 1976, it crept to the edge of the highway and ground up a Chinese-built bridge.\nThe next day, we scrambled over two wooden suspension bridges that crossed high above a roaring river. While we stepped gingerly on the swaying planks, villagers scurried across with bundles of firewood strapped to their backs. The path took us over a ridge and down to the Karakoram Highway, where we spent the night at the Shipsper Inn.\nAs in other budget guest houses throughout the valley, flies buzzed through the spartan rooms. The inn's owner and consummate chef, Azim Shah, proudly declared that he had fought against the Indian army in the state of Punjab in 1965, and in Bangladesh in 1971. Even in the relatively sheltered Hunza Valley, people talked about the ceaseless conflict with India as if it was destiny. Children here played at war by mimicking gunfire and pretending they were mowing down Indian soldiers.\nThe next morning, Dune and I hitched a ride on a brightly painted truck to Karimabad, informal capital of the valley. Houses dotted lush hillsides laced with irrigation channels. From the lofty perch of Baltit Fort, the rulers of Hunza once presided over their domain. Then in 1974, the Pakistan government forced the last ruler of Hunza, called the Mir, to hand over his powers to the modern nation-state, a move that still elicits resentment throughout the valley.\nDune rode down to Lahore to fly back to the United States, and I spent the next two days on a punishing trek up to a lookout called Hon Pass, at 15,000 feet. I camped one night in Ultar Meadow, an amphitheater of peaks where shepherds watched over grazing flocks. At night, avalanches roared down white slopes, rumblings from the ice-lined bellies of mountain gods.\nBeneath blue skies, Hon Pass yielded a panoramic view of the valley. The Hunza River glinted silver in the morning sunlight. Jeeps careered down the highway as it snaked between villages. But it was the pristine white mass of Rakaposhi that dominated views to the south.\nVillagers said the 25,560-feet peak was one of three mountains in northern Pakistan that spirits of the sky had fashioned into their homes. On this morning, wisps of clouds floated across their lairs, shielding them from human eyes. I decided then that that high kingdom would be my final stop in the Hunza Valley.\nThree days later, I concluded that Rakaposhi base camp seemed too glamorous a name for the chilly, wet pasture at the foot of the mountain. There were no international climbing teams. There were no brightly colored expedition tents. There wasn't even a view. Rainclouds had shrouded all the surrounding peaks. The only sight was steaming cow patties along a stream bank.\nWas this the ''truly special place'' that one Australian traveler had told me about? Was this the same mountain that had left me breathless at Hon Pass?\nI had hiked up a grueling 4,900 feet from the village of Minapin only to find a stone hut. A man named Muhammed Ali lived there every summer, renting out tents and cooking meals for climbers.\nWe quickly set up my tent as a light shower started. I lay inside reading V. S. Naipaul and listening to raindrops spattering on the canvas.\nWhen darkness fell, I pulled on a wool hat, gloves and rain jacket and walked over to the hut for dinner. Muhammed was stirring a pot of dal while six other men sat on blankets around a fire, boiling tea and rolling flat loaves of chapati bread. They had been mining for black quartz for several weeks in the mountains.\nOne of the men tried tuning a small radio to a news broadcast. Between the crackling of static, the announcer informed us of the latest fighting near the Indian border. Muhammed leaned over and told me how his 25-year-old brother had recently joined the army to do honor to his country. But less than two months ago, a single bullet struck him in the head during a battle. He was killed instantly, and now only memories and a village plaque remained to tell of his life.\nMuhammed's voice trailed off as he dished out the dal. I finished my dinner in silence, staring at the play of our shadows on the wall. After a last round of tea, the miners curled up in their blankets, and I walked outside to my tent.\nThe landscape had been completely transformed during our meal. The clouds had lifted from Rakaposhi. A full moon hung in the sky, bathing the meadow and the peak in an unearthly silver light. The blue face of the mountain gazed down at me.\nThe world up here seemed to exist entirely apart from the roads and villages of my recent travels. From deserts to mountain terraces, the highways that crisscrossed those lands were forged from human motivations like trade and politics and revolution. No matter how astounding, such paths went on until they arrived, inevitably, at conflict. Above it all, Rakaposhi and its sister mountains bear witness.\nFrom Kashgar to Hunza, on less than $10 a day\nThe Basics\nUnited States citizens need visas to enter China and Pakistan. Travelers may contact the Chinese Consulate in New York at 520 12th Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10036; (212) 330-7410, fax (212) 502-0245, www.nyconsulate. prchina.org, and the Consulate of Pakistan, 12 East 65th Street, New York, N.Y. 10021; (212) 879-5800, fax (212) 517-6987, www.paktrade.org.\nBecause I speak some Mandarin, I found it easy to talk with people in China. My companions managed to get by, even though most Chinese do not speak any English. Those in the tourism industry know at least a minimum.\nIn Pakistan, I found that many people could speak English because they are taught it in school. Those working in tourism speak it quite well.\nThe Karakoram Highway is open during the summer and blocked by snow most of the rest of the year. Even in summer, floods and landslides can close off parts of the highway for weeks. Kashgar is hot but bearable in summer, and the Hunza Valley is cool.\nFood and Lodging\nOn the average, I spent less than $10 a day on food, board and transportation while traveling the Karakoram Highway. The lodgings were mostly budget guest houses, and I ate at street stalls and small restaurants.\nIn Kashgar, I stayed in a dorm room in the Seman Hotel, once the Russian Consulate. In Tashkurghan, I stayed in the basic Ice Mountain Hotel. Budget guest houses with beds for as little as $1 a night are common in villages in the Hunza Valley. These include the Batura Inn and Shipsper Inn in Passu, Old Hunza Inn in Karimabad, the Hoper Hilton Inn in Hoper and the Diran Guest House in Minapin. I did not have any problems getting a bed on the spot (making reservations can be hard because most villages don't have telephones).\nIn Xinjiang, Uighur food consists mostly of hard bread called nan, lamb shish kebabs and pilau, a sweet rice dish. Chinese restaurants can also be found in towns. In Pakistan, flat bread called chapati and fried lentils called dal are the most common dishes. EDWARD WONG",

    "text": "Heater May Have Led to Fire That Killed 2\n2000-01-15T05:00:00.000Z\nA Bangladeshi couple who were trying to keep warm with a portable heater in an apartment where the heat had been turned off were killed yesterday morning in a fire that destroyed the Queens residence, friends and relatives said.\nFire officials said the fire began in the apartment's electric wiring, which may have been overloaded by the extended use of the portable heater.\nThe fire killed Kabir Ahmed, 50, an electrical contractor from Dhaka, Bangladesh, and his wife, Tashima Ahmed, 42. The couple, who were visiting New York, were staying in the Woodside apartment of their daughter, Lufta Bagum. Ms. Bagum, 23, was in critical condition yesterday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.\nFirefighters arrived at the basement apartment at 30-18 Hobart Street at 1:50 a.m., five minutes after the first of several calls from neighbors who had smelled smoke.\nBut the calls had come too late, the officials said.\n''The fire was too advanced by the time people started to smell the smoke,'' said William F. Feehan, the first deputy fire commissioner.\nAccording to city records, the house is owned by Syed M. Haque.\nMrs. Ahmed's brother, Dewam Alam, said the landlord, whom he identified only as ''Haque,'' lives on the top two floors of the house but had turned off the heat before leaving for Bangladesh on Wednesday.\n''It was a terrible thing for those people to shut off the heat,'' said Rana Dutta, 27, a friend who last spoke with the family about an hour and a half before the fire. ''They said they were so cold.''\nMr. Alam said his niece, Ms. Bagum, had come to him Wednesday to borrow his portable heater. ''They came to me two nights ago and took my electrical heater; it was so cold in that basement it was terrible,'' he said.\nMr. Alam said it was at least the second time the landlord had shut off the heat. He said he talked to his niece at 10 p.m. Thursday and said she was enraged about the lack of heat. ''She was planning to move in with me because her parents were concerned,'' he said.\nCarol Abrams, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the department would investigate the landlord. Building owners are required to provide heat for tenants whenever the temperature is below 55 degrees during the day and below 40 degrees at night. Ms. Abrams said there were no records of complaints from the address.\nMrs. Ahmed had been in New York for about two months and was planning to return home in February, said Mr. Alam, who lives in Astoria, Queens. Mr. Ahmed arrived this week and was planning to go home next week, after visiting with his daughter. She works at a cosmetics store and had just secured a loan so she could attend the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, Mr. Alam said.\nMr. Dutta came to the Hobart Street house yesterday with two other friends after he heard about the fire. The heavy smell of the smoke still coated the neighborhood as Mr. Dutta stood in front of the house and vented his anger at the landlord.\nWhen he spoke to Ms. Bagum around midnight Thursday, he said, she had turned on the oven as well as the portable heater, trying to stay warm as the temperature dipped below freezing.\n''They can't get their lives back,'' he said. ''That is the terrible thing.''\nNeighbors said the block filled with smoke early in the morning, creating confusion about where the fire was. One man who lives two doors away said he ran to the apartment door and heard people inside screaming.\n''I tried to break down the door, but I couldn't do it,'' said the man who would give only his first name, Gil. ''They seemed like they were locked inside.''\nMr. Feehan, the deputy fire commissioner, said the door required a key to be unlocked from the inside as well as the outside. Such locks are not illegal but obviously are dangerous in fires, he said.",

    "text": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; I.L.O., Long in Eclipse, Regains Some Prominence\n2000-03-23T05:00:00.000Z\nMarginalized by decades of obscure work and a lack of enforcement power, the International Labor Organization has recently gained some renewed prominence for a possible future role in helping police the way nations protect workers' rights.\nIn the rush of public concern over globalization, the organization, a United Nations specialized agency, has found that its work to promote basic labor rights in all countries is suddenly relevant. Part of the reason is a debate in both the rich and poor nations over whether minimum labor standards can or should be linked to trade.\nAnd unions are pressing for stronger worker protection in global trade pacts, an idea resisted by developing countries.\nThe debate comes as the organization is striving to change under new leadership. The agency is also trying to improve ties to the United States, which once considered it a toothless and irrelevant bureaucracy that ignored Soviet bloc labor violations. Indeed, the I.L.O. has been out of the limelight for so long that scholars may be among the few who recall that it won a Nobel Prize in 1969 for its work on labor injustices.\nJuan Somavia, a Chilean diplomat elected a year ago to run the labor agency, has promised to modernize its bureaucracy -- one so steeped in old ways that a significant part of its staff cannot use a computer.\nAt the same time, the Clinton administration has been giving the agency significant financing for its campaigns against child labor and for basic workers' rights. Last spring, Mr. Clinton became the first American president to address the I.L.O. annual meeting in Geneva.\n''With globalization, its essential mandate has come into prominence,'' said Andrew Samet, the top official in the Labor Department on international labor matters.\nJust a few days ago, the I.L.O. work to curb child labor was underlined as Mr. Clinton visited Bangladesh, a country once notorious for the number of young children toiling in its garment industry. I.L.O. monitors have helped Bangladeshi authorities remove thousands of children from garment sweatshops in recent years, and Mr. Clinton announced $8.6 million in aid to Bangladesh to help expand the effort.\nThe I.L.O. sets guidelines covering areas that include female workers, working hours and migrant workers. Governments, workers and employers have equal voices in how the guidelines are formulated.\nCritics say this structure is ineffective because it relies on consensus among three often-competing groups. ''The I.L.O. may have the competence, but its procedures are a bit cumbersome and slow,'' said Giampiero Alhadeff, head of Solidar, a Brussels-based alliance of nongovernmental organizations associated with the trade union movement.\nMr. Somavia says he wants to update the agency, which has a two-year budget of $481 million. Friendly and energetic, Mr. Somavia walks through the agency's Geneva headquarters and pops unannounced into offices, a contrast with his predecessors' formal style. But he faces a work force of 2,200, with entrenched rights; dismissals are nearly impossible and layoffs are costly.\nIn the labor-standards area, the organization's biggest weakness is a lack of enforcement power. It can examine compliance by its 174 member countries but has no authority to punish violators. A case in point is Myanmar, formerly Burma. Opponents of the government contend it uses 800,000 forced laborers on public works and army projects. Last year, the I.L.O. barred Myanmar from technical assistance and agency meetings. But the country cannot be expelled or fined.\nMr. Somavia, interviewed recently in his office, said penalties were not the point. ''I would not be in agreement that unless you have them, there is nothing you can do,'' he said. Mr. Somavia argued that labor conventions and treaties have an important role. ''When countries ratify such conventions, they become national law and are enforceable in national courts,'' he said.\nThe strength of the I.L.O. is that it ''can mobilize shame against a country,'' said Dan Cunniah of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. But to be effective, he said, the agency needs stronger tools against violators. Proposals to tie I.L.O. standards to trade have been floated over the last few years, but advocates are reluctant to push them too aggressively. They want to avoid alienating developing countries that fear enforcement of labor standards because it would hurt their competitive advantage.\nLabor standards, argued Pakistan's trade negotiator, Munir Akram, are ''a new protectionism'' that threaten to ''bedevil all future trade negotiations.''\nUnder a possible compromise, the I.L.O. and the World Trade Organization, which does have some enforcement power, would share jurisdiction over such labor issues. American officials have urged a joint committee to examine how international trade relates to basic labor standards -- that would mean prohibitions on child labor and forced labor, and the right of workers to form unions and bargain collectively. ''The growing reality,'' Mr. Somavia said, ''is that a global economy needs a social floor and that can be found in the work the I.L.O. has done previously.''",

    "text": "An Immigrant's Legal Enterprise; In Suing Employer, Maid Fights Diplomatic Immunity\n2000-01-12T05:00:00.000Z\nAs a maid for a high-ranking diplomat from Bahrain, Shamela Begum says she was kept a virtual prisoner in a high-rise apartment on Manhattan's East Side. For almost nine months, she was forbidden to go out alone, she says, and forced to work seven-day workweeks for meager wages that she never got to see herself.\nSo about four months ago, Ms. Begum, a mother of three from Bangladesh, illiterate and in many ways ill-prepared for the modern world, made a bold escape. She was on a rare trip outdoors with her employer's wife when, by chance, she heard a sidewalk fruit vendor speaking her native Bengali. As soon as the diplomat and his wife had left town later that day, she slipped out of the apartment, summoned a little boy to show her how the elevator worked and found her way back to the vendor, to whom she poured out her tale. Within days, she managed to get out for good.\nThen, mustering more courage, Ms. Begum took a typically American route to justice: she sued.\nMs. Begum, however, faces a hurdle other ill-paid laborers seeking redress do not face: because her former employer is a diplomat, he is potentially beyond the reach of the American courts.\nIn a rare effort to hold an official of a foreign government accountable to the laws of the United States, Ms. Begum has accused the diplomat who employed her, Mohammed Saleh, and his wife, Khatun, of flagrant state and federal labor law violations. Filed last month in Federal District Court in Manhattan and seeking unspecified damages, the suit also accuses the Salehs of a civil charge of false imprisonment. The most serious charge accuses the couple of keeping Ms. Begum in indentured servitude.\nMs. Begum's lawyers say they are seeking to push the legal envelope. Although diplomats serving in a foreign country are required to abide by the host country's laws, they are immune from legal action, both civil and criminal, according to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\n''Our position,'' said Ms. Begum's lawyer, Chaumtoli Huq of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund in Manhattan, ''is that hiring an employee to clean your house and watch your children is not related to consular functions and should not be immune from federal and state law.''\nTo date, Ms. Begum's accusations are just that; no witness can corroborate her version of events.\nMr. Saleh is second secretary at the Bahraini Mission to the United Nations, in effect the No. 3 official there. He did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment. Several calls placed recently to other officials at the Bahraini Mission in New York and to the Bahraini Embassy in Washington were also not returned.\nLast week, a lawyer for the defendants, David Wohabe, hung up the phone when asked to comment. The defendants have until Jan. 24 to respond to the charges in court.\nBut the lawsuit has already produced results. In Washington, State Department officials, aware of Ms. Begum's claims, said they were preparing a detailed new memorandum spelling out the obligations of United Nations diplomats toward their domestic workers. The department is also drawing up a brochure meant to inform those domestic workers of their rights in this country, officials said.\nMs. Begum's bewildering journey -- as described in interviews and court documents -- began a little more than a year ago in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. The wife of a vegetable vendor, she had never worked outside her home. She had only seen how friends and neighbors went abroad, found work and returned with money to build a house or set up a business of their own.\nIn November 1998, after contacting an employment broker, Ms. Begum, who is in her mid-30's, decided to make the trek herself. Unable to read or write, she pressed her thumbprint on an employment contract that promised a job as a domestic worker in the desert monarchy of Bahrain.\n''I thought maybe I can improve myself if I go abroad,'' she said in rapid-fire Bengali the other day. ''I thought my kids will say, 'My mother sacrificed so I could do something.' ''\nIn Bahrain came the first surprise. Her employer, she said, told her that she would soon be working for his brother in New York. State Department records show that on Dec. 2, 1998, Ms. Begum went to the United States Embassy in Manama, the Bahraini capital, where she was given a visa allowing her to work as a live-in maid for Mr. Saleh. According to an employment contract reviewed by embassy officials, Ms. Begum was to earn minimum wage -- $5.15 an hour -- and to be provided free room and board, State Department officials said.\nThe gross domestic product of Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, is about one-tenth that of Bahrain, an oil-rich hereditary monarchy in the Middle East that has a shortage of laborers.\nMs. Begum arrived in New York on Dec. 13, 1998. That day, Ms. Begum contends, the Salehs took away her passport. Her salary, roughly $100 a month, was sent directly to her husband in Dhaka, she says, adding that she did not get paid for her last two months on the job. Indeed, she says, she had not seen any type of American currency until recently.\nWhen her employers left town, she contends, they left little or no food. On one occasion, she says, Mrs. Saleh struck her with a glass. Ms. Begum, who speaks only Bengali, communicated with her employers in a mix of broken Arabic and Bengali. For many months, her family did not know where she was.\nWorst of all, Ms. Begum said, she was allowed to leave the apartment only three times, accompanied by the Salehs for short walks in the neighborhood. On most days, she stared out the windows of their apartment near the United Nations building. And she wept.\n''Who could I tell? I just cried,'' she said. ''I didn't even feel the wind, see the trees. They wouldn't let me see another human being.''\nThere are nearly 800 migrant domestic workers with special visas allowing them to work for United Nations officials in New York, State Department officials said. Many other workers, government officials say, are brought here illegally.\nMartha Honey of the Institute for Policy Studies, a research organization in Washington that has taken up the cause of domestic workers employed by officials at foreign embassies and international agencies, said it was not uncommon for maids to have their passports taken away, to be barred from contacting friends and to earn salaries of $100 to $400 a month.\nIn recent years, a handful of lawsuits have been filed, seeking back wages and damages, she said. A few have been settled out of court; others have been thrown out because diplomatic immunity was upheld.\nMs. Begum said it was impossible to escape her predicament. She knew no one in New York. She could not read street signs. She had no money. What she had instead was a mounting $1,400 debt for her passage out of Bangladesh -- a daunting sum in that country, where the per capita income is less than $300.\nOn her third and last outing with Mrs. Saleh, to a supermarket one day last August, she overheard a conversation in Bengali among some sidewalk fruit vendors. Mrs. Saleh, she recalled, pressed her not to dawdle. '' 'Quick, quick,' '' Ms. Begum recalls her saying. '' 'America bad. America bad.' ''\nNonetheless, when the Salehs left town later that day, she left the apartment alone for the first time.\nWorking the elevator was the first hurdle. She had never been on one by herself before, and so she stood there as the door repeatedly closed and opened on the same floor. A boy finally helped her get downstairs.\nMs. Begum retraced her steps to the fruit vendor and told him her tale. The vendor contacted Thikana, a Bengali-language weekly newspaper published in Queens. A reporter for the paper contacted a South Asian workers' rights group called Andolan -- the Bengali word for ''movement.''\nOn Aug. 30, a member of Andolan, Nahar Alam, showed up at the Salehs's apartment. At Ms. Alam's request, officers from the 17th Precinct took a complaint alleging false imprisonment.\nBecause the Salehs had diplomatic immunity, they were not arrested, a police spokesman said, though the Police Department made no determination as to whether the case, based on its merits, could be prosecuted.\nState Department officials said recently that they would have sought a waiver of immunity from the government of Bahrain had the police referred the case for prosecution.\n''The State Department's position is to react to cases where prosecutors want to proceed but need a waiver to do so,'' said Robert Moller, minister counselor for the department's Office of Host Country Affairs.\nMs. Begum left the Salehs's apartment for good the day the police came. Now in the country illegally, she has yet to gain control of her destiny, though her circumstances are markedly better. With help from Andolan, she found a job as a live-in maid for a family in Pennsylvania, earning $1,100 a month. It is a luxurious amount by Bangladeshi standards. And while conditions are hardly perfect -- she gets a three-day weekend once a month, for instance -- she can feel her earnings in her own hands. Finally, she says, she feels as if she is working. For now, she does not want to give that up.\n''It doesn't suit me, being here, being away from my children,'' she said, wrapping a polyester scarf around her head and shivering in the crisp winter wind the other day. ''It's just for the money I'm here. Just for the money.''\nHow long she will remain in the United States is unclear. She hopes to return with enough money to set up a small business for her two sons, ages 10 and 15, to run when they are older. She has married off her daughter, now 17 and uneducated like herself. Under no circumstances, she says, will she let her come to the United States to work.",

    "text": "Three Killed by Fire in Queens Automobile Repair Shop\n2000-03-02T05:00:00.000Z\nThree men died early yesterday morning when a fire swept through a Queens automobile repair shop after a work light fell to the floor and smashed, igniting vapors from spilled gasoline, fire officials said.\nThe explosion sent flames racing through the shop, Bangla Motor Repair in Long Island City, trapping two mechanics and a taxi driver who had brought his cab in for work on the engine. The nine other people in the shop when the fire started, at 4:15 a.m., escaped, although two of them suffered serious burns.\n''These guys did not have a chance,'' said Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen. ''When the firefighters arrived, a heavy body of fire was pushing through the opening in the rolled-down gates.''\nThe shop, at 38-02 22nd Street, in an industrial area near the Queensboro Bridge, was particularly popular with cabdrivers because it was open during the night when they often needed a quick repair before completing their shift. But the building had been reduced to a charred shell yesterday morning, as several dozen onlookers and a few of the survivors stood outside, describing how quickly a routine night had turned tragic.\n''I'm the last person to get out alive,'' said Mahmud Ali, 38, a cabdriver who had burns on his neck and hands. Mr. Ali said he had stopped by the garage just a few minutes before the fire to have the oil in his taxi changed. ''It happened so quick,'' he said. ''I never saw a fire like this.''\nFire officials said the blaze started after a mechanic, Mohammed Hassan, 27, removed the fuel pump and fuel filter from a 1998 Ford Crown Victoria taxi, which had been elevated on a hydraulic lift. After gasoline from the engine block spilled onto the floor, a work light that was being used to illuminate the repair crashed on the floor, igniting the vapors, the officials said. The fire quickly spread to about a half-dozen other cars.\nSomeone called 911, but when firefighters from Engine Companies 260 and 261 arrived, about four minutes later, they found the flames, fed by flammable liquids inside the garage, had already reached the roof, officials said. ''There was a heavy volume of flames coming out of both garage doors,'' said Firefighter Steve Cycan.\nMr. Hassan, of Queens, died at the scene, as did another mechanic, Isidoro Feliciano, 54, of Brooklyn, and the cabdriver, Mushdaq Khan, 49, of Queens.\nFriends of Mr. Hassan described him as a hard worker who had arrived in New York from Bangladesh a little over a year ago.\n''He was a very quiet guy and worked six days a week,'' said Mir Kadir, who identified himself as a roommate of Mr. Hassan's. ''He was only off on Fridays and we would go to the mosque together in Astoria.''\nTwo other civilians injured in the fire were taken to the burn unit at Weill Cornell Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. Four firefighters also suffered minor injuries, officials said.",

    "text": "NEW YORKERS & CO.\n2000-12-10T05:00:00.000Z\nBook Chain Finally Finds Its Staten Island Site\nThe Barnes & Noble bookstore chain will open its first outpost on Staten Island Wednesday. The 29,000-square-foot store, at 2245 Richmond Avenue (between Nome and Travis Avenues) in Heartland Village was built on the site of a former Christmas tree vendor's plot.\n''They've been waiting for a prime location for years,'' said Bill Blaber, the store's manager. ''We wanted to make sure we were very central.''\nThe store will carry more than 100,000 titles on two floors, with an emphasis on reference, gardening and children's books. There is also a 200-car parking lot. ''You've got a lot of people who live in Staten Island but work in Manhattan, so you've got that Manhattan mentality,'' Mr. Blaber said, ''and a lot of people who live in Staten Island and work in Staten Island, so you've got that suburban mentality.''\nGreat Big New Store With Lots of Little Nothings\nOne of the world's larger lingerie stores, a Victoria's Secret, opened on Nov. 22 at 1981 Broadway (at 67th Street). The store, which until next month will have an outer covering that makes it look like a giant gift box, has 18,000 square feet of retail space and stocks 60,000 bras and 107,000 pairs of panties.\n''We've been looking at Manhattan for some time, in expansion mode,'' said Monica Mitro, vice president for public relations. ''At that particular corner you've got nice residential neighborhood foot traffic.'' The store occupies the site of a former restaurant, Federico's.\nShadur Nabi, a Bangladeshi immigrant, applied for permission to build a newsstand on the block several months ago, but Victoria's Secret objected. Community Board 7 opposed Mr. Nabi's request and he has since droppped the plan.\nThe store offers an early look at the spring 2001 line, which emphasizes lavender, light green and sheer black silk and satin lingerie. These items will not available at other stores until Jan. 18. AARON DONOVAN",

There are few challenges as important as conserving the world's usable water and supplying clean drinking water and water for irrigation to those who need it. Yet this work is not getting done. Humans are depleting the earth's store of usable water at a rate that will soon threaten our food supply. Poor water management already kills millions of people a year and condemns hundreds of millions to hunger.\nThe technology exists to solve these problems. Providing slums with drinking water and sanitation, for example, is easy to do and a cost-effective way to prevent deaths and disease. But because those who suffer are poor, their access to water is rarely a political priority. There is now an opportunity for progress. More than 100 water ministers from around the world, along with thousands of water experts from villagers to scientists, have gathered in the Netherlands. The conference will be useful if it can persuade governments and the international banks to pay more attention to conservation and fair distribution of water.\nHalf the people in the world have no sanitary way to dispose of human waste, and 1.3 billion do not have safe water to drink. At least four million people die each year of water-related disease, and water-borne diseases account for 90 percent of all infectious disease in the developing world. The United Nations estimates that providing clean water and sanitation for everyone would require an additional $9 billion a year. No other investment would buy more health for less money.\nParadoxically, governments need to begin charging a market price for water based on usage, ending the subsidies so common in the third world. This would do more than spur conservation. Designed to help the poor, subsidies have ended up hurting them. They are so costly that governments do not build pipes into the relatively powerless rural areas or the settlements of poor people that ring most third-world cities. As a result, many slum dwellers must buy their water from itinerant peddlers. Some pay a quarter of their income for water.\nMost of the water humans use goes to crop irrigation. One reason so many people go hungry is that irrigation is a luxury generally reserved for wealthy farmers, consigning poor farmers to unnecessarily low yields. It does not have to be this way. In the last 20 years in Bangladesh, the government, aid agencies and the private sector have drilled millions of shallow tube wells, some for drinking water and some for irrigation. More than a million farmers now use an $8 foot-treadle pump, which allows even the poorest to use the wells for irrigation. These wells and pumps not only have helped the country to become self-sufficient in rice production, but have saved millions of people from disease and death.\nIn other countries, however, many small farmers cannot dig wells deep enough because the water table has been depleted by large landowners with powerful pumps using more water than is naturally replaced. Thirty years from now, the amount of water needed to produce our food will rise by at least half, and may even double. Yet we are already depleting many of the lakes, rivers and aquifers most important for food production, including China's Yellow River, the Nile and the Ganges.\nIn 1980, the U.N. set a goal of safe drinking water for all by 1990. Because of the international prodding, about two billion new people received clean drinking water over the subsequent 14 years. A new commitment is urgently needed to spread these health gains, help poor farmers and conserve the world's precious supply of usable water.",

    "text": "Women Are Defaced by Acid And Bengali Society Is Torn\n2000-06-24T05:00:00.000Z\nThe village elders met under a litchi tree, applying their collective wisdom to put a value on Peyara Begum's grotesquely ruined face.\nThe crime was hideous, they soberly agreed. A young man had become obsessed with her, but she was married and he was turned away. He took his revenge with sulfuric acid, to erase the beauty that had once enchanted him and to empty her life of happiness.\nHer cheeks melted. Her right eye was blinded and hollowed like a crater.\nBut what is done cannot be undone, the elders said. The attacker had been arrested. And his uncle, a respected religious man, had long pressed them to hold a shaleesh -- or informal court -- to mediate between the parties as is the tradition. He was willing to pay the victim's family a reasonable sum to atone for the wrong and buy his nephew's freedom.\nSo when the seven elders met in April, taking an unusually long time, they tried hard to be fair. Some who had seen the horrible disfigurement thought $10,000 a proper settlement. But others wondered aloud: his had been a crime of wild passion. Do a man's emotions go so wild unless a woman has done something improper? To them, $1,000 seemed enough.\nAnd so the arguing went on for three hours.\nIn Bangladesh, such stories have become plentiful. In the 12 months through March 1999, 174 acid attacks were reported. Most often, the culprit is a spurned suitor.\nNo one is sure why this crime occurs here at such a high pace, for this nation is not so different from many others in its poverty or its treatment of women. Inexplicably, some aberrant ripple is moving through the countryside. Nariphokko, a woman's rights group, has kept statistics: 80 attacks in 1996, 117 in 1997, 130 in 1998.\nThe horror for the victim is overwhelming. ''It felt like someone had poured boiling water on me,'' said Bilkis Khatun, a 13-year-old girl attacked as she slept. Her right ear is now only a nub. ''My mother and father rushed in. They thought I was having a bad dream, but when they saw my face burning, they shrieked.''\nSome victims die, but that seems unintended. The purpose of the attackers is to manufacture a living hell, and in that there is most often fulfillment.\nSurvivors are left not only with their deformities but also with the peculiarities of village reckoning. One young woman was forced by her parents to marry her attacker, solving the urgent matter of who would support a woman unwanted as a bride. Another was forbidden to come home until she allowed her husband to take a second wife.\n''The man who did this to me is in jail,'' said Peyara Begum, her eyes behind dark glasses that conceal her worst scars. ''But I am in jail too, and for me there is no door, no escape, nothing.''\nEarly in April, she worried that there would be no justice as well. The crime has a maximum penalty of death, but policemen and prosecutors are often corrupt. Most attackers are never arrested; most of the arrested are never tried. No one has ever been executed.\nFifteen months had passed since the attack. A 20-year-old man, Rakimuddin, who like many here uses only one name, is the accused. Peyara Begum's husband, Afsaruddin, 38, had been forced to bribe prosecutors before they would pursue the case. Medical bills had already left the family destitute. He and his brothers had to sell off their legacy, a parcel of land.\nAnd now, to Peyara Begum's disbelief, the elders were agreeing to a shaleesh, suggesting a bargain could be struck. This was unthinkable, she said. It would seem like forgiveness.\nPeyara Begum's village is Gosarigaon, 40 miles north of Dhaka. Her home is made of tin and mud, in a clearing surrounded by mangoes, banyans and mahogany. Rice paddies reach to the horizon.\nThe most respected man in the area is Moti Master, 74, a former school principal whose stringy white beard goes well with his reputation for wisdom. He had reluctantly decided to intercede; Usually, a shaleesh settles property disputes and petty grievances. Brutal assault is not on its agenda.\nBut Moti Master knew both the families and suggested that each could benefit from a compromise. He said it surprised him when Mr. Afsaruddin -- a quiet, well-liked man who sells cooked rice along the roadside -- responded with uncharacteristic boldness.\n''Haven't you seen my wife's face?'' he said with anger. ''My family has been destroyed. This is not a matter about money.''\nBut one of Mr. Afsaruddin's brothers was more open to settling. He signed a paper for the family, and Moti Master said this was enough to convene the elders. No outcome could be imposed on Mr. Afsaruddin, but Moti Master said he felt confident that Mr. Afsaruddin would respect the decision of his betters.\n''My husband loves me very much,'' Peyara Begum said during these fretful days. ''But he is not a strong man, and I am afraid the influential people can make him agree to a deal.''\nSince the attack, she had returned to the village only once. Her 8-year-old son, Awlad, had been struck with errant splashes of the acid. His burns were on his arm, chest and stomach. The two were living in a house for acid victims recovering from surgery, the rent paid by a charity.\nThere, secreted away, 20 women and the boy shared their common grief, safe from insults and pity. Anger sometimes rose in a chorus. Just once, they said, they would like to ask some man to marry them and then throw acid in his face when he said no. Maybe then the world would understand.\nMost often, though, melancholy and guilt held sway. Bangladesh is an Islamic country, and the victims asked themselves what they had done to offend Allah.\nLearned women from the rights groups of Dhaka are inclined to talk of ''frustrated gender relations,'' reproaching a male-dominated, conservative society where boys and girls are not free to meet and get acquainted. But the disfigured women are more likely to reach quite a different conclusion, saying their nation has grown too permissive and they would have been better off veiled, with their flesh out of sight.\n''Now I believe in strict purdah,'' Peyara Begum said. ''If I had been kept under the veil, Rakim would not have seen me or been able to talk to me. My life would not be ruined.''\nShe told her story.\nMr. Rakimuddin, who lived on the other side of the litchi grove, had been hired to tutor her two sons in their house while Peyara Begum worked outside in the open kitchen, cooking the curry that was used by her husband to flavor the rice at their modest stall.\nAfter several weeks, his interest seemed to shift from his pupils to her. ''He said my husband was a bad match for me, that I was too beautiful for him,'' she said.\nShe complained to her husband. The tutor was fired, but he continued to come around. He professed love, Peyara Begum said. In exasperation, she sent word to the young man's uncle, who is a moulvi -- a religious scholar -- asking him to intervene.\nMr. Rakimuddin received a thrashing by an older brother, say some of his family members. Soon after, he attempted suicide.\nFinally, near sundown on a cool winter night, Mr. Rakimuddin pushed open the door of Peyara Begum's house. He held a cup in his hand, she said. She was sitting at the table with her two sons and a niece. She had begun to stand up when the acid hit her face.\nSuddenly, her skin was searing. She ran outside. She howled for help. By the time Mr. Afsaruddin was summoned, there was a small crowd. He could make no sense of what he saw, he said, with his wife's face ''dripping down her head.''\nThe nearest clinic was 10 miles away. They climbed into a bicycle rickshaw and commanded the man who was pedaling to go fast.\nWhen they reached the clinic, the doctor was dumbfounded. He had never seen such an injury. He did not know what to do. He advised them to go to Dhaka.\nPeyara Begum did not get treatment for two days. There are only eight beds for burn patients in all of Bangladesh, a nation of 128 million, said Dr. S. L. Sen of the Dhaka Medical College Hospital. There are but six plastic surgeons in the country.\nShe has since had six operations: skin grafts, reconstruction of her eyelids. Her sight is gone in one eye and dimmed in the other. Aching is constant. She can tolerate only the slightest heat.\n''Rakim must be punished for what he has done to my life,'' she said firmly.\nBut the young man's uncle, the moulvi Motiullah, had suggested another path to the village elders. His nephew's imprisonment would not remake the woman's face, he said. And even if it could, Mr. Rakimuddin was going to plead not guilty. His conviction was no certainty. . ''A just compensation is best for everyone,'' he argued.\nA shaleesh is not bound by legalisms. There is no set membership. Any interested men can observe it, though decisions are usually left to a smaller group of elders.\nMoti Master presided. The meeting was very odd, he recalled. Neither the jailed man nor the distraught husband was there. ''Afsaruddin's absence was very much felt,'' Moti Master said. ''But I know him very well. He can be talked to. He can be reasoned with.''\nSo the shaleesh was assembled, and after an hour the old man asked seven elders to go sit under the litchi tree and decide about the money. He worried, he said. The judgment might be an unrealistic sum. Mr. Rakimuddin's family was poor. How much could they pay?\nIndeed, the appointed jury was concerned about the same thing. When some of them suggested that 500,000 taka -- about $10,000 -- was a fit penalty, others scoffed. Few people around Gosarigaon could raise that much cash.\nThose on the other extreme, who thought $1,000 a fair payment, also raised the question of improprieties: maybe Peyara Begum had flirted with the young tutor?\n''We thought there might have been some kind of relationship between the two,'' said Khander Abdul Mannan, who led the meeting of the seven. ''We didn't know, but we assumed: perhaps this, perhaps that. We thought Peyara might be partly responsible.''\nHaggling ensued. The high end dropped to $4,000, the low moved up to $2,000.\nThe lesser amount seemed about to prevail when someone mentioned the couple's son, Awlad. His face had escaped injury, but his body had been scarred.\n''Why had this little child been made to suffer?'' Mr. Mannan said. ''Peyara Begum may have shared in the blame but not this boy. We were shocked and angry at this.''\nThey finally agreed on appropriate reparations: $3,000.\nThe process had taken up an entire afternoon, and the members of the shaleesh were satisfied that they had done the right thing.\nBut Mr. Afsaruddin -- that bony and meek seller of cooked rice -- would not consent. He would not turn against his wife.\nAnwar Ali is president of the market where Mr. Afsaruddin has his food stall. Mr. Ali is a prominent man. He attended Afsaruddin and Peyara's wedding and considers himself their friend. But unlike them, he had thought that deferring to the shaleesh was a smart choice.\n''I urged him very hard to take the money,'' Mr. Ali recalled later, sitting on a bench in the ramshackle market. ''Afsaruddin acted like I was crazy. 'What are you talking?' he said. 'Have you seen my wife's face? Have you seen my son?' ''\nMr. Ali paused a few seconds as he reflected on that conversation.\n''I was a little ashamed of myself,'' he said.",

    "text": "POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT; For Islam, A Big Step In Trenton\n2000-06-25T05:00:00.000Z\nAs the owner of a slaughterhouse in Paterson, Ibrahim Batca knows the innards of the meat business as thoroughly as he knows the dietary edicts of the Koran. Now he has learned a triumphant lesson in state politics as well.\n About two weeks New Jersey became the first state to pass a bill -- proposed by Assemblyman Alfred Steele and State Senator John Girgenti, both Passaic County Democrats who have cultivated a relationship with their district's burgeoning Muslim community -- that protects Islamic consumers of food products against fraud.\n''I have been dreaming of this for a long time,'' said Mr. Batca, a Turkish immigrant, who teamed up with Riza Dagli, a 33-year-old lawyer, and others in the Muslim community and urged Mr. Steele to seek the legislation.\n In the Islamic tradition, for food to be halal, Arabic for lawful -- or roughly the equivalent of kosher regulations -- it should contain no pork products. For meat to be halal, the animals must be slaughtered manually by slitting the throat with a knife. The butcher must be Muslim and recite a short prayer during the slaughter. \n Halal products, which tend to more expensive than the supermarket variety, are offered by only a handful of slaughterhouses in the state. Other halal operations -- most of them fly-by-night -- are said to cut costs by passing off non-halal meat as halal.\n ''We have too much cheating going on in halal,'' said Mr. Batca. ''Vendors and middlemen, they label 'halal' and they just sell anything.''\n The legislation -- which is awaiting Governor Whitman's signature -- piggybacks on the state's existing legislation regulating the preparation of kosher food. Gene Herman, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, said, ''Generally the governor supports this type of legislation.''\n If the bill is signed into law halal food retailers, especially meat sellers, will be open to inspections and possible fines by the state's Consumer Affairs division if they falsely represent non-halal items as halal.\n ''I think it is fantastic,'' said Dr. Mohammad Munir Chaudry, who runs the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America based in Chicago, which certifies halal products nationwide.\n The passage of this bill is another indication that the Muslim community is becoming a more visible part of the state's cultural mosaic and wielding more political leverage. There are an estimated six million Muslims in the United States, and New Jersey is a popular entry point for many of them. While there are no official counts, Dr. M. A. Q Siddiqui, president of the state's chapter of the American Muslim Alliance, a nonpartisan group, said there were an estimated 400,000 Muslims in the state.\n Roughly half the state's Muslim population comprises native Muslims, who are mostly African-Americans, and the other half is a patchwork of immigrant groups from South Asia, the Middle East, Russia, Turkey, Indonesia and other far-flung corners of the Islamic world. Dr. Siddiqui said the influx began in the 1960's and accelerated in the last decade.\n Nabil Abbassi, 38, a second-generation Palestinian-American and president of the Islamic Center of Passaic County, the state's largest mosque, said he remembered when there was only one mosque in North Jersey when he was growing up. Today, the center is one of 54 mosques in the state and one of 11 in Paterson alone. Nowadays, Mr. Abassi said, more than 1,000 people attend Friday services.\n ''Fifteen years ago, I don't think anyone thought much about halal,'' said Mark Herr, director of the state's Division of Consumer Affairs, which will be responsible for regulating the industry. \n But today, no one needed to prove that Muslims had become a significant constituency, and the measure was unanimously approved in both chambers.\n ''The Muslim community was protecting its belief,'' said Scott Carlson, a spokesman for Senator Girgenti. ''It was just a matter of making that known to the legislature.''\n Until recently, the barriers of language and education as well as an old-world fear of an often-oppressive state had prevented many Muslims from exercising their rights.\n ''The language I speak and the language they speak in the legislature is different,'' said Mr. Batca. ''I have not been educated in the United States. What I know how to do is meat.''\n Among younger Muslims, ethnic and national differences have given way to a more pan-Islamic sense of identity. Most of the mosques and civic organizations have historically served specific communities -- Turkish, Bangladeshi, African-American -- with services held in those languages. But newer groups operating in the Paterson area are bringing together Muslims of different nationalities, sects and ethnicities.\n Sohail Mohammad, an Indian-American lawyer who helped in drafting the legislation, and attends Friday prayers at the Islamic Center, says he prefers the diverse groups that the center attracts.\n As a member of the younger generation, one of Mr. Abbassi's main responsibilities as president of the center is to retain the faithful while integrating them into the community at large.\n In Paterson alone, there are halal Chinese restaurants and pizzerias, and 11 halal butcher shops.\n ''It is the Mecca of North Jersey,'' said Mr. Batca who moved there in 1989.\n Indeed, in February the local chapter of the American Muslim Alliance successfully pushed for a holiday in Paterson's schools -- the first in the state -- on Eid-al-Adha, which marks the end of the hajj pilgrimage.\n Last month, residents elected Aslon Goow, Paterson's first Muslim councilman. Mayor Will Kubofcik, along with other elected officials, frequently attends Ramadan dinners and other Muslim civic and religious events.\n With the passage of the halal bill, many Muslims now hope that local supermarkets will feature special sections for halal food only, said Yousef Khost, president of the local chapter of the American Muslim Alliance.\n Farhan Pervez, a Pakistani-American who is secretary of the Central Jersey chapter of the Islamic Circle of North America, an organization affiliated with more than 50 mosques in the state, said other communities were following Paterson's lead.\n In Piscataway, where Mr Pervez works, Eid-al-Fitr -- the end of Ramadan -- is now a school holiday. It has been a holiday in Paterson for seven years. Local leaders like Mr. Mohammad have high hopes that Muslims will become an important voting block.\n ''Muslims, he said, ''could be the next pivotal constituents.''",

    "text": "Nothing Gaudy but Sales Figures; No-Frills Queens Center Outshines Most Luxury Malls\n2000-02-02T05:00:00.000Z\nThere is no marble, no chandeliers, no gourmet food court or Neiman Marcus at the Queens Center Mall, an aging shopping plaza where the landscaping consists of fake ficus trees and the atrium is highlighted with neon lights and a giant plastic Bugs Bunny statue.\nAs for its mauve and beige and windowless exterior, Lorraine O'Neill, the mall's manager, put it bluntly: ''It is ugly.''\nSo why is this cramped, dated mall causing twinges of jealousy among owners of upscale suburban-shopping meccas, places where visitors sip lattes under imported live palm trees and where Bugs Bunny is more likely found on a pricey T-shirt?\nDespite its decidedly no-frills style, the 27-year-old mall in Elmhurst is one of the best-performing in the nation. Sales per square foot there -- about $760 in 1999 -- are more than twice the national average. It even outperformed luxury-oriented centers like Tysons Galleria in suburban Washington, which sold about $680 per square foot in 1999 at stores including Versace and Max Mara, a spokeswoman for the mall owner said.\nThe quiet success of the Elmhurst mall, owned by the Macerich Company, based in Santa Monica, Calif., is a testament to the growing buying power of the surrounding Queens community, a sizable share of which is made up of recent immigrants, who turn to the mall for goods to set up new households or ship back to relatives.\nAs the only large-scale enclosed mall in the borough, it also illustrates the shortage of shopping alternatives for middle-class Queens, a reality that some of the nation's biggest retailers are scrambling to correct.\n''Queens Center clearly does much better than most people realize,'' said William S. Taubman, executive vice president of the Taubman Company, a Macerich competitor. ''Even most people in our industry don't realize it.''\nThe cash registers at Queens Center ring year-round, from the ground-floor Baskin-Robbins, which has the second highest sales of the 250 outlets in the New York region, to the top-floor Children's Place, the top-performing store of the national chain's 293 outlets.\nSales at the two mall anchors -- J. C. Penney and Macy's -- also put these stores among the national chains' top performers, company officials said.\nMuch of its success can be attributed to its location at 90-15 Queens Boulevard: it sits in the middle of a borough of two million residents, atop a subway line and alongside the Long Island Expressway. Macerich's managers have also assembled a mix of retailers -- from Father and Son Shoes to Lechters housewares -- that seem ideally matched to the needs of this particular set of shoppers.\nRetail analysts say that the youthful makeup of the customer base contributes to the mall's high sales. Popular labels like Tommy Hilfiger and Polo Sport sell consistently at shops there, in part because of a desire by many of the community's first-generation Americans to assimilate into their adopted culture, said Malachy Kavanagh, a spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers, based in New York.\n''The mall is a conduit to the American dream,'' Mr. Kavanagh said. ''You might still have a language barrier, but very quickly, if I buy the Levi's jeans, the Michael Jordan sneakers, the Tommy Hilfiger jackets or Polo shirts, I can look like an American.''\nThe frequent travel between native lands and Queens by many of the mall's customers also drives sales, said Paco Underhill, a New York retail consultant who has visited the Queens mall.\n''Queens, almost like Miami, is an acquisition capital of America for goods leaving the country,'' said Mr. Underhill, author of the recent book ''Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping'' (Simon & Schuster). ''People are buying icons of American culture to take them back with them.''\nAll this was evident on a recent evening at Queens Center, which buzzed with shoppers even after the holiday frenzy. Customers packed the Victoria's Secret store, feverishly grabbing for sale items. Employees at Baskin-Robbins could not scoop ice cream fast enough for a steady flow of customers. Upstairs at Macy's, shoppers lined up at the housewares registers, their arms filled with merchandise.\nOne Macy's customer, Paulina Espin, walked out with a toaster oven, pressure cooker and several bowls. She moved to New York City with her family seven months ago from Quito, Ecuador, and has turned to the Queens mall to fill her house with essential goods.\n''I need so many things,'' she said.\nShahzad Azmat of Kew Gardens added about $150 to the mall sales that evening, buying dolls, watches, children's clothing, shirts, perfumes and other goods he and his wife planned to take to their native Pakistan as gifts for family and friends.\nMeanwhile, Alexis Cartagena, 18, a recent graduate of Newtown High School in Elmhurst, was hanging out with his friends and looking for must-have clothes. ''Every day, there is something that looks cool,'' said Mr. Cartagena, who was wearing a Polo shirt, Mecca jeans, Spider cap and Dolomite boots. ''You come here, you see stuff, you want to buy it.''\nThe ethnic diversity at the mall is evident on every floor. Customers lined up in one row of tables at the food court were natives of Guatemala, Korea, El Salvador, Jordan and Bangladesh, as well as Queens.\nAt least 21 languages are spoken at the mall, according to a list kept at the customer service desk, which can arrange translation services.\nOver all, the steady stream of customers generated about $105 million in total sales at the mall last year, not including the anchor stores. That figure is far smaller than those of many giant malls, with the extreme being the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., with its 4.3 miles of storefronts.\nBut on a square-foot basis, sales at Queens Center last year totaled about $760, an increase of $20 a square foot from 1998, when it was already more than twice the national average of $320.\nGarden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J., and King of Prussia Mall in suburban Philadelphia, in comparison, each listed about $470 per square foot of sales in the recent tally by the Directory of Major Malls, an industry publication.\nExceptional retail sales in Queens are not limited to the mall. Home Depot has three outlets in the borough, two of which are open 24 hours a day. All three stores -- in Long Island City, Flushing and Ozone Park -- rank among the top 10 in performance in the 913-unit chain.\nRetailers nationwide have noticed all the money being made. A result is a flurry of blueprints that should soon mean lots of new shopping options for residents of Queens.\nMacerich, the owner of Queens Center Mall, wants to invest about $200 million to double the mall's retail sales area, by building an annex atop a municipal parking lot across the street. The expanded mall is to include skylights, real trees and sit-down restaurants.\nMattone Group, a family-owned developer based in College Point, Queens, intends to build an 18-screen movie theater on top of a second nearby municipal parking lot in Elmhurst. And Forest City Ratner, based in Cleveland, wants to add a new floor to the Stern's store nearby after the department store closes to accommodate a Target store, other retail space and another multiplex movie theater.\n''The pent-up demand is so strong,'' said John E. Simley, a spokesman for Home Depot, which intends to open its fourth Queens store, on Woodhaven Boulevard, in mid-February and is already planning a fifth, in College Point. ''It is not like suddenly two million people moved to Queens. I guess it was just overlooked for some time.''\nSome Queens residents are concerned that the building plans are too ambitious. Community Board 4 in Corona recently voted to oppose the construction of the new movie theaters planned for one of the municipal parking lots next to the mall.\n''You already have gridlock traffic every day, even on weekends,'' said Rose Rothschild, district manager for Community Board 4. ''Imagine if they all get approval. It is going to make a big mess.''\nBut borough leaders -- noting that they are committed to ensuring that the construction does not overwhelm Queens -- said they have long been waiting for respect from retailers that the borough deserves.\n''There are precious few places in Queens where you can shop and get a wide variety,'' said Borough President Claire Shulman, who often shops at Queens Center Mall. ''Big retailers have suddenly discovered us, and now they are making out like gangbusters. It is about time.''",

    "text": "NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BENDING ELBOWS; Chemical Bonding With Martini Formulas\n2000-10-01T05:00:00.000Z\nIn this age of synthetics, it seems that nobody wants to bond.\nNobody knows this better than Kazi Helal, the evening barman at the Chemists' Club, on 45th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas in the Club Quarters Hotel.\nHe is the loneliest mixologist in Midtown, and he can be found in the empty room known as Rumford Hall dressed in a maroon blazer and bow tie, polishing brandy snifters with a slow, methodical purposelessness.\nHis only company most evenings are the pink lofty marble columns and the aging oil portraits of deceased chemists and Nobel laureates. The hall itself is dedicated to Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, an 18th-century British scientist, born in America, who is credited with, among other things, inventing the modern fireplace. A plaque to the wig-wearing Count Rumford refers somewhat opaquely to his being ''Driven . . . hence by neighborly intolerance.''\n''Who knows, maybe Rumford was a big drinker,'' says Mr. Helal, 42. ''But not too many chemists come now. I don't know. Maybe they're tired. Too much mixing. They used to have a very big library. It was very expensive. But they sold it. Nobody cares now.''\nThe club, according to Ronald Stefandl, the president, and Hal Simons, the vice president, was at one time a citadel to the scientist. Until the oil crisis of the 70's, New York was the chemical capital of the world: Mobil, Exxon and Union Carbide were all based here.\nThe old club was at Madison Avenue and 41st Street, and it had a barbershop, a library and 10 floors of rooms where out-of-town chemists kept their shaving kits and their mistresses. Deals were done at the oak.\n''If you got to the bar at 5 minutes after 5, you were three deep,'' remembered Mr. Simons, 81.\nBut the companies consolidated, cut costs and moved away. And the new breed of chemical man is a suburban homebody by nature. Once the Chemists' boasted 2,400 members with a 500-man waiting list. Now there are just 600. They sold the old granite-block building about a decade ago and landed here in the hotel, just off the lobby.\nThe decline, Mr. Helal says, is just the way things work. It is Newton's Third Law of Motion: For every force, there is an equal and opposite force. Or, as he put it, ''What comes up must go down.''\nA busy evening here is perhaps 18 patrons and when it becomes hurly-burly, Mr. Kazi does not lose his cool. His demeanor is always smooth, the martini always dry.\nThe mixologist's recipe:\n3 oz. C2 H5 OH + H2 O @ 32degreesF + 3 olives.\nStir. Do not shake, as turbidity will increase specific heat, thus bruising the compound.\nMr. Helal was born into a Muslim family in Bangladesh. And as a Muslim, he admits that he is technically prohibited from handling alcohol.\nBut there is a rational explanation here. It seems that he is something of a scientist, with a doctorate in boozelogical studies.\n''I mix, therefore I'm a chemist.'' CHARLIE LEDUFF",

    "text": "BY THE BOOK; Exploring Cuisine From India's Spice Coast\n2000-09-13T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE first taste of the coriander chicken on coconut pancakes from Maya Kaimal's new book, ''Savoring the Spice Coast of India'' (Harper Collins, $27.50), evokes a number of responses.\nIs this Thai? Could it really be Indian? Certainly, it is like no Indian food found in restaurants here.\nIt is proof of how little most Americans still know about Indian cooking. Most of the restaurant food and cookbook recipes in America come from northern India and Bangladesh, where the cuisine is marked by lots of meats, tandoori cooking, flatbreads and mild spices. But such a large country, with widely varied climates and a diverse culture, has many regional variations in its cuisine.\nWhich is why Ms. Kaimal's recipes seem exotic. There are egg dishes and crisp pancakes leavened with yeast; coconut chutneys, cucumber salads and brothy curries. Mustard seeds, green chilies, tamarind and curry leaves are used in abundance.\nMs. Kaimal's spice coast is the shoreline along southern and western India, a region called Kerala. It is warm and humid; as in many tropical cuisines, fish and seafood prevail, as do chilies and spices.\nHindus, Muslims and Christians coexist in the region, and each group has its own style of cooking, all represented in this book.\nHindus there, including Ms. Kaimal's family, rely on vegetable curries, rice and legumes. The Syrian Christians are known for appam, or yeast pancakes, steamed fish, fried meats and meat stews. The Muslims' cuisine is more closely tied to the north, with meat curries scented with garam masala and rice casseroles, incorporating local foods like coconut, tamarind, fish and bananas.\nMs. Kaimal, who is American and a cookbook author, began by exploring the cooking of her relatives, then spent time with both Syrian Christian and Muslim cooks.\nFor coconut pancakes, a Syrian Christian recipe, you begin by softening yeast in water, cooking rice flour in a pan and stirring these together with cream of rice, shredded coconut and sugar.\nA few hours later, coconut milk and salt are added, and the delicate batter is fried. A hot nonstick pan, a very thin spatula and patience are needed.\nAlone, the pancakes are fairly bland but, as Ms. Kaimal points out, they are lovely with other dishes. I served them as a base for coriander chicken, a braised dish seasoned with coriander seed, curry leaves, spices, coconut milk and fresh cilantro.\nThe fragrant juices from the chicken soaked into the pancakes, making their nutty flavor come alive and providing a spongy, yeasty bed, much like the Ethiopian bread injera, but with crisp edges.\nTwo warm cucumber salads, both Hindu, were interesting. One, with tomatoes, cumin, green chilies, yogurt and mustard seeds, was tangy and richly spiced. Another, with black-eyed peas, coconut milk and green chilies, was less vibrant, but memorable for its novel, gentle flavors.\nLike many of the dishes, they had daunting ingredient lists, yet took little time to prepare.\nA pudding made with almond paste, milk, sugar and cardamom, and thickened with Cream of Wheat struck the perfect balance between childhood pleasure and adult indulgence. It was delicious.\nAs a guest served this food noted, each dish did what all good Indian food does: it keeps you wanting a little bit more. And a little bit more we all took.\nAt the beginning of the book, Ms. Kaimal judiciously lays out how to plan a southern Indian meal. Most include rice, bread, a legume, two vegetable dishes and a meat dish. Altogether, these would feed six. If you make fewer dishes, you won't have enough. I made a pancake, a meat dish and two vegetable dishes for five and it was just right.\nMs. Kaimal has a strong voice, but it is subdued by a lack of space. This is a slim, tightly edited book -- generally a good thing. As with her food, however, I wanted a little more.\nCORIANDER CHICKEN\nAdapted from ''Savoring the Spice Coast of India''\nTime: 50 minutes\n1/4 cup vegetable oil\n2 cups thinly sliced onion\n2 teaspoons minced garlic\n2 teaspoons minced ginger\n1 teaspoon minced serrano or Thai chili\n10 to 12 fresh curry leaves\n2 tablespoons ground coriander\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1/2 teaspoon cayenne\n1/4 teaspoon turmeric\n1/8 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/8 teaspoon ground cloves\n1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes\n1/2 cup coconut milk\n1/4 cup chopped cilantro, plus additional leaves for garnish.\n1. In a large deep pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Saute onions until edges are nicely browned. Add garlic, ginger, chili and curry leaves and fry for 1 minute.\n2. Stir in coriander, pepper, cayenne, turmeric, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, salt and a few teaspoons of water to prevent spices from sticking. Fry for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.\n3. Add chicken pieces and continue stirring over medium-high heat until the pink color disappears. Add 1/4 cup coconut milk and 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.\n4. Add remaining coconut milk and chopped cilantro, bring just to a boil and remove from heat. Check salt. Garnish with cilantro leaves and serve immediately.\nYield: 4 servings.",

    "text": "Rights and Strong Economies Go Hand-in-Hand, UN Finds\n2000-06-30T05:00:00.000Z\nGENEVA\u2014  Human rights are critical to every country's economy, and are not a reward governments should dole out after economic and social development has been achieved, according to a UN report issued Thursday. \n In its annual survey of how 174 nations stack up in quality-of-life issues, including income, health care, life expectancy and educational levels, the UN Development Program examined for the first time how human rights and human development, particularly in the area of poverty, are related in practice. \n The agency's head, Mark Malloch Brown, said the two sets of rights were \"inextricably linked.\" \n \"They reinforce each other,\" he said. \"To enjoy human rights, you need a strong functioning economy. To get that, every citizen must be involved. Rights make human beings better economic actors.\" \n Poverty, the report points out, is not only income deprivation, it is also lack of dignity, self-respect and the respect of others, which are denials of human rights. Even the highest-scoring countries in this year's survey \u2014 which ranks Canada as the top place in the world to live, followed by Norway and the United States \u2014 have discrepancies in other indicators that show not all citizens enjoy both sets of rights. \n The United States, which has the highest gross national product, ranked first in poverty rates among the 18 wealthiest countries surveyed. Ireland was second and Britain was third in the area of poverty. The key reason for the poor ratings was functional illiteracy, with one person in five unable to read at a fifth-grade level in those countries, the report said. \n Other European countries fared worse in literacy, with Portugal, for example, having nearly one out of every two citizens functionally illiterate. In Poland, nearly 43 percent, and in Hungary, nearly 34 percent were in that category. Those three countries were not ranked in terms of poverty rates. \n The United States also had the largest percentage of people living below the poverty line. In the decade that ended in 1997, the UN Human Development report said, 17.3 percent lived on 50 percent of the median disposable household income. \n The report was issued to coincide with a special UN session in Geneva to review the progress toward eradicating poverty made since a 1995 meeting in Copenhagen. Delegates at the gathering hope to set a new international goal of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015. \n Governments will have to respect human rights and give citizens a voice if the 1.2 billion people now living on less than $1 a day are to leave poverty behind, the report said. India has not had a famine since its independence because its democratic political process has not allowed the government to remain inactive in times of crisis, it said. \n This contrasts with Africa, where some of the worst famines of modern times have occurred, not because of catastrophic declines in food supplies, but because certain groups lost their entitlement to food for various reasons. \n African nations occupy the report's 24 lowest rankings, as they have in the agency's 10 previous reports, as a result of deprivation, poverty, AIDS and conflict. Sierre Leone ranked last on the 174-country Human Development index. \n In North and South America, Haiti was the worst performing country, receiving a ranking of 150. Yemen placed 148th, the lowest of the Middle Eastern countries. For the Asian countries, Bangladesh ranked lowest in the 146th place. \n The annual report warned that the 100 multiparty democracies set up over the past two decades were not all responsive to their citizens. Elections every few years are \"not sufficient to secure the kind of participatory democracy which will successfully contribute to human development and the reduction of poverty,\" Mr. Brown said. \n Gender bias also knocked many countries down in the rankings. Canada slipped to 8th place, the United States fell to 13th, and Japan fell to 41st place in the \"gender empowerment measure\" that looks at the position of women relative to men. ",

    "text": "MEANWHILE : If the Protesters Meant It, Here's What They'd Do\n2000-04-21T05:00:00.000Z\nThe recent demonstrations against the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund raise some intriguing questions. Once upon a time, the Soviet Union directed many such campaigns. Indians lapped them up, not necessarily to irritate the United States but because we are suckers for lofty idealistic causes.\nBut who organized the anti-World Trade Organization protests in Seattle last December? Who provided the inspiration and support for Mobilization for Global Justice, which took to the streets of Washington in recent days to demand the abolition of multilateral financial institutions?\nDo they really represent the interests of the poor and the developing world?\nThis is not to say that some criticism of the World Bank, the IMF, the free market and global capitalism is not justified. Like the United Nations Security Council, the Bretton Woods system reflects the balance of power at the end of World War II.\nThe increased movement of information, goods, capital and people \u2014 globalization, in short \u2014 benefits most those who already have the funds and expertise to take advantage of opportunity.\nFor instance, the migration of Indian software engineers helps the United States more than it helps India. But talented Indians who emigrate do so because it helps them first and foremost. To cite America's gain to prevent them from going would be like cutting off India's nose to spite its face.\nWe also see now that in the longer term India profits from a large pool of successful ethnic Indians in the United States. Globalization is not, therefore, a one-way street.\nIf the Washington protesters had really represented Third World interests, they would have acknowledged this and demanded the removal of restrictions on human movement.\nThey would have called for equal wages, expanded debt relief and more private sector participation in rescue packages.\nThey might have supported Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir bin Mohamad, in seeking curbs on speculative money.\nThey might also have asked the rich countries to live up to the aid target of 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product, and they might have insisted on increased access to Western markets for Third World goods.\nAll this would have challenged the developed nations, perhaps forcing a positive response. Instead, the protesters damaged the case for reform by echoing the clever-sounding but facile charge that trickle-down economics is like feeding horses oatmeal so that sparrows can feed on their dung. Does piety prefer that the sparrows starve?\nThe present economic system is like democracy, which is the worst form of government until you consider the alternatives. If the World Bank and the IMF do not lend money, who will? If exports are not to be encouraged, how will poorer countries ever earn their keep?\nThe dramatic success in East Asia of the export-oriented model of growth is in marked contrast to countries that rejected the free market.\nIndia, which made an indigenous car in the 1940s, 20 years before South Korea, now has a per capita gross national product of $310 compared with South Korea's $6,489. Such statistics are heartbreaking for an Indian.\nBut the Seattle and Washington militants did not seem to want a free market at all. What then did they want?\nA newspaper photograph of a protester, a long-haired semi-nude Caucasian youth of sturdy physique (doubtless the result of good food and healthy upbringing) who was wearing only a designer skirt of palm leaves, mocked the reality of a village in Bangladesh or Fiji.\nAre these champions of the Third World then the peacenik cohorts of the white mercenaries who fought for \"justice\" and \"freedom\" in Africa not so many years ago?\nThe writer, a former editor of The Statesman in India, contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]",

    "text": "Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n2000-09-24T05:00:00.000Z\nIt was breakfast time, and the food stand in the village in northeastern Thailand was crowded. Maesubin Sisoipha, the middle-aged woman cooking the food, was friendly, her portions large and the price right. For the equivalent of about 5 cents, she offered a huge green mango leaf filled with rice, fish paste and fried beetles. It was a hearty breakfast, if one didn't mind the odd antenna left sticking in one's teeth.\nOne of the half-dozen men and women sitting on a bench eating was a sinewy, bare-chested laborer in his late 30's named Mongkol Latlakorn. It was a hot, lazy day, and so we started chatting idly about the food and, eventually, our families. Mongkol mentioned that his daughter, Darin, was 15, and his voice softened as he spoke of her. She was beautiful and smart, and her father's hopes rested on her.\n''Is she in school?'' we asked.\n''Oh, no,'' Mongkol said, his eyes sparkling with amusement. ''She's working in a factory in Bangkok. She's making clothing for export to America.'' He explained that she was paid $2 a day for a nine-hour shift, six days a week.\n''It's dangerous work,'' Mongkol added. ''Twice the needles went right through her hands. But the managers bandaged up her hands, and both times she got better again and went back to work.''\n''How terrible,'' we murmured sympathetically.\nMongkol looked up, puzzled. ''It's good pay,'' he said. ''I hope she can keep that job. There's all this talk about factories closing now, and she said there are rumors that her factory might close. I hope that doesn't happen. I don't know what she would do then.''\nHe was not, of course, indifferent to his daughter's suffering; he simply had a different perspective from ours -- not only when it came to food but also when it came to what constituted desirable work.\nNothing captures the difference in mind-set between East and West more than attitudes toward sweatshops. Nike and other American companies have been hammered in the Western press over the last decade for producing shoes, toys and other products in grim little factories with dismal conditions. Protests against sweatshops and the dark forces of globalization that they seem to represent have become common at meetings of the World Bank and the World Trade Organization and, this month, at a World Economic Forum in Australia, livening up the scene for Olympic athletes arriving for the competition. Yet sweatshops that seem brutal from the vantage point of an American sitting in his living room can appear tantalizing to a Thai laborer getting by on beetles.\nFourteen years ago, we moved to Asia and began reporting there. Like most Westerners, we arrived in the region outraged at sweatshops. In time, though, we came to accept the view supported by most Asians: that the campaign against sweatshops risks harming the very people it is intended to help. For beneath their grime, sweatshops are a clear sign of the industrial revolution that is beginning to reshape Asia.\nThis is not to praise sweatshops. Some managers are brutal in the way they house workers in firetraps, expose children to dangerous chemicals, deny bathroom breaks, demand sexual favors, force people to work double shifts or dismiss anyone who tries to organize a union. Agitation for improved safety conditions can be helpful, just as it was in 19th-century Europe. But Asian workers would be aghast at the idea of American consumers boycotting certain toys or clothing in protest. The simplest way to help the poorest Asians would be to buy more from sweatshops, not less.\nOn our first extended trip to China, in 1987, we traveled to the Pearl River delta in the south of the country. There we visited several factories, including one in the boomtown of Dongguan, where about 100 female workers sat at workbenches stitching together bits of leather to make purses for a Hong Kong company. We chatted with several women as their fingers flew over their work and asked about their hours.\n''I start at about 6:30, after breakfast, and go until about 7 p.m.,'' explained one shy teenage girl. ''We break for lunch, and I take half an hour off then.''\n''You do this six days a week?''\n''Oh, no. Every day.''\n''Seven days a week?''\n''Yes.'' She laughed at our surprise. ''But then I take a week or two off at Chinese New Year to go back to my village.''\nThe others we talked to all seemed to regard it as a plus that the factory allowed them to work long hours. Indeed, some had sought out this factory precisely because it offered them the chance to earn more.\n''It's actually pretty annoying how hard they want to work,'' said the factory manager, a Hong Kong man. ''It means we have to worry about security and have a supervisor around almost constantly.''\nIt sounded pretty dreadful, and it was. We and other journalists wrote about the problems of child labor and oppressive conditions in both China and South Korea. But, looking back, our worries were excessive. Those sweatshops tended to generate the wealth to solve the problems they created. If Americans had reacted to the horror stories in the 1980's by curbing imports of those sweatshop products, then neither southern China nor South Korea would have registered as much progress as they have today.\nThe truth is, those grim factories in Dongguan and the rest of southern China contributed to a remarkable explosion of wealth. In the years since our first conversations there, we've returned many times to Dongguan and the surrounding towns and seen the transformation. Wages have risen from about $50 a month to $250 a month or more today. Factory conditions have improved as businesses have scrambled to attract and keep the best laborers. A private housing market has emerged, and video arcades and computer schools have opened to cater to workers with rising incomes. A hint of a middle class has appeared -- as has China's closest thing to a Western-style independent newspaper, Southern Weekend.\nPartly because of these tens of thousands of sweatshops, China's economy has become one of the hottest in the world. Indeed, if China's 30 provinces were counted as individual countries, then the 20 fastest-\ngrowing countries in the world between 1978 and 1995 would all have been Chinese. When Britain launched the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century, it took 58 years for per capita output to double. In China, per capita output has been doubling every 10 years.\nIn fact, the most vibrant parts of Asia are nearly all in what might be called the Sweatshop Belt, from China and South Korea to Malaysia, Indonesia and even Bangladesh and India. Today these sweatshop countries control about one-quarter of the global economy. As the industrial revolution spreads through China and India, there are good reasons to think that Asia will continue to pick up speed. Some World Bank forecasts show Asia's share of global gross domestic product rising to 55 to 60 percent by about 2025 -- roughly the West's share at its peak half a century ago. The sweatshops have helped lay the groundwork for a historic economic realignment that is putting Asia back on its feet. Countries are rebounding from the economic crisis of 1997-98 and the sweatshops -- seen by Westerners as evidence of moribund economies -- actually reflect an industrial revolution that is raising living standards in the East.\nOf course, it may sound silly to say that sweatshops offer a route to prosperity, when wages in the poorest countries are sometimes less than $1 a day. Still, for an impoverished Indonesian or Bangladeshi woman with a handful of kids who would otherwise drop out of school and risk dying of mundane diseases like diarrhea, $1 or $2 a day can be a life-transforming wage.\nThis was made abundantly clear in Cambodia, when we met a 40-year-old woman named Nhem Yen, who told us why she moved to an area with particularly lethal malaria. ''We needed to eat,'' she said. ''And here there is wood, so we thought we could cut it and sell it.''\nBut then Nhem Yen's daughter and son-in-law both died of malaria, leaving her with two grandchildren and five children of her own. With just one mosquito net, she had to choose which children would sleep protected and which would sleep exposed.\nIn Cambodia, a large mosquito net costs $5. If there had been a sweatshop in the area, however harsh or dangerous, Nhem Yen would have leapt at the chance to work in it, to earn enough to buy a net big enough to cover all her children.\nFor all the misery they can engender, sweatshops at least offer a precarious escape from the poverty that is the developing world's greatest problem. Over the past 50 years, countries like India resisted foreign exploitation, while countries that started at a similar economic level -- like Taiwan and South Korea -- accepted sweatshops as the price of development. Today there can be no doubt about which approach worked better. Taiwan and South Korea are modern countries with low rates of infant mortality and high levels of education; in contrast, every year 3.1 million Indian children die before the age of 5, mostly from diseases of poverty like diarrhea.\nThe effect of American pressure on sweatshops is complicated. While it clearly improves conditions at factories that produce branded merchandise for companies like Nike, it also raises labor costs across the board. That encourages less well established companies to mechanize and to reduce the number of employees needed. The upshot is to help people who currently have jobs in Nike plants but to risk jobs for others. The only thing a country like Cambodia has to offer is terribly cheap wages; if companies are scolded for paying those wages, they will shift their manufacturing to marginally richer areas like Malaysia or Mexico.\nSweatshop monitors do have a useful role. They can compel factories to improve safety. They can also call attention to the impact of sweatshops on the environment. The greatest downside of industrialization is not exploitation of workers but toxic air and water. In Asia each year, three million people die from the effects of pollution. The factories springing up throughout the region are far more likely to kill people through the chemicals they expel than through terrible working conditions.\nBy focusing on these issues, by working closely with organizations and news media in foreign countries, sweatshops can be improved. But refusing to buy sweatshop products risks making Americans feel good while harming those we are trying to help. As a Chinese proverb goes, ''First comes the bitterness, then there is sweetness and wealth and honor for 10,000 years.''",

    "text": "ART/ARCHITECTURE; How Historic Sites Can Matter in the Here and Now\n2000-12-10T05:00:00.000Z\nI WANT to know,'' Siaoying Beng asked, ''how can a person who is homesick learn to live in the new country?'' \n Ms. Beng, 34, a recent immigrant from China, was in the right place to get advice: a class co-sponsored by the Lower East Side Tenement Museum and University Settlement that draws on history to teach not just English but also life skills. ''It definitely gets better,'' her teacher Althea Davidson, a Jamaican immigrant, assured Ms. Beng. ''When I first came here, I hated this country. It's dirty, people walked too fast, and no one pays attention to you.''\nStudents in Ms. Davidson's class, most of them from Asia or Latin America, read letters, diaries and oral histories to discover similar reactions by earlier immigrants. Their homework includes researching social services available to immigrants today and using that information to aid family and friends.\n Every student is ''a future community leader'' who is ''changing what the experience is going to be for the immigrants who come after them,'' said Liz Sevcenko, the museum's vice president of programs.\n The Tenement Museum, which preserves and interprets several immigrant apartments at 97 Orchard Street in Manhattan, has been a pioneer in using history to promote social change -- a radical departure from the traditional celebratory role of America's historic sites. Last year, the museum's president, Ruth J. Abram, said that she, not unlike Ms. Beng, was feeling lonely on behalf of the museum and in need of support. So she sent out a call to historic sites around the world, asking if any of them shared common goals and wanted to band together.\n They did, and last Friday, the group they formed -- the International Coalition of Historic Site Museums of Conscience, a trailblazing organization whose nine members include the Gulag Museum in Russia, the District Six Museum in South Africa, the Terezin Memorial in the Czech Republic, the Slave House in Senegal and this country's own National Park Service -- celebrated its first anniversary.\n It has been a year of networking, collaborations and planning for a future that will likely include a joint Web site, expanded programming and, the coalition hopes, growing membership.\n ''We want to wake people up,'' Ms. Abram said. ''The reason we've come together is to really change the role of historic sites from one of passive history-telling to places of engagement for citizenship. So many museums are frightened that they're going to be the objects of great criticism if they take on any contemporary issues. One of the roles of the coalition is to create enough of a buzz to say to all those shrinking-violet curators: 'Don't worry, it's not going to undermine the mission of the museum. It's going to make it better.' ''\n Sponsored by grants from the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations and the Trust for Mutual Understanding, the organization held its first meeting a year ago this month in Bellagio, Italy. The representatives of historic sites who attended emerged with a manifesto, which declared in part: ''We hold in common the belief that it is the obligation of historic sites to assist the public in drawing connections between the history of our site and its contemporary implications. We view stimulating dialogue on pressing social issues and promoting humanitarian and democratic values as our primary function.'' \n In this country, where women, American Indians, African-Americans and other minorities are still struggling to have their contributions included in interpretations of historic sites, the idea of courting yet more controversy by poking into contemporary issues is not necessarily enticing. \n Within the National Park Service, only the Women's Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls, N.Y., has so far signed on to the International Coalition's mission, said Marie Rust, the Park Service's Northeast regional director. A few others -- including Manzanar National Historic Site in California, an internment camp for Japanese-Americans in World War II -- have also expressed interest.\n But Diane Dayson, superintendent of the Park Service's Statue of Liberty National Monument, which includes the Ellis Island Museum, said she has her hands full interpreting the past. ''Our controversy is based on the history surrounding Ellis Island,'' said Ms. Dayson. ''Here our charge is to enhance the existing story.'' In 1998, she said, her response to a brouhaha over an exhibition called ''America's Concentration Camps'' was to bring Japanese-American and Jewish groups together for a dialogue.\n But even museums that deal with darker episodes in human history may not want to push too hard on contemporary issues. Ken Gorbey, project director of the Jewish Museum Berlin, scheduled to open next September, said he is not convinced that museums should be in the business of advancing specific social goals. ''It's a very interesting question: How far do you get involved in social engineering? I don't think museums are the right sort of places to actually pump for a particular message,'' he said. ''I think museums are much better at touching peoples' experiences and getting them thinking more.'' \n Within the coalition, participating sites are far from homogeneous. Two -- the Workhouse in England and Project to Remember in Argentina -- are not yet finished. Financed by the private National Trust, the Workhouse, in rural Southwell, will open in the spring of 2002 with exhibits that tie Britain's 19th-century treatment of poverty to contemporary policies.\n The Argentine project, supported by an alliance of human rights organizations, is seeking to commemorate the reign of terror between 1974 and 1983 by turning a former naval school -- used by the military as a secret detention and torture center -- into a museum. The project is also planning an oral history archive in conjunction with the University of Buenos Aires. \n The other sites cover a variety of issues, including genocide (the Liberation War Museum in Bangladesh) and the evils of the slave trade (the Slave House). And they draw different lessons from the past.\n Ms. Rust said her organization's goal was to encourage dialogue. ''We should never presume to dictate any social position or philosophy,'' she told a panel at a meeting of the American Association of Museums in Baltimore in May. The session was part of a tour of the United States involving eight of the nine coalition members. (Only Terezin, the site of a former Nazi concentration camp about 50 miles from Prague, was not represented.) The tour included museum visits, news conferences and meetings with human rights groups.\n Sandra Prosalendis, director of the District Six Museum, which commemorates the forced removal of 70,000 people classified as nonwhite from Cape Town, said her museum was part of an effort at national reconciliation. In addition to housing a preschool center, a shelter for homeless girls and an archive for oral history, it has a large floor map, which she said ''has become a theater for the healing of memories.''\n The Gulag Museum at Perm 36 in Russia also emphasizes reconciliation, in part by holding joint reunions of former prisoners and former guards. Olga Ziryanova, the museum's liaison to the coalition, said that Sergei Kovalev, a human rights activist and deputy of the State Duma, had attended such a reunion and greeted his former guard, Ivan Kukushkin. \n MORE hard-edged in its attitude is the Liberation War Museum in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which on Dec. 1 opened an exhibition displaying human remains from what the director, Akku Chowdhury, calls ''the genocide in 1971 committed by the Pakistani Army,'' an atrocity for which the Pakistani government has denied responsibility. At an excavation site in Dhaka, the museum wants public money to construct a Memorial Park and International Research Center on Genocide.\n Argentina's internal divisions are reflected in the aims of the Project to Remember. ''We are trying to create a museum at the same time that strong issues about truth and justice'' are still being debated, said Patricia Valdez, a project representative. ''We are aware that, in our country, we have victims and we have perpetrators. And it is not the goal of the museum to reconcile the country.'' Instead, she said, the museum will tell the story of ''human rights violations and the resistance of the human rights movement and the society as a whole to this dictatorship.''\n Meanwhile, the Tenement Museum is working on projects like Net Worth, an educational program focusing on class-based bias, and Tenement Inspectors, which will train children to act as housing inspectors. The museum is also preparing a sweatshop exhibition, which will be linked to today's garment industry. \n Its Lower East Side Community Preservation Program is helping St. Augustine's Episcopal Church research two ''slave galleries'' -- an undertaking that suggests just how blurry the lessons of history can sometimes be. Hidden rooms above the church balcony date from the church's construction, in 1828, a year after the abolition of slavery in New York.\n Ms. Sevcenko said the rooms could have housed slaves brought in from other states, indentured servants or free blacks. Even if the name is a misnomer, the project represents an ''incredible opportunity to raise the question of what does freedom mean,'' she said. ''What's the difference between legal freedom and freedom in social customs and institutions, and in architecture?''\n But the Rev. Edgar W. Hopper, the church deacon and a descendant of Staten Island slaves, said he was convinced that the gallery was what its name indicates: a holding pen for slaves whose masters were attending services.\n ''Because they passed a law freeing the slaves,'' he said, ''that did not necessarily mean that the slaves were freed.''",

    "text": "WHAT'S DOING IN; Singapore\n2000-05-07T05:00:00.000Z\nDon't come to Singapore expecting a laconic equatorial city. Despite blazing heat and humidity year round, Singapore is a digital-age metropolis determined to make its name as a world capital.\nLike the pink bougainvilleas that sprout from every highway planter and the stately angsana trees lining the roads, nothing here is serendipitous, least of all the approach to tourism. As part of what the government calls Tourism 21, Singapore is trying to become a must-see destination, as well as a hub for travelers bound elsewhere in Southeast Asia.\nDelightfully green, safe and efficient, Singapore is a welcome refuge from its more exotic, bewildering neighbors and an impressive tribute to urban planning and immigrant pluck. The city is undergoing a renaissance, from confident new architecture like Kenzo Tange's UE Square near Fort Canning Park, to meticulously restored historic districts, with avant-garde clubs, quaint cafes and hip restaurants. Shopping is a perennial Singapore pastime, but June brings a cultural spectacle: the Singapore Arts Festival.\nThe way to appreciate Singapore is to go behind its squeaky clean facade to find its cultural and historical kaleidoscope. Singapore is a melting pot of Malays, Indians and an array of Chinese groups with their own languages, among them Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese.\nEvents\nPerformers from all over the world will gather in June for the Singapore Arts Festival, June 1 to 25. Performances are scattered around the city, so for information, call (65) 837-9589, or see artsfest.nac .gov.sg on the Web; for tickets, call Sistic, (65) 348-5555. The festival opens outdoors atop a wooded hill in Fort Canning Park at 7 p.m. on June 1 to 4 with dances from Yunnan Province in China and Uttar Pradesh in India, as well as Vietnamese folk opera, Cambodian chants and South African Zulu rhythms. Tickets are about $8.80, at 1.70 Singapore dollars to the American dollar.\nAt 8 p.m. on June 3 and 4, Hong Kong's Contemporary Dance Company will perform ''Sexing Three Millennia,'' about concubines in China, at the Kallang Theater, near the National Stadium; $13 to $30.50.\nThe Abbey Theater of Ireland will present Hugh Leonard's ''Love in the Title,'' about three generations of women. Shows start at 8 p.m. June 7 and 8 at the Victoria Theater, behind the Raffles Hotel; $13 to $30.50.\nFor choral music enthusiasts, the Tallis Scholars from Britain will preform renditions of medieval English music June 3 at 8 p.m. in Chijmes Hall, a converted Catholic convent chapel at 30 Victoria Street, next to Raffles City. The Scholars switch to Italian Renaissance songs June 4 at 8 p.m. at Victoria Concert Hall, next to Victoria Theater. Tickets for each concert are $13 to $36.50.\nA different kind of cultural event is the Singapore International Dragon Boat Festival, June 3 and 4 in Marina Bay. Twenty-four man crews from 12 countries will race 750 meters for $18,000 in prize money. A good viewing spot is the Marina Promenade on Raffles Avenue.\nThrough October, the Singapore Art Museum, in a beautifully restored former Catholic boys school, is showing ''Imaging the Century,'' an exhibition of paintings tracing Southeast Asia's history -- colonial rule, war and revolution, independence and social change. The museum is at 71 Bras Basah Road, and is open 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., until 9 p.m. Wednesday; closed Monday. Admission, $1.75.\nSightseeing\nSingapore is not dotted with historic temples and monuments as other Asian cities are. But it does have several interesting neighborhoods worth exploring on foot. Go early or late enough to avoid the oppressive midday heat.\nA good place to start is the Merlion, a water-spouting statue of a mythical lionheaded fish. While unspectacular as fountains go, it offers picturesque views near where legend says Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles landed in 1819 to establish Singapore as a British trading port and lend his name to a hotel, a school and a shopping mall, among other places. The Merlion park is open daily 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.\nSouth of the river, away from the high-rise hotels, lies Raffles Place and the heart of the financial district. On Cecil Street, the Stock Exchange sits where there once was a thriving spice market. Just off Telok Ayer Street, Pekin Street has been turned into a pleasant pedestrian promenade leading to Far East Square with a row of newly restored two- and three-story shophouses, built by Chinese immigrants to house their families above their businesses.\nFarther up Telok Ayer is the intricately decorated Thian Hock Keng temple, built in 1840 along what until roughly 1930 was shoreline to honor the queen of heaven and protector of sailors. West of Telok Ayer, on Amoy and Club Streets, are some of the best examples of restored shophouses. This gentrified area's older establishments, like the Dried Goods Guild, now rub elbows with a trendy assortment of bars, restaurants and dot-com companies.\nTo the southwest, on the corner of Maxwell Road and Kadayanallur Street is the modern edifice of Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority. On the second floor, you can see a scale model of the city and the government's vision for it, including a pharaonic new downtown of skyscrapers dwarfing the present skyline and what appears to be a gigantic bowling pin over the city's designated entertainment district around Bugis Junction.\nAlso worth wandering through is Little India, a cluster of shops around Serangoon Road, north of the Colonial district, selling saris, bindis for women's foreheads and booming bhangra CD's. On Sunday evenings, this boisterous area is inundated with laborers from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Visitors may join them at the Veerama Kaliamman Temple and pay their respects to Kali.\nEast of the Rochor Canal, the perfume shops and textile merchants around Arab Street remain picturesque, although business is waning, and Sultan Mosque endures as a serene refuge for the faithful. Stop along North Bridge Road for a murtabak pancake filled with egg and chicken or mutton. Meander down Kandahar Street to find the the dilapidated 160-year-old palace of Singapore's former Malay sultanate, whose descendants were evicted only last year.\nSingapore's zoo is one of the few in Asia to keep animals in natural looking surroundings rather than in cages. Once the sun sets, the zoo offers a Night Safari, with nocturnal animals up and about. The leopards are mesmerizing, but the hands-down highlight is the bat enclosure, which you can enter to test your composure against cat-sized fruit bats inspecting your coiffure. Admission to the zoo, which is open 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., is $6. The Night Safari, 7:30 p.m. to midnight, costs $9.\nSingapore's aquarium, Underwater World, is south of the city on Sentosa Island, which is a little bigger than Central Park and has man-made beaches, golf courses and other attractions. In addition to tidal pools with touchable sea life and a moving sidewalk that takes visitors through tanks of sea life, the aquarium has a new dolphin pool and a shark tank where scuba divers can take a 30-minute guided dive for $55. Open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.; admission is $7.60.\nAnother pleasant diversion is the Jurong Bird Park, west of the city, with its underwater penguin gallery and walk-in tropical aviary. It is open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday, and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends. Admission is $6.\nWhere to Stay\nThe Raffles Hotel, 1 Beach Road, (65) 337-1886, fax (65) 339-7650, opened in 1887, was the birthplace of the Singapore Sling, memorialized in prose by Conrad and Maugham. A makeover in the 80's tidied the hotel but replaced the musky charm of its Writers Bar with something more Martha Stewartish. Its 104 suites start at $380. Information: www.raffles.com.\nLess august but more tranquil is the 50-room Duxton Hotel among the shophouses at 83 Duxton Road, adjacent to Chinatown. Aside from its coziness, the Duxton, (65) 227-7678, fax (65) 227-1232, also has what is reckoned by some to be Singapore's best French restaurant, L'Aigle d'Or. Doubles cost $105; www .duxtonhotels.com.sg\nBudget: High ceilings, lazy fans and wooden banisters lend character to the 24-room Sun Sun Hotel, on Middle Road, near Bugis, (65) 338-4911. Doubles, with shared bath, are $23.50, $26.50 with air-conditioning.\nHotel Bencoolen, 47 Bencoolen Street, (65) 336-0822, fax (65) 336-2250, sparkles from a renovation two years ago and is a short walk from the art museum and the colonial district. There's an outdoor Jacuzzi on the second floor. The 74 rooms start at $49, including breakfast; www.hotelbencoolen.com.sg.\nLuxury: Built in 1900, the 235-room Goodwood Park Hotel, 22 Scotts Road, (65) 737-7411, fax (65) 732-8558, started out as the Teutonia Club and is a short walk from the main shopping district. The decor hasn't changed in 25 years, and its pool, surrounded by turf and white-enamel chaise lounges, is pure Graham Greene. Doubles from $250; www.goodwoodparkhotel.com.sg.\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore, 7 Raffles Avenue, in Marina Square, (65) 337-8888, fax (65) 337-5190, provides superior service and three restaurants. But another attraction is the octagonal windows in each bathroom of the 608 rooms, providing bathing guests views of the downtown skyline. Doubles from $252; www.ritzcarlton.com.\nWhere to Eat\nThe best food in Singapore is also the cheapest. You can eat your fill of something tasty for less than $6 at almost any hawker center or food court. For a good selection of local delights, like Hainanese chicken rice or nasi padang, drop into Lau Pa Sat, an old train station at Robinson Road and Cross Street near the financial district that is now an open-air food court. You can pick and choose from the many stalls there.\nFor crispy roti prata, a savory pancake served with a curry dip, head to the Casuarina Curry House, a small open-air restaurant on Casuarina Road in Ang Mo Kio. No reservations. Lunch or dinner for two costs about $8.\nFor something more elaborate, travel out along the East Coast to the Long Beach Seafood Restaurants, 1018 East Coast Parkway at the Singapore Tennis Center, (65) 445-8833, and 1202 East Coast Parkway, (65) 448-3636. Long Beach claims to have invented black pepper crab, a giant Sri Lankan crustacean suffused with pepper sauce. Equally delicious is Long Beach's chili crab, with its meat-laden piquant sauce. Wear old clothes and roll up your sleeves. Dinner for two with a pitcher of beer is about $60; www.Inesse.com /longbeach/home.html.\nIvins, 396 Alexandra Road in Bukit Merah, (65) 276-3721, specializes in Singapore's unique Peranakan cuisine, an adaptation of Chinese recipes with Malay ingredients. Try the beef rendang, chicken curry or steamed fish. Dinner for two with beers can be had for under $25.\nKomala Villas, 76 Serangoon Road (65) 294-3294, in Little India, serves delicious South Indian vegetarian thalis, and if you come close to finishing, a waiter is lurking not far away to ladle more onto your banana leaf. Dinner for two, $7.",

More than 1,000 of ''the innocents,'' as the Peruvians call them, have been freed, and they are trying to restore their lives. A1\nHope on Camp David Talks\nViolating a White House news blackout at the Camp David summit, President Clinton told the New York Daily News that he was ''more optimistic'' than he had been about the talks.

A10\nQuestioning Polls in Mexico\nMost polls published before Mexico's presidential vote showed the governing party candidate ahead of the man who won. The governing party reportedly pressured the news media not to use polls that showed the challenger leading. A debate is under way in Mexico about whether pollsters erred or whether voters changed their minds.

Bush gave voters a chance for the first time to make a side-by-side comparison as the two sat for hourlong interviews on network television. A14\nUsing an Incumbent's Strategy\nGov. George W. Bush has been taking a low-key approach to campaigning lately. The style and schedule are deliberate, reflecting the campaign's strategic confidence that he can mold his image by carefully choreographing television images in battleground states. It is almost as if he is running a modified version of an incumbent's Rose Garden strategy. A1\nCampaigning on the Water\nVice President Al Gore plans to ply the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes in a boat after the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, campaign officials said. The idea is to take advantage of the momentum that presidential candidates traditionally gain after their conventions. A14\nViolence Surges in Los Angeles\nA new wave of violence and killing has come to south Los Angeles, and people there said they were afraid and baffled by the surge and just as determined to stop it.

A12\nGreen Party Role in Colorado\nThe challenge facing Representative Mark Udall of Colorado mirrors a problem that Vice President Al Gore has encountered in his quest for the presidency: Both could lose the election because of a Green Party candidate siphoning off Democratic votes. In Mr. Gore's case, a strong showing by Ralph Nader could swing an otherwise close election to Gov. George W. Bush. Mr. Udall faces Ron Forthofer, in a district where many Democratic voters feel the party has abandoned them. A14\nNew Bishop Returns Home\nThe Rev.

But executives at most of the English-language stations have been fighting the move.

    "text": "SoHo Journal; Chai and Sympathy at Cabby Central\n2000-05-28T05:00:00.000Z\nMosharaf Sarder was bleeding money as he stepped out of the bathroom and looked around for his fish sandwich.\n''I should charge you one dollar for every minute,'' he said to Maqsood Ahmad, who was standing behind the counter of Lahore Deli. Mr. Ahmad pulled the sandwich out of a microwave and shoved it toward Mr. Sarder.\nThe cabby from Bangladesh ripped into his dinner. Every minute spent in the deli was a minute he could have been getting a fare. For him, time was measured in the shifting display of red digits on his meter.\n''People are out there in Brooklyn, in Queens, in the Bronx,'' he said. It was Saturday night, usually a good time for picking up riders.\n''How did you do tonight?'' asked a cabby who was sipping chai on a vinyl bar stool.\n''I started at 8 o'clock,'' Mr. Sarder said. ''One fare Queens, one fare Brooklyn.''\n''That's it?''\n''That's it!''\n''Now they're comparing what's in their pockets,'' Mr. Ahmad, the deli owner, said to a visitor who was watching the exchange.\nMr. Ahmad has listened in on hundreds of conversations like this. The cabbies have been stopping in since 1995, when he opened the 24-hour deli. They come for the samosas and the dhal, the basmati rice and the cool lhassi drinks. The meat is halal, and nothing costs more than $3. Not even the hundreds of cassettes of Hindi and Urdu pop music stacked against a wall, or the videotapes of dance numbers from those epic-length, Bombay-produced movies called Bollywood musicals.\nAbove the door hangs a hand-painted wooden sign with the deli's name scrawled in red Roman letters and flowing Urdu script. At any time of day, a couple of yellow cabs wait outside on Crosby Street.\nSandwiched between lofts and boutiques, the tiny shop stands across from the Gaseteria at Houston and Broadway, where cabbies hand off their cars during shift changes. Culinary connoisseurs would never mistake its cuisine for that of the Savoy or Balthazar, both down the block. But this is a place that the drivers can call their own, a four-stool joint where a Bollywood video always plays and packets of aspirin are sold at the counter.\n''They all have headaches,'' Mr. Ahmad said. ''They use a lot of painkillers.'' He also sells rolls of meter paper, batteries for cell phones and pagers, and paper towels for wiping windshields -- one-stop shopping for cabbies.\nMr. Ahmad knows that smiles are rare in the taxi business. He worked as a cabby on and off for three years before opening the deli. Driving was tough, but it was better money than the odd jobs he held after moving to New York in 1990 from Lahore, Pakistan: security guard, textile factory worker, newsstand salesman. Then in 1995, his wife joined him in New York and told him that if he opened a deli, she would do the cooking.\n''She makes home-style food,'' Mr. Ahmad said.\nFor Mr. Ahmad, running the deli beats driving a cab. In the taxi business, for every 10 good customers, there was one bad one, he said. Like the man who once told him to run a stop sign because he was in a rush. Mr. Ahmad did so, only to get slammed by another car.\n''Only the good drivers survive,'' he said. ''There's a lot of tension because they have to pay their lease, and a lot of stress from their customers.''\nA driver who had just walked out of the bathroom, his hands dripping water, heard Mr. Ahmad telling this to a visitor.\n''When they are outside the cab, they are polite,'' the driver, Zafar Ali, said. ''When they get in, they think they are the boss.''\nThat was on top of the other headaches, he said. No parking spaces on the street. Fifty-five dollar fines for double parking. No public bathrooms. Mr. Ali pointed over his shoulder, where there was a line six deep just to get into the deli bathroom. It had been like that all night.\nThen there was the recent spate of cabdriver murders. Ten men had already been killed this year.\n''I think about 10 to 15 percent of the drivers have quit their jobs because of the dangerous situation in this city,'' Mr. Ahmad said as he threw chick peas into a blender.\n''I say it is 25 percent,'' said an Indian driver known as Clinton. ''A lot of my friends have gone to limousines.''\n''Yeah, maybe 25 percent,'' Mr. Ahmad said. ''That sounds right.''\nClinton nodded. He shoveled another spoonful of rice and dhal into his mouth. No one here knows his real name. Everyone calls him Clinton because he once had a girlfriend named Monica.\nA particularly catchy Bollywood tune called ''Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'' began playing on the television. It had been the most popular song last summer on the Indian subcontinent. Mr. Sarder finished the last bite of his fish sandwich and stared at the beautiful dancing actors, his thoughts seemingly lost amid the heat and dust of another land.\nThen he hopped off the stool and walked out into the rain-slicked streets of a night that was already half over, a packet of aspirin in his hand.",

    "text": "The World: When Villages Go Global; How a Byte of Knowledge Can Be Dangerous, Too\n2000-04-23T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE prospects seemed bright when the Internet was recently introduced in a remote part of the mountainous Cotopoxi region in Ecuador. Under the guidance of aid workers, Quichua-speaking peasants planned to gather crop information and sell their crafts over the Web.\nSoon, though, it was discovered that some of the men were using the computer to visit pornographic sites.\nDismayed, the women began to question how the men were treating them, and a debate ensued over the common practice of beating women. Although use of the Internet was later curtailed, its introduction unexpectedly generated discussion on a once taboo topic.\nThe changes created by the Internet in rich industrialized nations are well known, affecting everything from how people date to how they work. But less is known about the impact on societies with limited contact with the rest of the world. As such experiments multiply, at least one outcome seems certain: the way people in these communities relate to each other and with the world is likely to be altered forever.\nThe Ecuadorean peasants were a case in point. ''The impact was huge, but as it almost always is when the Internet makes it to such a community, quite surprising,'' said Amalia Souza, a Brazilian technology expert familiar with the project who has been an adviser on programs that bring the Internet to poor communities in more than 40 countries.\nA year and a half ago the women of the impoverished Wapishana and Macushi tribes of Guyana were introduced to the Internet in a project sponsored by Bill Humphries, who headed Guyana Telephone and Telegragh at the time and was optimistic about technology's money-making potential. The tribal power structures were shaken.\nThe women began making money by marketing their intricate hand-woven hammocks over the Web at $1,000 each. Feeling threatened, the traditional regional leadership took control of the organization, alienating and finally driving out the young woman who ran the Web site. The weaving group fell into disarray.\n''The events should be a case study for students of economics and social work,'' wrote Indera Ramlall, who is Guyanese, in a letter to a newspaper in the capital city of Georgetown. ''Economic advancement is not just about technology and markets; more fundamentally, it is about human relationships.''\nThe Alliance for Progress was the great hope of the Kennedy administration in the early 1960's. Its aim was to thwart communism with American aid to Central America, bridging the gap between poor and rich societies by building roads, factories and bridges. But aid to El Salvador tore the social fabric, contributed to the oppression of the poor, increased the holdings of the land-owning classes and helped fuel civil war.\nFor many people in developing countries these days, inspiration is increasingly drawn from William H. Gates. Some of the outwardly successful development projects, like the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, are trying to deal with the unforeseen impact on the people they are trying to help. The Grameen Bank provides small amounts of credit to more than two million poor people, mainly women, enabling them to invest in raising livestock or entrepreneurial ventures like buying rickshaws. But critics say the focus on women, who are considered more reliable borrowers than men, has caused considerable tension between the sexes.\n''Redistributing income from men to women, sharing out the misery of a shrinking cake, is not going to solve the people's problems,'' said Para Teare, a London-based social scientist who has studied such micro-lending programs, in a critique of the Grameen Bank.\nNOW, as technology starts to blur the distinction between industrialized countries and developing ones, social transition, if not transformation, has become an issue in some of the world's most remote regions. A recent issue of Cultural Survival, a magazine that covers indigenous people and ethnic minorities, described projects to bring the Web to communities as varied as the reindeer-herding Sami of Scandinavia and northern Russian, the aboriginal peoples of the Northwest Territories in Canada, the ethnic minorities of Burma and native Hawaiians.\nThese efforts represent a departure from the idea that introducing new technologies to indigenous peoples will bring about negative results. Such thinking, which dates back to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the 18th-century French philosopher who lured Europe into idealizing the simple lifestyle of the noble savage, appears to be coming undone in the digital age.\n''It is not realistic to think that as the world gets smaller there should be enclaves untouched by Western technology,'' said Robert Whelan, a writer on indigenous affairs at the Institute of Economic Affairs in London. ''But it is realistic to realize that traditional cultures can be very oppressive, especially for women and wildlife, and that technology can help change this.''\nSome people think the double-edged nature of technology's impact is beneficial. For the Grameen Bank, credit is considered a weapon for alleviating poverty and oppressive policies affecting women. Yet some societies are better equipped than others to deal with an onslaught of technological change. The American Amish, who are known for their rigid views about technology, have banned the car and computer but not the pocket calculator. A few Amish also use the Internet, albeit quietly.\nOthers, though, are not so sure about placing too much value on technology's liberating potential.\n''When you introduce the Internet to people whose most urgent need is to get enough food to eat each day,'' said Karin Delgadillo, a coordinator at ChasquiNet, which provides technology assistance to remote communities in Quito, Ecuador, ''you see there are other priorities that need to be taken care of first.''",

    "text": "Rough Beast\n2000-03-19T05:00:00.000Z\nTIGERS IN THE SNOW\nBy Peter Matthiessen.\nIntroduction and photographs\nby Maurice Hornocker.\n185 pp. New York:\nNorth Point Press/\nFarrar, Straus & Giroux. $27.\n''EVERYONE is connected. Only the tiger is not connected.'' That is what Vladimir Shetinin thinks, and he ought to know. As the commander of a Russian government antipoaching force in a remote area of eastern Siberia, Shetinin was in charge of policing the contested border between tigers and men.\nYet it's an odd statement for Peter Matthiessen to choose as an epigraph for ''Tigers in the Snow,'' his book on Siberian tigers -- a book that carefully maps the myriad, often fatal connections that bind the great cats to the rest of creation. This is true, he shows, not just in overcrowded places like India and Bangladesh but even in Russia's wild east, where the human population averages well below one person per square mile and the Amur tiger (unlike its southerly cousins) is free to roam over vast stretches of territory among the snowy forests that slope toward the Sea of Japan.\nThese are not fragile animals, to be sure. ''Wherever the species occurs,'' Matthiessen writes, ''the tiger resides at the summit of its ecosystem.'' Amur tigers require 10 pounds of meat every day -- the fresher the better. When they attack humans, as they sometimes do, search parties rarely recover more than a few bloody scraps. (Over the past four centuries, according to Matthiessen, Asian tigers are believed to have killed about a million people.) They are also amazingly versatile creatures, ''equally well adapted to temperate woodlands and tropical rain forest, marine mangrove forest and long-grass Himalayan foothills, riverine thicket and the vast reed beds of western Asia's inland seas.''\nBut the tigers' perch at the top of the food chain is exactly what makes them vulnerable. When forests are logged and deer and elk are hunted to scarcity, the great cats silently vanish. The story has repeated itself across Asia. Over the past few decades, at least three of the eight tiger subspecies have become extinct. There are now almost as many tigers living on rich people's ranches in Texas (some 2,000) as there are in the wild in India, which is thought to shelter the world's largest free-ranging population. Visiting the few scattered habitats that remain, Matthiessen finds the situation even bleaker than others have reported. In Southeast Asia, villagers use homemade land mines to kill tigers. In China -- where, a few decades ago, Mao Zedong waged a national campaign to eradicate them as ''pests'' -- the few that remain are hunted to provide curative delicacies like tiger penis soup.\nThe region of eastern Siberia where Matthiessen concentrates his story was not even explored by Europeans until less than a century ago. And just 10 years ago, the Soviet authorities still kept it effectively off limits. Now, though, it has -- like everywhere else on earth, more or less -- become ''connected.'' American logging companies, among others, are carving out choice fillets of territory for clear-cutting, blissfully out of sight of the spotted-owl-huggers. (Russia has some 58 percent of the world's coniferous forests, compared with 11 percent in the United States.) And the homegrown mafiya has been quick to seize on the commercial potential of poaching. Within a couple of years in the early 1990's, more than a third of the native tigers were exterminated.\nSiberia's newly porous borders have also, however, admitted a team of American scientists, who in 1992 established a permanent presence in the area, the Siberian Tiger Project, whose researchers are the heroes of Matthiessen's tale. Thanks to them, the tiger population has rebounded somewhat. The Chinese, perhaps too late, are gradually being weaned off tiger penis soup in favor of mole rat wine (and, one suspects, Viagra). And the scientists have managed to learn more about the elusive tigers by doing all the familiar things that scientists do: chasing them down with tranquilizer darts, fitting them with radio collars, giving them cute names (Olga, Katia, Kolya). So now even these mysterious beasts in the secret heart of Asia are plugged in.\nMANY readers who buy this book will no doubt be looking for a sequel to Matthiessen's 1978 classic, ''The Snow Leopard,'' that profound meditation on wildness and civilization, animals and humans. However, ''Tigers in the Snow'' is distinctly minor-key Matthiessen -- always lucid, often sad and affecting, but less frequently poetic. The old Matthiessen, one feels, would have felt the poignancy of chasing after radio-tracked tigers in a helicopter. This Matthiessen more or less just settles back and enjoys the ride.\nWherever the species still hangs on in the wild, the animal at the summit of the ecosystem is no longer Panthera tigris, but rather Homo sapiens. And now that we've supplanted them in that lofty and precarious place, perhaps we can learn something from their fate. Like the powerful and versatile tigers, humans depend on a whole complex web of life to sustain us. We share their habitat, just as they share our future.",

    "text": "Few Blacks Where Tips Are High; Racial Diversity Is Rare for Waiters in Elite Restaurants\n2000-05-30T05:00:00.000Z\nIn New York City's restaurant firmament, where establishments ceaselessly open and close, where fortunes are made and lost overnight, and where chefs can go as hot and as cold as the soup, there are few unchanging truths.\nBut one reality has dominated the city's enormous inventory of distinguished restaurants: a scarcity of black waiters.\n''For anyone who eats in high-end restaurants in Manhattan, it is impossible to ignore the fact that there is very little, if any, diversity in many, many restaurants,'' said Andrew G. Celli Jr., the bureau chief for civil rights in the New York State attorney general's office. ''It's really in your face.''\nWhile more than 26 percent of New York City's population is black, only 10.5 percent of its 48,176 waiters and waitresses are black, according to 1996 census data. Since many of those are working in low-end neighborhood restaurants, the racial disparity among waiters in mid-to-high-priced places is greater.\nFor many city restaurantgoers, though, that truth takes awhile to sink in.\n''People are so used to the exclusion of African-Americans, you don't even notice,'' said David A. Paterson, a black state senator whose district includes Harlem and part of Washington Heights.\nThe reasons for the disparity are as complicated as diners' orders. Interviews with dozens of restaurant owners and waiters, and with state, city and labor leaders reveal an industry that acknowledges a dearth of black waiters, but offers several reasons for their absence.\nAt many Chinese, Japanese, Italian and other ethnic restaurants, for instance, owners say that they employ no blacks as waiters because they need to hire employees sharing their own backgrounds. They say that customers demand the authenticity implied by the presence of ethnic waiters in ethnic restaurants.\nOther restaurateurs say few blacks apply for the jobs even though new restaurants are plentiful and waiters are scarce. And both black waiters and leaders acknowledge that black Americans may be rejecting what they perceive as a servile profession.\nBut many blacks working in high-end restaurants in New York City say that the real reason their numbers are so small is racism.\nWaiting jobs could have considerable economic significance in black neighborhoods where boom times have certainly not brought full employment. Jobs in the city's 20,000 restaurants have increased 24 percent since 1992 in an industry that generated about $7.2 billion in revenues in 1998. Waiters at top city restaurants can earn from $40,000 to $70,000 a year or more.\n''Restaurant jobs are steppingstones into careers and opportunities for many,'' said Lloyd A. Williams, president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. ''There is absolutely no question that blacks are being discriminated against as waiters and waitresses.''\nCertainly many black waiters perceive this to be true. Chris Harvey, a waiter at Aquagrill in SoHo, said he had been shut out of previous jobs because of his skin color. ''Young whites come and go, but it takes me longer to find a job,'' Mr. Harvey said. ''So when I find a place, I stay.''\nGeorge Thomas, 35, remembered the days when he was trying to get a toehold in the industry. ''I have faxed restaurants with my qualifications,'' recalled Mr. Thomas, who is black, ''and they expressed excitement. Then they saw me in person, and the whole conversation changed.''\nHe kept applying for jobs, refused to take no as an answer, and became a waiter, a maitre d'hotel and sommelier at Gotham Bar and Grill in Greenwich Village. He later became a waiter captain at the three-star restaurant Daniel on East 65th Street, and for the last year, he has been a captain at the four-star Bouley Bakery in TriBeCa.\nBut his is the exceptional story. ''In some respects there is a ceiling for black people,'' Mr. Thomas said, adding that in regard to managers, maitres d'hotel and captains, ''there are not many blacks at fine restaurants.''\nOne of them, Daniel Smalls, 36, a former waiter, is now a manager at Guastavino's at Bridgemarket, where 40 percent of the waitstaff of 120 is black. ''A lot of black people began to apply here when they saw me,'' he said.\nWhite waiters predominate at many of New York's better-known restaurants. For example, of the 10 waiters and 5 captains in the dining room of La Cote Basque, the haute cuisine doyenne at 60 West 55th Street, none are black.\nOnly one of the eight waiters and three captains at Le Perigord, the 36-year-old French grande dame at 405 East 52nd Street, is dark-skinned -- a server from Bangladesh. Of the 48 waiters in the dining room and banquet operation of the four-star Le Cirque 2000, on Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, two are black.\nBut the owners of Le Perigord, La Cote Basque and Le Cirque 2000 say they do not have racist employment policies. ''The majority of our people working here are minorities,'' said Sirio Maccioni, the owner of Le Cirque 2000, ''including our chef,'' who is Cambodian.\nNevertheless, Brooks Bitterman, research director of Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, which organizes the city's nonhotel waiters, said the whiteness of waiters was striking considering ''that 99 percent of low-wage kitchen workers are nonwhite minorities, Hispanics and Asians.'' Dr. Bitterman added, ''That contrasts with white senior cooks in many kitchens, and the primarily white front-of-house staffs.''\nWhile women's groups and the state attorney general's office have challenged sex discrimination at some of New York's elite restaurants, racial discrimination has not really registered on the official radar screen. Mr. Celli of the attorney general's office said, ''We have several open investigations involving several high-end luxury restaurants,'' but these cases focus on sex discrimination. Racial discrimination may be involved, he added, because ''when you look at one thing, you often find other sorts of things.''\nRestaurant discrimination cases have traditionally been difficult to prove, but in 1998, the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission won a prosecution at the Harley-Davidson Cafe in Midtown: an African-American waitress, Lisa McDonald, won $175,000 after complaining that she had been verbally insulted (she accused the manager of saying ''you look like Buckwheat'') and ordered to redo her hair at the restaurant.\nIn February 1999, the Times Square Brewery agreed to pay $450,000 to $650,000 to settle a lawsuit involving accusations of discrimination and racial slurs, filed on behalf of 27 employees, but it admitted no wrongdoing.\nMr. Williams, of the Harlem chamber of commerce, suggested that a more representative labor organization might encourage black waiters to enter the restaurant industry. Yet currently only a little more than 10 percent of the city's waiters are represented by the two principal restaurant unions. Leaders of Local 6 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union said the union has little control over whom restaurants hire. The local represents nearly 4,000 New York hotel waiters earning $25,000 to $100,000 a year.\nSome unionized restaurants contend that seniority rules make new job openings for blacks very scarce. ''Our waiters are here for life, and last September we had our first job opening in three or four years,'' said Georges Briguet, owner of Le Perigord, explaining how he had hired the restaurant's Bangladeshi server.\nIndividual restaurateurs have made efforts to hire more blacks. Danny Meyer, co-owner of the Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Tabla and 11 Madison Park, said that five years ago, he became concerned about the ''sameness'' of his front-of-house staff. ''I asked managers why the staff wasn't more diverse,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''I wasn't satisfied with their answer that 'no minorities applied.' ''\nSo Mr. Meyer gave blacks visible jobs as hostesses and maitres d'hotel, blacks noticed and began applying, and ''things have changed dramatically now that we have people of color right at the front door.'' He added that now his staff is more diverse and so is his clientele.\nMr. Meyer does not insist that his Indian-themed restaurant, Tabla, employ only Indian waiters. Some restaurateurs, though, maintain that they cannot hire black servers because doing so may make ethnic restaurants seem less authentic to customers. ''In the older, high-end French and Italian places -- where the proprietor is of a certain age -- these people want to surround themselves with members of their own culture and their own age,'' said Eric Weiss, whose company, Service Arts Incorporated, has hired the staffs of many high-end restaurants.\nBut Peter Ward, president of Local 6 of the hotel and restaurant employees' union, said that ''it is ridiculous to suppose that you need to be Italian to serve Italian food.''\nSome black waiters say they have faced racism from customers, too. Mr. Thomas said he would not soon forget the customer at Gotham Bar and Grill who told him, ''For a colored boy, you're not too bad.'' And Mr. Smalls of Guastavino's, who previously worked his way up to manager at the four-star Jean Georges near Columbus Circle, remembers customers there who kept insisting on speaking to the real boss. ''I'd have to say to them, 'No, the manager -- that's me,' '' he said.\nSome blacks say that another problem is the lack of black chefs in New York City's finest kitchens. Carl Redding Jr., 36, said that he was not able to find a top cooking position in a white-owned restaurant, so he opened his own, Amy Ruth's, which serves up home-style Southern cuisine on West 116th Street in Harlem.\nBut Mr. Redding said that racism works both ways: ''there is racism on the part of blacks against whites,'' meaning that several Harlem restaurants hire only black waiters.\nBedelia Woods of Sylvia's, the soul-food landmark in Harlem, said this is not the case at her restaurant. ''Our doors are open to everybody,'' said Ms. Woods, a daughter of the owner, Sylvia Woods. She added that when white servers answer the restaurant's job advertisements and ask for directions, ''when we say uptown in Harlem, they may not come.''\nPart of the reason for the scarcity of black waiters, some suggest, may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. ''Young African-American women and men don't go out for those jobs,'' State Senator Paterson said. ''They think those jobs are closed off to them.''\nAnd it may be that the idea of serving people is the hurdle. Perhaps other blacks ''think it's a belittling job,'' Mr. Smalls suggested.\nCan patrons change the status quo? Some black leaders suggest that their buying power can speak volumes. ''We should not eat where we can't work,'' said State Assemblyman Keith L. Wright, who represents Harlem.\nMr. Celli of the attorney general's office agreed that the diners hold the cards. ''The restaurant industry is driven by consumer likes and dislikes,'' he said. ''If we change the culture so that, as a society, it is no longer attractive to have an all-white, all-male work force, then the customer will have to be right. And there will be change.''",

    "text": "Four Corners; When Shifting Groups of Immigrants Compete for the Same Turf, Even an Intersection Can Become Contested Ground\n2000-07-30T05:00:00.000Z\nTHERE is a saying among urban historians: You can always tell how a neighborhood is changing. The name of the outgoing ethnic group is on the funeral homes, and that of the incoming group is on the grocery stores.\nIn New York, ethnic groups move like tectonic plates, drifting land masses, sometimes colliding at their edges with unhappy consequences, sometimes slipping past one another with relative ease.\nThe signs of shift are everywhere. In the span of a few years, a Little Italy, a Koreatown or a Little Odessa is newly defined by the Mexican bodegas or Chinese shoe stores or Indian delis that press at its borders.\nThe phenomenon, which sociologists call ethnic succession, is as old as the city itself and may be heightened in New York because of its size and the multiplicity of ethnic groups jostling for the same turf.\nA single street corner can become central to a group's identity.\n''In New York, because we live so much of our life in public and the sidewalk plays such a role in our perception of the city, busy street corners demarcate territory in a way that may be much more significant than in other cities,'' said Philip Kasinitz, a professor of sociology at Hunter College who specializes in immigration issues. ''People feel an allegiance to a stretch of businesses or a corner because that's where the community is defined most publicly.''\nSo, 20 years ago, Puerto Ricans in East Harlem knew that if they walked east past Third Avenue on East 116th Street, which was controlled by Italians, they faced the threat of physical violence. Today, the same corner is dominated by Mexicans, who were just as wary of the corner a decade ago when Puerto Ricans held sway there.\nTo outsiders, these shifts may be all but invisible. Sometimes the two groups occupying the same turf share physical attributes and speak the same language. But the differences are all too evident to groups trying to forge or maintain an identity.\nThe result can be out-and-out conflict, but more often it is a fluid process that involves intricate cultural negotiation. Here are four corners where those delicate negotiations are taking place today.\nIn Flatbush,\nRussian Jews and Pakistanis\nYakov Semichan, 56, a Russian Jew whose barbershop has been at Coney Island Avenue and Glenwood Road in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn for nine years, was fighting the crosscurrents.\nIn the last five years, his original customer base, Orthodox and Russian Jews whose synagogues and kosher restaurants once dominated the corner, has been departing for wealthier sections of Flatbush. Pakistani immigrants and businesses that catered to them were replacing them.\nBut when two Pakistani barbershops opened across the street from Mr. Semichan's shop during the last six years, his business began to suffer.\nMr. Semichan, who has piercing blue-gray eyes and a gap-toothed grin, had bought Al's Barber Shop from another Russian Jewish barber in 1991, when he moved to Brooklyn from Moldova in the former Soviet Union, and renamed it Yakov's. At first, the shifting population did not affect his business. He was still the only barber on the strip.\n''Hair is hair,'' he said over his shoulder as he passed the afternoon playing checkers with Nikolay Banov, a friend and customer from Kiev. ''Jewish hair, Pakistani hair, it's all the same.''\nBut Asghar Choudhri, president of the Pakistani American Federation of New York, whose headquarters is up the block, said many new immigrants saw otherwise.\n''The Pakistanis all went to their own places,'' Mr. Choudhri said. ''They stayed with their own. When the second Pakistani barber opened, that's when his business really went down.''\nIn 1996, a Pakistani immigrant named Shabbir Hussain, who had owned four barber shops in his native city of Lahore, had arrived in Flatbush and was looking for a job. Mr. Semichan offered Mr. Hussain the battered red barber's chair in the front of the shop and put a bright green sign in the window advertising, ''We speak Russian, English and Yiddish,'' along with Mr. Hussein's name translated into Urdu, the Pakistani language.\nThe two men now cut hair side by side in Yakov's Barber Shop, and the shop seems busy. But their situation is unusual. Although many elderly Jews still live on side streets like Glenwood Road and Avenue H, the two groups enjoy little interaction.\nOn Coney Island Avenue between Glenwood and Avenue H, almost all the businesses are owned by Pakistanis, Bangladeshis or other Muslims. These include Urdu Bazzar, a 99-cent store; Asian Grocery Halal Market; Bukhara Restaurant, which serves Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi cuisine, and Raheela Beauty Parlor. Children wear shalwar kameez, traditional Muslim garb.\nBut one block from Glenwood, the scenery changes. Just across Avenue H, the streets are populated by Hasidic Jews in black coats and hats. Though the two communities lead separate lives, they share certain traits. Both groups are religious and conservative, both observe restricted diets, and in both communities, women assume traditional roles. Both groups have had tense relationships with blacks and Hispanics in surrounding areas. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Choudhri of the Pakistani American Federation spent the afternoon on the telephone, complaining to the police that African-American teenagers were throwing bottles and rocks at a new mosque and cursing its congregants.\nThe Jews and Pakistanis lead largely separate lives.\n''There has been no real interaction, except on the leadership level,'' said Rabbi Yechezkel Pikus, executive director of the Council of Jewish Organizations of Flatbush. ''There's a sort of tolerance. You mind your business and I'll mind mine.''\nIn Belmont,\nAlbanians Displace Italians\nFelix Mastro, a former prizefighter, stood with his buddies, Sal, Johnny D., Guido and Mikey, in the blue light filtering through a canopy outside the Cosenza Fish Market at Arthur Avenue and 186th Street.\nThe four men were downing clams on the half shell and reminiscing about the old days, 80 years ago -- before any of them were born -- when pushcarts selling Italian goods rumbled along Arthur Avenue, the heart of the Belmont section of the Bronx.\n''It all changed in 1933, when they opened the Arthur Avenue Retail Market,'' said Mr. Mastro, 70, still dapper in his brown sports jacket, who has lived in the neighborhood all his life. ''They closed the last place where you could buy live chickens on the street over here just a couple of years ago. Very few Italians are left here now.'' It is a daily lament at this intersection.\nAt first glance, the Italian presence seems as bright as ever. Along Arthur Avenue, banners on lampposts proclaim ''Welcome to Little Italy in the Bronx,'' beside Italian bakeries, meat markets and cheese stores. But in the last five years, as Italians have left Belmont for the suburbs, they have been replaced by Albanians.\nMany Roman Catholic Albanians first moved to Belmont in the 1980's, when those who suffered under their country's fanatical Communist regime fled to the United States. The recent wars that drove thousands of Albanians from Kosovo produced the latest wave of immigration, which began about three years ago.\nAlbanians felt comfortable in an Italian neighborhood because Albanians and Italians are neighbors in Europe. They eat and drink similar foods, and they look somewhat alike. But the two groups have not always mingled peacefully, as shown by life on this corner. At Mike's Deli, an Italian specialty store inside the Arthur Avenue market, three of the countermen are Italian and three are Albanian. All the Albanian employees have adopted Italian-style nicknames -- Milane is Milano, Keno is Nino -- and each speaks some Italian.\n''The Albanians get along fine with the Italian-Americans,'' David Greco, a second-generation Italian-American, said. ''But the Italians from Italy feel as if the Albanians invaded Italy, so they're a bit hostile. One of my guys is constantly calling them ignorant. If I wasn't there, there would be a fight every day.''\nOne combatant is Qamil Osmani, who goes by the nickname Ossie. Mr. Osmani, who worked for his country's Ministry of Defense under a previous regime, came to the United States in March to seek political asylum. He settled in Belmont because he knew that Albanians lived there and he had come to know Italians when he was serving in the Albanian Army a decade ago.\nAs for the Italian counterman who calls Albanians ignorant, he said: ''I tell him, I'm not coming from the street. I have stayed with much better people than him.''\nSimilar skirmishes are played out along Arthur Avenue between 186th and 187th Streets, which has become home to half a dozen Albanian stores, including the Kosova Commerce Corporation, which sells Albanian video and audio tapes and specialty goods; the Gurra Cafe, which serves Albanian cuisine; and the All Star Cafe, where the specials include typical Albanian dishes like chevapi and beef sausage.\nEven though many Italians have left the neighborhood, they return to buy their prosciutto and osso buco. And some of the vendors of those items are now Albanian. George Dedvukaj, who was born in a small town in Montenegro, owns and runs Giovanni's Restaurant on Arthur Avenue near 186th Street, which serves brick-oven pizza in the Italian style. He bought the business two years ago from another Albanian.\n''I think the Albanians helped the area,'' said Peter Servidio, an Italian-American who owns Peter's Meat Market across the street but moved to Westchester a few years ago. ''They buy a lot, like the Italians used to, by the bucket. And as far as business is concerned, Italians are going to be here for years and years.''\nIn Flushing,\nKoreatown Becomes Chinese\nThe pungent scent of cilantro accompanied Sean Lee, wearing a cut-off T-shirt and a baseball cap, as he wandered through Green Farm, a Korean-owned greenmarket at Main Street and Maple Avenue in Flushing, Queens, furiously directing the movement of crates of watermelons and okra.\nDuring a break, Mr. Lee, who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 of his 32 years, pointed to the last vestiges of the old Koreatown at the edge of Flushing's shopping district. ''Rose Handicraft was the first Korean store,'' Mr. Lee said, pointing toward a shop that rents traditional Korean kimonos. ''Over here, the pharmacy is Korean and the stationery store is Korean.''\nIn the last five years, many of the names on businesses on the corner have switched from Korean to Chinese, as Korean businesses have moved 10 blocks north to Northern Boulevard.\n''This has become like a second Chinatown,'' Mr. Lee said. ''They're bringing a lot of money from Hong Kong and China and investing it in this neighborhood.''\nTwo factors are cited to explain the departure of Korean-owned stores.\n''It's possible they've been pushed out because of the increase in Chinese business,'' said Daeyoung Kim, who is studying Korean-Americans at the Center for Urban Research at the CUNY Graduate Center. ''But it also could be because the Korean stores have become more diversified.'' As business owners diversified the products they sold, Mr. Kim said, they needed more space, and moved to a part of the neighborhood where larger, cheaper stores were still available.\nGreen Farm, which opened 20 years ago, is now encircled by Chinese businesses. Across the street is China Trust Bank, housed in a modernistic glass structure. Next door is Tai Pan Bakery. Just above Green Farm, restaurateurs from Hong Kong are putting the finishing touches on East Buffet and Restaurant, an ornate, 17,000-square-foot restaurant and catering hall. The three-floor restaurant, whose decor includes a sweeping marble staircase, a wrought-iron banister from Greece and a 120,000-piece crystal chandelier, is the third establishment created by the group, which also runs a wildly popular Chinese restaurant in Huntington, N.Y.\n''Most Chinese work late hours, and if you get off at 8 p.m., they can't get out there before we are closed,'' said Betty Cheng, one of the partners, explaining the decision to open in Flushing.\nAlthough East Buffet will concentrate on Chinese food, it will also offer sushi, Korean food and European specialties.\nLocal residents remember that East Buffet occupies a site that once housed a successful Korean restaurant called South River, and that a Korean restaurant up the block experienced what Ms. Cheng called ''another Chinese takeover.'' But she said she and her Korean neighbors, like those downstairs at Green Farm, get along well.\n''They speak in their language, which I don't understand,'' she said, ''but they eat at our places and we eat at theirs.''\nBut Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean American Small Business Service Center of New York, is less sanguine.\n''It is a bad thing that's happened here,'' Mr. Kim said. ''Koreans have been pushed out by other ethnic groups. Landlords kick them out to get higher rents. We used to have 80 stores in that area. Now we have three or four.''\nIn East Harlem,\nPuerto Rican Into Mexican\nMinutes after Mario Olmedo dropped his suitcase on the floor of his cousin's apartment in East Harlem 15 years ago, he heard a knock at the door. When he opened it, he said, three men assaulted him and robbed him of his watch, the only valuable he had brought from his home in Mexico City. Based on the tint of their skin and the cadence of their Spanish, Mr. Olmedo concluded that his attackers were Puerto Rican.\nWhether or not he was correct, the encounter left him feeling that he had entered hostile territory. Until just about six years ago, Spanish Harlem was just one kind of Spanish, Puerto Rican. The corner of 116th Street and Third Avenue, where Mr. Olmedo opened a taco stand 13 years ago, was dominated by Puerto Rican-owned bodegas.\nPuerto Ricans, in turn, had supplanted Italians, who first settled in East Harlem in the 1880's and numbered 80,000 by the 1930's. Conflicts erupted between Italians and Puerto Ricans as early as the 1920's. By 1930, most of the city's Puerto Ricans lived in the neighborhood, and the tensions between the two groups were legendary. Efrain Suarez, owner of Made in Puerto Rico Products, which sells CD's, books, coffee and other items from the island, stood on the corner and pointed east toward Second Avenue.\n''When the Italians were here, Puerto Ricans couldn't go down that block,'' said Mr. Suarez, 55, who has worked in the neighborhood for three decades. ''The farther you went down the street, the worse it got. If you went past Second Avenue, you were beaten up.''\nUntil six years ago, it was Mexicans who had to confine their movements to the blocks west of Third Avenue. In the early 1990's, Mr. Olmedo bought a bodega owned by a Puerto Rican in the heart of the contested territory and replaced it with a tacqueria, La Hacienda, possibly the first Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood. ''We used to see a lot of Puerto Ricans chasing Mexican guys down the street to beat them up,'' he said.\nMr. Olmedo now owns a second Mexican restaurant, La Tacquicanda, just down the block, as well as an apartment building. But it took time to catch on. ''People used to pass by and make nasty faces,'' said his teenage son, Omar, a younger, Americanized replica of his father.\nThat has changed, and no one chases Mexicans away from the corner anymore. After Mr. Olmedo opened his first restaurant, other Mexican immigrants started asking for advice on starting their own. Along 116th Street between Second and Third Avenue, Mexicans have made inroads. Amid 14 Puerto Rican flags hung from windows and fire escapes are at least eight Mexican-owned stores, among them Mexico Shoes, Azteca Unisex barbershop, Taco Mix taqueria and the Mexico Discount Center, a 99-cent store.\nA vast majority of recent Mexican immigrants to El Barrio came from Puebla, a state in northern Mexico that has been battered by economic troubles and natural disasters.\nMexicans feel more welcome today. As if to prove the point, Mr. Olmedo gestured toward the back of his restaurant, where three men were eating together. ''One is Mexican, one is Dominican and one is Puerto Rican,'' he said.\nBut resentment still festers in the hearts of some Puerto Ricans, who feel they have lost control.\n''Puerto Ricans still consider El Barrio 'la cuna,' the cradle of Puerto Rican experience,'' said Henry Calderon, president of the East Harlem Chamber of Commerce.\nPepe Castillo, a Puerto Rican musician who works at Made in Puerto Rico, stood at 116th Street and Third Avenue gazing east, his brow furrowed as he extolled the virtues of ''hard working Mexicans'' who now dominate the block. ''And it all started with the guy selling tacos on the corner,'' he said, in a tone tinged with loss.\nMr. Suarez sighed.\n''What can you do?'' he said. ''The Puerto Ricans created a vacuum here. The original Puerto Ricans who came here have now retired, moved to Rockland County, Florida or back to Puerto Rico. Their children are professionals.''\nBut, he added, ''there is no decent housing here for them.''\nAnd though the mix on the corner has changed, the tension is nowhere near as fierce as it was when Italians and Puerto Ricans were the two groups.\n''There is the fact that we would prefer it to remain Spanish Harlem,'' Mr. Suarez said. ''And if the Mexicans keep coming, it will be Spanish Harlem. It will be a different kind of Spanish, but still Spanish Harlem.''",

    "text": "Eve's Revenge, The Python's Sorrow\n2000-06-18T05:00:00.000Z\nONCE, snakeskin had the fashion cachet of a prison tattoo. Urban cowboys and rockers wore it. So did creeps. Snakeskin? Think Joey Buttafuoco's signature boots.\nWhat a difference a little marketing makes. Designers satisfied this year's cash-rich consumers by giving a makeover to python, skin taken from Asian snakes laced with primeval, netlike designs. Yves Saint Laurent sold out its line of $9,250 python trench coats. Jimmy Choo offered $550 python slides in traffic-stopping bright green. A pink python jacket from Chanel, with white chiffon trim and matching skirt, retailed at $8,455. It sold out, too.\n''Python did incredibly well,'' said Mariah Chase, a Jimmy Choo spokeswoman. ''It was all about luxury and exoticism. It was a maximalism kind of thing.''\nFor fashion houses, the metamorphosis of python from ruffian chic to Park Avenue popularity has been an irrefutable hit. But among conservationists, the snake's makeover has been ringing alarms. Does it signal a new round of consumers wearing wildlife products with light-headed nonchalance? If so, which animals will be next? And what about those snakes? In an era of shrinking habitat, are there really enough pythons out there to outfit every acquisitive fashion princess?\nHaving a python cellphone cover may be unmistakably hip, but it is an image oddly disconnected from the product's origins. A world away from the cubicles where fashion magazine pages are designed, this year's python craze is supplied by an international industry that snatches hundreds of thousands of wild pythons from jungles each year, kills them and ships their skins to European and Asian garment factories, all the while avoiding the notoriety that has dogged other commercial wildlife harvests, from the seal hunters of Newfoundland to the whalers of Japan.\nThe python hunt is legal, as is the export of the skins. But conservationists say that no one is certain whether the most heavily traded species, reticulated and blood pythons, both agents of rat control in some of the world's poorest nations, can sustain their numbers under the sort of hunting that keeps department stores stocked.\nPythons are creatures virtually without advocates. Many details of their lives are unknown.\n''For most of these snakes, there is absolutely no information on what is happening with the hunts or how the species are faring,'' said Dr. John Thorbjarnarson, a herpetologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society, headquartered at the Bronx Zoo. ''That is really a frightening thing.'' Pythons are nonvenomous tropical predators that strike from hiding and then twist their bodies around their prey, flexing their hold until the animal suffocates. The dead victim is swallowed headfirst. Sated pythons slither off to digest.\nSince 1975, trade in these reptiles has been subject to guidelines set by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, or Cites, a wildlife commerce treaty signed by 150 nations, which require each country to establish and supervise a conservation policy. According to the convention, more than 10 million pythons have been reported taken from the wild in the last 15 years.\nThe snakes are harvested from a long list of nations, including Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. But the unequivocal export leader is Indonesia, where harvesting pythons is a highly organized business. From 1985 to 1998, the last year for which data are available, Indonesia exported more than 4.5 million pythons, either skinned or alive.\n''It is a huge industry, but it keeps to itself,'' said Kamuran Tepedelen, who owns Bushmaster Reptiles, a Boulder, Colo.-based company that employs Indonesian snake catchers for the pet trade.\nSpokeswomen for four fashion houses that use python said they had no idea where the skins come from, a response evidently little different from that of consumers. ''It's very rare, honestly, that we think about where they come from, and what the ecological impact might be,'' Ms. Chase of Jimmy Choo said.\nThe most coveted species in the exotic leather trade is the reticulated python, arguably the largest snake in the world. Reticulated pythons are the anacondas of Asia, having been reported at lengths of more than 30 feet, although 10- to 17-foot snakes are typical. They feed on a variety of vertebrates, including rats, ducks, chickens, porcupines, pigs and monkeys. In rare instances the largest specimens have attacked humans.\nEach year from 1985 to 1998, between 305,000 and 834,000 reticulated pythons were reported harvested worldwide; a large portion came from Indonesia. Actual trade is believed to be larger because of smuggling. Much of the rest of the trade is in skins from blood pythons, fat-bodied snakes that reach maximum lengths of about seven feet. Once considered uncommon, blood pythons have benefited in recent years as vast tracts of rain forest have given way to oil palm plantations. These new habitats -- replete with brush piles and palm fruit -- support an extraordinary density of rats.\nExperts say the rats' abundance has allowed blood pythons, which feed on them, to colonize the plantations. And as their numbers have increased, the snakes have attracted skin hunters. In 1985, 32,000 blood pythons were exported worldwide. In 1998, reported shipments reached 127,000.\nTo convert pythons into profits, Indonesia's snake-harvesting industry relies on an army of catchers. Most are villagers who simply encounter a snake and pounce on it, selling it later for serendipitous cash. Others are more systematic and take regular walks through the palm plantations, peering into brush piles and plucking blood pythons from hiding places. A few ambitious hunters work in groups, settings nets, traps and baited hooks for the larger reticulated pythons. Captured snakes are stored in canvas bags and sold to primitive skinning plants. What happens next is unsightly, although industry representatives and scientists say it is no more unsettling than what occurs in meat-packing houses around the world.\nThe pythons are dumped from their bags and killed by suffocation or mallet blows. The carcasses are hung by their heads and inflated with water. A skinner then slits open the carcass, snips out the guts and scrapes away the meat. Depending on the market, some of the meat ends up being eaten, and some is used as livestock feed or discarded. In some cases python gall bladders are sold for use in traditional Chinese medicine. But the main product is the skin, which is pegged, dried and sent to tanneries. Most tanned skins are exported to Europe, where they are converted into all manner of clothing and accessories.\nThe industry employs about 174,200 people, including everyone from skinners to international sales agents, according to the Indonesian Reptile and Amphibian Trade Association, which represents licensed tanneries and reptile-product exporters. About 150,000 of the workers are snake catchers, most of them in persistently poor regions. They are paid a small sum for each snake.\n''I think the reality is that for these Indonesian villages, the snakes are an important economic resource,'' said Dr. Richard Shine, a University of Sydney herpetologist who toured Indonesian skinning plants for python studies.\nThe industry has existed for decades, subject to the capricious moods of the fashion industry and its equally capricious customers. But some conservationists say the skins' recent appearance on the runways is tied as much to the fine points of international trade law as to the vagaries of taste.\nSix years ago, the endangered species convention adopted rules requiring tags and permits for crocodilian products shipped across international borders. These rules, which did not affect snakes directly, complicated shipments for products from certain reptiles -- crocodiles, alligators and caimans -- often causing border delays or seizures, a potential catastrophe for retailers expecting seasonal merchandise.\nSince python skins are not covered by the tagging rules, they cross borders with comparative ease. Experts say this characteristic made them attractive when designers began seeking exotic leather for consumers flush with cash.\n''Snakeskins are not nearly as complicated to import and export,'' said Craig Hoover, of Traffic-North America, the trade monitoring arm of the World Wildlife Fund. ''They just don't run into the same possibilities of delays.''\nAccordingly, wildlife inspectors say they have noticed a significant increase in the number of snakeskin products entering the United States. ''From an industry's standpoint I guess I can understand it,'' said Sheila Einsweiler, a senior inspector for the Fish and Wildlife Service. ''It's a little easier to move snakeskins around.''\nAs more skins entered the country and began to bear brand-name labels, python's sudden popularity invigorated a long-running debate among scientists about the species' sustainability. Herpetologists are particularly worried about reticulated pythons, which do not seem to thrive in plantations, and whose skins bear the netlike pattern most desired by designers.\n''Reticulated pythons are giant snakes, remarkable creatures, but they are not adequately protected, and their trade is barely regulated,'' said Peter Brazaitis, a herpetologist and the former curator of animals at the Central Park Wildlife Center. ''Five years from now, if python fashion keeps going, how many of them will be left?''\nThe answers are not clear. Under endangered species trade rules, exporting countries must base their hunts on scientific studies and limit harvests ''to maintain the species throughout its range and at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystem in which it occurs.'' But little field research has been done on Asian pythons. Wildlife experts say there is almost no way of knowing whether the convention's standards are being met and whether the various species, or their roles in the ecosystem, are being preserved.\nSome studies are not encouraging. A 1990 report done for the convention's secretariat noted that for reticulated pythons, ''there is reasonable evidence for a significant decline in Bangladesh, and the species is reported to be depleted locally over much of the remainder of the range, including Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines.''\nBut since then, opinions on the hunt's impact have varied. Mr. Tepedelen, of Bushmaster Reptiles, said harvests are sustainable because catchers generally do not kill immature reptiles, meaning most of those killed have already been allowed to lay clutches of eggs and propagate the species.\n''The species that are in trade are just booming,'' he said.\nDr. Shine, the Australian herpetologist and one of the few scientists who have studied the harvest of reticulated pythons, said he has been surprised by the species's resilience. ''Reticulated pythons have the life history of a garter snake,'' he said. ''They grow fast, mature quickly and have a lot of eggs in each clutch. As a species, it can withstand a fair bit of pressure.''\nIn spite of these characteristics, the species has declined in some areas. ''It's not an issue about extinction, but there is no doubt that the commercial trade is reducing the numbers,'' Dr. Shine said.\nThe Indonesian reptile traders' organization has been working with field researchers and the Indonesian government to ensure that the hunt is sustainable. But field biologists caution that sustainable or not, it may have public health consequences. That is because the snakes are being removed from an ecosystem heavily populated with rats.\nWhile harvesting pythons may generate profits locally, some scientists say, they leave behind rats, which carries social costs, including increases in disease and damage to crops. ''I think we have to ask ourselves, what is the value of a python?'' said Mr. Brazaitis. ''Is it as a pair of expensive pants? Or is it as a means to check exploding rat populations in nations where communicable diseases are rampant?''\nThis month, the knockoff-bag merchants were selling fake python clutches and baguettes on the sidewalks outside Bloomingdale's, a sure sign the snakeskin craze has gone down-market and is nearing its end. And even though python products remained in some display windows throughout the city, a salesman at the Original Leather Store, which operates six boutiques in Manhattan, was pronouncing the snake dead.\n''I'm so sick of it,'' he said, pointing toward a pair of python pants on display overhead, rich maroon hip-huggers, the remains of a mid-size reticulated python. The salesman rolled his eyes and sighed. ''It's going to be very dated, very fast,'' he said. ''I think it's the acid wash of 2000.''\nWhether sinking snakeskin sales in New York City will mean more pythons in the wild is an open question. The skins remain popular in Europe, and snakeskin boots are likely to maintain their hold over would-be rock stars and barroom cowboys.\nBut in New York, at least, pythons may soon be getting a reprieve.\n''I've heard,'' the salesman said, ''that in the fall, it's ostrich that will be hot.''",

    "text": "On a Student Field Trip, With the Planet at Stake\n2000-11-25T05:00:00.000Z\nIf it had been a normal November, Daniel Jones would have stayed at Hunter College through the Thanksgiving break instead of heading home to Kalamazoo, Mich. ''There's a lot of stuff I want to do in New York City,'' said Mr. Jones, a 19-year-old sophomore who had never been to the city before last year.\nBut this was no normal November. The fate of the planet was at stake, and Mr. Jones had a chance to jump in and try to save it.\nMonths earlier, he had seen a bulletin from an environmental group inviting more than 200 college students to come to this Dutch city to help influence negotiators who were going to tussle for two weeks over the details of a proposed treaty to fight global warming.\nAnd now he was here, with an emergency cell phone number scribbled on his forearm in case he was arrested, with a pad full of notes on where Senator Larry Craig's aide was headed, when the reception put on by nuclear power lobbyists was scheduled, what restaurant the delegates from the United States frequented for breakfast.\nHe was on the inside.\n''It's a beautiful thing,'' Mr. Jones said, cracking a shy, sly smile. ''It's just so great -- like college pranks, but with a difference.''\nOver the course of a week here, he and more than 220 students from dozens of states had the ultimate class in environmental education, some of it uplifting and some of it a sobering reality check.\nTheir goal was to serve as a goad, a conscience, a jab in the ribs of the lobbyists and delegates from 170 countries, conveying the message that all the minutiae they were debating -- articles 3.14 and 4.8, the emissions targets, loopholes and disputed phrases marked by brackets -- really mattered to somebody.\nThe treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, was conceived in Japan in 1997 after a decade of debate on how to curb the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gases from cars and power plants and burning forests.\nA century-long buildup of these gases, mainly carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, was thought to be raising the planet's thermostat. If enacted, the treaty would require dozens of industrialized countries to cut emissions of warming gases by 2012 to at least 5 percent below where they stood in 1990.\nUntil the meeting here, the Kyoto treaty was essentially a new, high-stakes sport, but with no rule book, no field boundaries, no penalties.\nGreenpeace USA, concerned that this was going to be another in a long line of inconsequential conclaves full of huddling dark-suited diplomats, decided to inject a big dose of adrenaline. And it wouldn't hurt to foster a new generation of activists, said John Passacantando, who became the group's executive director this fall.\n''The environmental movement these days is mainly a bunch of 30-somethings or 40-somethings,'' he explained as he assembled the students this week for a news conference and photo session with journalists from Bangladesh, Japan, Australia and a dozen other countries. ''We need a back bench.''\nMr. Jones was one of about 1,000 students who sent in applications, replete with essay questions, for the 225 openings. He lacked money to cover the $400 airfare, and sent a letter to Hunter's dean of student affairs, Sylvia Fishman. ''Her only question was how much did I need?'' he said. ''She's amazing.''\nThe students' days began at 8:30 a.m., as they roused groggily at the youth hostel near the city's central rail station.\nOne morning early last week, dozens of dreadlocked, pierced, tie-dyed young people -- and a few in jackets and ties, including Mr. Jones -- gathered for a breakfast of nut-laced whole grain bread, granola and strong coffee and a dose of strategizing.\nChris Ball, a Greenpeace official from Washington with the perky air of a camp counselor, strode to a podium and went over some of the highlights of the days ahead, which would include all manner of theatrics and gentle monkey wrenching. He then asked for ''quick downloads'' from participants about their experiences so far.\nA student from Northern California described how he and several others had presented a ''head in the sand'' award outside a news conference by Senator Craig, Republican of Idaho, and Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, who had just finished describing why they opposed the treaty. The award was five Barbie dolls buried upside down in a box of sand.\nAcross the breakfast room, another student stood and described how he and more than 20 others had sat in on a presentation by a European organization called Young Generation in Nuclear, which was at the climate conference to promote nuclear power as an alternative energy source that produces no greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe young Greenpeace campaigners did not share that view. ''We challenged them with question after question,'' the student said. ''It was kind of depressing that someone our age could be so backward.''\nA Greenpeace official told them that a delegation of eight representatives from Congress had arrived. ''Six out of eight got a zero'' on the League of Conservation Voters' report card ranking votes on environmental bills, the official said.\n''Hissssssssssssss,'' came the communal response.\nThe students were divided into more than a dozen groups, each focused on a different task: attracting news media attention with catchy demonstrations, dogging the tracks of lobbyists for oil companies and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, talking with American negotiators, who were seen as seeking loopholes, or delegates from countries that had strong environmental policies.\nMr. Jones was in group 13. His task was ''research and dissemination,'' in other words, intelligence gathering and communicating the latest tactics to all the other groups.\nEvery hour or so, in a basement room tucked away from the bustling action in the rest of the sprawling convention center, he and others convened to plot moves.\nThey donned Santa Claus hats and handed out stockings full of coal -- the dirtiest of the fossil fuels -- taken by a Greenpeace team a week earlier from a freighter in the nearby harbor of Rotterdam.\nWhile doing so, they sang modified Christmas carols, including a greenhouse version of ''Jingle Bells'': ''Hot as hell, oceans swell, warmer every day, oh, what fun it is to fry in a world with climate change.''\nOne night, Mr. Jones and Janet Sawin, a graduate student at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University, jumped on a tram to head to the elegant Des Indies Hotel, where the International Nuclear Forum was the host of a reception for Republican congressmen.\nMr. Jones, playing the role of decoy, strode straight into the crowd of tailored business suits wearing his red suspenders and a half-dozen brightly colored pins with strident environmental messages.\nDisplaying his sly smile, Mr. Jones was swiftly escorted away, but this created an opening for Ms. Sawin, who was wearing an elegant maroon dress and long scarf -- and who quickly cornered Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. Earlier in the day, Mr. Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Science Committee, had blasted the treaty as a waste of time that would never be supported by Congress.\nScrewing up her courage, Ms. Sawin began peppering him with questions and criticisms of nuclear power and of Republican opposition to the treaty.\nAt first, Mr. Sensenbrenner engaged in the debate, but he slowly realized this was a no-win situation and soon made for the exit. Ms. Sawin smiled.\nBy late Wednesday night, with the negotiators making little progress, 80 of the students were starting to feel discouraged and decided to begin a fast that would take the place of the Thanksgiving feast they might otherwise be enjoying back home with friends and families.\nOn Thanksgiving, they sat in the restaurants around the convention center staring at empty white plates, with armbands that read, ''Fasting: Ask Me Why.''\nThree of them sat at a table with two White House officials who picked self-consciously at their lunches but gamely conversed with the students.\nAmanda Long, a Wesleyan University student from Wappingers Falls, N.Y., said, ''The U.S. should really take the lead on these things.''\nJohn Gibson, a member of the American delegation, said that the negotiators were doing the best they could, but that they had to find some compromise that would protect the environment while satisfying the Senate, which must approve a treaty by a two-thirds majority.\n''It wouldn't do the environment much good to sign an agreement that will never be ratified,'' he said.\nLate Thanksgiving night, the students put on a performance of ''The Lorax,'' the environmental parable by Dr. Seuss. At the same time, an energy industry group held a reception in the basement, serving sliced turkey and cranberry sauce while a tape of Monday night's National Football League game between the Redskins and the Rams played on a projection television.\nThen it was time for one of the final crunch sessions, with the conference president calling a late-night session to order.\nAround 1 a.m. today, as bleary delegates filed into the meeting, Mr. Jones, Ms. Sawin and a half-dozen other students joined a gantlet of campaigners and lobbyists handing out fliers pinpointing problems with the latest negotiating positions.\nThe talks had developed a momentum that largely shrugged off their efforts. Most of the leaflets would end up on the floor.\n''The big issue here should be the environment,'' Ms. Sawin said, ''but it's at the bottom of the list.''\nTheir 24-hour fast could have ended an hour earlier, but none of the students seemed to be thinking about food.",

    "text": "Food; Kitchen Confidential\n2000-09-17T05:00:00.000Z\nThere are those who celebrate the ''melting pot'' -- a mythic caldron constantly bubbling far-flung flavors until they become bland and commonplace -- and there are those who worry the caldron. The authentic, say the latter, is, by definition, ''unmeltable,'' and can exist only apart from mainstream taste.\nNeither camp disputes the inevitability that time and the mass market will eventually erode distinctions. But along the way, the collision between the familiar and the foreign offers experiences of flavor, hope and revelation that, like so many bubbles in the pot, are the essence of a living, changing cuisine.\nIn large ports of entry like New York, where, at last count, more than 100,000 legal aliens from well over 100 countries settle and cook each year, you can smell the future on the streets in the vying aromas of ethnic cuisines wafting from carts and holes in the wall. And, increasingly, you can catch the vibrant sputter as the arriviste and the established meet in some of the country's finest restaurants.\nLegions of newly arrived immigrants working as dishwashers and runners start to inform menus. At the Lobster Club in New York, for instance, the chef, Anne Rosenzweig, was swayed by the staff meals prepared by the restaurant's Bangladeshi busboys. ''The spicing was so elegant and delicious,'' she recalls, ''that I found myself drawing from it, inventing things like the corn fritters we serve.''\nInspiration, rather than literal duplication, is usually the result. Eleven Madison Park, where Nick Oltarsh is the executive sous-chef, offers a lamb dish Oltarsh created when he was over at Gramercy Tavern and observed the Dominican prep cooks.\nMichelle Bernstein, the chef at the Strand in Miami Beach, was so intrigued by the techniques and flavors used by her Peruvian prep cook, Miguel Puelles, that she visited his homeland. Her Jamaican sous-chef, Sara Mair, also influences her menus.\nContrasts between the unknown and the established are part of what makes food worth eating. David Waltuck, Chanterelle's chef, describes such ''boundary-crossing moments'' in his book ''Staff Meals From Chanterelle,'' written with Melicia Phillips, which will be published next month by Workman.\nBoundary crossing is never safe and always fleeting. The shock of an unfamiliar flavor happens in moments -- before the new colors on the culinary palate grow matte and tacky, before the inexorable melting begins.\nMiguel's Ceviche\n(Adapted from Michelle Bernstein, The Strand, Miami Beach)\n8 jumbo shrimp, shelled, deveined and cut into 1/2-inch chunks\n6 ounces grouper fillet, cut into 1/2-inch chunks\n1 tablespoon peeled, minced ginger\n1 teaspoon peeled, minced garlic\n1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste\n2 lemons\n2 limes\n2 ears corn, shucked\n12 mussels, scrubbed\n12 clams, shucked, juice reserved\n12 oysters, shucked, juice reserved\nLeaves from 1 bunch cilantro, chopped\n3 tablespoons minced red onion\n1tablespoon minced celery.\n1. In a small, nonreactive bowl, combine the shrimp, grouper, ginger, garlic and 1 teaspoon of salt. Add the juice of 1 lemon and the juice of 1 lime. Toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.\n2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add corn and boil for 5 minutes. Cool in a bowl of cold water. Remove, pat dry and use a large knife to cut the kernels from the cob. Discard the cobs and refrigerate the kernels.\n3. Place a cup of water in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the mussels, cover the pan and steam until the mussels just open, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain immediately and set aside. When cool enough to handle, remove the mussel meat and refrigerate, discarding the shells and any unopened mussels.\n4. Drain excess liquid from the shrimp and grouper and transfer to a large bowl. Add the corn, mussels, clams and oysters with their juice, cilantro, onion and celery. Add juice of the remaining lime and lemon and toss. Season with salt to taste. Divide the mixture among 4 small plates or martini glasses and serve.\nYield: 4 appetizers.\nSpicy Corn Fritters\n(Adapted from ANNE ROSENZWEIG, the Lobster Club, New York City)\n3/4 cup flour\n2 tablespoons yellow cornmeal\n1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n1/8 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric\n1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds\n1/2 teaspoon garam masala\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste\n1/2 cup milk\n2 tablespoons buttermilk\n1 cup fresh or well-drained defrosted corn kernels\nCanola oil for deep frying.\n1. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, turmeric, cumin seeds, garam masala, cayenne, pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Whisk until thoroughly combined. Pour in the milk and buttermilk and stir until just mixed. Stir in the corn.\n2. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add oil to a depth of 1 1/2 inches. When the oil is very hot, working in batches, drop in rounded tablespoons of the batter and fry, turning the fritters occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with salt and serve hot with corn chowder or clam chowder or on their own as an appetizer.\nYield: 4 servings.\nSara's Sweetbread Fricassee\n(adapted from Michelle Bernstein, The Strand, Miami Beach)\n1 pound calves' sweetbreads\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n1 tablespoon canola oil\nKosher salt to taste\n1/3 cup flour\n2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped\n1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped\n1 bunch scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced\n3 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced\n4 1/4 cups chicken stock\n3 tablespoons tomato paste\n1 tablespoon Pickapeppa or Worcestershire sauce\n1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1 bunch fresh thyme\n1 whole green Scotch bonnet chili\n3 whole allspice berries\n1 clove\n1 bay leaf\nFreshly ground black pepper to taste.\n1. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil and add sweetbreads. Simmer for 10 minutes. Drain, cool sweetbreads in a bowl of cold water, remove and peel away any membrane. Cut into 1-inch-thick slices.\n2. Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Salt the sweetbread pieces and dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Add to skillet when the butter has melted. Cook, turning once, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Add the carrots, onion, scallions and garlic, shaking the skillet occasionally, until the vegetables are just tender, 3 to 4 minutes.\n3. Add the stock, tomato paste, Pickapeppa sauce and nutmeg to the skillet. Tie the thyme, whole chili, allspice berries, clove and bay leaf in a square of cheesecloth and add to the skillet. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the liquid is thickened and reduced by about 1/2, 30 to 35 minutes.\n4. Remove skillet from the heat. Discard cheesecloth bundle. Season with salt and pepper and serve.\nYield: 4 servings.\nDominican Braised Lamb\n(Adapted from Nick Oltarsh, Eleven Madison Park, New York)\nFor the lamb:\n2 tablespoons canola oil\n4 lamb shanks, trimmed of excess fat\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n10 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed\n6 cups chicken stock\n2 teaspoons capers with liquid\n2 sprigs fresh thyme\n2 sprigs fresh tarragon or 3/4teaspoon dried tarragon\n1/4 Scotch bonnet chili\nFor the sauce:\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n1/2 onion, chopped\n1 stalk celery, chopped\n1/2 green bell pepper, chopped\n1 1/2 shallots, peeled and minced\n3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n228-ounce cans plum tomatoes, drained\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n2 tablespoons sugar\n2 teaspoons capers, with liquid\n1 small sliver Scotch bonnet chili\nKosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste\n1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves.\n1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. To make the lamb, in the bottom of a large Dutch oven or braising pan, heat the oil over high heat. Sprinkle lamb shanks with salt and pepper and cook until seared all over. Remove shanks, drain excess oil and return shanks to the pan. Add garlic, chicken stock, capers and enough cold water to just cover the shanks. In a square of cheesecloth, tie together the thyme, tarragon and Scotch bonnet and add to the pan.\n2. Return the pan to high heat and bring just to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover the pan and bake in the oven until the meat is very tender and begins to pull away from the bone, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and cool. Discard the cheesecloth bundle.\n3. To make the sauce, in a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, bell pepper, shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Using your hands, squeeze as much excess liquid from the drained tomatoes as possible. Add the tomatoes to the pan along with the tomato paste, sugar and 1 teaspoon of the capers. Add 2 1/2 cups of the liquid the lamb shanks were cooked in. Tie the sliver of Scotch bonnet in a piece of cheesecloth and add. Bring to a boil, adjust the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1/2hour.\n4. Remove and discard the cheesecloth bundle. Working in batches, carefully puree the mixture in a blender. Return the sauce to the pan. If it is very thick, whisk in more of the lamb cooking liquid. Season with salt and pepper.\n5. When ready to serve, reheat the lamb shanks in their liquid on top of the stove. Stir the remaining teaspoon of capers into the sauce and reheat if necessary. Place a lamb shank on each of 4 deep plates. Cover with sauce and sprinkle with cilantro. Serve immediately.\nYield: 4 servings.",

    "text": "SUMMER AT P.S. 19: A special report.; 5 Weeks to Alter the Course Of Education in Young Lives\n2000-08-05T05:00:00.000Z\nShukria Akhtar wants to be a doctor when she grows up. Tidy in the loose tunic, slacks and scarf prescribed by her Muslim religion, she seems temperamentally well suited for the job. She is gentle, caring and patient. There is one hitch: she is 10 years old, going into fifth grade, but still reading and calculating at kindergarten level.\nSo in this monsoon summer in New York City, Shukria is spending most of her days in a second-floor classroom at Public School 19 in the East Village. Between stealing glances out the window to check on prospects for swimming, she haltingly sounds out double vowels and adds 6 plus 3. Shukria might save lives some day. But only, her teacher says, if her life can be turned around first.\nShukria, who came to the United States from Pakistan three years ago, is among 327,000 New York City public school children in kindergarten through 12th grade who are so far behind in their studies this year that their teachers have either urged or ordered them to go to summer school. Many of those in elementary school and middle school are at risk of being held back, in one of the most radical efforts to end the system's traditional policy of automatically promoting students.\nShukria's class is a mix of immigrant children still shaky in their new language -- some after being illiterate in their old language -- and native-born classmates hobbled by poverty, by broken families, by emotional problems, by parents who are too drained after work to take them to the library or help with homework.\nTheir teacher has five weeks -- from July 6 to Aug. 10 -- to reverse or at least slow down the runaway train to becoming a dropout that Shukria and many of her summer school classmates are on. When the summer session began, the chances of success seemed as remote as Shukria's were of realizing her dream of being a doctor. But as the days have gone by, there have been signs of progress: Leonda's sudden grasp, after nine months of trying, of how to round off numbers; Ting's carefully written autobiography; Cecily's increasing awareness of the ''ed'' endings on words in the past tense.\nPart of the reason for the progress is the small number of students -- 15 -- in the class, a result of the otherwise troublingly high truancy rate in summer school.\nThe class started out with all the drawbacks of a school in a poor urban neighborhood. Their teacher, Greta Bouterse, is fairly new to the profession and has only provisional state certification. Tests administered on the first day of summer school showed reading levels ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade, yet one teacher working with a single curriculum was expected to reach them all.\nMiss Bouterse had previously taught only 4 of the 15 children attending her class. Normally, she said, it takes from September to December to win the trust of her students; this time, she would have to do it within days.\nBefore summer school opened, Harold O. Levy, the schools chancellor, warned that teachers could not be expected to make up for a year of failure in five weeks. Making his rounds at P.S. 19 one day, the principal, Ivan Kushner, wondered if Mr. Levy had been wrong. Mr. Kushner marveled at how calm and focused the children were. ''This is the answer,'' he said. ''You don't need Sylvan Learning and all that other stuff. This is like a private school.''\nDiscovering the Children\nOn the first day of summer school, Miss Bouterse arrived in room 4-205 to find an ethnic panoply. There was Ting Ting Chen, the elegant, birdlike Chinese girl, whose comprehension and abstract thinking far outstrips her ability to express herself in English. Across from Ting sat Sayyid Choudhury, who emigrated from Bangladesh 10 months ago and has become addicted to the stock ticker of the Financial News Network on television.\nThere was Stephen Williams, who travels 45 minutes on the No. 4 train and the L train to school, because his father believes that P.S. 19 is better than schools in the South Bronx, where they live. Stephen spent much of the day with his head on his desk, barely able to stay awake. Later, his father told Miss Bouterse that Stephen takes seizure medication, which makes him drowsy.\nTrying to discover something about the children besides their test scores, Miss Bouterse asked them to write down three wishes. When some children wrote down only one, she concluded that they had trouble following directions.\nSome, like Rahman Mohibur, revealed a strong drive to succeed. ''I wish I stayed in my country. I wish I could be president. I wish I could buy a building,'' he wrote.\nJesenia Gomez, a quiet girl who failed fourth grade, wished for a baby. Leonda Turner showed hints of the spunky attitude and complex emotional life that would become clearer in the days ahead: ''I want to be rich. I want my family to be together.''\nJustin Pertuz had written: ''I like to sing.'' Looking in his direction, Miss Bouterse giggled when she found him mouthing the words to a song while dancing in his chair.\nBy all appearances, they were ordinary children. What brought them together was that they had scored in either Level 1, the lowest level on the state reading test, or Level 2, still below standards.\nUsing the techniques she is learning at Hunter College, where she is studying for a master's degree in education, Miss Bouterse gave the students a sight-reading test. Their ability to recognize words ranged from kindergarten level (''big, did, funny'') to fifth grade (''bracket, shred, yonder''). Sayyid was reading at the fifth-grade level, but did not understand the words he was pronouncing. His problem, Miss Bouterse concluded, was his lack of vocabulary.\nThe math test confirmed that Sayyid's problem was verbal. He breezed through the multiple choice questions, getting all the calculations right. But on an item that asked whether minus-4 was a negative or a positive number, he confidently picked positive. Numbers less than zero are positive, he said, and those greater than zero are negative.\n''If someone said, 'You're a good boy,' is that a positive or negative statement?'' Sayyid was asked. ''Negative,'' he replied.\nIn the time that Ting took to solve more than 30 problems, showing her work in exacting detail, Brittany Aldea shaded the answer bubbles for four questions, showing no work. Confronted with dollar signs, fractions and decimal points, Shukria was completely stumped.\nHow was Miss Bouterse going to deal with this mishmash of abilities in the days ahead? ''That's the challenge,'' she said.\n'Those Crazy Body Counts'\nOn the first day of school, Mr. Kushner reported 95 out of about 150 students attending, roughly the same as the 60 percent attendance rate citywide. As elsewhere, some students at P.S. 19 are required to attend, or they will be held back; and some have been encouraged to attend, but will be promoted anyway.\nMr. Kushner was puzzled by the chancellor's embarrassment in trying to explain the low numbers citywide to the news media. But he was not surprised by the numbers themselves. The letter urging students to attend summer school was ''kind of an invitation,'' he said. He had known since June which students would not be there.\n''This reminds me of Vietnam,'' said Mr. Kushner, summer casual in a Hawaiian shirt. ''All those crazy body counts.''\nBetter attendance would cause problems. If the no-shows in Miss Bouterse's class suddenly appeared, she would have 25 students instead of 15. ''This is how we planned it,'' Mr. Kushner said.\nMiss Bouterse was delighted by her small class. It was about half the size of her regular fourth-grade class, and she got to know the children more quickly and intimately than she had expected. The children seemed more motivated, too. Even the habitual latecomers, like Brittany, usually arrived on time.\nBy the end of the first week, Miss Bouterse knew the abilities and quirks of every child, and could tailor the curriculum to fit. She gave Shukria handwritten sheets of double-digit addition and subtraction problems, telling her to ignore the story problems that everyone else was doing. During writing sessions, Miss Bouterse had time to give instant feedback, reading and correcting almost everyone's essay on the spot.\nIn a class of 30, Miss Bouterse said, some children are so distracting that they cheat the other children of attention, and some children are so quiet that you forget they are there.\nThe day lasted just four and a half hours, from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., broken into segments for math, phonics, grammar, reading and writing. The Board of Education did not provide snacks, so Miss Bouterse bought pretzels and oatmeal cookies on her own. As they ate, the children colored cardboard scraps to make a patchwork quilt about their families, the theme of the curriculum.\nOften, the classroom was so hushed that it sounded like a library. Only the air-conditioner blasting in one window marred the peace. During literature discussions, Miss Bouterse got in the habit of switching it off so the children could hear one another.\nThe first time she did this, the silence was deafening. ''AaaaahhhCHOOOO!'' Leonda said, playfully feigning a sneeze to break the tension.\n''Clown,'' Miss Bouterse teased back.\nOut of a Soap Opera\nAt the end of each day, Miss Bouterse hands out little happy-face stickers to those who have behaved, and Leonda is as eager for hers as anyone. On the first day of class, the children made up nicknames for everyone, and Miss Bouterse wrote them in colored marker on a poster that she clipped to one of several clotheslines stretched across the room. As the days go by, posters accumulate like clean laundry.\nLeonda's nickname, Loving Leonda, turns out to be uncannily apt. A compact, restless girl with tightly braided hair, she is always smiling or laughing. Miss Bouterse has to separate her from Justin, the would-be singer, who likes to gossip with the girls.\nDuring listening time, Miss Bouterse is reading ''Jenny Archer, Author,'' to the class. When Jenny Archer talks about watching soap operas, Leonda is the only child who can describe a soap opera with precision: ''People get sick. Car accidents. Airplane accidents,'' she says.\nSometimes, it seems that Leonda's life is a soap opera. For her quilt square, she colors a picture of herself as a baby, sitting in a walker, next to a tall man. ''This is my father,'' she says. ''He died.''\nMiss Bouterse is impressed by how absorbed the children are in Jenny Archer's story. She departs from the prescribed curriculum to propose that the children write their autobiographies, as Jenny Archer does in the book. Miss Bouterse wants them to write their real life story and then what she calls their ''unreal'' life story, just like Jenny.\n''Yes!'' Leonda exclaims. Fantasy books are her favorite kind, she says.\nShe already knows what she is going to write about in her unreal autobiography. ''How my father raised from the dead.''\nThe Substitute\nFor her 30th birthday, Miss Bouterse, her sister and their friends spend a long weekend in Las Vegas. Miss Bouterse will miss class on Monday, and Mr. Kushner assigns Matty Billig, the reading teacher, to substitute. She knows most of the children already, Mr. Kushner explains, so she will be able to handle the class better than a complete stranger.\nMiss Bouterse has left behind a blow by blow schedule, written out by hand, with the comment, ''They're a good group!''\nMs. Billig starts with choral reading, something that Miss Bouterse does not do. The children enjoy it, but become increasingly rowdy. Leonda blows kisses to an imaginary audience. Cecily Darby takes on the sour-mouthed, squinty-eyed expression she gets when she is thinking about being held back. Ms. Billig, who has emerald green eyes and bright red hair, keeps smiling, but her tone does not match her expression.\nEvery time the children misbehave, Ms. Billig orders them to check the list of responsibilities hanging on the laundry line and to recite the relevant rule. They check the list, forgotten until now, a lot.\nWhen Ms. Billig hands out the graham crackers Miss Bouterse has left in her desk drawer, Stephen takes snack time as his cue to rush excitedly across the room to fetch markers, for the patchwork quilt. Ms. Billig stops him cold. ''Stephen. Can I ask a question?'' she demands. ''Why are you over there?'' As the children eat, the substitute patrols for crumbs, fretting about roaches and mice.\nWhen it's time for the math problem of the day, Sayyid writes his solution on the chalkboard. As usual, his calculations are meticulously correct, written in his ornate, Arabic-looking script. ''Are you sure you put everything in there?'' Ms. Billig asks. ''Are you sure?'' She tells the class that she was one of the graders on the state math test. Sayyid's mistake, she says, is that he put just one vertical slash through the dollar sign, when he should have put two.\nTo Leonda, she says: ''You knew how to explain it, you just couldn't do the math right. So you should have explained it, and gotten points off for math.'' Leonda looks bemused.\nAt noon, with just an hour to go, the class is barely under control, like a pot boiling while the lid rattles. Ms. Billig looks over at Leonda and sees that she has been washing her hands under her desk in white, sticky Elmer's glue. Leonda explains that Brittany Aldea dared her to do it. ''I believe it,'' Ms. Billig says.\nAt the end of the day, six children do not get happy-face stickers, more than ever before.\nThe Teacher Comes Back\nMiss Bouterse returns from Las Vegas at 4:30 in the morning on Tuesday and barely has time to wash her face before arriving in class. She is in a good mood. Instead of the usual baby pink, she has painted her toenails a wilder shade of fuchsia. Today's ''Literacy Warmup,'' in which the children must correct grammar, spelling and punctuation, is: ''who is you're favrite entertainer i like billy crystal, RoBin Williams, and nathan LaNe, I like the People who make me lagh.''\nMiss Bouterse grew up in Plainview, N.J., the youngest of three sisters. She took dance lessons growing up, and she still takes classes at Chelsea Piers. Sometimes, she will pirouette while handing a child a pencil or a piece of chalk. When Leonda mastered estimation, Miss Bouterse waved her arms like Goldie Hawn in a go-go dance for joy.\nShe realized by the time she went to college at Rutgers that she was not going to dance professionally. She came to P.S. 19 to teach an after-school program in computers and the arts, and Mr. Kushner spotted something special in her. ''I grabbed her,'' he says now, and put her in charge of a third-grade class.\nShe acknowledges that her teaching has improved during her three years in the classroom. ''I look back at things I did my first year. . . .'' she starts to say, then stops, perhaps thinking better of confessing too much.\nStill Reading Below Standards\nOne of the sore spots in Miss Bouterse's career is Cecily, whom Miss Bouterse taught as a first-year teacher. In third grade, Cecily scored below the 10th percentile in reading and in math, after accumulating weeks of absences, partly because of asthma. Miss Bouterse believed she had no choice but to hold her back, and recommended testing for special education.\nCecily's mother, Linda Darby, was furious and refused to allow her to be tested. Ms. Darby recalled that she did not want her daughter to be ''labeled.'' Miss Bouterse says she was baffled by Cecily's low achievement and hoped that the testing might shed some light on how to help.\nCecily repeated third grade. But two years later, she is still reading below standards, a low Level 2, on the state test.\nLinda Darby is a single mother working two jobs, one in the city morgue and the other at Bellevue Hospital Center. She lives in a Harlem housing project. Cecily's small room is as neat as a museum, with her toys arranged on the floor and magazine pictures of Britney Spears, Destiny's Child and other teen idols taped to the walls.\nBut Cecily is rarely there. During the week, she stays with her grandmother on the Lower East Side, near P.S. 19; she goes home on weekends.\nAmong her classmates, Cecily stands out like Gulliver among the Lilliputians. She was big at birth, 12 pounds, her mother says. Now 11, she could pass for 16. When Cecily was held back, ''Me and her talk,'' Ms. Darby said. ''I told her, 'Cecily, you're a strong young lady. You'll be all right with it.' And she was all right.''\nThe High Achievers\nSayyid Choudhury and Ting Ting Chen seem out of place in a summer school program that is designed to be remedial. Sayyid's father was a philosophy professor at a community college in Bangladesh, and Sayyid was a top student in his country. He keeps his awards for scholarship proudly taped to the wall of his family's two-room tenement on East 11th Street.\nBelow the awards stands a rickety table, covered in a plastic cloth, where he and his younger sister, Zerin, take turns doing their homework. Sayyid has checked out a paperback copy of ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' from the Tompkins Square library. ''Some words is hard, so you can look in the dictionary,'' he says earnestly, gesturing toward his Bengali-English dictionary.\nHis uncle, Raz, shares the apartment with the family. Raz, 28, has been running a convenience store on 14th Street with an older brother for seven years. Amadou Diallo peddled his wares outside the shop. Raz dabbles in day-trading, and has taught Sayyid about the stock market. ''In Bangladesh, we were rich,'' Raz says. ''We had two houses, a Jeep.'' Here, they are poor. But Sayyid's strong education in his home country gives him a strong foundation at P.S. 19.\nWith only 10 months in the United States, Sayyid was exempt from the standardized tests. But Ting, a Chinese immigrant, scored a 1, the lowest level, on the reading test.\nMiss Bouterse suspects that the graders could not see past Ting's broken English and idiosyncratic grammar to her high level of thinking. ''The test does not reflect what my little Ting can do,'' she says.\n'This Is My Life'\nIn late July, the students in Miss Bouterse's class turned in their ''real'' autobiographies.\nSayyid's brims with masculine bravado. ''When I was five years I learned to play soccer. Seven and a half years old I learned to play cricket. . . . We got many trophies,'' he wrote. ''Now I attend summer school at Mrs. Bouterse class because I like school and I don't like to stay at home.''\nCecily's exudes vulnerability. ''Then I meet new friends like Crystal but they wasn't good because I got lefted back in the third grade and they went to fourth and they acted like they didn't know me,'' she wrote breathlessly.\nLeonda's, scribbled on the back of another homework sheet, is full of the impish brio that so irked the substitute teacher. ''My life is just like any other child's life,'' she began. ''My brother is nice, he keeps a lot of my secrets. . . . My sister says I have big feet. My mom and brother say I have a apple head. My little sister just bother me and my teacher is the best. I know this is a boring story but this is my life.''\nTing wrote four chapters, beginning with her birth by Caesarean section in China and ending with a disaster that turned out to be just a bad dream. ''One day I went to sleep. I was dreaming. I dream that I fell of the stair. It scary to me. I was felling, felling and felling.\n''Then when I fell at the end of the stair. My body is hurting so much.\n''When it hurt so much then I say ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. The I wake up and it only a dream. I went back to sleep.''\nShukria's autobiography is nearly indecipherable (although her spoken English is good). She came to the United States in 1997, entering third grade in Queens, and it is not clear whether she was literate in Urdu, the language she still speaks at home. She came to P.S. 19 in the fall of 1998, and repeated fourth grade this year.\nYet Shukria has learned more math in three weeks of summer school than in three years before that. She no longer gets 0 when she adds 0 to a bigger number. She has been weaned from counting on her fingers, to counting with colored tiles, to memorizing most addition combinations up to 12. She has perfected borrowing and carrying to the hundreds place.\nMaybe, Ms. Bouterse ventures, Shukria will go to medical school after all.",

No radiation leaks were reported. The shutdown occurred just days after Ukraine announced that the reactor, No. 3, next to the fire-scarred No. 4 reactor now encased in concrete and steel, would be closed for good on Dec. 15. But officials said they would restart No. 3 on Dec. 2 for a final two weeks. Patrick E.

Mr. Kohl is accused of having accepted $116,000 in donations in 1997-98 that were intended for his Christian Democratic Union, and using the money outside the party's budget. The new accusations may be combined with existing charges. Mr. Kohl admitted in December to receiving about $1 million in party contributions between 1993 and 1998 and illegally failing to declare them.

In Budapest during World War II, Wallenberg saved at least 20,000 Jews by issuing them Swedish passports. He was last seen on Jan. 17, 1945, on his way to meet commanders of Soviet troops occupying Hungary. The official Soviet account said the diplomat, 34, died of a heart attack in a Soviet prison in July 1947. But Aleksandr Yakovlev, chairman of the commission, said, ''We do not doubt that he was shot in the Lubyanka prison,'' and he expressed confidence that President Vladimir V.

    "text": "In a Looted Sierra Leone House, The Riddle of a Rebel Chieftain\n2000-05-10T05:00:00.000Z\nAfter a night of looting, the abandoned house of the notorious rebel leader Foday Sankoh had been stripped of almost everything this morning. Looters had left gaping holes in the brick walls where air-conditioners had kept out West Africa's stifling heat, and they had absconded with every piece of furniture, clothes and item of value.\nOutside the house, seven bodies, most of them Mr. Sankoh's guards, lay stiff. Inside, the looters left behind only some garbage and scraps of paper.\nAmong them were pages from an original copy of the 10-month-old peace accord and an original copy of a document in which Sierra Leone's president granted Mr. Sankoh -- the man responsible for a terror campaign that left thousands of men, women and children killed or maimed -- ''absolute and free pardon.'' That allowed him to live, join a power-sharing government, form his political party and, eventually, run for president.\nAt least that is how the peace process was supposed to go.\nInstead, Foday Sankoh, the legendary survivor, a jungle fighter with barely a primary school education, a failed commercial photographer, a cashiered corporal of Sierra Leone's army, has succeeded in turning his small country into a big problem for the world, and a policy quagmire for the West. [News analysis, Page A10.]\nMr. Sankoh has humiliated the United Nations. He has embarrassed the West, including the Clinton administration.\nAnd now, after a confrontation outside his house on Monday, in which his bodyguards killed at least four civilians while 75 United Nations peacekeepers watched helplessly, he has disappeared.\nHas he vanished into the bush? Did a rival militia kidnap him? Was he even alive? The United Nations force said it did not have him, and did not know his whereabouts. In the confusion on Monday, United Nations peacekeepers fled from the compound and apparently did not return in time to see what happened to Mr. Sankoh.\n''We are anxious to find a way of contacting Mr. Sankoh for reasons that I think are clear to all,'' David Wimhurst, the spokesman for the United Nations force, said at a news conference.\nThe reasons related to the fact that 498 United Nations soldiers and civilians are being held hostage by Mr. Sankoh's men.\nIn the confusion, the United Nations is trying to sort out what it can do to restore order. Thousands of fresh troops from Jordan, India and Bangladesh are expected to arrive sooner than originally planned to operate under the United Nations flag. In addition, Washington has sent a military team to Nigeria so that two Nigerian battalions can be deployed here as a West African force.\nThat came a mere week after the Nigerians left Sierra Leone and Mr. Sankoh seized on their departure to attack the United Nations force.\nThe streets of Freetown remained tense today as British paratroopers evacuated hundreds of Europeans. The paratroopers, who arrived on Monday, were not expected to take part in the United Nations force, though many could be seen today operating checkpoints and patrolling near the United Nations headquarters.\nOutside the capital, Nigerian and Guinean soldiers for the United Nations abandoned the junction town of Masiaka, about 35 miles east of here, after they ran out of ammunition, Mr. Wimhurst said. Mr. Sankoh's loyalists were thought to be advancing toward Freetown. Kamajors, traditional hunters who have been allied with the government, as well as supporters of a military junta that briefly controlled Sierra Leone in 1997, could be seen heading east out of the capital.\nAs the United Nations force began losing its grip on the country in recent days, the country's main militias re-emerged, creating again the sense of lawlessness and anarchy that long pervaded Sierra Leone. New alliances appear to have formed, most significantly between the government and the 1997 junta, which was allied with Mr. Sankoh until last year.\nThe 1997 junta is headed by Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who, like Mr. Sankoh, was a member of this power-sharing government. Most residents of Freetown, particularly those living around Mr. Sankoh's abandoned house, seem convinced that Colonel Koroma had captured Mr. Sankoh.\nInside Colonel Koroma's house this morning and afternoon -- where young men in sweatsuits carried automatic rifles and walked up and down a staircase above which hung a sign that read ''Peace'' -- men talked of waiting for arms supplies from the government so they could go fight Mr. Sankoh.\nColonel Koroma was too busy to talk, his aides said. But his personal bodyguard, known as Hiroshima Bomb, who wore a skirt and a tank top over chest muscles of steel, and a necklace of ammunition rounds, explained the new alliance.\n''We fight the R.U.F.,'' the bodyguard said of Mr. Sankoh's organization. And of the government that he had tried to topple only last year, he now said, ''It's my father, my brother.''\nWhat happens next to Sierra Leone will depend in great part on whether Mr. Sankoh is alive or dead.\nOutside Mr. Sankoh's ruined house today, a local man, Michael Kamara, 50, said Mr. Sankoh's involvement was essential to resolving the nine-year civil war.\n''He needs to express himself to the people,'' Mr. Kamara said. But what if he is dead? ''Peace will take its course,'' he said.\n''Power and wealth to the people,'' read a poster in front of Mr. Sankoh's destroyed house.\nIt was with that message that Mr. Sankoh began a civil war from the bush in 1991. The message struck a chord. Sierra Leone, rich with diamonds, had long been controlled by a corrupt elite made up of Lebanese businessmen and urban Sierra Leoneans. Many of those Sierra Leoneans were descendants of the freed slaves who gave the capital its name and formed a privileged class.\nMr. Sankoh represented the rural dispossessed.\nOver time, Mr. Sankoh, who is in his 60's, seemed driven by ambition for power. His ally, Charles Taylor, a guerrilla fighter who terrorized Liberia into making him its president, provided the overall strategy: single out civilians and make their suffering so great that they will make you president just to stop the suffering.\nEventually, Mr. Sankoh's group began committing the atrocities that defined this war: chopping off people's hands and arms. Belgian colonialists had done that decades ago to rule their colony in Central Africa, the Congo. But Mr. Sankoh infused the strategy with a contemporary significance: his men cut people's hands off because they had used them to vote in 1997 for the current president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.\nNo hand, no more vote, his men said, as they chopped off limbs with machetes and axes.\nMr. Sankoh clearly did not believe in elections, preferring the military option.\nSince the peace accord was signed in July, he has delayed laying down his weapons and has obstructed peacekeepers from deploying, especially in the diamond district, where his men have kept digging. Now it is believed that they are better financed and equipped.\nInside Mr. Sankoh's gutted house, in a second-floor room designated ''confidential office'' and marked ''out of bounds to all,'' motivational messages decorated the walls.\n''There are three kinds of people,'' one read. ''Those who make things happen. Those who watch things happen. Those who wonder what happened.''\nMr. Sankoh, if he is alive, certainly sees himself in the first category, and has gambled that the international community will fall into one of the other two.",

    "text": "Kite Fighting for Keeps, And Losers Float Away; Pakistani and Afghan Competitors Use Cutting String in Fierce Aerial Battles\n2000-07-18T05:00:00.000Z\nA dozen Pakistani men from New Jersey, some in the gauzy tunics and pants called shalwar kameez, clambered out of their van at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. With scrupulous friendliness, they greeted a group of similarly attired men from New York. Forming a double receiving line, they took turns giving each other brief, one-armed hugs and Muslim salutations before proceeding to a Sunday lunch of halim, a viscous beef stew, scooped up with pieces of flat bread called nan.\nThen they entered the field of battle.\nIt was a circular, fenced-in area intended (and F.A.A.-approved) for flying model airplanes. These men, though, would fly kites. Not fanciful contraptions of balsa wood designed to swoop gracefully on curtains of wind, but lean fighting kites, with their battle scars patched with Scotch tape and their strings coated with powdered glass, all the better to cut loose the kite of one's opponent.\nAfter wrapping their hands with duct tape to protect them from the glass, one man from each team began to launch their kites, standing about 200 feet apart. The wind was strong -- one flier estimated it was twice the ideal speed of 9 miles an hour -- and the kites swiftly dwindled to tiny dots in the sky, unspooling up to 1,000 yards of line apiece.\nTugging on the taut strings, the two men maneuvered their fighters until their strings crossed, and then tried to use friction or speed to snap the enemy's line. When it became clear that a line had been cut, the winning team would give a shout.\nThese limousine drivers, business owners and Wall Street consultants learned to ''cut'' kites as children, standing on the rooftops and in the fields of Pakistan. In the last few years, they have rediscovered the custom, meeting on evenings and weekends in the park to compete.\nOn an earlier evening, Basit Mian of Jamaica, Queens, had barely gotten all the way out of his convertible Supra before he started flying. ''It's like a sport back in Pakistan,'' he said. ''They don't consider it too good, though. People who don't study, don't go to school, they cut kites.''\nBut what was once a juvenile pastime is now a costly hobby. ''People are spending literally hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' Fayyaz Mehmood said proudly. Mr. Mehmood, 38, a convenience store clerk in Trenton who was in Queens to defend his team's earlier victory against New York, pointed out Mohammed Malik, 47, who owns a meatpacking company and is the New Jersey team's captain and principal financier.\nThe kites, which are brought over from Pakistan, ordered on the Internet or bought at neighborhood stores, cost $2 to $3 each (a kite that gets cut is usually gone for good; a winning kite often sustains small rips and tears). The glass-coated string costs about $22 a roll. And each team has a macho version of a spinning wheel spindle: a DeWalt power drill that attaches to the spool to rewind the string.\nThere are other expenses. The Meadow Kite Flyers carry their kites in blue nylon bags emblazoned with the name of the club. They have traveled to Pakistan, where they helped organize an international competition which they won. Some of them founded the Kite Flying Association of the United States, and members are also stateside contacts for the World Control Board of Kite Flying, based in Pakistan. They boast of the Basant Mala, a festival to be held in the model airplane field on July 28. There will be free food and music from 8 p.m. until the wee hours, thanks to the generosity of members. And the sky will be filled with 5,000 free, ghostly white kites.\nThe club members like to think that both their lavish spending and that they are American will help elevate the sport to its proper place in the world pantheon of competitive events. Members even dream of Olympic kite fighting.\nThough kites were invented 2,500 years ago, probably in China, this type of kite fighting is said to have originated in India. The kites are made of simple colored tissue paper and bamboo. Indian fighting kites are diamond shaped, like the kite a child would draw. Pakistanis fly mostly kites shaped like hawks.\nThe head-to-head combat rules here are straightforward: the winner is the last kite flying.\nThe game is played differently elsewhere. In Japan, kite fighters stand on opposite sides of a river and fly rokkaku, or six-sided kites. In Brazil the piao fighters are shaped like spinning tops. In Thailand, there is no cutting. Instead, kite fighting there is a battle of the sexes, in which the chula, or ''male'' kite, and the pakpao, a smaller ''female'' kite, try to knock each other to the ground.\nThough kite fighting doesn't require much physical exertion, the Pakistani kite cutters show their dedication in other ways. One member of the New York Meadow Kite Flyers took his mother to the airport five hours before her flight to Pakistan in order to make it to the park that afternoon. ''You have to put the effort behind your culture,'' he said.\nThe Pakistani-Americans were not the only kite cutters in the park that Sunday. While they tallied their scores (it was neck and neck), the parking lot to the north filled with unaffiliated players looking for a pickup game. Most of them were from Afghanistan, where cutting competitions are organized by the government.\nGenerally speaking, the Pakistanis play down in the field, the Afghans up in the parking lot. But what separates them is not nationality. It is their differing philosophies concerning string.\nSeveral Pakistani teammates explained that they use manjha, an imported cotton string with a glue and glass coating applied by hand. American kite-flying groups, who have modified kite fighting into a series of symbolic maneuvers with no cutting, frown on glass-coated strings, saying that they are a safety hazard. Although the string feels like rough sandpaper and does indeed cut unprotected skin, Sheryar Choudhry, a kite fighter from Queens, later insisted that glass coating was no longer used.\nThe Afghans prefer ''chemical line,'' which is much like fishing line, and which the Pakistanis say is dangerous and has been outlawed in their home country. Some people said chemical line, too, was glass-coated, while others said it was soaked in an acidic chemical that could inflict easily infected wounds.\nWhatever the truth is, one thing is certain: cotton can't compete with fishing line. ''The lack of communication with the Afghanis is due to the fact that they refuse to use the cotton thread,'' said Mr. Choudhry, 29.\nThere's also a difference in kite style. Afghans fly diamond-shaped kites that are smaller and nimbler. ''When it comes to battle, they're unbeatable,'' said Habib Atamy, 32, an Afghan coffee vendor who lives in Whitestone, Queens, and was out in the lot with his brother-in-law. ''The Pakistani kite, it's heavier and it goes down quicker.''\nAssadula Nassari, 29, smiled as he got help untangling his kite string. ''We are homeless,'' he said, thinking of Afghanistan, ''though thank God we are not friendless.''\nBobby Singh and his turbaned father, K. Singh, had learned of kite cutting in the park by watching the Indian cable channel in New York. The elder Mr. Singh took his son out to experience what had been a favorite game in his youth in Punjab. His son, who had just finished medical school, brushed aside a warning about the Afghan's chemical line, saying, ''Give me a chance.''\nMinutes later, after losing two kites, his bravado had wilted. ''He has a fishing line,'' he complained. ''You can't break that!''\nThe men stayed well into the evening, losing kite after kite to the wind. But one person profited from their losses. Fahamida Nusrat, a 10-year-old girl from Bangladesh, tugged a kite down from a tree. It was, miraculously, intact. As her parents sat on a blanket nearby, she carefully wrapped the kite string around an empty water bottle and stood in the grass alone, trying to coax her prize aloft.",

    "text": "U.N. TROOPS BRACE TO DEFEND CAPITAL OF SIERRA LEONE\n2000-05-11T05:00:00.000Z\nWith its political options in Sierra Leone all but exhausted, the United Nations reluctantly ordered peacekeeping troops there today to take up defensive positions and prepare to fight rebels advancing toward the capital, Freetown.\n''We'll do what we have to do to defend ourselves and the government,'' the United Nations spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said here today. ''We hope it won't come to a pitched battle, but we are preparing for one.''\nHe said the peacekeepers, who number more than 8,000, had been consolidated around Freetown and were digging in at the entrances to the capital.\nThe lightly armed soldiers, who came to Sierra Leone to help the United Nations carry out a peace agreement signed last July between the government and the Revolutionary United Front, are not configured or equipped for conventional combat. Now the peacekeepers have been told to assume a role they did not expect to take on, lacking tanks, artillery and helicopter gunships.\nUnited Nations officials said they still know little or nothing about the whereabouts and condition of about 500 peacekeeping troops who were taken hostage by the rebels early last week -- the incident that precipitated the current crisis.\nOne detachment of 208 Zambian soldiers, who were captured together with their armored personnel carriers, was reported to have been taken to Koidu, a rebel stronghold in eastern Sierra Leone.\nThere was no word on the fate of another contingent of 200 Zambians who disappeared later. Attempts to deliver food and other supplies to the captured peacekeepers have largely been thwarted. The United Nations has not specified the nationalities of the other hostages.\nPresident Charles Taylor of Liberia, who is close to the Sierra Leone rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, has been asked to win the peacekeepers' freedom, but so far has won only the release of a Russian helicopter crew and two passengers. Mr. Sankoh himself has been missing since protests outside his home in Freetown erupted into gunfire on Monday.\nThe United Nations does not know the size or location of the rebel forces, which are thought to control about half the countryside. The rebels are armed with assault rifles and side arms. When the peace accord was reached last year, there were some 45,000 combatants, on all sides.\nUnited Nations officials said that a handful of peacekeepers have been killed and others have been wounded. The dead include Nigerian troops caught in a cross-fire between government troops and rebels at Rogberi last weekend, when a government helicopter accidentally fired rockets at the Nigerians.\nThe Revolutionary United Front, Mr. Sankoh's rebel organization, has set no conditions for freeing the captured peacekeepers. He has denied that his forces held any peacekeepers, and his disappearance has left the United Nations with no one to approach directly for their release.\nThe 13 armored personnel carriers that the rebels took from the Zambians have been painted black and have been seen moving with the rebels, officials said.\nWith Sierra Leone sliding back into war, Mr. Eckhard said the United Nations would no longer report the movements of its troops or clashes with the rebels, who are already engaged against government forces.\nSecretary General Kofi Annan's strategy has been to shore up the United Nations military presence in Sierra Leone sufficiently to deter the rebels while he seeks a political solution salvaging the peace accord.\nAt the United Nations headquarters, where the mood was somber today, officials met with diplomats from Jordan, India and Bangladesh to discuss how to speed up the arrival in Sierra Leone of three infantry battalions that these countries had pledged for next month.\nThe United States, Russia, Canada and the Netherlands have offered to supply aircraft to ferry the new troops into Sierra Leone. But the United States is limiting the carrying capacity of its transport planes and proposes charging the United Nations as much as or more than commercial air carriers would charge, diplomats complained. The other countries are considering carrying the troops for nothing or at cost.\nThe arrival of new troops would lift the United Nations mission's military strength in Sierra Leone close to the authorized ceiling of 11,700, from 8,936 reported today.\nBut officials said that airlifts could not begin for at least 10 days and would not be completed before the end of May.\nMr. Annan has received no response to his appeal for a well-equipped rapid reaction force. The mission has been criticized for the ease with which the rebels were able to overwhelm and detain United Nations soldiers.\n''The best peacekeeper is a well-trained soldier,'' Mr. Annan said today. ''And we would have liked to see some of the governments with capacity -- with good armies and well-trained soldiers -- to participate. But they are not running forward to contribute to this force. So we have to take the forces we get.''\nThe secretary general seemed to allude to the United States and European powers when he said he hoped that strong countries ''would go to the assistance of those who are in there doing their bidding for the Security Council and the U.N.''\nThe Clinton administration has ruled out putting American troops on the ground in Sierra Leone. But today, Mr. Annan expressed thanks for a British force of more than 800 paratroopers, which has secured the airport at Lungi, outside Freetown, freeing up United Nations soldiers to help defend the capital.\n''The British presence has been helpful,'' Mr. Annan said. ''They have done something, even though the initial objective was to evacuate British and other nationals.''\nFor all the setbacks, the United Nations refused to say that its faltering mission to Sierra Leone had failed. ''For as long as it's possible, we're going to hang in there and try to revive this peace process,'' Mr. Eckhard said.\nMr. Annan had hoped that the meeting of nine regional African leaders Tuesday in the Nigerian capital Abuja might find a political way out of the crisis in Sierra Leone.\nIn a communique, the regional leaders condemned the Revolutionary United Front for taking the peacekeepers hostage and called for their immediate release. They also warned that the amnesty granted the rebel leader, Mr. Sankoh, and others last July could be revoked. The rebels became notorious during the civil war for mutilating civilians.\nThe regional leaders promised to use ''all means at their disposal, including the military option,'' to prevent the rebels from taking over Sierra Leone. But they stopped short of offering immediate help, saying that their defense ministers and chiefs of staff would meet next Wednesday to consider reviving a Nigerian-led intervention force that defended Freetown against the rebels before the peace treaty was signed last year.\nSome United Nations officials were dubious about bringing in new Nigerian troops, a proposal espoused by the United States, because the veterans who fought the rebels had been sent home and demobilized, and their replacements would probably be new and untested recruits.\nThe Security Council, which authorized the peacekeeping mission last Oct. 22, was briefed today on the situation by Hedi Annabi, the assistant secretary general for peacekeeping operations. But it decided to put off decisions about what to do next until it hears from Bernard Miyet, the under secretary for peacekeeping, who is heading back from a visit to Sierra Leone, according to a diplomat at the meeting.\nThe United Nations Children's Fund expressed concern today that the fighting would lead to the recruitment of child soldiers. The rebels used about 5,000 children to fight in Sierra Leone's nine-year civil war. ''The very high level of instability could lead us back into the vicious cycle where children are used as tools of war,'' Joanna Van Gerpen, the head of the agency's office in Freetown, said in a statement.\nThe children's agency said it had to postpone the third round of its polio immunization campaign in Sierra Leone because of the deterioration in security.",

    "text": "If You're Thinking of Living In/Bedford Park; Stable, Convenient and Committed\n2000-07-09T05:00:00.000Z\nTWENTY-FIVE years ago, the future of Bedford Park, a tiny neighborhood in the north Bronx, looked bleak. Farther south, whole neighborhoods were plagued by drugs, abandoned buildings and trash-strewn vacant lots. And it seemed to many observers that it was just a matter of time before Bedford Park would face a similar fate.\nThat did not happen. Instead, Bedford Park residents formed community organizations to fight for better city services, to pressure landlords to sell or renovate buildings, to improve neighborhood schools and, as many like to say, ''to just get to know our neighbors.''\n''People said 25 years ago that the neighborhood wouldn't last,'' said Barbara Stronczer, the president of the Bedford Mosholu Community Organization, which will celebrate its 25th anniversary next month. ''They thought there was this syndrome of the South Bronx moving north.''\n''We had lots of battles and lots of meetings,'' she added. ''We are a more diverse and strong neighborhood today.''\nSome attribute the neighborhood's stability to its location. Tucked between the New York Botanical Garden and the Herbert H. Lehman College campus, the neighborhood is about a half hour's subway ride from Midtown Manhattan. The Metro-North train station near Webster Avenue along with a handful of major highways nearby provide residents with quick access to jobs and entertainment in Westchester, Queens and New Jersey. Both the botanical garden and the college offer various educational programs and entertainment for children and adults.\nThe tree-lined Mosholu Parkway snakes along Bedford Park's northern border, and the 1,122-acre Van Cortlandt Park lies just beyond its northwest corner. There is some debate about the neighborhood's southern border, but most people agree that it is 198th or 196th Street.\n''We have beautiful parks, excellent transportation and affordable housing,'' Ms. Stronczer said. ''With all that, there didn't seem to be any reason why this neighborhood should fall apart.''\nDespite the benefits of its location, most residents credit church groups and longtime residents for preserving the neighborhood. ''Community groups formed all across the northwest Bronx at a critical time, and it had a snowballing effect,'' said John M. Reilly, who grew up in Bedford Park and returned from college in the 70's, when the neighborhood seemed bent on self-destruction. Determined to help turn the community around, Mr. Reilly joined a tenant organizing campaign.\nA FEW years later, they formed the Fordham Bedford Housing Corporation, a nonprofit community development and property management organization that owns and manages more than 70 apartment buildings across the northwest Bronx.\nMr. Reilly is the organization's executive director. He and his wife, Lois Harr, an adjunct professor at Manhattan College, are raising their two daughters in the Queen Anne cottage where his father grew up.\n''Bedford Park never had a serious problem with abandonment, but there was a lot of fear,'' Mr. Reilly said. ''A lot of people worked very hard to keep their buildings up and ultimately restore confidence in the neighborhood.''\nThat work paid off as property values stabilized in the 80's and began to climb in recent years. One-family houses went up 25 percent to 30 percent in the last 10 years.\nMany of the old Art Deco buildings along the Grand Concourse and Mosholu Parkway were converted to co-ops in the late 80's. One- and two-bedroom co-ops with hardwood floors, nine-foot ceilings and crown molding are priced from $50,000 to $90,000, said Joel Fishman, a real-estate developer who is an owner of JTF Management in the Bronx.\n''They are selling quickly,'' he said. ''A two-bedroom will be on the market for about two days.''\nRents are rising, but a two-bedroom apartment can still be found for $700 to $950 a month. One-bedrooms and studios run from $500 to $700, depending on the condition of the building and its location. Farther north in the neighborhood, housing prices are slightly higher, Mr. Fishman said.\nThe neighborhood's hilly side streets are lined with 80- to-100-year-old frame houses. Many have been subdivided into two or three apartments. One-family houses sell for $185,000 to $200,000, and two- and three-family houses for $190,000 to $220,000, said Joe Maymi, an owner of Coldwell Banker Realty Associates.\nJOHN VARELA, the owner of Heritage Realty, said: ''These are affordable houses for working families. Most don't have new kitchens or new bathrooms. Maybe they were upgraded 25 or 30 years ago. It's the handyman specials that fly off the market.''\nAbout 150 years ago, much of Bedford Park was part of the vast estate owned by Leonard Jerome, Winston Churchill's grandfather. He sold the Bedford Park tract in the late 1860's, but it took 20 years before a group of developers subdivided the property and began building houses. Designed as a suburban retreat, the community was named for the London suburb of Bedford, which was the inspiration for the Queen Anne architecture seen in many of the original houses.\nOne of the few remaining buildings from that era is the Bedford Park Congregational Church, built in 1891-92 and recently designated a landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The rustic-style church was designed by Edgar K. Bourne, the son of the church's first minister.\nThe opening of the Jerome Avenue subway line in 1917 and the Third Avenue El in 1920 attracted large numbers of middle-class families to the area. Among the neighborhood's earliest residents was William Fox, a founder of the film company that later became 20th Century Fox.\nIn spite of the Depression, a number of apartment houses were built in the 1930's, including many of the Art Deco buildings that line the major thoroughfares. After World War II, large numbers of Irish, Jewish and later Puerto Rican families moved to Bedford Park.\n''It was a very Irish neighborhood,'' said Emilia Kazimiroff, who with her husband, Theodore, moved into an apartment in Bedford Park in 1940. They later bought a house and raised their two children there. ''Our kids weren't Irish,'' she continued, ''but they would come home from school and say, 'Can't we be a little Irish?' ''\nTHERE were a number of artists living in the neighborhood in the 1950's and 1960's. ''We used to have a summer art show each year,'' Mrs. Kazimiroff said. ''It was a lot like Greenwich Village.''\nBy the 1970's, recent immigrants were replacing the older population. Today, the community is home to a vibrant mix of ethnic groups: Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Koreans, Albanians, Bangladeshis and Indians, as well as a few of the older Irish and Jewish families.\nThough there are few restaurants and just a tiny shopping strip along 204th Street, as well as shops on Jerome Avenue, there are more than half a dozen churches and several Roman Catholic schools in the area. Students in kindergarten through the eighth grades can attend the St. Philip Neri School on the Grand Concourse. St. Philip Neri Church burned to the ground in 1997. Reconstruction is expected to be completed by next Easter. The Academy of Mount St. Ursula, the oldest Catholic high school for girls in New York State, established in 1855, sits on a rocky hill on Bedford Park Boulevard.\nBedford Park's public elementary schools include P.S. 8 and the Bronx New School, a magnet school established by local parents and opened in 1988. P.S. 8 ranked 480th in reading scores out of 660 city elementary schools in the spring, while the Bronx New School ranked 330th.\nMiddle-school students can attend any school in District 10. Parents also helped to establish the Jonas Bronck Academy, a public middle school on the Manhattan College campus in Riverdale.\nAmong the neighborhood's concerns are the quality of the public schools, and some residents complain about graffiti and noise on residential streets. Yet the fears of drugs and urban blight that prompted neighbors to hold regular community meetings 25 years ago seem to have disappeared.\n''It's really a quiet, comfortable community,'' said Ms. Harr, who teaches in the campus ministry at Manhattan College. ''It's nice. You can look around and say, 'I did something to make this,' and a lot of other people can say the same thing.''",

    "text": "Bombay Journal; A World Pays Tribute to India's Master Drummer\n2000-02-14T05:00:00.000Z\nThe mingled sound of splashes and shouts from the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Olympic Pool drifted into the cool, dark room when the park attendant, clad in black Lycra bicycle shorts, opened the padlocked doors, insisting that all who entered must first take off their sandals as a sign of respect.\nInside was the small, austere space where Alla Rakha Qureshi, one of India's most venerated classical musicians, had come most evenings for the last 15 years. Here, he taught his disciples the mathematically complex rhythms of the tabla, the humble two-piece drum that he elevated to an exalted status in more than half a century of playing the world's grandest concert halls, often with the renowned sitar player Ravi Shankar.\nOn this day, the curtains of this room perched on the Arabian Sea were drawn and the maestro's voice was stilled.\nAlla Rakha, who was universally known by that name, sometimes rendered as Allarakha, usually preceded by the honorific Ustad, which means teacher or guru, died of a heart attack at age 80 on Feb. 3, just hours after his 50-year-old daughter, Razia, died suddenly and unexpectedly after routine cataract surgery.\n''He couldn't bear it,'' said his son Fazal Qureshi, 38, describing his father's reaction to the loss of the daughter who had lived at home and tended to his needs, giving him medications, taking his calls and accompanying him to concerts.\nAlla Rakha's students, who were at his side when he lapsed into unconsciousness, immediately put away their instruments to honor their guru. And his tabla-playing sons -- Fazal and Zakir Hussain, who is considered one of the world's greatest living tabla players -- canceled their performances to rush home.\nEver since, the front door to the large family apartment here has been thrown open. Musicians, dancers, singers and painters have poured in to console the twice bereft family and pay their respects to the man they so often found lost in thought on his sofa, counting out his calculations of drum beats.\nThe mourners clustered cross-legged on the Persian carpets in the living room and gathered before a garlanded photograph of Alla Rakha playing his tabla and wearing a sweetly mischievous smile. Curls of smoke wafted the subtle scent of burning incense through the apartment.\nSitara Devi, an aging dancer in the Kathak tradition of north India, creaked as she rose from the floor. She recalled the early days in the 1940's when Alla Rakha sang catchy tunes while she danced in Hindi films, and later when he played the tabla as she entertained rapturous throngs across India.\n''He played very complicated rhythms,'' she said. ''I used to say, 'Sahib, please don't play difficult or I won't be able to follow you!' ''\nAlla Rakha's students have come each night, and among them was a 25-year-old tabla player from Minneapolis, Suphala Patnakar, who talks in a flat Midwestern accent but wears her hair in long dark ringlets down her back and dresses in an Indian-style white tunic over matching pants.\nFor several months each winter since she was 19, she has come to Bombay to study at the feet of the great Alla Rakha. She described sitting quietly with him in the mornings, waiting for him to recite a rhythm for her to play.\n''If you wanted to learn from Alla Rakha, you were expected to be around for a while,'' she said.\nMore than any other musician, Alla Rakha brought the tabla to international prominence during more than 20 years touring abroad with Mr. Shankar, from the late 1950's until the 1970's. Together they played at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, the Woodstock festival in 1969 and the concert for Bangladesh in Madison Square Garden in 1971.\n''He was a fabulous drummer,'' Mr. Shankar said. ''His speciality was a very loving personality. He had such happiness in his playing.''\nAlla Rakha was a purist, not a showman, in his performances. Critics described his presence on stage as luminous, joyous and revelatory.\nThe magic in his playing grew out of his fluency in the grammar of tabla, the verbal corollary of the drummed beats, and his ability to translate spoken tabla into an improvisational, poetic music.\n''There was a sense of commas, exclamations and full stops,'' said Raghava Menon, author of many books about Indian classical music. ''He played with punctuation.''\nEven in his later years, when he had lost the physical strength for grueling concert schedules and night after night of intricate, energetic finger play, Alla Rakha and his sons gave performances at Carnegie Hall and Symphony Space in New York, among other venues.\nHis greatest musical contribution was in helping to lift the tabla -- a centuries-old instrument that dates from the Mogul era -- from its second-class role as an accompanying instrument to that of solo instrument.\n''In the 1950's tabla players were sometimes not even mentioned on an album,'' said his celebrated 48-year-old son, Zakir Hussain, who lives in San Francisco. ''The tabla player traveled by train while other musicians flew. Now the tabla player is loved and honored. He travels by airplane, business class or first class, stays in fabulous hotels and is treated as a star.''\nJust as remarkable as Alla Ra kha's worldly accomplishments was his mystical commitment to the tabla -- and his success in imbuing a generation of students with the same love of percussion, say his students and children.\nAlla Rakha himself was the eldest among the seven sons of a small farmer. He became entranced as a boy by the small drama troupes that performed stories from the Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Maha bharata. He joined in, learning to drum, and when he was just 14 apprenticed himself to a tabla guru in Lahore, said his youngest son, Taufiq.\nHis two daughters and three sons grew up in a home where their father, absent much of the year on tour, literally spoke tabla at the dinner table.\nThe techniques of tabla playing have been handed down orally -- not in written musical notation form -- and the music is largely improvisational, not composed. Alla Rakha, the guru, recited these phrases of playing over dinner, and his sons would play after the dishes were cleared.\nThe family's life was filled with sound of the tabla.\n''When he was on stage and started playing, for us it was like God himself,'' said Taufiq, who now plays percussion on instruments from Africa, Latin America and India. ''His eyes played the tabla. His body played. Some beautiful expressions of pleasure, ecstasy and serenity would come when he was playing.''\nAlla Rakha's elder daughter, Kurshid Aulia, said she had the rhythm in her but her mother would not allow a daughter, who should be learning to cook and clean, to become a musician. ''My misfortune was that I was born of a different sex,'' she said.\nBut the father became a guru to each of his sons, though only after each of them convinced him that he had a sense of rhythm. His two youngest sons spoke of him in awe.\n''It was a very difficult proposition, having a father who's also your guru,'' Fazal said. ''The status of a teacher is higher than a father. It's a very reverent relationship. You can refuse your parents' word, but a guru guides you in every turn of your life.''\nAlla Rakha was a demanding guru. His displeasure with faulty playing was a fearsome thing, and his pleasure in good playing was spontaneous and childlike.\n''He never raised a hand, but he would show his anger and make you play it again and again and again,'' said Taufiq, whose father took him on as a student at age 12. ''His face would become very strict, as if in disgust, as though he were thinking, 'What are you doing to my tabla, this priceless thing?' as though you had just broken a crystal glass.''\nFor Alla Rakha the tabla was like a religion and a mother tongue. Fazal recalled that when his father would accept an award or release a cassette, he would first speak a few words of Hindustani. But then he would switch to the language of the tabla, reciting the phrases that his fleet, strong fingers tattooed on goatskin.",

    "text": "COMPANIES TO CUT COST OF AIDS DRUGS FOR POOR NATIONS\n2000-05-12T05:00:00.000Z\nFive pharmaceutical companies offered today to negotiate steep cuts in the price of AIDS drugs for Africa and other poor regions afflicted by the disease.\nThe announcement of negotiations, to be held with the World Health Organization and other international aid groups, was made in Geneva. It followed mounting pressure on the companies -- including a personal appeal from the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, at a special session on AIDS in December -- to make their therapies more accessible in Africa, Asia and other regions devastated by the epidemic.\nDr. Peter Piot, the executive director of Unaids, a joint United Nations agency, said, ''This is a promising step in a long-term process.'' He added, ''Lowering the price of medicines, however, is only one critical factor in what must become a much broader and more urgent effort.''\nIn many parts of Africa, government health budgets can be as little as $10 a person a year, and treatment programs are hard to carry out, even among people who acknowledge having the disease.\nSome 50 million poor people in developing nations are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The participants in today's accord emphasized that they were at the beginning of a process and did not predict how many people might be helped soon.\nThough only one company, Glaxo Wellcome, spoke of any specific prices, the companies were expected to agree to cuts of 80 percent and more below their American prices. Drug treatments used in the United States, most commonly the triple-therapy ''cocktails'' that suppress the replication of H.I.V., can cost up to $15,000 a year.\nDr. Rolf Krebs, vice chairman of one of the five companies, Boehringer Ingelheim, which is based in Germany, said, ''This is the first time that both the public and private sector are joining forces to implement a major change in the care of H.I.V./AIDS in the developing world.''\nBesides Boehringer, the other companies in today's agreement are Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Company, both of the United States; Glaxo Wellcome of Britain, and Hoffmann-La Roche of Switzerland.\nBen Plumley, an official of Glaxo Wellcome, said the company would sell its Combivir, a blend of AZT and 3TC that sells at a global average price of $16, for $2 in poor countries.\nThe announcement of the agreements, first reported in The Wall Street Journal, followed several weeks of negotiations. Officials said the companies negotiated separately to avoid falling afoul of American price-fixing laws.\nThe five companies will work with five international agencies, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, Unaids, the United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Population Fund.\nAt world trade conferences like the one in Seattle in December that attracted many protesters, drug companies have been portrayed as racking up record profits by concentrating on drugs to cure relatively minor problems like obesity, baldness and impotence among rich Americans, Western Europeans and Japanese, who make up 80 percent of the world drug market, while ignoring dire suffering in places like Africa, which buys 1 percent of the world's drugs.\nGro Harlem Brundtland, the director general of the World Health Organization, said in an interview today that big pharmaceutical companies had ''analyzed their roles more broadly recently.''\n''The reality of poverty and the affordability of medical technology has led companies to think about their policies and postures,'' she said.\nBut officials in Geneva and elsewhere cautioned that cheaper drugs would not provide a quick fix for the epidemic.\nThey stressed that controlling AIDS also required a developed health-care system, which many third world countries lack, and that even slashed prices might be too high for many patients. They also said they feared that the cheap drugs could find their way into black markets in richer countries.\nBy some estimates, sub-Saharan Africa has 80 percent of the world population of people infected by H.I.V., though few of those people have ever had an AIDS test.\nIn much of Africa, the disease is treated as a badge of shame. And the anti-retrovirals, protease inhibitors and other drugs involved are toxic and difficult to monitor even in patients in Manhattan.\nIn many poor countries, distributing the drugs, teaching people to take them and monitoring levels of virus, T-cells and drug residues in the blood amount to a mammoth task.\n''To be realistic, this is not going to fix the problem, but I'm cautiously optimistic,'' said Dr. Piot, of Unaids. While the agencies involved in today's accord emphasized the hope of lower prices, the drug companies focused on joint principles for tackling the epidemic. These include stronger government efforts, better drug-distribution systems and more financing from donors, all matters outside the corporate world. Who would pay to create such standards remains unclear.\nMost of the drugs scheduled to come under discussion are those used to control replication of H.I.V. But the poor also need other medicines, like strong antibiotic and anti-fungal drugs for the infections that arise with AIDS.\nCutting prices is in some ways a risky concession by the companies. Soaring prescription prices in the United States have led some lawmakers to call for European-style price controls. If the drug companies in effect admit that they can sell a drug at an 80 percent discount, they risk Congressional pressure to lower Medicare prices. But over time, the industry argues, skimpy prices would strangle their immense research budgets, and the flow of valuable new drugs would stop.\nSome AIDS activists argue that the companies are lowering prices simply to forestall the seizure of their patents by third world nations desperate for the drugs. Thailand and South Africa have recently passed laws allowing such seizure; India, Bangladesh and Brazil have drug industries that ignore patent treaties.\nOn Wednesday, the Clinton administration angered the industry by issuing an executive order saying the government would not interfere with African countries that violate American patent law to obtain cheaper AIDS drugs.\nThe companies denied that they had asked for any quid pro quo, like demanding that countries pass tough patent laws or that the United Nations agencies endorse them. ''No, we're not asking for a ban on parallel imports or compulsory licensing,'' said Jacqueline Wallace, a Roche press spokeswoman. ''That would be illegal.''\nThe fear of all five companies is that corruption in poor countries is so rampant that millions of their cut-rate pills will disappear and be sent to rich countries to cannibalize their full-price sales.\n''That's precisely one of the things that's worried us,'' said Jeffrey Sturchio of Merck & Company. ''That's something we hope this initiative will be able to address.''\nToday's announcement was greeted with skepticism by Doctors Without Borders, the Nobel Prize-winning medical agency. The opening of discussions ''is a victory, but a small one, much like an elephant giving birth to a mouse,'' said Dr. Bernard Pecoul, who cited the lack of any concrete commitments.\nA Clinton administration official said the administration had not played much of a role in events that led to the agreement.\nPoor people in the United States, unlike those in poor countries, have several ways of obtaining AIDS drugs. Medicaid generally covers the costs of such drugs. Low-income people who do not qualify for Medicaid may be able to obtain drug therapy through AIDS drug assistance programs run by the states with substantial federal money.\nIn addition, drug manufacturers have programs to provide drugs free, as a last resort, to patients who have no health insurance.\nBut Daniel Zingale, former executive director of AIDS Action, a lobby for people affected by the disease, said: ''There are still some people in the United States who cannot get the drugs they need because the price is prohibitive. It costs $15,000 to $17,000 a year just for H.I.V. drugs.''\nGlaxo's Combivir, a combination of retrovir and epivir anti-viral drugs, generated $454 million in 1999 sales, but only 10 percent came from outside the United States and Europe.\n''They don't have a great deal to lose,'' James Culverwell, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, told Reuters. ''I don't imagine the financial effect is that significant.''",

    "text": "Temples Drawn on a Tabula Rasa\n2000-02-27T05:00:00.000Z\nWATER, fertile soil and vegetation everywhere: Bengal, once India's easternmost province, was a treasure house for centuries. The Mogul Empire grew rich on Bengali taxes; the British founded their empire there. Then came independence and partition. Today, West Bengal, one of the 23 states of India, is best known for the travails of Calcutta, its capital. East Bengal has become Bangladesh, a separate and desperately poor nation.\nAs a result, few Western tourists ever get beyond Calcutta; and yet Bengal, mutilated but still vast, is full of treasures. Most of the towns, palaces and temples that can be found throughout the state belong, as might be expected, in the great tradition of Indian art and architecture; but then there is Bishnupur, and it is a place unlike any other.\nThe city was the capital, by the 17th century, of the Malla kingdom, a small state peopled by tribal aborigines. Eager to gain respectability, they built temples. That, however, was not easy. The Mallas had no connection to the high culture or the architecture of the late Mogul Empire, of which, unwittingly, they were a part. Unable to pick up on most Muslim techniques because they were Hindus, they were also unconnected in many ways to their own artistic tradition, and so they simply improvised as they went. The result is a series of remarkable and wholly original temples.\nSlightly more than five hours' drive from Calcutta, and reachable as of this year by train, Bishnupur still has few visitors, partly because it is so little known, partly because it seems so far away. But, as it happens, getting to Bishnupur is in itself a constant pleasure. Bengal may not be as rich as it once was, but its lush, tropical landscapes -- where banyans, palm trees, banana bushes, sugar cane fields and rice paddies each provide a different shade of green -- are as beautiful as they are enticing. Water is everywhere, in rivers and ponds; and along the potholed road, bullock carts, cattle, children, bicycles, trucks, buses and the occasional car all struggle for space.\nThe villages are many and picturesque. Each house centers on a two- or three-story pagoda-like central tower and is edged with deep, curved eaves that, at the lower level, form a veranda. In many places still, the roof and eaves are made of palm thatch, although corrugated tin is fast catching up; and because the houses are clustered close together, each village looks like an intricately designed palace compound. In and around the villages, cows and bullocks are everywhere, and with their humps and their coats of the most elegant shades of gray, they look as if the have come right out of a Mogul miniature, while the water buffaloes seem, as always, invitingly goofy.\nOn the edge of the villages, ayanars, those protective terra cotta divinities sometimes in the shape of a horse, sometimes in that of a man, add another touch of local color -- as do the passing trucks painted in bright yellows and oranges, adorned with figures of gods and goddesses.\nCompared with all these villages, Bishnupur, when it is finally reached after a five-hour trip on a mediocre road, looks like a major center, although it is only a small town. Its narrow, crooked streets are busy throughout the day: people, cattle, motorcycles, bicycles and trucks make an unending pageant. Here is India away from the tourist centers: bustling, crowded, cheerful, a little raucous sometimes, and always full of charm. Here and there, a broken vault or a half-collapsed dome marks the presence of a long-abandoned temple. A myriad of small shops sells everything from silk to pickles and electric cord to mangoes and even photographic supplies. All over the streets, there are goats of extraordinary elegance, black with a white stripe on each side of the head and white-bordered ears, and dogs and chickens and pigs, snuffling and rooting. Bullock carts meet head-on in lanes too narrow for them to pass, so they stop, and a long debate is held to determine who will back up. Cycle-rickshaw drivers ring their bells; people wearing scarves and shawls, in spite of the heat, meet, chat and wander away.\nThe Tourist Lodge, the only place to stay, is in keeping with this atmosphere. Set off in a charming if ragged garden, the hotel's best rooms (there are 12 in all) have air-conditioning of sorts and bathrooms with Western-style toilets and showers that actually emit a trickle of tepid water. The food is very simple -- it is wisest to stick to the excellent bread, rice, cooked vegetables and fruit. But it is easy to buy, at one of the neighboring stores, first-rate yogurt (or curds are they are called here) and pickles (the lemon and mango pickles are particularly good). The men who run the hotel are welcoming and amiable and your fellow guests are likely to be Indian.\nIT would be worth visiting Bishnupur just to see the exuberance and color of its daily pageant; but then there are the temples, scattered throughout the town, each in its small, green garden. Built of brick with terra cotta tiles on the main facades, they glow with an intense reddish-brown in the midday sun; and their very shape is surprising. Indian temples, after all, are supposed to follow the unchanging plan set down in an ancient treatise of sacred architecture, the arthashastra; there should be a pillared hall, perhaps preceded by a porch, and always followed by a tower-crowned sanctum. The material is always stone, carved on the outside walls to represent the gods, the goddesses and scenes from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.\nIn Bishnupur, however, none of this is to be seen. Each temple has a different outline; there is not a tower in sight -- or, for that matter a single stone.\nThere is no sanctum, either: the designers looked at the nearest available buildings, which were mosques. So, like mosques, these Hindu temples consist of a single chamber entered through doors topped with cusped arches. Above the chamber, there usually is a dome -- not very large or very high, the designers could not have coped with more.\nFinally, the terra cotta plaques are thoroughly unconventional. Some are decorated with geometric motifs, others with flower-based patterns. The gods and goddesses do appear, but often in unfamiliar positions, with unfamiliar attributes and within the context of local stories unknown anywhere else. It is no wonder that the tiles are so abundant: terra cotta, after all, is the cheapest, simplest medium possible. Happily, it does not preclude quality: the tiles of Bishnupur have all the exuberant creativity, all the grace and complexity of Indian art everywhere. These are folk temples, although they were built at the behest of the Malla kings -- but folk temples on a larger than normal scale and with a unique presence and dignity.\nThe Rashmanchat is the earliest. Built in 1600 by King Birhambir as the first affirmation of the might of the dynasty, it originally housed statues taken from temples throughout the area. The difficulty was to provide adequate room for all these sacred images, and so it consists of a triple arched gallery topped by a pyramid shaped roof. The plan is square; the triple depth of the arches makes the building seem weightless; and, once entered, the galleries become a forest in stone where light and shadow mingle, perspectives are everywhere, and the temple appears almost without boundaries.\nBy the time the next temple, the Shyamray, was built in 1643 by Rajunath Singha, an entirely new plan had been developed: four square, squat linked towers covered with terra cotta tiles. Here there are many scenes from the lives of the gods. Some look familiar; others are totally puzzling and represent illustrations of folk tales not to be found in the immense canon of Hindu mythological stories. Sometimes the gods and goddesses are recognizable by their attributes (the conch for Vishnu, the trident for Shiva), sometimes by their mount (the lion for Durga, the mouse for the unmistakable elephant-headed Ganesha) -- although it may take a good deal of looking, since most of the time the telltale symbol is either very small, or off in a corner of the composition. What matters, though, is not theological accuracy, but the vivacity of movement and the luxury of detail.\nThe next temple, the Jor Bangla, was built 12 years later by the same king. Once again, except for the brick and terra cotta, it seems absolutely unrelated to the others, and far less mosquelike. It is essentially a joining of two local houses, grown larger, with their crescent-shaped rooftops and deep curving eaves. Except that here, a small cube emerges from the center of the building and supports a tiny square tower topped by a curving eave. The meeting place of the two houses is marked by a small recess in the wall; and the whole structure should look odd and awkward. Instead, standing on its low platform, it is nothing short of stunning. The very improbability of the plan gives it a daring and almost magical quality. Nothing is quite where it should be, but everything works.\nThe latest of the temples, the Madanmohan, built in 1694 by King Durjan Singha, manages to resemble a Western building that had somehow been made exotic. The triple scalloped arches of the main facade, the pilasters at the corners, the little octagonal dome resting on a one-story drum and flanked by Bengali eaves, all manage to look both Western and Eastern. Perfectly proportioned, this temple seems a little like a grown-up toy house; and, as usual here, it resembles nothing else.\nOn the way to the Madanmohan are many other ruined temples that give the landscape an almost grandiose quality. The temple itself sits in the middle of a lush green garden, and so the visitor has it all: the pleasure of the setting, and, just outside the low boundary wall, the feeling of passing time and the fall of empires. Best of all, perhaps, this is India unchanged, unprettied, unexpected and always fascinating.\nIf you go\nThe cost of hiring a car and driver from Calcutta for two days (you will need an overnight stay in Bishnupur) is $160; a good guide should charge $50 a day.\nThe Tourist Lodge charges $25 a night for an air-conditioned room; simple meals are about $2. The best way to book is through an agency in India because the lodge staff does not speak English. Arrangements can be made in Calcutta through the major hotels, or through a United States travel agency.\nA visa is required by India. A six-month visa ($50) can be obtained from the Consulate General of India, 3 East 64th Street, New York, N.Y. 10021; (212) 774-0600, fax (212) 570-9581; www.indiacgny.org.",

    "text": "Maverick Chinese Province Fears Opening of Trade\n2000-06-12T05:00:00.000Z\nEvery Monday for seven years, Wang Tai-ching has boarded a ferry in Hong Kong and chugged up the muddy waters of the Pearl River delta. His destination is a factory in Zhongshan, one of the slapdash cities that have sprouted in Guangdong Province over the last decade, crowding out rice paddies and duck ponds with smokestacks and elevated highways.\nMr. Wang, and thousands of Hong Kong entrepreneurs like him, have helped transform Guangdong into the fastest-growing region in China -- a capitalist hothouse on the South China Sea. As China moves closer to its dream of entering the World Trade Organization, however, people here are nervous.\nFar from relishing the prospect of free trade and wide-open markets, they worry that the new competition could threaten their livelihood. To enter the W.T.O., China will have to throw open its doors to foreign companies. And by reducing tariffs on imports, it will level its commercial playing field -- depriving the frontier capitalists in Guangdong of many of their advantages.\n''The beauty of W.T.O. is that it is a signal to foreigners to come in,'' said Mr. Wang, 55, who bunks in a spartan dormitory with his workers during the week. ''But it's different for the people who are already here. I don't know how many will survive and how many will fail.''\nMr. Wang's factory makes disposable diapers. His company, Disposable Soft Goods, is one of 15 such manufacturers in China -- a remarkable statistic for a country that regarded throw-away diapers as an unattainable luxury a few years ago. Procter & Gamble began selling Pampers throughout China last October, setting off a ferocious price war.\nFor Mr. Wang, that is just the beginning of his headaches. As part of its agreement to join the W.T.O., China is committed to reducing duties on imported raw materials like plastic and fabric by 40 percent, and to open up its tightly controlled distribution system. This will greatly benefit global manufacturers like Procter & Gamble, enabling them to cut their prices even further.\n''It's going to be very tough for the local companies to survive,'' said Andy Xie, an economist who specializes in China at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Hong Kong. ''The W.T.O. deal means that in industries with large economies of scale, the American companies will dominate.''\nAs one bounces along the pothole-pocked roads here, Zhongshan seems the very picture of a swaggering gold-rush town. Tacky hotels and karaoke bars line the streets, while prostitutes troll for visiting businessmen. But there is something new in the air these days: fear.\n''The local people are scared,'' said Mr. Wang, who employs 130 workers, most of them women. ''They're worried about losing their jobs. They're worried about their factories being closed. To them, this is a revolution.''\nOf course, the threat to Chinese-owned companies is not confined to Guangdong Province. But it resonates powerfully here because of Guangdong's hard-won prosperity. An economic backwater as recently as 1984, this province of 60 million people capitalized on its proximity to Hong Kong and its distance from Beijing to transform itself into a free-market powerhouse.\nInitially, companies moved their factories across the border to escape rising labor costs in Hong Kong, a former British colony. The increasingly blurry line between Guangdong and Hong Kong enabled the garment industry to evade strict quotas placed on clothing exported from China.\nLater, business people from Taiwan came, attracted by Guangdong's anything-goes atmosphere and the access to Hong Kong's duty-free port. More than 4,000 Taiwanese companies set up footwear, electronics and other factories.\nBy the early 1990's, Guangdong was producing two-thirds of China's exports. When Deng Xiaoping made a famous visit here in 1992, he held up the province as a model for China. Guangdong, he declared, would become the ''fifth tiger of Asia,'' alongside Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea.\nBut the political winds have shifted, and the country's leaders are now promoting development around Shanghai and in the northern provinces. Guangdong's economic growth slowed to 9.4 percent last year from 10.2 percent in 1998. Although it still grows faster than China as a whole, its share of the country's exports dropped to 41 percent in 1999 and 38 percent in the first quarter of this year.\n''The focus of China's economic development is moving north,'' Mr. Xie said. ''Guangdong will remain successful, but it will no longer be central to China's growth.''\nIn some industries, the Chinese government is trying to accelerate this process. Earlier this year, Beijing began requiring garment manufacturers here to pay a deposit equal to 30 percent of the value of their exports. Factory owners complained.\n''We think the Chinese government is trying to drive us out of business to move the industry up north,'' said Laurie Jim, whose Hong Kong garment-trading company works with dozens of factories in Guangdong. ''Eventually in southern China, there won't be any garment factories at all.''\nThe outcry from the apparel makers was so loud that the government shelved its policy. But Ms. Jim believes it is only a temporary reprieve. As China seeks to establish normal trading relations with the United States to and enter the World Trade Organization, she contends, China will intensify its efforts to move labor-intensive production from Guangdong to the less-developed northern regions.\nEven without state intervention, Guangdong's advantages are slipping away. Today, many apparel companies here make a portion of each piece -- a sleeve or collar -- in Hong Kong, so they can claim it is ''Made in Hong Kong,'' and ship it out under the territory's less-restrictive trade quotas.\nBy 2005, however, the United States is scheduled to lift quotas on textiles from China. That would erase the advantage of splitting production between Guangdong and Hong Kong. And with labor costs significantly lower in northern China -- not to mention countries like Mauritius and Bangladesh -- it would rob the apparel companies of one of the main reasons to build factories here.\n''Guangdong has been very good in taking advantage of loopholes,'' Mr. Xie said. ''But when the rule of law is strengthened, it will be tougher to do that.''\nLike other coastal provinces, Guangdong has a thriving underground economy in smuggled oil, cigarettes and food products. China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, has made cracking down on smuggling the centerpiece of his anticorruption campaign.\nGuangdong also led the way in the creation -- and subsequent downfall -- of investment trusts. These state-run companies borrowed heavily to invest in often-dubious real estate ventures. When Beijing decided to make an example of one of them by throwing it into bankruptcy, it chose Guangdong International Trust and Investment, the flagship venture of the provincial government.\nIn some ways, Guangdong is suffering the same growing pains as any region that struggles up the economic ladder. With its labor costs the highest in China outside of Shanghai, it is trying to attract more capital-intensive industries, like telecommunications, computers and software. It is also trying to hold on to the higher-end segments of its traditional manufacturing industries.\n''What Guangdong needs to do is move up the value chain,'' said Vincent Chen, the founder of Texwatch.com, a Web site that tracks the garment industry. ''They will be known for making high-quality products, like polo shirts.''\nAs China seeks to catch the technology wave, however, Guangdong may find itself handicapped by its dearth of good universities and its less-educated work force. China's Internet industry is centered in Beijing -- home to the top-notch Beijing and Qinghua universities.\nFor all its weaknesses, experts say that Guangdong is still far more competitive and resilient than other parts of China. They note that the Pearl River delta is dominated by private entrepreneurs -- a stark contrast to the sclerotic state-owned enterprises of northern China.\n''None of those grievous problems that you see up north blight the Pearl River delta,'' said David Dodwell, who has written extensively about the region. ''Most of the companies here are leaner, meaner, and better equipped to confront international competition.''\nIndeed, Wang Tai-ching is not about to wave a white flag. He notes that he, too, will benefit from lower duties on imported raw materials. Lower duties on machinery will allow him to install another assembly line in his factory.\nTo counter the threat from Procter & Gamble, he wants to build warehouses in the north to deliver diapers in Shanghai and Beijing. Eventually, Mr. Wang predicts, his factory will produce 300 million diapers a year. With 19 million babies born in China every year, he says there are more than enough bottoms to go around.\n''I'm very optimistic about W.T.O.,'' Mr. Wang said gamely. ''But the changes haven't happened yet.''",

    "text": "Translating America For Parents and Family; Children of Immigrants Assume Difficult Roles\n2000-06-19T05:00:00.000Z\nIt was an elementary school summit meeting. Crammed around the low table in the first-grade classroom sat the parents (fidgeting nervously), the principal, the first-grade teacher, the speech therapist and the 11-year-old translator, who had been hauled out of her sixth-grade class for the meeting.\nThe news was not unexpected. Eduardo Barros, who like nearly 80 percent of the incoming students in Public School 139 arrived speaking no English, needed to spend another year in first grade to improve his language and comprehension skills.\n''Mommy,'' said Edda Barros, who translated the news about her brother to her parents, ''they are saying that Eduardo has too much trouble reading and understanding. They do not want to put him in second grade and then move him back down. It is better if he does another year.''\nEdda's was not an unfamiliar role. She accompanies her parents, who were born in Ecuador, to the bank, to the doctor and on shopping trips, as well as to all school functions. It is her job to make sure her brother understands and completes his homework and to riffle through electric and gas bills, business letters, rent notices and school and community announcements. Edda's cousins, some in their 20's, often call with questions about English phrasing. One, who is 30, has used her help to get through a computer course. After learning about American traditions for holidays like Thanksgiving and Easter, Edda explained the customs to her family and insisted that her mother stuff and bake a turkey in November and hide candy eggs around the apartment in April.\nLike millions of young children in immigrant families, Edda is much more than a translator for first-generation parents who speak little English. She interprets American culture, customs and mores for her parents, at times gently correcting and advising them. She plays a vital and at times nerve-racking role, navigating the complex and intimidating world of hospitals, law offices and officialdom. One slip, she knows, could mean disaster.\nShe assumes, as do more than half the students in her class, responsibilities and duties usually left to parents in English-speaking families. Along the way, she must listen to unvarnished and unsettling accounts of her father's illnesses and looming financial difficulties. It can be, she says, overwhelming.\n''There are times, especially with doctors, when I have no idea what they are talking about,'' Edda said in English, seated in her Queens apartment with her parents. ''But I have to translate something. My parents rely on me. I have to keep asking and asking what it means, what they are talking about. And sometimes I have my own life, my own work to do, but I have to stop to help my brother or leave to go with mother or father. It is tiring.''\nTeachers and administrators in schools like P.S. 139, where 36 different languages are spoken and 77 of the 100 children in kindergarten come from homes in which the parents speak a foreign language, say young children must often mediate with parents to get them to conform to American society. And each new hurdle loads more onto the children.\n''It is often too much for their fragile nervous systems,'' said Khanna Borukhov, a teacher in the English as a Second Language program at P.S. 139.\n''They want to be leaders, but they do not have the capacity. They struggle to validate themselves, going from family appointment to family appointment. It leads to a kind of role reversal. Parents can begin to resent the power the child assumes. The parent wants to be a parent and the child wants to be a child, but because of the circumstances they cannot. With all that pressure it is hard for the child to function academically.''\nDr. Gary D. Goldenback, the supervisor of the E.S.L. program for District 28, which includes P.S. 139, says that when children are taken out of school to accompany parents to appointments or on routine chores, the missed classes can affect homework and test scores.\n''When this is done excessively, it can even harm chances for promotion,'' he said. ''One should remember that some of these parents do not even have the English facility to buy a subway token or ask directions, so they must take the child along.''\nConflict often comes in later years, when parents try to reclaim the authority they have ceded.\n''This has contributed to the gang culture,'' said Frayda Sharaby, an E.S.L. teacher at P.S. 139. ''These older children look for other avenues where they can again exercise authority.''\nConflict also often erupts around benign and simple tasks. Many immigrant parents will not sign school permission slips or allow their children to go on overnight trips.\n''A lot of these families live in fear of deportation,'' said Dr. Goldenback. ''They fear that something could happen to the child if they sign anything, even a report card. At school, a child may be told every day to get his parents to sign a slip, and at home, his parents may be steadfastly refusing to cooperate. It is a lot of pressure.''\nAnd there is pressure on these students to Americanize their parents. ''Bangladeshi women will typically not leave their homes, day or night, unescorted,'' said Dr. Goldenback. ''The school can call, say a child is sick, but it does not mean the mother can come. She may have to wait for her husband. What looks like negligence is not.''\nJust as parents fight to grasp the new world, teachers fight to comprehend the old. Discussions about summer camps, for example, have disturbed children from the former Yugoslavia, where families were held in detention centers. Simple rituals, such as fire drills, have sent some children into hysterics.\n''We had a child who thought we were being bombed,'' said Steven C. Rosenberg, the principal of P.S. 139.\nAnd school officials, as well as parents, can become perplexed by it all.\nCristina Chin, the co-president of the P.S. 139 parents' association, said she resorted at one point to speaking with a parent in an improvised sign language. And Mr. Rosenberg's best efforts to bridge the language gap have sometimes backfired. ''I brought a boy in the office to help translate for a couple that did not speak English,'' he said. ''He listened and told me, 'That's not my kind of Chinese.' ''\nClassrooms must also adjust to new traditions, such as allowing Muslims to skip lunch during Ramadan, and new cultural sensitivities.\n''I had a child from Iran in my class,'' said Ms. Sharaby, the E.S.L. teacher. ''One day Mitre did something I perceived as brilliant. I said it was not just one thumb up, but two thumbs up. She fell to the floor laughing.'' The thumbs up sign, it turns out, is a foul insult in Iran.\nThe new wave of immigrants is so diverse that it is also impossible to keep up with the plethora of languages, even in schools such as P.S. 139, where teachers or administrators speak Spanish, Korean and Russian.\nThe parents-night meetings are broken down into clusters, so children can translate what is being discussed. Newsletters go out in Russian, Spanish, Korean and Chinese, in an effort to reach at least some of the community in their own tongue. And teachers, dizzy with the infusion of cultures, customs and languages, look for ways to make the American experience relevant.\n''How are the Pilgrims like Russians?'' Jackie A. Neuwirt, the first-grade teacher in classroom 1-229, asked her pupils one morning last week.\nMrs. Neuwirt, whose parents did not speak English when they arrived in Queens in 1959 from Israel, explained to her pupils that the Russians came to the United States to escape religious persecution and find freedom. She pointed to a bulletin board in her classroom labeled ''We are the children of the world'' that had 15 figures, labeled with names of countries like Peru, Azerbaijan, Nepal and Taiwan, that represented the cultural backgrounds of her 20 students.\n''How many other people came for this reason?'' she asked.\nThe music teacher at P.S. 139, Fern Nash, has the school choral group do songs in Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Yiddish, French, Korean, German and Mandarin.\n''We incorporate the school's diversity into the program,'' she said. ''I have Chinese kids who know songs in Yiddish and have danced in Indian costumes. It is all here.''\nYears later, some who assumed the role of interlocutors say it was not only burdensome but uncomfortable.\nMrs. Neuwirt's sister, Zeporah Becker-Gonzalez, a fifth-grade teacher at John I. Smith Elementary in Miami, remembers what it felt like to be the family translator.\n''I was often embarrassed that my parents could not speak English or assimilate,'' she said. ''I wanted to be just like the other kids. I wanted to be an American.''\nOne way she rebelled was by refusing to respond in Hebrew when her parents spoke to her. Despite the family tensions, she said she believed she was a stronger person for the experience.\n''They could not help me with my homework,'' she said of her parents. ''I had to do it myself. I could not depend on them to help me as much as other parents that spoke English. It made me more self-reliant than other children.''",

    "text": "What's Doing In Rome\n2000-12-10T05:00:00.000Z\nChristmas in Rome is a blend of the spiritual and the sensual -- solemn midnight Masses and opulent five-course dinners. This year, it marks the end of the 2000 Jubilee, a Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church. The Holy Doors into St. Peter's will be closed and bricked over on Jan. 6, the Feast of the Epiphany, until the next Holy Year.\nRome has spent this year on her best, most orderly behavior: a little like a beauty pageant winner who reigns for an entire year immaculately made up and tummy tucked in. Just as this Christmas season is a pilgrim's last chance to experience the Jubilee, it is also a visitor's last chance to experience a sparkling, spruced up Rome before she sighs with relief and takes off her girdle.\nIn Italy, the holiday season stretches from Dec. 24 to Jan. 6, the traditional day when Italian children receive gifts from La Befana, a witchlike creature who distributes candy to good children and coal to the less good. The globalization of American holidays, which brought Halloween costumes and Valentine's Day cards to Europe, long ago also brought Babbo Natale (Father Christmas) to Italy, so that the time for giving never quite ends.\nShop windows on the Via del Corso and around the Piazza di Spagna are lavishly decorated with wreaths, ribbons and Christmas lights. But these areas, even on pedestrian streets, are jammed, fretful and noisy. Lightening the mood, if not the noise, are shepherds from Abruzzo, who dress in native costume and play Christmas tunes on bagpipes.\nRomans love fireworks, so there should be no difficulty seeing sparks fly on New Year's Eve. The city plans two firework displays, best viewed from the Gianicolo, the hill next the Vatican, or Pincio Hill, overlooking the Piazza del Popolo.\nEvents\nEvery year, near Santa Maria del Popolo, there is an exhibition of 100 creches from all over the country until Jan. 4; admission $2.60 weekdays, $3 weekends and holidays, at 2,300 lire to the dollar; (39-06) 3610836. It is held at the Sale del Bramante on the Via Gabriele d'Annunzio between the Piazza del Popolo and Salita del Pincio. Some of the more unusual or elaborate creches, composed of 18th-century Neapolitan terra-cotta figures, can also be seen at the Chiesa di Santa Maria in Via, telephone and fax (39-06) 6796760, from 5 to 11 p.m. daily (8 p.m. Sunday and holidays), or Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, in the piazza of the same name, (39-06) 7014769; open daily 7 a.m. to 7:15 p.m. The largest nativity scene, a life-size wooden stable filled with the Holy Family, angels, shepherds, wisemen and animals, is in St. Peter's Square, next to a towering Christmas tree.\nMany of Rome's churches have concerts, some of which are free. Sant Anselmo all'Aventino, on the Piazza Cavalieri di Malta on the Aventine Hill, offers an organ concert of music by Buxtehude, Pachelbel and Bach beginning at 6 p.m. on Dec. 17, followed by a solemn Vespers sung by the monks of Sant Anselmo; (39-06) 57911 or 5791319.\nRome's main concert hall, the Auditorium of Saint Cecilia, via della Conciliazione, 4, will present slightly more secular fare with Kurt Weill's ''Threepenny Opera,'' performed by the Ensemble Moderne Dec. 21 to 23; $9.50 to $19. To order tickets from outside the country, call (39-06) 8088352. Box office: (39-06) 68801044, fax (39-06) 6893622; to book with a credit card: 800 907080.\nThe Palazzo delle Esposizioni, via Nazionale, 194, has two major shows with an understated Christmas theme. One, ''Il Volto di Cristo,'' from this Friday until March 19, is a broad sampling of representations of Christ, with works by Giotto, Titian, Rembrandt and Matisse. The other, from Dec. 16 to April 20, is an exhibition of sculptures, mosaics and gems from the third and fourth centuries tracing the transition from pagan to Christian Rome. Box office: (39-06) 4745903; www.palaexpo.com. Closed Tuesdays; $6.50.\nPaganism reigns at the Palazzo Ruspoli, via del Corso, 418A, in an exhibition entitled ''Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt,'' with 350 archaeological artifacts from all over the world, until Feb. 25; $6.50. Information: (39-06) 6874704.\nNearby on the Via del Corso, in the recently opened Museo del Corso, is an exhibit of 20th-century sculpture from Rodin to Giacometti, through Feb. 4. Information and tickets: (39-06) 85301755; fax (39-06) 85301757. Closed Mondays; $5.25.\nItalian painters from the same period, including de Chirico and Modigliani, can be seen at the Scuderie Papali al Quirinale, via Ventiquattro Maggio, 16, Dec. 30 through March. Open daily; (39-06) 696270; $6.50.\nThe new Palazzo Poli, at via Poli, 11, which houses the National Institute of Graphic Arts, is presenting a show of views of Rome, from the 15th to the 19th century, until Jan. 28; (39-06) 692050205; $5.25.\nSightseeing\nVilla Borghese is Rome's best-known park, but Villa Ada, once a residence and hunting lodge of the Savoia royal family, has its own, more hidden charms, including a lake, acres of woods and the just-restored Temple of Flora, an 18th-century neo-Classical folly. (Part of the villa itself is the Egyptian Embassy.) The park is open daily, including Christmas and New Year's, and has bike paths, pony rides, a carousel and a very small outdoor rink (but no place to rent skates). Entrances on the Via Salaria, the Via Ponte Salario and the Largo Bangladesh.\nBy mid-December, the elegant Baroque Piazza Navona is transformed into a dizzying Christmas theme park, where vendors sell everything from tiny wooden figures and furnishings for the traditional Italian presepio (Nativity creche) to giant lollipops, roasted chestnuts, Christmas stockings and novelty items. There are also garish target-shooting galleries -- perhaps to allow shopping-crazed parents to let off steam. Two toy shops on the piazza, Al Sogno and Berte, sell attractive but very expensive dolls, stuffed animals and toy soldiers.\nChildren and adults might enjoy seeing an exhibit of toys and models of playgrounds designed by more than 30 contemporary artists, the best of which will be sent to refugee camps around the world. The show, sponsored by Art for the World, a Geneva-based nonprofit organization, runs until Jan. 14 at the Hendrik Christian Andersen Museum, via Pasquale Stanislao Mancini, 20-24, near the Piazza del Popolo; 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; $2.60. Closed Mondays; (39-06) 3219089.\nRecent waves of immigration have left Rome more ethnically diverse. Visitors who want to sample how other cultures have become part of the city's fabric should consider a visit to its first and only mosque, a modernist blend of Arab and ancient Roman architecture, designed by Paolo Portoghesi and the Iraqi architect Sami Mousawi, and opened in 1995. Id al-Fitr, the Muslim holiday that follows Ramadan, this year falls on Dec. 27, and is a joyful celebration when candy and treats are lavished on guests, particularly children. The mosque, far north of the center, across the Tiber from the Olympic Stadium, at viale della Moschea, 85, is not easily accessible, however. You may take Bus No. 360, 217, 53 or 230, or, preferably, a taxi. Free guided tours (9 to 11 a.m.) Thursday and Saturday; (39-06) 8082258.\nWhere to Stay\nThe Hotel Domus Aventina, via di Santa Prisca, 11B, 00153 Rome, is a former convent with a patio garden in a quiet, lovely location near the Circo Massimo on the Aventine. The 26 large rooms are tastefully decorated; most have balconies overlooking the church of Santa Prisca. Doubles are $160, with buffet breakfast; (39-06) 5746135, fax (39-06) 57300044; www.domus-aventina.com.\nFor families, the Palazzo al Velabro, via del Velabro, 16, 00186 Rome, near the Bocca della Verita and within an easy walk to the Forum and Capitoline museums, has 35 large, starkly elegant suites, ranging from studios with kitchenette to two-bedroom suites with living room and kitchenette. A one-bedroom suite costs $150, without breakfast; (39-06) 6792758, fax (39-06) 6793790; Web site www.venere.it/roma/velabro.\nBudget: Hotel Trastevere, via Luciano Manara, 24, off the Piazza San Cosimato in Trastevere, has a cheerful, recently restored lobby. Its nine rooms and seven triplex suites are spare but comfortable. Double with bath and breakfast: $74; triplex suite (for three or four), $104; (39-06) 5814713, fax (39-06) 5881016.\nLuxury: The elegant Hotel dei Borgognoni, via del Bufolo, 126, 00187 Rome, has 50 stylish, uncluttered rooms near the Piazza di Spagna. Doubles: $208 to $237, with breakfast; (39-06) 69941505, fax (39-06) 69941501; www.hotelborgognoni.it.\nThe newly opened Duke Hotel, via Archimede, 69, 00197 Rome, in the posh residential neighborhood of Parioli, is near embassies, the Villa Borghese and the zoo. The hotel, with 78 rooms and suites, blends the feel of an English club with modern service and convenience. Doubles: $205 to $230, with buffet breakfast; (39-06) 367221, fax (39-06) 36004104; www.venere.it/roma/theduke.\nWhere to Eat\nItalians traditionally have a multicourse fish dinner before midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, toasting one another after church with prosecco, a sparkling wine, and panettone. Christmas Day is also often celebrated with a lavish midday meal. Most restaurants offer a special menu for either Christmas Eve, Christmas or New Year's Eve.\nLa Pergola, at the Hilton, via Cadlolo, 101, (39-06) 35091, fax (39-06) 35092165, one of Rome's highest-rated restaurants, offers a family Christmas Day brunch on the Orange Terrace ($70; $35 for children). The menu for Christmas dinner, which is served on the Pergola Terrace, includes a rabbit pate, foie gras with black truffles, and lamb medallions in an olive crust ($170).\nThe ancient, unpretentious neighborhood of Trastevere acquired a touch of wine snobbery with Ferrara, via del Moro, 1A, phone and fax (39-06) 5803769, a sleek new wine bar and restaurant. It also brings a touch of Milan chic, with lighting that's art-gallery bright. The food, ranging eclectically from tripe alla Romana to curried shrimp over couscous, is excellent. Phone-book-sized wine lists offer everything from Sardinian whites to Tuscany's full-bodied reds. Dinner for two, with wine, about $70.\nMaccheroni, a converted butcher shop at Piazza delle Coppelle, 44, (39-06) 68307895, is a hip, understated trattoria that offers classic, simple Roman dishes like ravioli with basil and tomato, or a light veal and vegetable stew. Its simple, burnished decor looks like a less studied version of a Keith McNally bistro in New York. Dinner for two, about $50. Closed on Sunday.\nAnother find is Spirito DiVino, via dei Genovesi, 31A, (39-06) 5896689, fax (39-06) 58349011, in Trastevere: a jewel-like, family-run restaurant where everything -- from spaghetti with lemon, dill and tuna, to pork filet with fennel sauce -- is delicious. It sits atop the ruins of an 11th-century synagogue; the owner happily takes clients down to his wine cellar to admire brick Roman walls that are 2,000 years old. Dinner for two, about $52. Dinner only.\nTrattoria dal Cavaliere Gino, vicolo Rosini, 4, (39-06) 6873434, a small, very simple, family-run restaurant near the Via del Corso, has traditional Roman dishes (osso buco, spinach and ricotta ravioli) at reasonable prices. Dinner for two, without wine: $35. Closed Sunday.",

    "text": "The Blood All Over\n2000-10-08T05:00:00.000Z\nChandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the president of Sri Lanka, is a virtual prisoner in the fortress of her official residence, locked away in a lovely, white-washed mansion from the suicide bombers who prowl the traffic-clogged streets of the capital, Colombo. They wait for a chance to blow themselves up and take her with them, all in the cause of a separate homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority. Even with parliamentary elections crucial to the future of her government looming on Oct. 10, Kumaratunga, a formidable, instinctive campaigner, has not appeared at public rallies because of fears she will be killed.\nLate one night in August, she sat with regal formality behind an imposing, antique desk in her darkened office, her lustrous black hair swept back in a bun, and over the next two hours she talked about murder in a torrent of precisely enunciated words. It is a defining theme, not only of her life, but also of Sri Lanka's post-independence history. In the matter-of-fact manner that other political leaders might employ in conversing about economic policies or diplomatic conundrums, she spoke of children chopped to pieces, burning piles of bodies and corpses floating in rivers. Her broad, expressive face, bathed in the glow of light from a desk lamp, was by turns animated and as hard as stone as she described in clinical detail the incidents of violence that have torn her life apart.\nShe was 14, in class at convent school, when her father, the prime minister, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, the Oxford-educated scion of an elite Sinhalese family, was assassinated by a Buddhist monk in 1959 on the veranda of the family home. His was the first political murder -- the original sin -- in this lush island nation that has since seen tens of thousands more killings committed by government-sponsored death squads, Sinhalese leftist insurgents and separatist Tamil guerrillas, among others. Kumaratunga's father was succeeded by her mother, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who became the first in\na line of widows and bereaved children to rise to power across South Asia -- in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as Sri Lanka -- following assassinations.\nKumaratunga was 42 at the time of her second ordeal. She was standing on the doorstep of her home in 1988 when a hit man from a leftist group shot her husband, Vijaya, himself a rising politician, a film idol and the father of her children, then 5 and 7. ''I was the only one who ran toward the scene -- the others ran away; so I must have had some inkling of this courage always,'' she said. ''I saw the murderer pumping bullets into my husband's head.'' The killer glanced at her, she said, then fled. By the time she got to her husband, ''he had no more head.'' Half a million people attended his funeral, which was carried live on state television.\nThe cameras were rolling again last December when Kumaratunga herself came close to death at a campaign rally on the grounds of Colombo's town hall. It was pouring rain that night, just three days before elections that would decide whether she would be re-elected president for a second term. Thousands were waiting for her beneath umbrellas and soggy newspapers. When she arrived, she waved jubilantly to the crowd and flashed a dazzling smile. After she spoke about her plan to bring peace to the nation, she descended from the dais. Journalists encircled her, thrusting microphones in her face.\nThen she emerged into the clear. In one camera frame, she is walking confidently toward her chauffeur-driven car. In the next, the lens is filled with a shimmering explosion of orange light. A female suicide bomber from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam had detonated the explosives strapped to her waist, propelling bits of her shredded flesh and hundreds of ball bearings toward Kumaratunga. The cameras next found the president crouched and bloody on the pavement, surrounded by the howls of the dying.\nAs she sat in the dark of her office, she recounted how she had kept her wits. ''A lot of the men were screaming, crying and terrified and saying, 'Am I going to die?' I was directing operations even at that time. Blood was pouring from my two eyes.'' One piece of shrapnel had entered the bridge of her nose, damaging her optic nerve and blinding her right eye. A pellet lodged in her neck. ''There it is, you can feel it,'' she said, rubbing a finger on the underside of her chin. A third projectile came within a quarter-inch of her brain. Once she was in the car, her driver headed for the official residence, but she exclaimed, ''Are you mad?'' and ordered him to take her to a hospital.\nIn the hospital, she recalled, she felt as if she were floating above a room full of weeping people. She heard one of them say that Sinhalese youth were vowing to kill every last Tamil in retaliation for the bomber's attack. In the past, bouts of anti-Tamil rioting had raged with the complicity of earlier governments. People had been burned alive. Hundreds had been murdered. She roused herself to consciousness and summoned her secretary. She told him to go on television with a message to the people. ''Tell them I'm fine,'' she said. ''And then I thought of a little shrewd move. I know that when people are excited and wanting violence, when they go to a place of worship, they do become calm. I said, 'Tell them my only request is that first they should remain calm and don't try to harm anybody, and secondly that they should all go to their places of worship and pray for me.''' That night, the peace held.\nDays later, having won with 51 percent of the vote, Kumaratunga took office. Upon mentioning her children in her inaugural address, she lowered her bandaged face into her hand. Her ragged breathing was amplified over the microphone as she struggled to compose herself. She went on to say: ''I have suffered our nation's sorrow in every way humanly possible. In the vicious pain of losing a father. In the loving pain of motherhood. In the soul-destroying pain of losing a husband. And now, finally, I have nearly stepped over the threshold of my life into the deep abyss of the unknown darkness, only to be miraculously saved by the powers that be in order that I serve your further.''\nSince the attack, Kumaratunga has lived in claustrophobic splendor, a charismatic, partly blinded ruler, emotionally scarred by each phase of her country's violent past. She has had losses enough in her 55 years to become the embodiment of a politics of sorrow. She remains the only Sinhalese leader to have repeatedly risked her political future for the idea that the grievances of the Tamil minority must be addressed. At the same time, she has allowed herself to undermine these very goals by becoming snared in enmities with her Sinhalese rivals that have derailed the country's best hopes for peace. Like Sri Lanka itself, the president seems torn between contradictory impulses of reconciliation and revenge.\nIt is sometimes said in Colombo that Kumaratunga's father planted the seeds of Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict, that her mother nurtured them and that she has been left to reap the bitter harvest. Her father, Bandaranaike, was the first national leader to successfully exploit the ethnic tensions between the Tamils and the Sinhalese for electoral gain. During the British colonial era, when Sri Lanka was still known as Ceylon, the predominantly Hindu Tamils, who made up a little more than a fifth of the population, had come to be disproportionately represented in the civil service and the professions. This aroused a deep resentment among the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese majority, who constituted about 70 percent of the population.\nIn the 1956 election that made him prime minister, Bandaranaike tapped into the festering Sinhalese anger toward the Tamil-speaking minority, campaigning for a Sinhala-only language policy. The first violent clashes between the Tamils and the Sinhalese flared after his election over this emotional issue. Following his assassination, his wife, Sirimavo, pursued policies that further inflamed Sinhalese-Tamil tensions during her two stints as head of state, from 1960 to 1965 and 1970 to 1977.\nThe Bandaranaike children grew up in the thick of Sri Lankan politics. ''We breathed, ate, drank and lived politics,'' said Kumaratunga, who was the middle child. She remembers sitting on the arm of her father's chair, absorbing it all. Her political education continued while she was a student radical at the University of Paris in the 1960's. ''I was on the barricades,'' she said. ''I became a revolutionary there.''\nBack in Sri Lanka, she worked on land reform issues in her mother's government. But in 1977, her mother was swept from office. Kumaratunga, then in her 30's, showed a streak of independence from her mother, personally and politically. The next year, despite her mother's disapproval, she married Vijaya Kumaratunga, a magnetic, politically ambitious movie star from a lower caste. Anura, Kumaratunga's estranged brother, said his sister's husband was seen as being out of her league. ''He'd sit on the ground and drink arrack with his cronies,'' he said. ''That was different from Chandrika sitting with her friends, sipping wine and discussing movies and theater.''\nDuring the 17 years the Bandaranaike family was out of power, Sri Lanka saw the ghastly maturation of a political culture of violence that found ready recruits in the alienated ranks of its educated, unemployed youth, both Tamil and Sinhalese. The country had done a remarkable job of building a literate society, but its state-dominated Socialist economy had failed to produce enough jobs -- a situation that bred what Lal Jayawardena, who was an economic adviser to President Kumaratunga, called ''endemic insurrection.''\nThe Tamil rebellion, which began in 1983 after horrific anti-Tamil riots raged through Colombo, has become one of the world's most vicious, intractable civil wars, claiming more than 60,000 lives. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a ruthless separatist group that sends child soldiers into battle and young people on suicide missions, has been fighting for a separate nation in the country's north and east, which it considers the historic Tamil homeland.\nJust a year after the war began, Kumaratunga and her husband broke with her family's Sri Lanka Freedom Party (S.L.F.P.) to start their own party, which took a much more liberal line on power-sharing with the Tamils. ''The S.L.F.P. was becoming impossibly chauvinistic,'' Kumaratunga said. Their new party was on the verge of announcing an alliance with several Tamil groups in 1988 when Vijaya Kumaratunga was murdered by Sinhalese radicals. Fearing for her own life, Kumaratunga and her two children moved to London, where they remained until the early 1990's.\nBack in Sri Lanka in 1992, Kumaratunga returned to politics, rejoining the S.L.F.P. and quickly rising to prominence. Her brother, Anura, overshadowed, joined the family's despised political rival, the United National Party. According to Anura, his sister's rise was the result of a failed political gambit by their mother. ''My mother played this game between her two children: she'd promote me when Chandrika was too strong and Chandrika when I was too strong,'' he said.\nIn November 1994, Kumaratunga was elected president in a landslide victory, redeeming the Bandaranaike family's claim on power by promising a war-weary nation that she would start talks with the Tamil Tigers and introduce a new constitution that would give the Tamils more regional autonomy. Both Tamils and Sinhalese hoped she would have the magic to bring peace.\nBut things quickly went very wrong. In April 1995, her government's negotiations with the Tigers collapsed when the rebels sunk two warships in Trincomalee harbor. Feeling tricked, the president went to war with a vengeance. The last six years have been among the bloodiest in the country's history. According to official estimates, 8,502 of the 13,542 troops killed in the conflict have died since she took office.\nKumaratunga has also been unable to forge a consensus with the rival U.N.P. for the new constitution and did not have the votes to get it adopted in Parliament without opposition support. Her last-ditch effort to negotiate a compromise with the U.N.P. leader Ranil Wickremesinghe collapsed in acrimony this summer. She then sought to ram the constitution through Parliament in a matter of days.\nOn Aug. 3, Kumaratunga left the safety of her residence for a rare trip to Parliament to introduce the constitution. Helicopters hovered overhead, antiaircraft guns sat menacingly on the lawns and police boats floated in the small lake that surrounds the Parliament building, ready to repel any attack. During her impassioned hour-and-a-half-long speech, U.N.P. members heckled her, tore the proposed constitution into little pieces and even set it on fire.\nThese vituperative exchanges between Kumaratunga and the political opposition discouraged intellectuals and peace advocates. ''I have enormous respect for her instincts on the ethnic question,'' said Rohan Edrisinha, director of the Center for Policy Alternatives in Colombo. ''But she's also such a chaotic, arrogant person that you sometimes despair that she has the necessary management skills for a negotiated settlement and the discipline to compromise when necessary.''\nPresident Kumaratunga's ability to break the country's political impasse depends on winning a big majority in the coming parliamentary elections. But instead of barnstorming the country, she is trapped at home behind barricades and bunkers fortified with olive green sandbags. Last month, as candidates fanned out across the nation, she plodded on with the mundane tasks of running the government. She listened patiently to the gripes of chamber of commerce representatives and met with members of a child-protection task force. During a two-hour session with wildlife and zoo officials, she inquired into the state of elephants, leopards and turtles.\nAt times, she seemed to carry the frustration of her political seclusion lightly. ''The knowledge that you can get bumped off is not fun,'' she said with a wry smile as she posed for a photo shoot on the colonnaded veranda of her residence. She offered to change into a more flattering blue sari and tugged on the silken cloth that draped over her shoulder and across her midriff. ''Let's hide the rolls of fat,'' she said with a rich laugh. At one point, she crossed her arms and looked queenly. ''I'll be imperious,'' she declared impishly. Then, an instant later, she turned on a flamboyant smile -- wide and womanly.\nBut she also showed a darker side. In a conversation at the presidential residence last month, she was spoiling for a fight. She seemed less the tragic figure seeking to heal a wounded nation and more the politician out to settle scores. She zestfully accused Wickremesinghe of watching as men were tortured at a secret state-run interrogation facility in the late 1980's. A commission of inquiry she appointed concluded in a report published in February that Wickremesinghe was ''indirectly responsible'' for the torture chambers, but it produced no evidence that he witnessed incidents of torture, nor did it recommend his criminal prosecution. Without giving any hard evidence, she declared that she was ''fairly convinced'' that Wickremesinghe knew in advance that the Tigers were sending a suicide bomber to kill her. She also alleged that her father's assassination had been masterminded by the U.N.P. leader at the time, J.R. Jayewardene -- a view scholars dispute.\nThe phone jangled. It was her media minister. They chatted about a letter to her from Wickremesinghe that had been published in a newspaper that day. In it, the opposition leader angrily denied her accusations about his involvement in torture and the assassination attempt on her. ''If there is any substance to your accusations then the police will question and if necessary arrest me,'' he wrote. ''I challenge you to put up or shut up.'' No charges have been brought against him.\nKumaratunga told her minister to ignore the letter: ''It is absolute lies and the writing of a deranged mind.''\nWhen she hung up, she promptly went back to savaging the opposition leader. For more than 10 minutes, she described how Wickremesinghe, when he was minister of education 12 years ago, blocked her 5-year-old son's admission to Royal College, an exclusive, government-run school -- a charge Wickremesinghe later denied.\nIt is hard to see how Kumaratunga and the U.N.P. will work together after this rancorous election season -- and she does not seem interested in the prospect, anyway. She said she held her tongue about Wickremesinghe until 1998, hoping he would compromise on the constitution, and that had got her nowhere. After Tuesday's elections, in a move that will inevitably bring court challenges, she plans to have Parliament declared a constituent assembly and get the constitution adopted by a simple majority, without U.N.P. support.\nShe also seems to have very nearly given up on making a deal to end the war with Velupillai Prabhakaran, the rebel leader of the Tamil Tigers, who is presumed to have dispatched the suicide bomber to kill her. ''Mr. Prabhakaran is mentally ill, seriously,'' she said, adding later, ''The momentum of violence and terror he has begun, he's gotten caught up in the cogwheels of that, and I don't think he can extricate himself.''\nKumaratunga has interpreted her survival in the suicide bombing as a sign that she has been chosen by the gods to achieve peace, but lately her efforts have brought her only bitter frustration. As she sat at her desk that afternoon in a bright pink sari, railing at the opposition and vowing to go it alone, this stubborn, combative woman who has shown such magnanimity and endured so much pain seemed herself to have become entangled in the cogwheels of Sri Lanka's dead-end politics.",

    "text": "The Pacific Rim, a Continent Away; Asians, the State's Fastest-Growing Minority, Are Changing the Face of New Jersey\n2000-10-22T05:00:00.000Z\nON the western bank of the Hudson, right on the river's edge, stands a pagoda-roofed restaurant with postcard view of Manhattan and a serene rock garden in the rear. A few feet away, there is a warren of small, interconnected stores that sell everything from origami paper to kimonos to the latest Godzilla comic books.\nAmong the many imported items at the nearby grocery story are 17 kinds of tofu and the Korean pickled vegetables known as kimchi. The pharmacy offers barley juice and shark cartilage pills.\nThe unusual collection of businesses -- called the Mitsuwa Marketplace -- is part of a nationwide network of enterprises that cater to an East Asian clientele. To the growing Asian population in New Jersey, it is a merchandise mecca, and for those who were not born here, one of the best places to put homesickness to rest.\nWhether they are visitors with visas, immigrants or citizens born in the United States, the state's Asian/ Pacific Islander population has increased by 69.5 percent since 1990, the largest comparative growth of any ethnic group, according to federal Census Bureau estimates.\nPut another way, in the last decade New Jersey's total population has increased by 5 percent, to 8.14 million people. And while the white, non-Hispanic population has shrunk by about 1 percent, the group with the second highest rate of growth, the state's Hispanic population, has grown 37.4 percent during the same period.\nIn five years, the Census Bureau says, New Jersey's current population of 475,000 Asians and Pacific Islanders will have grown to 578,000; the projected population in 2025 is 995,000.\n''The ethnic composition of New Jersey is changing in meaningful ways,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''That is likely to have an effect on how people identify themselves as New Jerseyans, and on the issues that the state faces in the future.''\nNor is New Jersey simply following a national trend; it is leading one. With 28.5 percent of its population Asian-born, New Jersey had the second-highest proportion of Asian residents in 1997, the most recent year for which statistics were available. Only California, where 33.5 percent of the population was of Asian origin, outpaced New Jersey.\nOne recent Sunday, Michael Usami, a product manager for Sony Electronics Inc., was browsing in the Kinokuniya Bookstore at the marketplace here.\nMr. Usami, who moved to Ridgewood from his home near Tokyo two years ago, said: ''I come here maybe once a month. It feels good to be here. I think about Japan a lot.''\nJapanese friends and fishing buddies help him feel at home, Mr. Usami said. On the other hand, he added, his wife, Kaori, has become acquainted with people in their neighborhood, which is racially mixed. And their sons, Shin and Len, seem to ''know lots of American kids'' and prefer to speak English rather than Japanese.\nPeter and Rebecca Jen, who came to New Jersey from Taiwan three years ago to attend college, said they were considering making the move a permanent one. On this day, they drove an hour from their home in Denville to scour the Yaohan Food Market for special sales on the everyday things that they took for granted back in Taipei.\nAfter one such excursion, they took turns holding their 15-month-old son, Jonah, and heaving 60 pounds of sticky rice in cloth bags into the back of their car.\n''We normally shop at the local grocery store near our home, and buy the usual things that people get,'' Rebecca Jen said. ''But often there are special items here on sale, so it is always worth the trip.''\nWhether it is Indians in Jersey City, Japanese in Bergen County or Chinese in Piscataway, Asians have been drawn to New Jersey by relatives who preceded them here as well as by the growing number of job opportunities. But unlike earlier migrations -- made up of people with little money or education -- many of today's Asian immigrants already have an education and have come here to capitalize.\nIn the 1990 Census, which provided the latest reliable statistics, 71 percent of the state's Asian population said they had attended college.\n''Asian immigrants tend to be well-educated professionals,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''In New Jersey, Asians are finding employment especially in the burgeoning high-technology industry, in electronics and computer design.''\nThe Asian-born in this country often are referred to as a model minority because of their relative success. But along with the population and its prosperity, tensions have also begun to rise. Incidents of bias -- including violent crime -- have prompted some to question how well accepted Asians in this country really are. Those concerns were heightened after a nuclear scientist at the national laboratory in Los Alamos, Wen Ho Lee, was accused of stealing nuclear secrets for China.\nLike all broad demographic brush strokes, being Asian can mean many things. Mr. Hughes noted that in New Jersey, Asians made up about 90 percent of the people whom the Census Bureau categorize as ''Asian and Pacific Islander.''\nData from the 2000 Census is not yet available. For now, experts say patterns established in the 1980's are the best indicators for the recent rise in the Asian population.\nIn the 1990 Census, Indians comprised 1 percent of the 7.7 million people then living in New Jersey, the largest Asian community in the state. In addition, the Immigration and Naturalization Service says that more people have been coming to New Jersey as legal and permanent residents from India than from any other country -- 15,003 from 1996 to 1998, the most recent year for which figures are available.\nResidents of South Asian origin are spread throughout the state, but there are regions with comparatively larger concentrations of people from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Central Middlesex County is one such area, with an estimated 50,000 people of South Asian origin in and around Woodbridge and Edison. Indeed, a several-mile stretch of Oak Tree Road has come to be widely known as Little India because of the concentration of Indian-owned restaurants, services and shops.\nSince 1990, Edison has been home to the annual Navratri, or Nine Nights Festival, which participants say is the largest celebration of Indian religion and culture in the country. The manager of the event, Jayesh Mehta, said that on an average Saturday night in mid-October, as many as 10,000 people were drawn to the festival.\nRun by the Iselin-based Indo-American Cultural Society, the Navratri festival features music, dance and foods from throughout the subcontinent. ''This is our big opportunity once a year to proudly share some of our cultural gifts with other people,'' said the president of the society, Pradip (Peter) Kothari.\nNot everyone has seen it that way since the Raritan Center in Edison became the site of the festival. Complaints about excessive noise and crowds have led to several legal disputes.\nMr. Kothari dismissed the grumbling as ''the irritation some people feel toward any community which is different from them.'' But, he said, ''It could be worse. Things have improved dramatically in that regard in recent years.''\nFor instance, on the night after Mr. Kothari opened his travel agency in Iselin in May 1990, vandals smashed the windows. And he said it happened 10 more times in subsequent years.\nAs bad as that experience was, it paled next to the wave of beatings and destruction of property visited on Indians in Jersey City in 1987 and 1988. The gang found responsible for much of violence called themselves ''dotbusters'' -- a crude reference to the bindi cosmetic dot with which religious Hindus mark their foreheads.\nIn a letter to a local newspaper, the dotbusters wrote that they would ''go to any extreme to get Indians to move out of Jersey City.''\nThe group's tactics included ''Patel attacks'' in which they would select victims from the telephone book by name and harass them in their homes. The most infamous crime took place on Sept. 27, 1987, when a 30-year-old Indian man, Navraze Mody, was beaten to death by a gang of youths after he left a Hoboken cafe.\nThat incident mobilized many in the state's Indian communities to protest what they viewed as police indifference to their safety, and a lack of prosecutorial rigor.\nThese days, Asian leaders in the state agree that the most recent issue to galvanize opinion in their communities has been the case of Wen Ho Lee, who was accused of spying, lost his job and was jailed for nine months before his release in September. He pleaded guilty to one felony count of mishandling nuclear secrets, while the other 58 charges against him were dropped.\n''A large number of Asians in this state work in science and technology,'' said Marjorie Li, the president of the Asian American Political Association, based in New Brunswick. ''Many had great empathy for Dr. Lee. They felt they might have been faced with the same treatment, and it was really shocking.''\nNow the state's Asian communities are split over how best to get along in New Jersey: Keep a low profile or to become more visibly active and take more interest in public life.\n''Many first-generation Asian immigrants read only the newspapers in their own languages, and keep up only with the news from their old country,'' said John Bang, a staff assistant on immigration issues and Asian outreach for Senator Frank Lautenberg. ''The second generation comes in a little more savvy about U.S. current events. They also show a much greater interest in the political process.''\nStill, Mr. Bang said the Asian-American community was not a very cohesive political force because it was made up of people of different nationalities.\n''But they are starting to come together in regional political groups,'' Mr. Bang said, ''so that they will have more political capital.''\nMr. Bang, a second-generation American whose parents are Korean-born, added: ''We don't have our own Jesse Jacksons or Al Sharptons. It's contrary to the Asian culture to be aggressive and toot your own horn. But that is what the communities will have to do to gain political recognition.''\nMichelle Kim, a junior who is majoring in political science at Rutgers, might be ready for the job. A second-generation Asian American, she was student body president at her high school and became active in campus politics at Rutgers in her freshman year.\nNow Ms. Kim says she is considering a career in public service when she graduates. ''I see the need for somebody to be out there as a voice for the Asian community,'' she said. ''Somebody has got to do it, and not many people are willing to do it, so it might as well be me.''\nIn staking claim to that position, Ms. Kim considers herself unusual among second-generation Asian Americans because she has not been placed under intense pressure at home to earn good grades, but has always been encouraged to take part in social activities at school.\nMs. Kim said: ''Maybe it's because my mother went to high school in the United States after moving here in 1970 from Taegu, South Korea. She recognized the importance of my being involved with things that other kids at school were doing. A lot of first-generation Asian parents are concerned only about their children's academic achievement and financial stability in the long term.''\nUpendra Chivukula, the Indian-born mayor of Franklin Township and one of the few people of Asian origin to hold municipal office in the state, is among those who is trying to raise the Asian profile.\nA past president of the local Lions' Club and former head of the Democratic Party for Franklin Township, Mr. Chivukula said Asian transplants to New Jersey did themselves no favor by remaining ''in close-knit, ethnically distinct societies, unseen by the rest of the world.''\n''The challenge they're going to be facing will be getting accepted in the communities where they live, and being integrated into them,'' Mr. Chivukula said. ''They should not appear clannish. There will also be a certain jealousy factor as more people of Asian origin are succeeding here.''\nIf public opinion polls are any indication, however, most New Jersey residents do not resent the immigrants, and are more tolerant of immigration than the country as a whole.\n''Keys to Successful Immigration: Implications of the New Jersey Experience,'' published in 1997, explored various dimensions of immigrant life in the state, including public attitudes toward the foreign-born.\nThomas Espenshade, chairman of Princeton University's sociology department and a faculty associate at the school's Office of Population Research, edited the study.\nIn a Gallup poll commissioned by the university, slightly more than half of New Jersey adults surveyed welcomed the new immigrants, while 40 percent thought the number ought to be decreased. Those who wanted to see immigration reduced expressed anxiety over the availability of jobs and possible overcrowding, but no specific animosity toward immigrants themselves.\nThe study contrasted this result with a 1993 CBS News/New York Times poll that found more than 60 percent of respondents nationwide wanted immigration to decrease.\n''One of the things that has actually helped in New Jersey's case is that the foreign-born population is better educated than the foreign-born population nationwide,'' Mr. Espenshade said. ''Those who are better educated tend to pass along the values of education and achievement to their children, and that's probably been good for the state.''\nAsked whether New Jerseyans' attitudes toward immigrants and native-born Asians might change as the Asian population here continued to rise, Mr. Espenshade said: ''That would be difficult to predict. But these attitudes tend to remain stable, as long as the economy is good.''\nFor Asians who are newly arrived in New Jersey from overseas, getting acclimated and finding a job are more immediate challenges than the question of prejudice.\n''Maybe after living here many years, people begin thinking about their place in mainstream society, or whether they become the object of bias,'' said Mai Lieu, director of the migration and refugee office of the humanitarian agency Catholic Family and Community Services in Paterson. ''But first they think about are how cold the winter here is compared to their country, or how far they need to ride the bus to work.''\nMs. Lieu's agency helps newly arrived refugees and immigrants obtain housing, become enrolled in the Social Security and Medicaid programs, and find employment. Initial job placements for many, she said, tend to be in electronics firms staffed by other Asian immigrants.\nMs. Lieu currently is working to help Trang Khanh Huynh, a Vietnamese refuge, resolve some of these very issues. Ms. Huynh, 29, arrived in the United States from Saigon last February with her two younger brothers. Soon afterward, their father was admitted as a refugee in August 1999.\nMs. Huynh is about to complete a six-month beauty school course that will entitle her to become a licensed manicurist.\nWith Ms. Lieu as her interpreter, Ms. Huynh said: ''The first thing I would like to do is to get a job in a salon, so I do not have to depend on anyone else for support. When I have enough money, I hope to start taking English lessons.''\nEarlier this year, when Catholic Family and Community Services helped Ms. Huynh fill out her census form, she was living with relatives, had no job prospects and was uncertain what the future would bring. How does she envision her life in 10 years, when the next census is to be done?\n''I will speak English well and have more American friends,'' she said. ''And I will own a beauty salon.''",

    "text": "A Magic Carpet of Cultures in London\n2000-06-25T05:00:00.000Z\nLONDON today is radiant and self-aware, no longer seeming like a venerated museum the whole world feels obliged to visit because it is so cutely Olde Worlde. Even grumpy Londoners like myself, who have to grapple with these pilgrims, now concede that there is something exhilarating in the air, and that it is qualitatively different from the 80's, when shallow yuppies seemed dangerously close to taking over the metropolis. What we are witnessing feels portentous, a key historical juncture that tomorrow's scribes will look back on and note. In her diary entry for May 26, 1926, Virginia Woolf wrote: ''London is enchanting. I step out upon a tawny coloured magic carpet and get carried into beauty.'' Today she would look down on a place less beautiful, perhaps; infinitely more unsettling, at times like Babel, yet magnetically attractive and engaging.\n Long before the locals caught up, the ''it'' people had already sniffed and followed this seductive scent (trendy celebrities have this knack of knowing the happening places before the places themselves) and so the capital has recently attracted a clutch of American stars like the happily pregnant Madonna, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Kathleen Turner and Julia Roberts. Baz Bamigboye, the black showbiz columnist for the tabloid Daily Mail, confirms that ''everyone wants to come and work in London.''\n''We have the funky directors, the exciting theaters where genuine experimentation is taking place, brilliant food, too, and the city feels more at ease than U.S. cities,'' he says.\n But do these style seekers really understand what is making London so special at the moment? I think not. Take the film ''Notting Hill,'' which set off a mini-rush to this area of befuddled tourists desperately seeking a house with a blue door. The filmmakers (encouraged, we hear, by American backers) reinvented Notting Hill as a place of white Englishness, peopled by eccentric gentleman booksellers, rosy women in pretty frocks and the odd working-class antihero who delighted in being unemployable and uncouth.\n In reality, Notting Hill, home of the annual, breathtaking Caribbean Carnival, was one of the first places in this country to be colonized by the colonized, and it is where the soul of multiracial Britain resides. The locality beguiles because it is so un-English. From being an endless problem for the capital (long before the postwar migration from the colonies, Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes believed London had become a ''great cesspool into which all the loungers of the Empire are irresistibly drained''), diversity has become potent, drawing loungers of an altogether different sort.\n LONDON has never been separated into ethnic no-go areas, but there were, at one time, localities that were seen as immigrant ghettos. Now the flux has started to loosen these imagined boundaries. There are no dogs, gates, barriers, guns to divide people from one another. Every group of newcomers into London disturbs the meaning of belonging and home. Notting Hill is now clogged up with the white chattering classes who previously would have headed for Hampstead with its old money and unnatural calm. Brixton, Paddington and Shoreditch, which were once impoverished immigrant dumps, are places where our dot.com millionaires, artists and designers want to live and play. Brick Lane in the east end, infamous for its cruel penury and vile racist thuggery, now swarms with diners in sharp suits from the City. Multiracial London is coming of age, and it is this that is igniting such energy, buzz and creativity.\n The last such profound shake-up in London was in the 60's, when the city became a shrine to youth, sex and freedom. But those parading down the Kings Road in flaky dresses or proudly unwashed caftans forgot to notice the signs on doors saying ''No Blacks, No Irish, No Dogs.'' Perhaps it was the dope. When the Rev. Clifford Hill, a London priest, said on the radio that he would not mind his daughter marrying a black man, he was inundated with abuse. One woman wrote: ''I sincerely hope that God will cut short your life so that dear little white girl may be saved from a black blubber-lipped Negro on top of her.'' Sex was obviously only free if you were white. The culture scene was white. The Beatles and Rolling Stones were white. So were Twiggy, Mary Quant, David Bailey, Harold Pinter and Julie Christie. London was pretending that we black and Asian Britons had never arrived. We lurked at the fringes, hidden, trying not to draw unwanted attention. When Henry Louis Gates Jr. was here in the early 70's, he observed our powerlessness. The United States had more blatant racism, but also produced James Baldwin, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, people who ruled the cultural scene. London did not yet belong to us. Today it does. Indisputably so. And it is official. Chris Smith, the secretary of state for culture, media and sports in Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, said recently, ''Diversity is a fundamental feature of this city, and it is what makes it, in many ways, rather special.''\n When the Queen was wheeled out to attend the celebrations in the Millennium Dome, she looked bewildered, out of place in the capital, which is fast shedding its dry and wrinkled skin, enabling a new, hybrid metropolis to emerge. There is at present no other Western city that can match this. While the great American cities appear to be noisily retribalizing, London is defining itself as an expansive, inclusive, eclectic, unpredictable and yet organically connected entity.\n This emerging London is sharp and cosmopolitan. It is where many of the young love Fun-Da-Mental, a multiracial group of musicians led by the devout Muslim Aki Navaz, who merges rap with Sufi and hip-hop music. Or Asian Dub Foundation, with young British Bangladeshis mixing hard lyrics with yielding, soft harmonies. Both of these pop groups are aggressively demanding of their right to this city. Their songs are raw and real; they rail against racism, exclusion and all inherited categories and celebrate instead the essential hybridity of their own lives. As does the phenomenally successful Jazzie B of Soul II Soul. He says that his inspiration is his complex British identity, which includes ''back home,'' in his case the Caribbean, but also his upbringing in London, where he lived intimately and easily with Greeks, Asians, Jews, Muslims, Catholics and Rastafarians.\n You could fill a book with examples of these artists who are remaking London. Take the striking, haunting work of Steve McQueen, the black artist who has become the centerpiece of the universally acclaimed new Tate Modern. One of his installations, ''The Bear,'' shows two men slowly wrestling (or are they making love?) with close-up, enlarged views of black nipples, an image that is so beautiful and vulnerable that it delicately subverts the stereotype of muscled manhood. The choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh merges classical Indian dancing with post-modern dance. She started off 20 years ago selling ''exotic'' Indian dancing to imperial nostalgics. Then she thought of herself as a temporary immigrant. Today she is profoundly of this place, producing dance that is complex, British, urban and hybrid.\n After being in the doldrums for a good long while, British jazz has been revivified in the last five years and sold to a young general audience. Jazz was white except for the saxophone player Courtney Pine. Today, says the jazz composer Jason Yard, ''There is a lot which is suddenly happening for jazz. More and more bands are mixed. It is more about music than any black or white thing.'' The tenor saxophonist Denys Baptiste is tipped to be as big as Mr. Pine. He had an English gentleman's musical education at the famous and traditional Guildhall School (one wonders how his dreadlocks went down there), and this is possibly why his knockout 1999 debut album, ''Be Where You Are,'' is such a combination of confidence and poignance.\n Then there are the dazzling fusion artists Talvin Singh, a classically trained tabla player (he has performed with Bjork) who combines his tradition with what one critic calls ''the skittering rhythms of drum and bass and jungle to create something new and vibrant,'' and Nitin Sawhney, whose music crosses every divide to create an authentic sound for a globalized epoch. As one fan wrote on the Internet of Mr. Sawhney's album ''Beyond Skin'': ''This is what the next millennium sounds like. This is the sound of the years to come for all those people who come from nowhere and everywhere.'' Soul music enthusiasts speak worshipfully of the 25-year-old Lynden David Hall. The critic Phil Johnson claims that this south Londoner ''sings like an angel,'' adding: ''His songs are sublime. He is the best and only thing to happen to British soul music for a generation or more.'' Mr. Hall, like so many other black youngsters, was expelled from school at 14 for fighting. ''It was all about wanting to be real and about how to deal with being a black man in London,'' he says. He was lost and then he found his voice, which is irrefutably that of 21st-century London.\n The infection is spreading to institutions. Even the House of Lords now has more than a dozen nonwhite peers, including Lord Alli, the young, openly gay millionaire who gave us our first dumbed-down TV breakfast show. The Institute for Contemporary Arts, for half a century an elitist space obsessed with the European avant-garde, is showing the first major exhibition here of the work of the Iraqi immigrant Zaha Hadid, an architect who is described by the conservative newspaper The Daily Telegraph as the ''prophet of new architecture.'' She designed the Mind Zone installation in the Millennium Dome, much acclaimed by critics. The Royal Court Theater first showcased Ayub Khan-Din's ''East Is East'' as a play before it was turned into a phenomenally successful film, and the National Theater is changing beyond all recognition.\n It is there that you can see ''Waiting Room'' by Tanika Gupta, a sensitive and funny story of an Asian woman who is trying to come to terms with her own death and wasted life. For the first time, masses of British Asians are coming into the National audience, as are white Londoners who have grown to love Gupta's previous work on television and in fringe venues. The Othello there of the young black actor David Harewood, the former lover of Vanessa Redgrave, was unforgettable, as was ''Troilus and Cressida'' with black actors playing all the Trojans and white actors playing the Greeks. A new black star, Chiwetel Ejiofor, is stunning audiences in a new play, Joe Penhall's ''Blue Orange,'' which Mr. Bamigboye of The Daily Mail says is ''the best play in town.'' Cathy Tyson (star of the film ''Mona Lisa''), Adrian Lester (in Kenneth Branagh's ''Love's Labour's Lost'') and Josette Simon (the female lead of two of the three plays brought recently to the Brooklyn Academy of Music by the Royal Skakespeare Company) are all actors whom you are now as likely to see at the R.S.C. as on TV soaps. This would have been unthinkable even five years ago. A black Othello would have been seen as an affront to the bard and to precious Englishness.\n British television is going through a similar transformation. ''Goodness Gracious Me,'' the irreverent comedy show, started life as ''Asian'' entertainment on the BBC. But the walls of containment have long since been smashed. The actors and writers Nina Wadia, Kulvinder Ghir, Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar (you should see his Muslim Woody Allen) have created brilliantly risque material that ridicules their own folksy folk as well as white Britons. Black, Asian and now white kids are ardent fans and can be heard yelling out catch phrases -- ''kiss my chuddie'' (panties), for example -- in cut-glass or chimney-sweep accents. Ms. Syal met a skinhead in a park who, instead of threatening to kill her, told her how much he liked her show.\n As Nina Wadia says: ''Finally, to be Asian is to be cool. How London has changed since I first came over 12 years ago. It feels like everyone has a stake in this city. You can be yourself and find an outlet for your talents, your stories.'' Ms. Syal agrees up to a point. Too many talented blacks and Asians are still kept out by the powerful elite, she says, but: ''Now we are not the 'other.' We are universal and valid.'' Her one-woman show at the Groucho Club, the place for snooty arty folk, was sold out, and the BBC is making a six-part drama series based on her first novel, ''Anita and Me.'' There is no other person in London who combines Ms. Syal's talents -- a stand-up comic, serious actress, singer, feature film writer, television script writer and performer and now an award-winning novelist.\n Popular culture and lifestyle are also deeply affected by what the author Paul Gilroy calls ''London's heterocultural life.'' The hottest clothes designers are Ozwald Boateng and Hussein Chalayan, who bring the gifts of the outsider to subvert the aesthetic assumptions of insiders. The ''holistic beauty therapist'' Bharti Vyas uses Indian medical and cosmetic systems on clients like Margaret Thatcher, Cherie Blair and Cher. Her walnut shell face cream is (allegedly) used by both the Clintons to bring a shine to their faces. Chefs at modern Indian restaurants have completely outwitted their complacent (and often arrogant and careless) counterparts at French and Italian restaurants. Eating the delicate creations of Cyrus Todiwala at Cafe Spice Namaste is like listening to an excellent musician; the pleasure echoes in your senses for a long time afterward.\n You could argue that the English have been consuming multiculturalism since Francis Drake first set sail, bringing back with him all manner of foreign booty, spices and recipes for cooking peacocks. The colonial enterprise, in part, came out of this peculiarly irrepressible English need for the exotic. This is why they have been massively better at embracing (or is it appropriating?) multiculturalism than has any other European community, or indeed the Scots, Irish or Welsh. The Italians, for all their reputed openness, remain morbidly committed to the preservation of homogeneity and historical continuity. Here, curry has become the favorite food of our city and indeed the nation.\n BUT unlike before, the purveyors of diversity are more than suppliers. They choose not to be possessed but to possess, and to move beyond becoming just another choice for the insatiably greedy white consumer. The ''ethnic minorities'' are beginning to redefine the very essence of what it means to be a Londoner. As Mr. Navaz of Fun-Da-Mental says: ''There is no other place in the world like this city today. In spite of racism, in spite of keeping us down and out for so long and the powerful keeping control over what they will let through, we have burst out. I used to look through the windows at the white world. Now I know that white kids are looking through mine, wanting to join in with this energy.'' Mr. Bamigboye agrees. When he takes his teenage son Nicholas to a skateboard park, he sees how ''young London is black London.'' ''We are infiltrating every corner of London's cultural life, including the most traditional outposts,'' he says. And the writers who best capture this modern London are not Martin Amis or Julian Barnes but Zadie Smith (''White Teeth''), Meera Syal (''Life Isn't All Ha Ha Hee Hee''), Shyama Perera (''Haven't Stopped Dancing Yet'') and Diran Adebayo (''My Once Upon A Time'').\n This is not to deny that the city is still blighted with racism. Integration is not equality. The much publicized racist murder in South London of the 18-year-old black man Stephen Lawrence, one of many such victims, shows just how far we still have to go to eradicate this poison. The memorial on the spot where he was killed is frequently desecrated. There were 200,000 racial incidents in Britain last year. In some London areas, 60 percent of the population is nonwhite and attacks against them are rife. And if overt racial discrimination has slipped from view, that which remains has become more efficient. There is barely a trickle of black and Asian power brokers into the most influential positions in this country. The African-American journalist Tara Mack, who now lives here, believes that ''London is more at ease with the idea of integration and there is no public expression of the raging debates in the United States about cultural distinctiveness and the perils or otherwise of integration.'' ''But,'' she continues, ''it is important not to mistake signs of integration with progress on equality. You see mixed-race couples everywhere and friendships too. But you know how access is still denied and what the struggles are. We are nowhere near the post-racial London depicted in Zadie's book.''\n Ethnic and social divisions, too, reveal themselves, with some young people increasingly attracted to simplistic ''pure'' identities (Muslim, Sikh, black, English) and at times fighting one another on the streets where their parents have lived peacefully for years. But although this has led to some separation of groups, evidence of real and irreversible integration is everywhere.\n The impact of integration is manifold. It has forced open the doors of white establishments and empowered us to enter as equals. This subverts the insanity of cultural protectionism, black or white. Black kids seeing Mr. Harewood learn to cultivate a love of Shakespeare that they previously and foolishly rejected as ''white.'' White gatekeepers can't keep us out (though they try even now), and audiences for Ms. Gupta's ''Waiting Room'' find that the sad life of a dead Asian housewife speaks to their hearts.\n In some areas, like food, this spark of integration has meant the bringing back from the dead of spent old England. But the most exciting consequence of all this unsettling is that newness is born. The cultural landscape is always changing, and yet out of this flux, at some still points, an unexpected shoot and root appears that settles in and becomes part of a new landscape. Talvin Singh's fusions belong to those who are not ''Western'' or ''Eastern'' but thrusting, modern cosmopolitans with ambitions that go beyond both original identities.\n Why is this optimistic upsurge happening now? The reasons are political, social and demographic. We have finally come out of the national depression that settled on our city during the long, bitter days of Conservatism. I remember Mrs. Thatcher saying in the very year that I moved into London that white Britons like her were worried about being ''swamped'' by alien cultures. Her ideological son, William Hague, now comes to swim in that swamp. Eagerly, too. Two years back he turned up at the Caribbean Carnival in a baseball cap, the first British politician ever to do so. We have our first elected mayor, Ken Livingstone, a man well loved for his genuine enthusiasm for multiculturalism. And although New Labour is still too white in its inner sanctums, for the first time in our history we do have black and Asian ministers and we are getting other important endorsements. Cherie Blair, for example, frequently appears in public in Asian clothes, which she wears with the love and flair of someone who feels utterly at home in them.\n Devolution has made Londoners acutely appreciative of multiculturalism. With the Scots and Welsh in their all-white new political institutions, and the ethnic English now demanding their own parliament, London is becoming the keeper of precious diversity. How can it ever imagine itself ethnically pure? Fifty percent of young black men here have white partners. In some schools mixed-race children make up 80 percent of the population. Your archetypal Londoner is Zadie Smith, not Eliza Doolittle.\n Immigration changes those who move and the places they move to. Neither can ever be the same, especially not a promiscuous city like London, which is ever more hungry for contact and less afraid of contamination. As Stuart Hall of the Open University says: ''For the first time being black and Asian is a way of being British. It is also sexy, and cool -- all things that the Puritan English culture has both reviled and desired. In London especially, young blacks and Asians have turned marginality into a creative life force. They have styled their way into British culture -- which is not hard because it was very unstylish. They have made it their own.'' And how.",

    "text": "MEDICINE MERCHANTS: Patents and Patients; As Devastating Epidemics Increase, Nations Take On Drug Companies\n2000-07-09T05:00:00.000Z\nUntil recently, Robert Nyantika, 30, was a strong, straight-backed police officer fighting ''shifters'' -- guerrillas and cattle thieves who make cross-border raids from Somalia. Now he is a stooped wraith unable to focus his eyes, bathe himself or walk without help. Speaking in a voice somewhere between a whisper and a song, he says his best memory is that his unit never left its wounded behind.\nHis elder brother, Omari, has the same philosophy. When he heard that Robert was deathly ill in a faraway clinic, he brought him home, already gravely thin from AIDS-related tuberculosis and diarrhea. Overworked doctors at a public Nairobi hospital were too busy or indifferent to examine Robert for a week, but Omari, a home health worker in a Nairobi slum, realized what was happening: Robert had the crippling headaches and stiff neck of cryptococcal meningitis, an AIDS complication that would blind and then kill him within two weeks.\nThe cure is fluconazole, a drug patented in most of the world by Pfizer, Inc. and commonly prescribed in America as a one-pill cure for women's yeast infections.\nIn Kenya, it costs $18 per pill, a price paid by the tiny number who can afford Nairobi's one private hospital and escape the vagaries of a national health budget that averages $5 per citizen per year. To live, Robert would need two pills a day for 8 weeks -- cost $1,080 -- and then one a day for the rest of his life -- $540 a month. His monthly earnings as a police officer were $43.\nRobert's cure became a tiny part of the titanic struggle going on between pharmaceutical companies and public health advocates over the cost of drugs like fluconazole and who has the right to produce and market them.\nA cheaper generic version of the drug was available and made legally in Thailand, which along with South Africa has challenged the drug companies' monopoly on their most successful products. This, they say, is the only way to save lives from the AIDS epidemic. The Thai generic, which costs only 60 cents a pill, could not be brought legally to Kenya, which like many other third world countries is only now considering whether to follow the Thai and South African challenge to the world's pharmaceutical giants.\nBut Omari knew a nurse at a foreign aid agency where doctors furious at Pfizer's pricing policy were illegally smuggling the Thai drug into Kenya. They had enough to save two lives. Robert's became one.\nIn April, when Robert began taking the pills, he was too weak to lift his hand to his mouth, but he still had courage, Omari said.\n''He recognizes how expensive the drugs are, and if he vomits, he throws that away,'' Omari said. ''So he really clings on. He fights to contain them.''\nBy mid-June, Robert was alive and home in this Nairobi suburb where goats graze beside row houses and turkeys stalk up and down the dirt roads. He had survived a bout of malaria and was still skeletal, but he could feed himself, sit up and walk with help. Asked where he most wanted to go, he answered: ''Back to my place of work.'' Omari, who still helps bathe him, is slowly breaking it to Robert that this is unlikely. He is proud that his care, connections and good luck have bought his brother a few more months, perhaps even a few more years of life.\nSetting Prices\nBig Differences And Big Profits\nFluconazole, the best anti-fungal agent invented by modern science, is equally effective against toenail fungus, children's oral thrush and cryptococcal meningitis. It is too miraculous for the poor to live without and too profitable for Pfizer to give up.\nTwo competing forces have intensified the battle over drugs like fluconazole: the 1994 world treaty on intellectual property that underpins free trade and the AIDS epidemic of the 1990's, which is devastating whole continents too poor to pay the going rate for patented drugs.\nThe public health advocates and an increasing number of third world countries say the 1994 treaty allows them to manufacture or import much cheaper generic drugs to avert national disaster; the drug companies argue that the costs of developing drugs are so high that they cannot afford lower prices for the few that become wildly successful.\nPfizer first patented fluconazole in 1982 under the name Diflucan, and it will remain patented until 2004 in the United States and longer elsewhere. It is one of many drugs that put the drug companies in an awkward position: They earn their largest profits when they are prescribed for routine problems of wealthy Americans and Europeans, but they could save millions of the very poor if available and affordable.\nTo protect valuable patents, the industry has used a whole array of tactics, from aggressive lobbying to generous giveaways of millions of doses.\nCryptococcal meningitis attacks about 9 percent of all people with AIDS. In some countries, like Thailand, it attacks more than 20 percent. Untreated, the victims die in less than a month.\nThe wholesale prices of pills are set to recoup the costs of research, which the industry says is about $500 million per new drug, to pay for marketing, lobbying and other overhead, and to earn the huge returns that make the pharmaceutical industry among the world's most profitable.\nPfizer sells roughly $1 billion worth of fluconazole a year.\nIts wholesale prices vary widely around the globe. A 1999 study by the Nobel Prize-winning agency Doctors Without Borders found them ranging from $3.60 a pill in Thailand to over $27 in Guatemala, with about a $10 average. Pfizer did not dispute the average, but said the range is smaller, from $5 in Thailand to $11 in France. The wholesale price is $6.38 in South Africa, $8.52 in Kenya and $9.78 in the United States. With retail markups, the drug may sell for $40 a pill.\nIn countries that do not honor American patents, the same drug is made by generics manufacturers. Cipla, a major Indian drug company, offers it for 64 cents a pill; Madawa Pharmaceuticals of Bangladesh for 41 cents, three Thai companies for between 30 and 70 cents.\nPfizer has other phenomenally profitable drugs: Lipitor, which cuts cholesterol, Zoloft for depression and, of course, Viagra. Because it is so wealthy, and yet keeps fluconazole prices high, Pfizer's critics call it a pitiless corporation that lets people die rather than cut prices or relinquish patents.\n''Everyone -- senior citizens, AIDS activists -- always accuses us of being profiteers,'' said Brian McGlynn, chief spokesman for Pfizer. ''And they say we'd rather give a rich white guy an erection than help an African with AIDS.\n''But we invest $4.7 billion in research each year, and 3 out of 10 medicines never make back their investment. And, yes, we spend a lot of money on advertising and marketing. But we don't sell soda pop. It's an enormous transfer of knowledge from our lab scientists to doctors, through those sales reps.''\nSouth Africa has the world's fastest-growing AIDS epidemic. In April, on the day that AIDS activists, unions and religious groups were set to begin a lawsuit and picketing campaign denouncing the company as an AIDS profiteer, Pfizer announced that it would supply the drug free to any South African with AIDS who could not afford it.\nIf the company expected thanks, it got almost none.\nAct Up, the American AIDS activism group, tried to storm Pfizer's annual meeting. By June, Doctors Without Borders, which is campaigning for cheaper drugs, was accusing Pfizer of reneging on its promise. It said the company had imposed a time limit on its donation and required doctors to report back as if in a clinical trial.\nSeeking Solutions\nAs Disease Spreads, More Nations Act\nPfizer denied this, saying the company will supply the drug free for life to every South African whose doctor says he cannot afford it, and that doctors have to report only whether their patients still take the pills and are still alive. The first free pills will not be distributed before fall at the earliest.\nIn Kenya, at a meeting in June on drug prices, officials from several African countries wondered aloud why they could not get the same deal. Dr. Jack Watters, Pfizer's medical director for Africa, said the giveaway might eventually be extended to the rest of Africa. He had already spoken with the Kenyan health authorities, he said.\n''If we can make it a success anywhere, we can in South Africa, because they have the best infrastructure,'' he said. Asked what the company's limit for charity was, he said, ''I really don't know the answer.\n''I tell the C.E.O.: 'We have 100,000 patients, they need 200 milligram pills, we don't know how long they'll live . . .' It's impossible math to do. We're not planning to stop the program, we're planning to look at it after two years.''\nThe profits on fluconazole and other drugs allow Pfizer to give away $120 million worth of free drugs a year, including millions of free doses of its best-selling antibiotic, Zithromax, to cure eye infections in central Africa and to treat venereal disease among southern African prostitutes and mineworkers, who are central to the spread of AIDS.\nHowever, many third world countries believe they cannot wait until the big pharmaceutical companies grant them charity.\nAt the June conference here, held some weeks after he had spoken to Dr. Watters, Kenya's health minister, Amukowa Anangwe, attacked profiteering, referring specifically to fluconazole. He said afterward that Kenya's Parliament was ready to pass a law allowing him to declare a health emergency when an important drug is unavailable at reasonable prices. The bill would empower him to void the drug's patent in Kenya. He could then either import cheap generic versions or use the threat to get Pfizer to lower its price.\nMore and more countries are contemplating or pursuing this path, taken already by South Africa and Thailand.\nUntil the 1990's, Thai law did not allow medicines to be patented. But the country signed the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which covers all sorts of goods. Signers become members of the World Trade Organization, an important goal for Thailand, which depends heavily on exports.\nBut one million Thais are infected with the AIDS virus, and high-priced medicines, fluconazole included, were eating up the health budget. The intellectual property laws Thailand generally defended started working against life expectancy.\nSetting U.S. Role\nOnce Firms' Protector But Changing Course\nBecause fluconazole was on the market before the law changed, it was unpatentable. But under American pressure, Thailand had created a program that conferred the same market exclusivity. Pfizer put fluconazole in it and charged $7 a capsule. When the exclusivity expired in 1998, three Thai companies began to make cheap generic fluconazole. Pfizer promptly dropped its price sharply in Thailand. Thai law allows the health minister to declare an emergency and seize a drug patent. In patent law, it is known as ''compulsory licensing'' -- a company is compelled to license its secrets to a rival.\nIn practice, Dr. Korn Dabbarensi, Thailand's health minister, said in an interview, seizing a patent is usually too much legal bother; the mere threat normally gets a company to lower its prices.\n''Even though we're able to go ahead with compulsory licensing, we've been informed by the Ministry of Trade that we have to use W.T.O. procedures,'' Dr. Dabbarensi said. ''So we go talk directly to the drug companies in a 'humane' manner. Just one-to-one talking. But the bottom line for me is -- how 'humane' are these manufacturers? They are talking to me about the profits of their company against the lives of my people.''\nThe 1994 global trade treaty specifically permits governments to use compulsory licensing -- not just for drugs, but for any safeguards against crises in public safety, war, health or environmental disasters. Such exceptions apply only to cure domestic emergency, and some royalty must be paid to the patent holder.\nThe Western pharmaceutical industry opposes compulsory licensing, and another practice known as ''parallel importing,'' which let a country's drug buyers seek the cheapest price anywhere in the world. Until recently, the drug companies' most powerful ally was the United States government.\nThe United States is a signatory to the 1994 protection of copyright worldwide, and has pressed other countries to pass patent and copyright laws more restrictive than its own to protect American corporations against foreign piracy.\nIn 1997, when South Africa tried to pass a law allowing the health minister to ignore the Patents Act in health crises, the United States lobbied hard against it. President Clinton raised the issue with President Nelson Mandela, the Commerce Department put South Africa on a watch list that is the first step toward trade sanctions, and a bill went through Congress making all American aid to South Africa contingent on dropping the law.\nThe South African pharmaceutical industry, which included subsidiaries of American and European companies, took the pressure much further. It closed factories, canceled investments and took out scare ads suggesting that babies could be hurt by counterfeit generic drugs. Its chief lobbyist, Mirryena Deeb, threatened to cut off all new drug discoveries to South Africa if the law passed, including AIDS drugs, cancer drugs and antibiotics. Asked in a March 1998 interview if she was literally threatening to let thousands of South Africans die, she reluctantly conceded: ''In so many words, yes.''\nThe practices that the United States and the industry were fighting so hard were legal not only under the 1994 treaty, but also under the laws of Western countries like France and Britain.\nThe United States, too, is a big user of compulsory licensing, said Carlos M. Correa, an internationally recognized patent law expert with the University of Buenos Aires. It is a common remedy in antitrust cases and was recently considered in the Microsoft case (it would have forced the company to license its Windows source code to rivals).\nAmerica's change of course came rather abruptly last year.\nIn early 1999, the Clinton administration was still squarely against South Africa's Medicines Control Act.\nBy December, the administration said it would not object if South Africa violated American law in seeking AIDS medications, as long as it abided by World Trade Organization rules. Within months, it had offered the same olive branch to the rest of Africa and to Thailand.\nThe catalyst was, apparently, a decision by the Philadelphia branch of Act Up, the gay advocacy group, to take up South Africa's cause and start heckling Vice President Al Gore, who was in the midst of his primary campaign for the presidency. The banners saying that Mr. Gore was letting Africans die to please American pharmaceutical companies left his campaign chagrined. After media and campaign staff looked into the matter, the administration did an about-face.\nWithout cheaper drugs, public health advocates say, the problems of doctors like Christopher Ouma, who works in a Nairobi public hospital where nearly 70 percent of patients have AIDS, will never be solved.\nHe recently listed drugs his hospital can never afford in sufficient quantity: Vitamins. Morphine. Warfarin for blood clots in the bedridden. Acyclovir for blinding shingles. Any anti-retrovirals, including the oldest, AZT. And, of course, fluconazole.\nThe chief killers of his AIDS patients, he said, are tuberculosis, diarrhea, pneumonia and cryptococcal meningitis. The first three are usually treatable. With the last, he said, ''we run up against a wall'' because of the price of fluconazole.\nThese patients are instantly recognizable, he says, because they moan all day. No painkiller but morphine works for them, and it is rationed.\n''They get no peace,'' Dr. Ouma said. ''With the intense pressure on the brain, some go blind. Most just go into a coma and die, and by then they are in such pain that it's really a blessing.''\nAs soon as he diagnoses cryptococcal meningitis in a patient, he says, he dispenses advice he hates: If they want to be buried in their ancestral village, as most Kenyans do, they should board a bus. They have only two or three weeks to live, and the cost of refrigerated trucks ruins many families.\n''Can you imagine, as a doctor, having this conversation with your patient?'' he said. ''I have it once a week.''",

    "text": "Can Mexico's New Leader Really Work Wonders?\n2000-10-29T05:00:00.000Z\nAS a new president prepares to take power in Mexico, the biggest economic news is what's not happening.\nThe peso is not plummeting, investors are not panicking, and people are not suddenly paying more for their tortillas or televisions. Given recent history, this is a small miracle: every presidential transition in the last two decades has been scarred by an economic crisis. Instead of fears, there are great hopes, all raised by the next president, Vicente Fox Quesada.\n''The revolution of the 21st century has begun,'' Mr. Fox, who takes office on Dec. 1, proclaimed last week. His advisers have compared his election on July 2, which ended seven decades of political domination by a single party, to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Ever since, during the long transition, he has been promising to tear down the corrupt and inefficient legacies of the past, and to erect modern and rational practices in their place. That has not been easy in Germany -- and may be harder in Mexico.\nMr. Fox now must institutionalize the stability he has inherited. He has pledged sweeping tax and fiscal reforms, annual economic growth rates of up to 7 percent, millions of new jobs, a stable economic architecture for foreign capital, private investment in the state-run oil industry and competition in telecommunications. He also promises budget austerity, increased social spending, the rise of the rule of law and an end to ingrained political corruption. To do all this might take 60 years, rather than the six-year term that Mr. Fox has won. It will require constitutional changes, the cooperation of a divided Congress, and lots of luck.\nBut many of Mexico's most prominent and powerful business figures are cheering for him. ''What I have heard is very encouraging,'' said Alejandro Elizondo Barragan, president and chief executive of Hylsamex, one of the country's largest steel manufacturers. ''This country needs to grow, and Mr. Fox is very aware of that.''\nMr. Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who entered politics as a congressman and later became a governor, knows that he was elected to change the way Mexico works. If he made good on half of his promises, Mexico would be transformed.\n''The most fundamental challenge for Fox will be dealing with the enormously profound expectations Mexicans have of him after winning the election,'' said Luis Rubio, the director of Cidac, an economic and political research organization in Mexico City. ''Now he will have to deliver.''\nMillions of Mexicans, and many foreign investors, are hoping that he will.\nMexico is still very much a developing nation. Reliable electric power and potable water are sometimes hard to find. In the capital, one of the world's most populous and polluted cities, the elite live behind barricades, protected from the impoverished by armed guards. Middle-class Mexicans have less buying power than they did 20 years ago, and some of the biggest banks are shaky from a legacy of bad loans. Many small businesses are threatened by imports, credit is difficult to obtain, and millions of people scrape by on less than $2 a day.\nThe departing president, Ernesto Zedillo, never addressed the huge structural problems of the state-run energy industries, which are inefficient and suppress competition, or of the justice system, which cannot control crime -- a serious worry for foreign companies considering operations here even if they are optimistic about Mr. Fox.\n''He's going to have his hands full,'' said Peter E. Weber, vice president of Latin American operations for the FMC Corporation, a Chicago-based industrial and chemical company that does extensive business in Mexico. ''Fox will have to address the crime situation, which has an impact on attracting foreign investment. There's an awful lot of work to be done in the microeconomy, the ability of industry and agriculture to compete on a global scale, improving the quality of education.''\nYET Mr. Zedillo has enabled Mr. Fox to come to power in a Mexico that looks -- on paper -- economically stronger than ever.\nReal growth rates have averaged 5 percent for the last four years. Driven by the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican exports to the United States have grown from about $60 billion in 1995 to more than $100 billion in 1999. Richard W. Fisher, the deputy United States trade representative, estimated that two-way trade between Mexico and the United States is running at the equivalent of more than half a million dollars a minute. At its current growth rate, it will exceed the trade between the United States and the European Union by 2004.\nIn June alone, Mr. Fisher said, ''we sold them $700 million worth of semiconductors, 28,000 cars and trucks, $48 million worth of surgical equipment, 250,000 tons of soybeans and 200,000 golf balls.'' Mexico's leading exports include machinery, oil, clothes, fresh vegetables, glass and electronics parts.\nMoody's Investors' Service raised Mexico's foreign debt rating to investment grade in March. That same month, Mexico signed a free-trade agreement with the European Union. Foreign investment is expected to exceed $12 billion this year after averaging about $11 billion annually since 1995. Inflation is decreasing -- and is predicted to fall below 10 percent this year. Wall Street appears to love Mexico's central bankers, especially Guillermo Ortiz, the central bank president, whose term lasts three more years.\nAll of these are indicators of Mr. Zedillo's achievements. They give international investors reasons to believe, given continuing fiscal austerity and a stable currency, that the nation may become stronger without severe growing pains.\nIf it does, the credit will go in roughly equal measures to the two men trading places at Los Pinos, the presidential mansion.\nPresident Zedillo, an economist trained in the United States, took office in 1994, inheriting and in some cases aggravating a series of financial shocks that staggered Mexico, including a banking crisis that may wind up costing citizens $100 billion. But he is in many ways keeping his pledge two years ago ''to hand over the presidency in healthy economic conditions, protected from the crises that have ruined the country over the past 20 years.''\nSome of the success has to do with the trade and economic policies that Mr. Zedillo instituted during his first three years in office. Some has to do with what he was handed: namely, Nafta. Mexican government figures show that export growth generated by the free trade agreement accounted for nearly half of the 3.3 million jobs created in Mexico in the last five years.\nBUT nothing that Mr. Zedillo has done for Mexico economically may be more important than the way that he is giving up power. He became the first president of Mexico to create the conditions for truly free elections and a democratic transition of power.\nFor decades, the economy, like every other institution in Mexico, was manipulated by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Every six years, each president played tricks to help his hand-picked successor win -- artificially strengthening the peso, increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates, handing out a nationwide wage increase shortly before election day.\nThe party kept power, but the economy kept crashing, undermined by the previous administration's acts of self-interest. Mr. Zedillo, mindful of that history, strove to make the economy more institutional than individual.\nHe never took on some sacred cows -- like state-run oil and state-sanctioned barriers to competition -- and thus never fully transformed Mexico's centralized economy into that of a modern market-driven nation. But when he gave independence to Mr. Ortiz and the central bank in 1997, Mr. Ortiz turned the central bank into a stabilizing power.\n''The central bank's independence, as an institutional counterbalance to the presidency, was also a deliberate erosion of the power of the presidency,'' said Gray Newman, the head of the Latin American economics group at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York.\nThe price of a stable economy was the loss of power. On election day four months ago, the country was stable enough to change without an economic or political crisis. And if Mr. Fox has his way, it will keep changing, drastically.\n''Mexico's old six-year curse appears to be broken,'' Mr. Newman said. ''But there is now a curse of abundance. Rapidly growing economy, flush with cash -- sounds like you couldn't ask for more. That is why it is so risky for Mr. Fox right now.''\nThe risk is that Mr. Fox, having promised change, will fail -- foiled by the Congress, where the old ruling party still holds a plurality, and by the high expectations he has raised.\nMr. Fox, 58, cuts a rougher figure than his courtly predecessor. A Reaganesque rancher, wearing cowboy boots engraved with his name, he has little formal background in economics. By instinct and training from his days as president of Coca-Cola of Mexico, he sold himself to Mexico like a soft drink. He is a delegator, with deep faith in corporate management techniques. He is a man given to great, sometimes transitory enthusiasm, and his transition to power has been marked by a few possibly pie-in-the-sky fiscal policy pronouncements.\nHe has promised that the economy will grow by up to 7 percent a year--- although he is now hedging on that bet. (G.D.P. grew at an annual rate of 7.6 percent in the second quarter, fueled in part by windfall revenue from Mexican oil exports, but Merrill Lynch's and J. P. Morgan's economists are predicting Mexico's growth rate will slow to 4 percent in 2001.)\nHe has also pledged to create 1.35 million jobs a year, spend millions to fight illiteracy, poverty and disease, and to institute the first coherent tax-collection system that Mexico has ever known.\nBut during the long transition, Mr. Fox -- who has yet to name a cabinet -- has also failed to say precisely how he will accomplish all this.\nMR. FOX has some other lofty ideas.\nOne is his vision of the United States, Mexico and Canada united in a common market, their borders mere lines on the map, a generation from now. Another is breaking down corrupt structures in banking, finance, real estate and political circles.\nHe expresses high regard for the Grameen bank, the Bangladeshi institution that pioneered credits for the poor, and he promises to help Mexico's farmers and shopkeepers with loans. As the governor of the state of Guanajuato in 1995, Mr. Fox himself started such a bank, granting credits of $50 and up.\nHe wants to enforce tax collection from the rich, something that Mexico does poorly. Tax revenue is equal to only 11 percent of Mexico's G.D.P., compared with 30 percent in the United States. The low level of tax collection means that the government can do far less to help the 30 million or more Mexicans living below the poverty level.\nMr. Fox also says he will seek to tax many of the poor -- millions of people who are off the grid of the formal economy, like street vendors. He aims to increase value-added tax collections on retail sales by 17 percent next year. That includes a deeply unpopular proposal to impose the tax on food and medicine -- the single largest component of new revenue that Mr. Fox proposes, and the most politically sensitive. He would ease the pain for millions of families making less than $12 a day by providing direct subsidies.\nOne key to Mr. Fox's success will be whether he can open Mexico's electrical and petrochemical sectors to foreign investment and change the nature of Petroleos de Mexico, known as Pemex, the state-run oil and natural gas company, to allow more competition. Such a shift would diminish Mexico's financial reliance on Pemex, which provides about a third of the government's annual revenue.\nSome members of Mr. Fox's circle -- including people vying to become cabinet ministers -- have suggested that Pemex have more autonomy and that the entire energy sector, including the ragged electric-power grid, be opened to private investment. Mexico is the last large nation in the Western hemisphere without private-sector power.\nThe departing administration's top energy officials say Mexico would have to amend its constitution to allow private investment in electricity. And restructuring Pemex would be a radical change for Mexico, which nationalized the oil industry in the 1930's.\nBUT if Mr. Fox wants to meet his economic goals, he may have to change the way energy is produced and sold in Mexico. Demand is outpacing the supplies provided by state-run monopolies. To meet demand, $5 billion a year in new investments in electricity and $2 billion a year in natural gas may be needed for the next decade.\n''Everything starts with the need for economic growth, and to get it you need to make the energy sector more productive, and to do that you have to open it up to foreign investment,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a petroleum consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ''You've got to get the gas and power from somewhere.''\nMr. Fox has said he will push Congress in the coming year to open up the electricity and natural-gas markets. Not everyone is confident that it can be accomplished so soon.\n''We are very eager for the new administration, to see the new rules of the game,'' said Jean Noel Mesnard of Gaz de France in Mexico. ''Providing natural gas for Mexico is going to be a big question in the coming years, and opening it up to private operators would be a good solution.''\nThe lack of affordable energy already is threatening some businesses, like iron and steel manufacturers, which laid off hundreds of workers in September after natural-gas prices shot up.\n''The root of the problem is that we have a monopoly here,'' said Mr. Elizondo, the Hylsamex chief executive, who is also chairman of Mexico's iron and steel industry council. ''There's only one supplier of natural gas, and that's Pemex. The most important thing is to do away with the monopoly, open up the industry to private investment, local and foreign, and allow market forces to freely do their work.''\nMr. Fisher, the deputy United States trade representative, said he is convinced that Mr. Fox ''believes that competition is good and monopolies are bad.''\n''He understands, as a business guy, that to take Mexico to the next stage of growth, he's going to have to put in place structures that enhance competition and encourage foreign investment,'' Mr. Fisher said.\nMAKING rich and powerful Mexicans pay their taxes and obey the law would also help. Mexico did not invent impunity, but after 70 years of often corrupt one-party rule, it has made an art of it. A contract signed with a powerful person in Mexico may not be a legally enforceable document, one member of Mexico's business elite observed.\nChanging that culture is another of Mr. Fox's pledges, and it may also be hard to fulfill. ''But if they're going to take the final steps to institute the rule of law and provide investors with an encouraging, not an uncomfortable, environment, it will have to be done,'' Mr. Fisher said.\nRogelio Ramirez de la O., one of Mexico's best-respected economic analysts, says Mr. Fox has to change the way Mexico runs, down to the roots, if he is to succeed in the economic realm.\n''With the banking and energy sectors, he has to be able to change the way they operate,'' he said. ''That implies reducing the size of state companies like Pemex and making them more efficient. That implies changing the government, not just the company. It implies fiscal reform, judicial reform, regulation and competition.''\nThat is what the middle-class, educated people who helped put Mr. Fox in power voted for. In the election, the freest and fairest in Mexico's history, one of Mr. Fox's strongest assets was who he was not: not a member of the political ruling class, not weighed down by its often sordid past. He is already a historic figure: the man who drove the world's longest-ruling party from power after seven decades.\nAmid great change, the country feels stable, and its economy looks strong for the moment. But Mexico is a land of earthquakes, and if Mr. Fox cannot keep his promises when he is in power, the ground may well shake before he leaves office in 2006.",

    "text": "The Smart Set\n2000-06-04T05:00:00.000Z\nOn a wet, blustery April morning, mist blowing sideways across the docks marking the lower end of Union Street on the Brooklyn waterfront, 17-year-old Alice Warren-Gregory races down the steps from her family's third-floor apartment a little after 5:30 a.m. Clutching a calculator and a copy of ''The Great Gatsby,'' she hurries up the block in the predawn darkness to catch a waiting B71 bus. As we step on board, the driver says, ''Good morning, Alice,'' and closes the door.\n''I got four hours of sleep the night before, and I went to bed at 1 a.m. last night,'' Alice says grumpily, settling into a seat and opening her book. We have barely gone a block, and she is already fretting about how far behind she is. ''I was supposed to write my essay on 'Song of Solomon' for English, but I didn't get to it,'' she says. ''I had to do my laundry.'' The topics of this early-morning conversation -- laundry, homework, her guitar lessons, the boring party in Manhattan over the weekend -- form little tiles in the typical mosaic of teenage ennui.\nBut as the empty bus lumbers down into the Gowanus flats and up toward Prospect Park, strange words and phrases begin tumbling from Alice's lips. ''Synaptic plasticity.'' ''Hippocampus.'' ''Long-term potentiation.'' She isn't talking about things she has learned from a textbook; she is talking about the stuff and ideas of contemporary brain research, things she'll be working with later that same day. Indeed, she is talking about a science project she is pursuing after school under the guidance of Constantine Pavlides, who happens to be a world-class neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York and a leading researcher on the role of stress in the neurophysiology of memory and learning.\nThe Pavlides lab, she says, has been pursuing a theory suggesting that animals -- presumably including humans -- convert the things they learn during their waking hours into long-term memory during the period of sleep characterized by rapid eye movement, or REM sleep, which also happens to be the peak period for dreaming. It is on the leading edge of modern scientific research, and Alice, who just took her College Boards and still doesn't know where she wants to go to college, spends part of every school day living on that edge. ''If you deprive animals of REM sleep, they have lots of trouble, like with spatial relationships,'' Alice explains. ''Kind of like me,'' she adds with a laugh. ''Dr. Pavlides was explaining this to me, and I'm, like, yeah, two things I know a lot about -- stress and lack of sleep.''\nAlice's typical 18-hour school day begins before 6 a.m. As a junior at Midwood High School in Brooklyn, she attends one of the most overcrowded, antiquated, ethnically diverse and, in terms of science education, unusually successful schools in New York City's public school system. She is one of approximately 60 students in the class of 2001 known informally as ''Intel kids'' -- gifted students who literally sign a contract promising to devote several precious years of their teenage lives, weekends and summers usually included, to conducting original independent research and competing in a series of local and national science competitions, culminating in the prestigious Science Talent Search sponsored each year by the Intel Corporation (formerly by Westinghouse). Since 1990, Midwood High School has produced 112 semifinalists, one of the best records in the nation.\nA generation ago the kind of students who entered science fairs were considered nerds -- preternaturally bright kids whose ardent intellects, moire-patterned wardrobes and clueless social instincts put them outside the adolescent mainstream. Geeks still roam the halls of American high schools -- and of Midwood, for that matter -- but many of Midwood's Intel kids move comfortably in the newly respectable mainstream, where being scientifically astute has a certain cachet. They inhabit an area of cultural endeavor that -- coming a quarter-century after the birth of biotechnology and personal computers and, yes, the rise of Nasdaq -- is now seen not only as intellectually precocious but also, suddenly, improbably, as positioned in a fast lane pointed toward wealth, creature comforts and the freedom to choose what to make of one's life.\nAt a place like Midwood, which draws on a less elite population than city schools with admission exams, like the traditional powerhouses Stuyvesant and the Bronx High School of Science, the Intel contest provides the flame that heats a new, high-tech version of the melting pot myth. Many of the students competing for next year's prizes lived just a few years ago in places like Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Vietnam and Bangladesh, and English is often a second language. Many come from households with difficult financial or familial circumstances. Like a test-tube version of the teenage strivers immortalized in the movie ''Fame,'' they see the science-fair competitions as a path to attention and acclaim, to scholarship money and a better college education and, ultimately, to a better life. For many students, merely doing the research and producing a paper is a transforming experience.\nBut it comes at tremendous sacrifice. ''Everyone who has worked in my lab has gone to Harvard, Yale, Brown, all Ivy League schools,'' Alice says. ''I really feel a pressure to perform.'' That pressure often chases an otherwise lovely smile from Alice's face; in more relaxed moments she can be sassy, irreverent, insightful and unusually self-aware, but like many Intel kids, she has her eyes firmly latched on the prize. ''I think it's really good to have something like Intel, because it gives you focus,'' she says. ''I think some people in high school lose sight, and then they get to their senior year and find that they've gotten caught up in trivial things. Right now is a really good time to work hard at something.''\nIn these days of standards-based education, the Intel competition functions as a kind of ex officio nationwide Regents test for the best and the brightest. It is often referred to -- in Intel news releases, certainly -- as ''the Nobel Prize of high school students,'' and kids who reach the finals and semifinals get lots of attention. What rarely gets described is the gestalt of life as a burgeoning adolescent intellect -- the incredibly long days, the hard and heady work, the inevitable shedding of many quotidian pleasures of teenage life (dating, participating in sports, listening to or making music) in order to conduct advanced lab research. As Alice puts it: ''There are people in the Intel program at school who have social lives. I just don't happen to be one of them.''\nAfter leaving the subway and stopping for a bagel with cream cheese (''This is probably the last thing I'll have to eat until 7 o'clock tonight''), Alice walks briskly to Brooklyn College, where Midwood students attend some of their college-level advanced-placement classes. The first to arrive, she sits on the floor of a long, empty corridor interrupted only by a succession of cranberry-colored steel doors, all locked. ''My mom is really concerned about my health,'' Alice says at one point. ''She thinks I have an eating disorder. But I just don't have time to eat, that's the problem.''\nUnexpectedly, a little fear creeps into her voice. Her mother, she continues, recently announced her desire to leave New York -- the sooner she could move, the better. Alice interprets this development as a potentially devastating disruption of all her dreams -- of staying at Midwood, of completing her Intel project, of getting into a top-drawer East Coast college. ''I just want to finish up at Midwood,'' she says, swallowing hard, staring straight ahead. ''But as it stands now, I really have no place to go.'' Shortly after sunrise, she is deep into the day's first crisis.\nAt 7 a.m., the chemistry teacher, Alan Finkelstein, arrives and unlocks the classroom door, and Alice, along with 30 or so other sleepy-eyed students, files into the room. Finkelstein wordlessly begins to write a problem on the board. ''The electrolysis of an aqueous solution of potassium iodide results in the formation of hydrogen gas at the cathode and. . . . '' Like everyone else, Alice gets out her calculator and begins solving what, for her, is a far more tractable kind of problem.\n'The Scientific 'Hood'\nIt has always been hard to be a high school intellectual. my 1967 high school yearbook contains a photograph of the Science Seminar club. Eight students, all boys. No one is smiling. It would be easy to make fun of the horn-rimmed glasses and bold plaid shirts, but what is most striking to me is the body language: the tense, tight-lipped posture of defensiveness, as if being smart, clever and intellectually adventurous singled you out for ridicule. The damning adjective for any teenager from that era was ''mature.'' That was code for smart, responsible and virtually incapable of the puerile, thrill-seeking, predatory, reckless and authority-defying behavior so essential to adolescent self-esteem.\nI wasn't in that picture, but only because the brainiacs at my suburban Chicago high school left me in the dust. I don't believe the word ''geek'' had entered the lexicon then, but the sense of the word surely had: kids gifted in science and math inhabited a rarefied universe, where everything intellectual was easy and everything social was hard. Or so it seemed. In reality, I have come around to the view that science institutionalizes the need to challenge your strongest convictions with rigorous thought, which is one reason it constantly chases the New and is now, arguably, a much more interesting avant-garde than, say, art. And there comes a moment, sooner or later, when we all admire its creativity and yearn for its interventions. One of the ''kids'' in that photograph, Douglas Brash, is now a professor at Yale who has played a leading role in explaining why we risk developing cancer when we sunbathe -- molecular explanations that may lead to molecular interventions and treatments for the growing epidemic of skin cancer.\nWhile geekdom has not totally been erased from the culture of high school science, the difference at Midwood is immediately apparent. In Alice's junior research class, taught by Stanley Shapiro, an enthusiastic, joke-spewing instructor who has a Ph.D. in chemistry and coordinates the science research program at Midwood, girls outnumber boys by almost 2 to 1, as they do in the entire program. And plastic shirt-pocket pen protectors don't live here anymore. Maria Bouzas, a junior, stands in front of the class describing her research project; she is wearing baggy blue pants, a loose gray sweatshirt and a light green kerchief around her streaked hair and sports a stainless-steel diamond-shaped stud through her lower lip. After describing the molecular biology of diabetes, and some particularly grisly techniques she has learned in a laboratory at Brooklyn College, someone in the class asked, ''You did that?''\nMaria suddenly brightened. ''Yeah, man,'' she gushed. ''I broke my way into the scientific 'hood!'' (I later learned that she also rides dirt bikes on the weekend and subscribes to a motocross magazine.)\nEveryone at Midwood seems to have a story. Alice, for example, lives in an apartment in Carroll Gardens with her mother and younger sister. Her mother works as a massage therapist at a Y.M.C.A. in Manhattan; she has hired a baby sitter so that Alice can do her after-school research at Rockefeller until 7 p.m. and not have to pick up her 7-year-old sister, Karyn, after school. To pay for the sitter, she has to work longer hours, which means she rarely sees Alice during the school week. ''I'm usually in bed before she gets home,'' Alice said. Alice often leaves for school before her mother wakes up.\nI noticed that Alice mentioned her mother a lot, but her father not at all. ''He's not a factor,'' she said in a strenuously neutral voice. She had written a poem about him, she told me, that appeared in Patterns, Midwood's literary magazine; it describes a daughter going to visit her father after he has undergone drug rehabilitation. ''Three weeks was long enough,'' it reads, ''For him to see/how slowly he was killing me/How waiting to find your father strung out/over cold, white, bathroom tile/was enough to rip your soul to shreds.'' Alice has a grade-point average of 97.1 and recently totalled 1490 on her College Boards.\nAs Jay Touger, one of three research advisers at the school, put it, ''You never know, looking at these kids, what life has done for them, or to them.'' Ananya Das's family, which belonged to the Hindu minority living in Moslem-dominated Bangladesh, fled the country in 1994 after increasing incidents of religious violence, including the kidnapping and rape of young Hindu girls; she is studying perception and the visual system at a lab at Brooklyn College. Mong Thi Le, who goes by the name Meagan, is a quietly brilliant 17-year-old who emigrated with her family from Saigon in 1996 and now has a grade-point average of 96.23. Anti-Semitism forced the family of Marianna Shnayderman, one of a large contingent of Russian emigres at the school, to leave Kiev in 1991; in addition to having been an Intel semifinalist, she will be Midwood's valedictorian at graduation ceremonies this month. Eugene Simuni, another Russian, came to the United States less than three years ago, yet finished higher than any other New York City student in this year's Intel contest. His classmate Emmanuelle St. Jean, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, was the only African-American among the Top 40 Intel finalists. Shapiro likes to tell the story about the time one former student needed to supply a Social Security number to fill out a science-fair application, which is how it was discovered that she was, technically, an illegal alien.\n'A Lot of People, Like, Don't Even Know That I'm Smart'\nMidwood may be an especially comfortable place to be smart. It's competitive -- everyone seems to know everyone else's grade-point average, down to the hundredth place, and students can have a 90 average and still rank 200th in their class. But many of the Intel students glide in and out of their elite subculture without passports or apologies.\n''I don't think of myself as being smart -- I think of myself as being normal,'' says Emmanuelle, who chose Barnard over Harvard for college. Diana Murakhovskaya, a senior who is also editor of the school's science magazine, Prism, says: ''I don't see myself as a geek. I have my smart friends. I have my museum friends. I have friends I go to clubs with on the weekend. A lot of people, like, don't even know that I'm smart.''\nWith its six Ionic columns and its Georgian cupola, the architecture of Midwood High School makes an outdated argument for a traditional, even classical, education in a neighborhood, and world, that has changed around it. The school was built to accommodate 2,800 students, mostly from the Irish, Italian and Jewish families that used to live nearby, but now nearly 4,000 crowd its hallways. In addition to its two gifted programs, for medical science and for the humanities, it is also the zoned high school for Midwood and surrounding neighborhoods, with their predominantly minority populations; the school is just over 40 percent African-American, 31 percent white, 19 percent Asian and 9 percent Hispanic, although the research program is much less heterogenous.\nIn many respects, Midwood is as up to date as any high school in the nation. Students affect a hip urban nomad look, lugging enormous backpacks, athletic bags, coats and lacrosse sticks from room to room. (No one is allowed to use the lockers anymore because thefts became so rampant.) The Intel students typically avoid the crowded cafeteria and eat lunch in class (everything from takeout barbecue to mocha Frappuccinos). They can get credit for phys ed by taking the ''cheese bus'' (the classic yellow schoolbus) to a bowling alley or billiards parlor. And the school newspaper recently ran an article entitled ''Should Cross-Dressing Be Allowed at the Prom?''\nBut time has stood still at Midwood in the worst possible way: its physical plant is a running joke among students and teachers. When I marveled at the beautiful 1940's-era glass-paneled cabinetry in some of the science labs, the principal, Lewis Frohlich, barked: ''I don't need museum pieces. I need modern equipment and facilities.'' (He is about to get his wish: after nearly six years of bureaucratic and community delays, Midwood hopes to begin construction on a $22 million state-of-the-art science annex across Bedford Avenue from the school in the fall of 2001.)\nAnd yet Midwood's shabby facilities also prove the point that dedicated teachers mean more than modern equipment. Midwood's two Intel finalists this year worked under Touger's tutelage. Ann Nicastri, who was a Westinghouse semifinalist in the 1950's, guides research students in biology. When you ask students why Midwood has been so successful in recent Intel competitions, they invariably mention the close and informal rapport with their teachers, and after watching their interaction over several months, I realized that in order to push students to their limits, and perhaps a little beyond, you need to know them very well. Recently, for example, when Alice began to feel a little overwhelmed, she went in to see Shapiro and ''yenta,'' as he put it, about all the stress she felt in her life -- how she was burning the candle at both ends, working too hard, tired all the time. ''My reaction was, 'Good,''' Shapiro told me later. ''That's what I like to see in my students.''\n''We ask the kids to do the impossible,'' Touger said. ''We ask them to do the equivalent of a master's thesis or a graduate thesis on a topic they know nothing about at first, and to do it in one year. And they do it. Year after year, they do it.''\nRoom 256\nThe first time I encountered Alice, she had come into room 256 -- technically a prep room for the physical science teachers, but in practice a kind of clubroom for Midwood's teenage intelligentsia -- with an excuse. Her English teacher had lost the only (handwritten) copy of the essay she had done on ''Scientific Attitude,'' one of five essays that form part of the Intel contest application. Shapiro looked at her skeptically -- as much, it seemed, because she preferred writing in longhand to using a computer. They bantered back and forth, and somehow the discussion turned to the way that kids, even in rural areas, can become interested in science. Shapiro mentioned the movie ''October Sky,'' about young rocket enthusiasts growing up in West Virginia. Alice, whose attitude can fairly be said to lean toward the humorously unsentimental, made a ribald remark about the recreational practices of teenage boys in rural America. In my day the comment might have earned a suspension, or at least a lecture. Here, everyone laughed.\nRoom 256, in other words, is the place where the traditional boundaries of authority and deference between students and teachers break down. The atmosphere of adult collegiality in turn creates an environment of adult expectation. Room 256 has high ceilings, high windows and an unbelievable amount of clutter, including half a dozen models of the solar system, quaintly obsolete electrical devices, the odd box of rocks, bottles of chemicals with yellowing labels, one computer for a dozen teachers and a ceiling fan that, upon closer inspection, is a floor fan lashed to the ceiling.\nOn any given morning around 8:30, several seniors invariably gather in the room around a 12-foot worktable. The conversation veers into molecular biology or computer models of traffic flow, then just as quickly back to plans for the prom. Diana, who is a dark-haired 18-year-old born in Odessa and an Intel semifinalist this year, goes clubbing on the weekend with Marianna, the class valedictorian, and other girls from Midwood. But she can tell you more than you could possibly want to know about the reactivity of ATP synthase molecules on the surface of cancer cells. She plans to get an engineering degree from Cooper Union. ''I probably want to start my own business,'' she said. ''Or belong to a corporation -- like, be the boss of it.''\nRoss Krupnik, 17, a genial and thoughtful student who lives in Sheepshead Bay, also did some original research on ATP synthase. ''We have, like, clashing results,'' he admitted, nodding toward Diana.\n''Yeah,'' she replied, ''but mine are being published.''\nSteven Beigelmacher, 18, spent one morning lecturing the others on his empirically derived technique for pouring hot coffee into a thin plastic cup without its melting; a computer jock, he will spend the summer calculating pensions for retired city firemen before attending Carnegie-Mellon University in the fall.\nThey don't, however, spend all their time reciting equations. One day, Diana announced that having finally turned 18, she had made a long-anticipated appointment to go sky diving this month. Someone asked if she liked para-sailing; she shook her head and said it was too boring. Instead of going to the prom, she and some friends have rented a limo and plan to go to dinner and clubbing before catching a bus to Ocean City, N.J., for a day of jet skiing at the beach.\n''If there was a television show, Room 256 would be the place,'' said Martin Langan, the assistant principal for the school's science department. ''This is like the teacher's version of M*A*S*H.'' The scene even came with goofy public-address announcements. ''Today's meeting of the Islamic Society has been canceled,'' went a voice over the loudspeaker. ''Thank you. Have a good day today, and a better day tomorrow.''\nThe (Rube) Goldberg Variations\nAlice, who was born in California and moved to Brooklyn when she was in the fifth grade, entered the research program as a sophomore because of her exceptional performance in science classes. ''I didn't ask to be an Intel student,'' she explained one day as we walked to her lab at Rockefeller. ''They just sort of put me into it without asking. My mom's reaction was, 'This is what we wanted!' and I said, 'We'?''\n''There was a little hesitation,'' confirmed her mother, Patricia Gregory. ''She can be very, very hard on herself, and has to be perfect. She wasn't sure she could handle it as well as her schoolwork. But I felt she was too young not to take risks.'' By May of last year, she placed first in Midwood's annual sophomore science fair and was on her Intel way.\nThe most promising science students at Midwood, approximately 105 freshmen, are steered into the research program. During their first two years, the students take classes in research methods, develop critical thinking and are encouraged to submit entries as sophomores in various science fairs. ''If you can't get 95's easily, then you better drop out, because you won't be able to keep up with your schoolwork,'' Shapiro said. ''And it's usually self-selection out.'' By sophomore year, the total in the program is down to 95, and by junior year the number is about 60.\nThe advanced level of the research adds a layer of incomprehensibility to the already fitful conversation between parents and teenagers. ''My dad, like, didn't even know I was in Intel until he saw my picture in The Daily News,'' Diana told me. Lauren Mikulski, a senior, said describing her research project to her family was difficult because ''we had a vocabulary in the lab that isn't even in the dictionary, it's so new.'' When she showed her father a draft of her research paper, he said it was good. ''But did you understand it?'' she continued. ''No,'' he confessed. Not an unusual reaction, except that Lauren's father teaches organic chemistry at Brooklyn Technical High School.\nThe sheer workload and commuting time -- getting to school by 7 a.m., taking the subway to labs -- makes the day especially long. During the summer following her sophomore year, Alice stayed with family friends who lived closer to Midwood while taking a course in molecular biology. She began to hang out with two other Intel students who lived nearby, Daniel Shaw and Etan Marciano. ''Those guys are so funny,'' she said at one point. Indeed, as sophomores the two boys parlayed their humor into the winning entry in the Rube Goldberg contest held last year at the New York City Science Fair. Their device was a monument to high-precision superfluous engineering, designed to deposit cereal and milk in a bowl mechanically, and to do so in exactly 60 seconds. ''Breakfast for One,'' they called it.\nWhen I went to visit him one Saturday afternoon, Daniel was playing Chopin's Waltz in C Sharp Minor on the piano in the living room of his family's home in Ditmas Park. A junior at Midwood, Daniel, 16, had just come home from playing tennis and later that night would be hanging out with his girlfriend. I had first met Daniel on a Tuesday afternoon at Midwood when he came into Room 256 to meet with Shapiro and discuss the first draft of one of his Intel essays. He had jet black hair, slicked back, and wore baggy pants and tennis shoes, which in one sweeping motion he planted firmly on Shapiro's desk. Juniors like Daniel and Alice are encouraged to engage in a version of what Jay Touger calls ''six degrees of separation,'' in which the brother of the father of a friend of a friend might know someone who runs a laboratory in Brooklyn or Manhattan and might be approached to work as a mentor. A student was once placed at N.Y.U. Medical Center through someone who knew a custodian there.\nWhile Midwood might be accused of tailoring its program too specifically to successful Intel applications, there was nothing narrow about the discussion between Shapiro and Daniel. It was a stream-of-consciousness conversation that had almost nothing to do with science but everything to do with two associative, nimble intellects jumping from one topic of interest to another, highbrow erudition tussling with lowbrow humor the entire way.\nWhile eating his lunch, Shapiro perused the first few paragraphs of Daniel's essay on ''Scientific Attitude.'' ''Yeah, clever stuff,'' he grunted approvingly. ''I didn't know you played the piano.''\n''I play three instruments,'' Daniel replied. ''The piano, the cello and the bass guitar.''\n''Too bad you didn't go to the High School for the Performing Arts.''\n''Yeah,'' Daniel laughed, ''I could be a starving artist instead of a starving scientist.''\n''What kind of pieces?'' Shapiro asked, referring to the music. ''Are you talking about 'Mary Had a Little Lamb'?''\n''No, no,'' Daniel protested. ''I was decent. I can play Beethoven sonatas. The 'Moonlight Sonata.' 'Pathetique.' Chopin waltzes.''\n''Can you play the 'Appassionata'?'' Shapiro asked.\n''No,'' Daniel said with a knowing laugh. ''But that was always my goal.''\n''So who was Haydn's favorite composer?'' Daniel scrunched up his face and half-heartedly suggested Beethoven. Shapiro shook his head. ''And it wasn't Mozart, either,'' he said. ''His name was von Weber, who almost no one has heard about. It's beautiful stuff, but no one knows about him.'' The conversation moved on to 12-tone scales and then, somehow, to gefilte fish. ''Did you know,'' Shapiro said, ''that Mrs. Goldberg, the chemistry teacher, makes her own gefilte fish? And it's fabulous.''\n''Those are two words,'' Daniel said firmly, packing up his books, ''that should never appear in the same sentence -- gefilte' and 'fabulous.'''\nOn the Saturday afternoon I visited Daniel, we crossed Argyle Road to Etan's house, and the two boys fetched the Rube Goldberg device from the basement. While setting up the apparatus, they talked about the research they were conducting for their Intel projects. Rube would not have approved.\nThrough an uncle who is an orthopedic surgeon, Daniel had found a position working in a lab at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, testing the effect of naturally occurring estrogens (known as phyto-estrogens) on bone-forming cells known as osteoblasts; this has suddenly become a hot avenue of research lately because of concerns about hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women. Etan, meanwhile, was working with psychiatric researchers at Columbia University who were investigating the biology of several drugs that seemed to mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia.\n''Ready?'' Etan said, with a sly self-aware smile, after they had set up the device. ''Ready to be amazed?'' It doesn't translate readily into words but involved a golf ball rolling down a tube that hit a lever (which caused cereal to fall into a bowl) and then knocked another ball, which caused a container of milk to tip over, slowly filling the cereal bowl until the weight completed a circuit underneath the bowl that turned on a motor, which removed a nail from the lower end of the tubing, allowing the golf ball to descend and then plop into a little basket and activate a pulley, which lifted it, as the rules required, exactly 30 centimeters above the surface, returning the ball to its starting height.\nIt was a little hard to reconcile the geeky exuberance of their creation with the heavy exertion usually required to maintain teenage indifference, and I was curious if Daniel and Etan felt the same defensiveness that characterized the students in the picture from my yearbook. ''We're friends with people on the lacrosse team that we hang out with,'' Daniel explained. ''We hang out with a lot of kids who are, quote, popular, although they do make fun of us all the time and call us nerds. But,'' he added with a triumphant smile, ''we have better grades than they do.''\nPerhaps the shrewdest observation came from Lauren Mikulski. ''I think a lot of people perceive that the Intel students are supersmart and dorks,'' she admitted. ''But there is so much cultural diversity at Midwood, I guess, that you don't see it as much.'' Brilliance, in other words, is just another form of diversity at a school with an Islamic Society and Gay-Straight Alliance. As Marc Ostrega, a teacher, put it one day, science is just another alternative lifestyle.\nFor Every Action, an Equal and Opposite Reaction\nWhether you are an athlete or an intellect, there is nothing more humbling than the day you discover that you are no longer among the best, after having been there for so long. For a lot of students in the research program, that day came on Jan. 10, when all 44 Midwood seniors who entered the Intel competition filed into a classroom on the third floor to learn who had been selected as Intel semifinalists. The media had been alerted, and juniors like Alice also attended. ''I felt nervous for the people who were there,'' she recalled, ''and I was sitting there thinking: Oh, God, this is going to be me next year. Who wants to find out in front of all these people?''\nIt was a great day for Midwood, with 13 semifinalists in all -- 11 from the science research program and 2 from the school's social science program. That total tied a school in Bethesda, Md., for tops in the nation. But three out of four research students did not make the cut, and some of the teachers took it harder than the kids.\nThat thought came to mind when I spoke to Lauren, who squeezed in an appointment with me between her daily stint at the yearbook office, where she is head photographer, and a meeting of the prom planning committee. She wore a copper-colored V-neck sweater and tight black pants and fairly bristled with energy. For her Intel project, Lauren, 18, worked in the Rockefeller University laboratory of A. James Hudspeth, searching for a gene that creates tiny hairs in certain cells of the inner ear, allowing an animal (the bullfrog, in her case) to detect sound. She worked in the lab seven days a week for one summer and four or five days a week during the school year. But the Intel deadline arrived before Lauren had found the gene she was looking for. (A crushing paradox about the Intel competition is that some of the most ambitious and interesting projects are in effect penalized because they can't be completed in time.)\n''I was down to five or seven genes,'' she said. ''So it was very frustrating.'' Not that she didn't have a few other things to divert her. In addition to her many extracurricular activities -- being director of Midwood's Black Heritage Alliance Show and an officer in the student government -- every afternoon, after getting up at 5 a.m., attending classes and then putting in her time at the Rockefeller lab, she would head over to N.B.A. headquarters in Midtown, where she worked (sometimes as late as 10 p.m.) in human resources for the Women's N.B.A. And then she would transfer four times on the subway ride back to her home in the Windsor Terrace section of Brooklyn. When I casually asked if she had a boyfriend, she practically shouted, ''Does it sound like I have time for a boyfriend?''\nShe, too, was sitting in the room when the Intel semifinalists were announced, and she ended up having to console her teachers. ''All of my advisers were very surprised,'' she recalled. ''Miss Nicastri was apologizing to me. She was saying, 'I'm so sorry, you should have won, I'm so sorry.' And I'm saying: 'Miss Nicastri, it's not your fault. It's O.K., it's O.K.'''\nFailure happens to the best of them. One day in mid-May, Eugene Simuni returned to Midwood after having spent the previous week at the International Science and Engineering Fair in Detroit. He was Midwood's star science student this year; he had already won $10,000 in cash as the grand prize winner in New York City's annual science fair and $25,000 in scholarship money as the fifth place finisher overall in the Intel Science Talent Search, which is considered the most rigorous science competition. He had been accepted at Harvard, M.I.T. and just about every other place he had applied.\n''So what'd you win?'' somebody asked when he walked into Room 256.\n''I got a T-shirt,'' he laughed. He did merit an honorable mention in the biochemistry competition. (Emmanuelle finished third in microbiology.) The consensus at Midwood was that the judges at the Detroit fair simply did not understand Eugene's project.\n'Welcome to New York, Eugene'\nAlice has her pugnacious moments, and they often surface during a long-running friendly disagreement she has with Eugene, a senior in her Spanish class. Eugene spent much of April wrestling with the enviable problem of deciding whether to attend Harvard or M.I.T. (Harvard won out.) But for the time being, he doesn't plan on pursuing a career in science. ''Eugene wants to make money,'' Alice told me one day, confiding this in a way that made it clear she considered it a prodigious waste of intellectual talent.\n''I don't see my career as a scientist,'' Eugene confirmed. ''Now I'm thinking about working in the technology field, but not as a scientist. More as an administrator. My personal feeling about money is, it's not the most important thing in life -- you should love what you're doing. But it's still important!'' A year ago he would have been inclined to pursue a career related to computers. ''Now, because I've been doing so much biochemistry, I'm more interested in biotechnology. So this choice is not easy.''\nBorn in St. Petersburg, Eugene attended a special mathematics and science academy in Russia. In December 1997, when he first arrived at Midwood, Eugene would sit alone in the cafeteria, barely able to speak English yet resolutely determined not to be fazed by the experience. ''I couldn't say I was too much shocked,'' he said. He has a cheerfully phlegmatic personality, quick to laugh when he is teased but serenely unruffled by the experience of learning his chops as an American teenager in the crucible of an inner-city public high school. ''I wasn't shocked by anything. I realized that that would be the case, so I didn't feel especially bad when I sat alone in the cafeteria.''\nAs far as I could determine, the only things that left Eugene even moderately puzzled about life in America were episodes of ''Seinfeld'' and how to operate the mimeograph machine in Room 256. One morning when he was standing by the machine, Emmanuelle, Midwood's other Intel finalist this year, came in. ''Did you get your check yet?'' she asked, referring to the $1,000 each semifinalist received. ''I got it yesterday,'' Eugene said.\n''How come you always get your money before me?'' she demanded. Eugene shrugged and smiled. ''I already know what I'm going to buy with mine,'' she continued. I immediately thought of a stereo, a bushel of CD's, clothes. ''Stock,'' she announced confidently. And she knew exactly which biotech company she was going to invest in.\n'If You Make Gazillions of Dollars. . . .'\nIt wasn't just that they invested in stocks and won six-figure scholarships. It was the level of the research they conducted that frankly stunned me. As a high school student in the 1960's, I knew I didn't have the right stuff for the science-fair circuit from my very first (and only) project, which was based on the profoundly misguided idea that water pollution might actually benefit the health of animals. Almost everything associated with this benighted project was wrong, including the assurances I gave my family that frogs could not possibly escape from an uncovered laundry tub in the basement.\nThe Intel students don't do science projects -- they do science, period, often working at the frontiers of knowledge and sometimes under intense competitive pressures. Eugene, working at Rockefeller University with Ethan Marin, used computerized data on the three-dimensional atomic structure of two proteins (known as G proteins) to compare the way they relayed a biological signal inside cells. He showed that the structure of one of these proteins differed in a way that could explain why it acts in a more delayed fashion in the rod cells of the eyes (and thus affects vision) but not in other cells of the body. Emmanuelle, working with a biologist at New York University Medical Center named Jayne Raper, identified a portal-like molecule on the surface of trypanosomes, the family of microbes responsible for sleeping sickness in Africa and a disease in cattle. This ''scavenger'' molecule allows the parasites to feed on cholesterol in the bloodstream of humans and animals, and thus the research suggests possible strategies for developing medicines that would block the parasites' ability to feed. Emmanuelle doesn't even have a driver's license yet, but, Raper said in an interview, ''she will get her name on a scientific paper.''\nThe Top 40 Intel finalists, including Eugene and Emmanuelle, converged on Washington last March for the mother of all high school science fairs, the Science Talent Search, which was originally conceived by an advertising and public relations executive at Westinghouse in 1942. The students stayed for six nights at the elegant Mayflower Hotel, set up their little booths to explain their projects to public visitors at the National Academy of Sciences and endured several grueling days of questioning by a panel of judges. ''We called the Massachusetts Room, where three of the judges were, the 'Massacre Room,''' Emmanuelle explained later. The Top 10 finishers were announced at an annual black-tie awards banquet.\nThe contest has always been exceptionally prestigious, but it has the added aura now of New Economy money. The winner of the top prize this year, Viviana Risca, of Paul D. Schreiber High School in Port Washington, on Long Island, went home with a $100,000 scholarship, part of the $1.25 million in prize money provided by Intel. A representative of a major pharmaceutical company circulated through the crowd of finalists, practically promising summer internships on the spot. There were lots of stock market jokes.\nI don't think the sea change in the way the world views these kids became truly apparent to me, however, until two weeks later when I accompanied the Midwood contingent to a reception at the New York City Board of Education honoring all the city's Intel finalists and semifinalists. ''This has a special meaning for me,'' said Harold O. Levy, then interim chancellor, in a ruefully witty, been-there-done-that riff, ''especially as a Bronx High School of Science student who did not get what was called, in those days, a Westinghouse. But I tried.'' As an endless stream of board members, educational officials and other functionaries took the podium, I couldn't help thinking of something Touger mentioned several days earlier: ''I tell the kids that if they're lucky enough to win, I will take full credit, and Mr. Shapiro will take full credit, and the principal and the district superintendent will take credit, and the Board of Ed and the borough president will take credit, and their parents will take credit. And whatever is left over is theirs.''\nBut it was the eleemosynary pitch by Judith A. Rizzo, the deputy chancellor for instruction, that truly signaled the fact that nerds now rule: she already had her hand out. She implored the students to remember that they had been the product of a public school education. ''If you start a company and make gazillions of dollars,'' she said hopefully, ''maybe you can buy a few computers for the schools.'' Where once it was assumed that they would ''do well'' in the traditional academic sense, the new economy has made clear that they will most likely do well -- fabulously well, in some cases -- in the financial sense, too, and it's never too soon to get your hand out.\n'We Expect to See You Win a Nobel Prize'\nFor a good part of April and May, one Midwood student after another walked into Room 256 with news of intellectual approbation -- and financial reward. Amber Iqbal, a petite girl from Pakistan, stopped by to report that she was being honored by the Society of Microbiology for her project. The American Academy of Neurology faxed a letter saying they were flying Lawrence Fung, the son of a Chinese immigrant truck driver, out to San Diego as one of three high school students in the country to collect a $1,000 award. And Ilya Sherman, one of the Russian kids, walked in with the news one day that he had received a college scholarship from Chase Manhattan Bank worth more than $100,000.\nMidwood's 13 Intel semifinalists also took a victory lap through the city. While the seniors posed for pictures on the steps of City Hall, savoring Peter F. Vallone's parting words at a City Council reception (''We expect to see you win a Nobel Prize one of these days,'' he said), the juniors at that very moment were schlepping to labs all over Brooklyn and Manhattan, facing a hot summer of 18-hour days, hopeful that they, too, would enjoy a similar victory tour in the spring of 2001. At about 4 on an afternoon not long after the City Hall celebration, Alice sat in front of a computer in a large high-ceilinged lab at Rockefeller University, the indirect light of a glorious afternoon spilling in through the windows. The scene had an air of monastic serenity -- not least because the most recent personal crisis seemed to have passed. Alice's mother assured her that she wouldn't move until Alice finished up at Midwood.\nAs it turns out, the lab was in a scientific race on a very competitive project, and she was hardly a teenage bottle-washer. They needed her! Constantine Pavlides, the lab chief, began to explain to me that they were looking at the activity of a certain ''immediate-early gene'' called zif-268, which alters synaptic architecture and in so doing ''cements'' what has been learned into permanent memory. Suddenly he stopped himself short and laughed nervously. ''I'm not sure how much I should tell you,'' he said.\nIn the next room, Alice sat at a computer plotting some preliminary data under the tutelage of Sidarta Ribeiro, a Brazilian graduate student. The software automatically converted the activity of the gene they were studying, in dreaming and wakeful animals, into side-by-side columns. The results were preliminary, but nonetheless promising. ''We have a long way to go,'' Ribeiro said carefully. ''But it's very . . . auspicious. Very interesting. We're going to pursue this.'' He got out a calendar and laid out a crash program to confirm the results, which would require an intense, coordinated plan of experimentation every day over the ensuing four weeks.\nSeveral other scientists stopped by to stare at the data on the computer screen. ''It's a nice result,'' one said. ''A cool result,'' another said. A look of sudden, unexpected rapture briefly flickered across Alice's face, as if she had just discovered an extraordinarily interesting way to be cool. ''I'm so lucky to be here,'' she whispered, and then went back to the numbers on the screen.",

    "text": "Bandits in the Global Shipping Lanes\n2000-08-20T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Midnight Raid\nEverything seemed fine that spring afternoon as Captain Ken Blyth watched over the loading of his ship in Singapore. He was skippering the Petro Ranger, a medium-size tanker with a $1.5 million cargo of jet fuel and diesel oil bound for Ho Chi Minh City. It was a three-day turnaround. No big deal. After it was over, he'd fly back to his home in Queensland, Australia, to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary the following week with his wife, Denise.\nWhen the Petro Ranger finally slipped its berth, it was just another cargo vessel amid the daily parade that makes Singapore the busiest port in the world. Not far outside the harbor is the Horsburgh Lighthouse, the last outpost of domestic law. From Horsburgh on, you pass into the only true frontier of the 21st century: international waters -- the no-man's land of the new world economy. Not technically owned or patrolled by anyone, these waters are the last place on earth where you are truly alone.\nAnd given the high technology aboard ship these days, you almost are alone. Blyth sailed with a crew of just 20 men, downsized from the 35 or so he might have needed a few decades ago. The deck of the Petro Ranger is a steel meadow longer than a football field. Toward the stern is the ''accommodation housing'' -- a tall, whitewashed structure with windows that resembles an old apartment building. As a piece of real estate, the Petro Ranger is like a small-town mall with ample parking, pretty much deserted, at sea.\nThat night, a Malaysian sailor of Indian extraction was the officer of the watch, but instead of performing his duties, he tuned the shortwave to his favorite Indian music station and didn't pay attention to the radar screen -- although, since the ship's funnel creates a blind spot directly in the rear of the vessel, it's not clear what he could have seen. But there was, in the ship's wake, a small blue speedboat. It was made of fiberglass and had no canopy, making radar detection difficult. Throughout the evening, it trawled at the tanker's pace, sitting about a mile back.\nAt 9:30 p.m., the ship cruised past Horsburgh Lighthouse and headed north. Blyth was relieved and tired. He put the ship on automatic pilot, then showered, crawled into bed and fell asleep. The sea was calm. Just above the captain's quarters was the bridge, where one man was stationed as the lookout. In the nearby chart room, the officer of the watch listened to the comforting drone of a faraway sitar.\nJust after 1 a.m., the blue speedboat opened its engines. Cruising straight up the wake, without any threat of detection, it pulled up to the ship's stern. There were 12 pirates on board -- as multicultural as their 18th-century avatars: 7 Indonesians, 3 Malaysians and 2 Thais. They had learned the layout of the ship beforehand and moved with feline grace. Securing bamboo ladders to the stern, the men scrambled to the main deck and leapt upon the outside ladder of the accommodation housing, climbing five stories to the open bridge. Dressed in jeans and T-shirts and with balaclavas pulled over their faces, they appeared in the bridge's doorway. They were armed with machetes. The officer of the watch panicked and fled the chart room by a back exit. The lookout was overtaken in a struggle that thumped the floor loudly enough to awaken the captain below.\nBlyth sat up in the dark, thinking perhaps that someone on the bridge had been drinking. He decided to check on his crew. He stood up in his underwear and put on a terry-cloth bathrobe. He stepped through the door of his bunk room into the shadowy twilight of his day room. Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of a loud banging at his door. Instinctively, he unlocked it.\nThe door blew open. Four hooded pirates waving machetes rushed in. A fifth pirate stepped forward with a gun. He put the barrel to Blyth's head and ordered the captain to place his hands in front of him.\nThe pirates bound Blyth with boat lacing so quickly that he remembers only one detail. In the moments before the rope touched his wrist, the pirate slipped off his watch and wedding ring as effortlessly as plucking autumn leaves from a tree.\nHe would remain bound for the next 13 days.\n''I still have burn marks on my wrists,'' Blyth recently told me, sitting in the perfectly shipshape living room of his modest home, just a few miles outside Brisbane. His wife, Denise, sat with ankles crossed as he spoke. Their house was clean and fit. Appliances rested beneath knit cozies. Across the room, a plate of sandwiches, each with the crusts cut off, sat beneath a drum-tight stretch of plastic wrap, awaiting our adjournment to luncheon.\nBlyth leaned forward from the majesty of his comfy chair to show me the discolorations that lingered two years after that April 17, 1998, night. Blyth, 55, is a tall, blue-eyed Scot, whose Sean Connery accent has endured even if his reddish hair hasn't. He's a tall sailor, all sinew and no bulk. He doesn't laugh easily and radiates a hard-headed intensity.\n''The pirates wanted me to go around with the master key -- the one the captain has to unlock any door -- and round up the crew,'' Blyth recalled. ''The idea was that I would knock on the door, tell them not to worry and not to do anything silly. Then the pirates would tell them to get their hands out and tie them up.''\nMohiuddin Ahmed Farooq, the Bangladeshi chief engineer, remembers Blyth's approach as one of the most terrifying moments of his life. He had been reading his favorite professional journal, Marine Engineering Review, when he heard the officer of the watch swoop by his cabin, howling oddly, but dismissed it as some crew prank. Then the second engineer called him on his cabin phone to tell him pirates were on board.\n''I told him not to call back because my phone rings so loud,'' Farooq said. He immediately started scheming: ''I brought my shoes back in from outside the door so the pirates might think no one was inside. Then I got all my money together to give them so they wouldn't hurt me. Then I locked my door from the inside and turned off the light.''\nThen he heard Blyth just outside. ''With a shivering broken voice, the captain said, 'Chief, chief,' and nothing else,'' Farooq recalled. ''There is a gap of one centimeter below my door, and when I got down and looked, I saw 2 white legs and 8 to 10 colored legs. And then I knew. I switched on the light and opened the door. The captain had four or five knives at his neck. I quietly went to my knees, because I was so much taller than the pirate, and let him tie my hands.''\nOne by one, every crew member, except for the officer of the watch and an engineer who accompanied two pirates to the engine room, was taken and dumped in the captain's day room.\n''When we were passing the laundry door,'' Blyth said, ''suddenly there was the officer of the watch. I have never seen anything like it. His eyes like golf balls! And screaming like someone demented.'' As the machetes quivered at the commotion, Blyth could see that most of the pirates were young and quite agitated. ''My concern was that the officer of the watch was going to upset the pirates. So I stood on his head with one foot and told him to shut up. I kept him down with my foot until the pirates tied him up and took him away.\n''Then they took me to the bridge,'' Blyth continued. ''I was still tied up, and then they taped my arms and legs to the chair. They didn't understand how to turn off the automatic pilot, and the pirates were baffled by touch-screen computerized piloting. So I said, 'If you're going to kill me anyway, why should I help?''' Then one of the head pirates told Blyth something that convinced him: the names of his wife and two daughters -- and their street address. ''Here's where it gets surreal. I said I would cooperate, but that I wanted my wedding ring back. So one of the pirates disappeared down the stairs and a few minutes later I felt someone putting the gold band back on my finger.'' Blyth can't quite figure out why he made such a demand. ''When I look back on it,'' Blyth said, ''it was mad.''\nThe pirates unbound Blyth long enough for him to alter course, taking the Petro Ranger far from the regularly trafficked corridors of international shipping and into the maritime equivalent of a dark alley. By the time the pirates retaped him to the chair, the ship was still steaming northward but no longer on a course for Vietnam. He was served a glass of juice by one of the pirates. Since he was bound to the chair, the pirate poured it for him, sloshing it down his chest. Around this time, Blyth was reassured that they wanted only the cargo. ''That's when all my confusion about why they had kept me was solved,'' Blyth recollected. ''But once they figured out the basics of the navigational equipment, I wondered, Would I go over the side?'' He sat up in his easy chair, the only sound the slight crinkle of a single cigarette paper. He sprinkled some tobacco in it and rolled it in a single motion. ''This is how dopey your mind works in these circumstances. I'm thinking: Would the chair float with me or be too heavy? Would I have enough time to get the tape off my leg? Of course the bottom line was I'd have been sucked straight into the propeller.'' He licked his rolling paper.\n''Then they stuck a cigarette in my mouth -- and I'd quit smoking for 16 months -- and they lit it for me.'' Blyth took a big drag on the one he'd just rolled; the slightest curl of a smile appeared, possibly remembering that one Great Cigarette, possibly in the triumph of being able to tell me this story. ''That cigarette,'' he said, ''was better than an orgasm.''\nAfter learning how to navigate the ship, the pirates took Blyth back to his bunk, where nearly all his crewmen, taped and tied, were crammed into his day room, sitting up ''like zombies.'' Being the captain, he was permitted the luxury of being tossed on his own bed where, by some magic he cannot remember, he fell asleep.\n''When I awoke, I could see that a movie was on in the day room,'' Blyth continued. ''I heard sounds like cattle dogs getting on with the sheep.'' Three young pirates stood among his bound crew, drinking and eating out of his private fridge while watching television. ''All I could hear was grunts and groans -- and then I realized they were watching a blue movie.'' Sitting up in his underwear and robe with his chest a sticky mat of juice, ash and sweat, Blyth said, ''I just looked and looked and thought, Am I dreaming?''\nOne of the pirates realized that Blyth was awake and stepped away from the movie, irritably demanding that Blyth give him the combination to the ship's safe. When Blyth told him that the safe was broken and that he kept the ship's store of cash in a briefcase, the pirate grew enraged. He smashed Blyth in the head with the handle of the machete and knocked him out cold.\nHours later, when Blyth woke up again, he was taken to his men in the mess hall, which had been filled with mattresses. Guards were positioned at the door, and new procedures were explained. One hand would be freed when a crewman had to use the bathroom. The only time their hands were completely untied was for a brief shower. Lights blazed 24 hours a day, making sleeping difficult. A bootleg copy of ''Titanic,'' the only nonpornographic entertainment on board, played over and over again like water torture.\nThe pirates had taped over the portholes, but the captain once saw through a crack in the tape over the bathroom porthole that the bottom half of his ship's identifying blue funnel had been painted red. And could he have seen the stern, he would have found that the Petro Ranger no longer existed. He was now aboard the ''Wilby,'' just another vessel bobbing along without notice in international sea lanes. Over the next several days, changes in the weather and the flies buzzing in through the vents were enough to convince Blyth that they were nearing the China coast. Blyth theorized that the pirates intended to meet some black-market tankers to offload the fuel cargo. They would need Blyth and his crew to help make that transfer. But then what?\nPiracy on the high seas resurfaced in the mid-1980's and in recent years has ratcheted up to a true crisis both for shippers and recreational yachtsmen. In 1989, there were 48 acts of piracy reported around the world; in 1999, there were 285. So far this year, it's up by 40 percent. Consider what havoc Blyth's hijacking caused the parent company, Petroships of Singapore. It operates only nine ships, according to C.M. Tan, the executive director, and suddenly one just seemed to disappear. ''We thought the ship was on its way to Vietnam,'' Tan said. ''When the ship didn't show up at the scheduled time, we frantically tried to contact the Petro Ranger but heard nothing.''\nThe cause of piracy's revival is no different from its appearance centuries ago. Ships serving the top trading nations (England, Holland and Spain in the old days; America, Germany and Japan now) are transiting through a global geography of poverty, envy and desperation. Often these vessels are carrying on board a king's ransom of commodities -- no longer cinnamon, indigo and flax, but jet fuel, alkali and aluminum ingots -- all easily black-marketed into quick money. And they are forced to travel through infamous areas, from the Strait of Malacca to the South China Sea, that inspire the same feelings of dread as did the legendary danger zones: Sherwood Forest in the 12th century, the Caribbean Sea in the 17th century, downtown Detroit in the 1980's.\nModern piracy ranges from desperate fishermen pulling off petty larcenies at sea to highly organized syndicates slaughtering crews to steal multimillion-dollar vessels. Today's pirates are a troubling symptom of a new world order, one shaped by a fierce Darwinian struggle in the feral markets of modern international trade.\nMost piracy is of the mugging-at-sea variety. The pirates just zip up in a speedboat, point a rocket launcher at the hull and demand money. Lately it has been getting a little rougher. Last January, an Australian couple were sailing around the world. In the Gulf of Aden off Yemen, a small powerboat pulled up beside the couple's catamaran; a burst of machine-gun fire tore through the hull, wounding the wife. Four pirates boarded the boat, ripped out some high-tech communications equipment, then left.\nGetting aboard a huge ship is easy if you have an expensive speedboat. But even the poorest fishermen know a simple tactic that is reported more frequently these days. Two sets of pirates get in two sampans and stretch a rope across a sea lane in the dark. When a big cargo vessel finally comes through, it catches the rope at the bow and neatly pulls the two boats right alongside. The pirates then heave up grappling irons, climb aboard and in the quiet of night clean the boat of everything portable. When they are finished, they just drop down to the boats and untie one of the lines. The sampans are immediately left in the big ship's wake, and then they row back home, where a can of paint might fetch the equivalent of a week's pay.\nBeats fishing.\nOf course, more ambitious pirates realize that stealing some watches and shipboard cash is small stakes when you're dealing with a huge vessel carrying cargo worth millions. Often the pirates will contract with black marketeers to hawk the cargo. And they also want the ship. This may mean repainting it at sea, obtaining fake registration papers and then selling it or just using it themselves to become seemingly legitimate shippers. This process, known as phantom shipping, is costly and dangerous, requiring serious planning and organization.\nThe more sophisticated forms of piracy are carried out by Southeast Asian syndicates and Chinese triads. According to a 1998 report on piracy published by the International Chamber of Commerce, the corporate-style organization of the syndicates is impressive: ships can ''be hijacked to order in the Philippines for about $300,000 and delivered within three days.''\nThe global reaction to the piracy revival has been, by all accounts, slow. A United Nations committee in Vienna has been working for years to develop policy on transnational organized crime. But according to a State Department official who declined to be identified, ''It is not addressing this issue.'' Since few ships serving American companies are registered in the United States, he explained, ''piracy has not reached out and touched enough people here to drive it up the political flagpole.''\nSo the pirates aren't too scared. Ships disappear pretty regularly and with impunity. Once a ship has been captured, the crew faces one of two fates. In the case of the tanker Global Mars, which was seized by pirates last Feb. 23, the 17 crewmen were bound and blindfolded before being set off in lifeboats. But the 21 crew members of the Hualien No.1, which disappeared with a cargo of river sand last Feb.28, have never turned up and are now presumed dead. Most seamen know such stories. They hear them and can't believe it will ever happen to them. Ken Blyth was certainly thinking about them when one of the junior pirates told him that their leader wished to see him at once.\nThe Pirate King\nBlyth was escorted to his own day room, where the pirates had set up their headquarters. The pirate king was 49 years old, a well-educated and heavyset Indonesian of medium height. He spoke four or five languages, including grammatically perfect English. The pirate king's name, Blyth would learn, was Herman.\nThe two men sat down and had a cup of coffee. Blyth began negotiating right off. The ropes were cutting into their wrists. Herman agreed to a less chafing form of homemade handcuffs, a restraint using a rubber O-ring and strong tape. After such business was out of the way, Blyth was surprised that Herman wanted to linger and chat a little.\n''The impression I got,'' Blyth told me, ''was that having achieved what he had done -- the Petro Ranger was the most modern tanker he'd swiped -- he would have loved to phone up CNN and say, 'Look what I pulled off.' He was so exhilarated he wanted to share it with someone. I was the only one around who could possibly appreciate what he'd done.''\nRight away Blyth realized that with the mildest prodding, Herman would provide details that he thought were irrelevant. Blyth learned that the junior pirates were basically thugs. The kid who'd knocked Blyth out had been released from a Malaysian prison just three days before. Herman would later order the boy to apologize to Blyth for striking him. Blyth then understood that four of the pirates were in leadership positions. These were the ones carrying guns. Herman and a second officer were the brains of the operation; the other two, Blyth surmised, were executioners. The junior thugs spoke no English and were only trusted to wield machetes. The two pirate engineers who were operating the ship turned out to be legitimate sailors who had signed on to what they thought was a real charter contract. In other words, they'd been press-ganged, just like in the good old days.\nSometimes Herman would try to joke with Blyth. Noticing some dates written on the captain's blackboard, Herman asked about them to learn that they were the dates of Blyth's return flight to meet his wife. ''I wish I could send a message for you, but you know the predicament I'm in,'' Herman said.\nThe syndicate he worked for, he went on to explain, had five men in leadership positions: one each from China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. He claimed that they had ''inside access'' to Petroships, the shipping company. They knew that the Petro Ranger would be sailing with a simple commodity -- fuel -- easily fungible on the black market. They knew the date of embarkation. They knew all about Blyth and most of the crew. Herman had all the documents he would need: registration for the ''Wilby,'' papers that identified Herman as the legitimate captain along with his crew and bills of lading identifying the cargo on board as part of a legitimate charter.\nBlyth was returned to his mattress, quite impressed by the extent of Herman's operation. One thing worried him, though. Why would Herman tell him all this if he didn't also intend to kill him?\nIf piracy has its formal organization in syndicates, then the Piracy Reporting Center in downtown Kuala Lumpur is its attempted complement, part of the emerging antipiracy infrastructure. Founded in 1992 by a collective of shipowners and other maritime interests, the Piracy Reporting Center documents hundreds of reported pirate attacks every year. They man a 24-hour hotline for captains to call for help at sea and maintain a Web site filled with fresh accounts of piracy. To visit its office is to get a broad sense of where modern piracy originated.\nNot far from the Piracy Reporting Center's headquarters stand the Petronas Towers, the tallest buildings in the world. Kuala Lumpur's skyline may be more prominently marked, however, by a bank tower whose pinnacle glows with the bespectacled visage of Colonel Sanders. The fried-chicken baron looms three stories high, bearing the same half-smile found on Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, whose image is posted behind every cash register in Kuala Lumpur. It's no longer clear which icon holds the most sway.\n''The governments in Southeast Asia have simply been incapable of handling this huge, Chicago-in-the-20's-like explosion of economic growth,'' said one veteran shipper. And no greater proof can be found than the world map in the lobby of the Piracy Reporting Center, where every pirate attack is marked by a red pushpin. Looking at the map this spring, I noticed that the oceans familiar to me were pin-free, whereas the areas around Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia were perforated beyond recognition.\nA clean-cut Malaysian named Noel Choong, himself a former sailor, emerged to introduce himself. He was dressed in a white shirt and a pricey-looking gold-and-black tie. His neat shiny black hair had a bluish tint.\n''Every day we send out a 'sitrep' -- situation report -- via satellite and transmit it to all the ships on all the oceans,'' he said. ''We advise them of current events, what ships have reported pirate attacks, that sort of thing.''\nOccasionally, Choong's office lights up with action. Last October, the Japanese captain of the Alondra Rainbow was able to alert the Piracy Reporting Center to a hijacking at sea right after his ship was seized by bandits. After the sitrep went out, some captains in the region radioed back sightings of a ship vaguely matching the description. ''We pieced a lot of other bits together and were convinced that the ship was one spotted steaming toward India,'' Choong said. ''We contacted the Indian Coast Guard to intercept it, and they sent out a patrol boat. When the ship saw the patrol boat, they altered course for international waters and maintained radio silence. So the patrol boat gave chase. After a while they radioed that they were from the Philippines, but Manila said there was no such ship originating there. Then they said they had a Belize registry, but there was no ship by that name registered there. So we decided to fire warning shots across the bow. Still they proceeded full speed ahead. We sent an aircraft up and followed the ship. We shot at the hull and still it wouldn't stop. The patrol boat maintained the chase for two days.''\nUltimately, the chase lasted three and a half weeks. Choong said that the Piracy Reporting Center facilitated several multinational meetings, including one requesting intervention by the United States naval forces stationed in Bahrain. But before America could accept, an Indian Navy vessel fired cannon rounds at the ship off the coast of Goa. Hit, the pirates scuttled the ship and set afire all the documents on board. The disabled vessel was towed to India; the pirates are currently in Bombay awaiting trial.\nDuring my visit, Choong loaded me up with sitreps, weekly reports, quarterly reports and annual reports -- making it clear that most of what he does is report the attacks, after the fact. And Choong's charts underscored the clear connection between economics and piracy. In the early 90's, the number of attacks hovered around 100 each year; then in 1995, when the Pacific recession hit hard, the number shot up to 188 and has been bounding upward ever since.\n''Ninety-five percent of pirates are armed,'' Choong said, ''and will not hesitate to use weapons to escape.'' The captured seamen may end up like the crew of the Global Mars, set adrift. Or maybe like the sailors aboard the Cheung Son, a furnace-slag cargo ship. ''The pirates murdered the entire crew,'' Choong explained. ''The head pirate wanted everyone on his team implicated, so he systematically forced each pirate to kill one crewman. Some were shot, some stabbed to death. What most of the pirates did was cover the crews' heads with bags and then club them to death like monkeys.''\nHow did international trade get to this point? For one thing, the frontier marketplace of modern shipping has provided pirates with plenty of targets. Roughly 40,000 ships move almost all the world's trade across the largest stage possible, the seven seas. Piracy erupting in such an environment was as likely as the 19th-century explosion in train robberies after the Wild West became scored by miles of unprotected railroad lines.\nAnd although the precise catalyst that set off modern piracy is hard to identify, some point to the Vietnamese diaspora of the late 70's and early 80's. Around that time, Southeast Asian fishermen grew desperate, as their once stable livelihoods became shackled to the boom-bust cycle of the new global economy. Horrific stories began surfacing in the international press: a single girl would be found at sea, for example, and tell of being on a boat boarded by ''fishermen'' who robbed everyone and then went crazy, raping the women and pulling the gold from men's teeth before finally tossing everyone into the shark-infested sea. When the wave of boat people finally subsided, the criminals at sea had completed a kind apprenticeship in maritime robbery and murder. It makes grim sense that these bandits would graduate to the larger vessels crowding the sea lanes -- cargo ships and tankers.\nThe Great Escape\nAfter a week of sleeping in the continuous white light of ceiling lamps and the flicker of the perpetual ''Titanic'' showing, Blyth realized time was running out. Somewhere at sea, two tankers had pulled up alongside for cargo transfers. Blyth and his chief officer had been forced to help offload thousands of tons of fuel, a task made more difficult by the thought that the faster it was accomplished, the sooner they were likely to die.\nA third tanker was delayed, Blyth learned. The deposed captain's radio man would occasionally report back what he was gleaning from working alongside the pirates (like the unsettling fact that Herman had two machine guns hidden in the radio room). The Petro Ranger idled at sea for several days. Then, on the 13th day of the crew's captivity, one of the pirates made a huge mistake. With the third tanker sailing around unable to find the ''Wilby,'' the No.2 pirate called the tanker on the public VHF frequency. The Chinese heard him.\nNot long afterward, a Chinese patrol vessel stopped, boarded and inspected the Petro Ranger. But Herman handled it smoothly. He locked Blyth and a few of his men down below in crew cabins. He presented papers indicating that he was the captain and passed off both Blyth's legitimate sailors and his own henchmen as his crew. (The pirates kept Blyth's crew in check by routinely reminding them that they knew the whereabouts of their wives and families. Herman could be vicious in this regard. He once told Farooq that he'd just visited the chief engineer's cabin, menacingly adding that he'd seen the pictures of his beautiful wife and two children. Farooq managed to retrieve the pictures but Blyth urged him to put them away. ''The captain told me, 'Looking at them will only make you weak,' and he was right,'' Farooq said.)\nSuspecting a smuggling operation, the Chinese withdrew and waited to see what might happen. When the third tanker did arrive, the Chinese sped in, stopped both ships at sea, and escorted them to Haikou harbor on the island of Hainan in southern China.\nSince the Chinese were now convinced that the ''Wilby'' was a smuggling ship, Herman quietly contacted his syndicate and got a lawyer to facilitate the usual round robin of bribes. Blyth learned all this from, of course, Herman, who enjoyed summoning the captain back to the day room to boast about his caginess.\nThe problem for Blyth now was simple. If Herman pulled this off, then the ''Wilby'' would push out to sea and they would all surely be killed. For help, Blyth turned to two of his crew members: a big Ghanian known as Benny and a trim young Malaysian named Saini.\n''I decided I had to get to the Chinese,'' Blyth recalled, ''and then I could only hope that I was in fact getting to the good guys, the ones who weren't corrupt.'' Saini, who spoke a little Mandarin, managed to get close enough to a Chinese lieutenant on board to tell him to meet at midnight on the top of Monkey Island, the colloquial name for the roof of the bridge.\nThe pirate guards checked on Blyth every half hour or so. Often that meant just jiggling the handle on the door to make sure it was still locked. Knowing this, Blyth, Benny and Saini concocted a ''Mission: Impossible''-like plan.\nBlyth explained it to me this way: ''What was to happen was that Saini would check where the pirates were, and when the stairwell to the bridge was clear, I would hear three bangs on the door. Then I'd unlock it from the inside and we'd all take off.'' The scheme began as planned; Saini and Blyth ran barefoot to minimize noise.\n''Saini and I moved quickly to the bridge, while Benny went back into my cabin and locked the door from the inside so that if they tried the handle, it would be locked and everything would seem dinki-di.'' (Also, if the plan failed, Blyth would be able to return to his cabin without deadly repercussions from Herman.)\nSaini and the captain bolted up to Monkey Island, where the Chinese lieutenant was keeping watch and was more than a little surprised to have a tall Scot appear in the doorway.\n''Saini explained who I was,'' Blyth recalled, ''and I gave him my passport and some Malaysian documents stating I had command of the Petro Ranger, which the pirates had neglected to destroy. Once I had made contact and we knew I wouldn't have to go back to the cabin, Saini rushed down to get Benny. They rolled up a blanket and put it in my bed. They locked the door from the inside, walked out, then gently pulled it shut. Then Saini went to his cabin and Benny to his. The only person missing was me.\n''The Chinese then developed their own plan,'' Blyth said, in order to minimize any chance of gunfire. ''They dressed me in a Chinese army uniform and asked me to sit down atop Monkey Island. From below, the pirates could only see the silhouette of me in battle fatigues and the army hat, which was distinctively Chinese.''\nThe next morning, Chinese soldiers came to the ship. Blyth was still safe atop Monkey Island. Peering over the railing, he watched as the Chinese herded first Herman and his ''officers'' and then nearly the entire mix of pirates and legitimate crew onto their boat. Told they were simply going ashore to sign documents granting port clearance, they easily complied as 30 armed soldiers held their weapons at the ready.\nThe Chinese lieutenant then called out to Blyth, who stood up. We are left to imagine what Herman must have been thinking when he looked up to see the faraway Chinese guard descend to the deck as Ken Blyth. The captain calmly strode to his gunnel and pointed at each man in turn, identifying him as either pirate or crew.\nPreventing an attack from a pirate like Herman is not easy (and catching him after he has struck often requires the kind of cunning and good luck Blyth had). Standard preattack precautions range from keeping a constant watch to pressurizing the ship's water supply so crew can hose pirates off the side of the vessel when they start climbing up the ropes.\nThe latest technological fix is the onboard tracking system, a kind of Lojack at sea. One such device, called the Shiploc, was recently installed on all nine vessels owned by Petroships. Several companies offer variations of it -- Seajack Alarm, Fleet Remote Monitoring System, ShipTrac. But in general, few shippers use them. Shipowners are no different from most of us who simply believe that bad things happen to other people. What's more, no ship with the feature has ever been attacked by pirates, so it remains untested in the real world.\nBeyond that, the latest ship designs coming out of London appear ready to turn your average vessel into the maritime equivalent of a Humvee cruising through the guarded sanctuaries of a gated community. Blueprints from the offices of John McNeece, a noted ship designer, incorporate the following improvements: heat detectors, vapor sniffers, a 60-meter high-intensity light zone, escape pods -- and even attack weapons.\nCarl Hunter, a veteran shipper based in London, is starting a company named Anglo Marine Overseas Services, which will lease out Gurkhas to guard cargo ships. Even in these postcolonial days, the British maintain three battalions of these Nepalese soldiers notorious for their headlong audacity. The idea is the opposite of Shiploc. Rather than conceal from the pirates the fact that the ship has some added protection, Hunter's company seeks very much to tell them. Each ship that employs his men will be permitted to fly the Gurkha insignia. On a plain field, it shows two kukri -- those wavy Nepalese knives -- crossed at the blades. The flag would serve as a kind of reverse Jolly Roger.\nWould the Gurkhas have guns? ''I am not hiring out mercenaries,'' Hunter said. ''Obviously I don't want to say outright that these men are not armed, because that would hinder their deterrent effect. But I am not in the mercenary business. There are others doing that.''\nTwo others, to be precise. Satellite Services is a Dutch firm that will rent out 225 former peacekeeping troops whose combat experience includes the battlefields of Bosnia. But perhaps the most notorious is Marine Risk Management, located in Oxton, England, next door to Liverpool. The company is run by a bearish man named John Dalby (whose eerie resemblance to Bill Clinton is, in an interview setting, disturbing). Most of the day, Dalby is a repo man, container-ship style: he reclaims vessels when an owner has missed several mortgage payments. Three years ago, however, his company added a ''rapid response service'' to handle pirate attacks.\n''So far we've had four calls,'' Dalby said of his new enterprise. He agreed to describe ''the gung-ho, Errol Flynn concept of what we do'' and took me out to his favorite restaurant in Oxton, where we dined on legs of mutton as cartoonishly huge as a Henry VIII dinner imagined by a Hollywood director.\n''I don't want to sound bigheaded, but we are just known,'' he said. ''We don't advertise. The client comes to us after a ship has been pirated. We talk on the telephone and then outline what we can do. Generally we can have a team to the problem area within 24 hours.''\nDalby uses a Falcon 900B executive jet to move his team -- which is composed of 8 to 12 men, all of whom have served in England's Special Boat Squadron, the equivalent of the United States Navy Seals. He wouldn't say how much he charged for an ''action.'' But he did say at one point, ''We earn more money from one antipirate rapid response than-- ''He burst out laughing, ogled the waitress and washed down some mutton with shiraz.\n''We assume that the cargo's been sold in advance,'' he continued. ''That determines where the ship's going to go. So we get our local spies on alert. They are listening for rice in the marketplace, you know what I'm saying?'' I didn't know what he was saying, but ''listening for rice'' sounded so cool, I just nodded furiously, ogled the waitress and tore into my mutton.\n''And then suddenly a rice dealer somewhere says that rice will be available at a discount. Now we are pretty sure where the ship will go. Once our guys locate the ship, they conduct reconnaissance,'' he said, explaining that if it's in port, then the team just watches it. ''You never try to snap a ship back in port. If they have tugboats, then someone in the local government regime is probably involved. So it's dangerous. We'd send two guys to look at the ship to see if it's the original crew, pirates or a mix. They might just set a ship-tracking device on board. Then they report back, and we discuss future strategy.''\nIn one particular reseizure, Dalby's men boarded a pirated ship at sea posing as drug-enforcement inspectors. The pirates handled it calmly, while Dalby's men managed to plant a tracking device. They then fell back and watched the ship on computer for days. When it was within Indonesian waters, the owners contacted the national navy and had it seized.\nIf the decision is made to retake the ship, Dalby's men are prepared to do it: ''Our guys can pirate ships better than the pirates can.'' Dalby's men can secure a bridge and an engine room quickly and then throw the ship into darkness. ''The pirates can panic,'' he said, ''but they're just running around a pitch-black ship. It's worse than a cave. There are so many traps. They're afraid. And we have night sights.''\nThe Coonawarra shiraz, having breathed, was getting quite tasty.\nHave your men ever fired at a pirate? I asked.\n''Never directly, no,'' he said. ''We've fired warning shots in the air.''\nWhat would happen if they killed somebody?\n''We'd hide the evidence.''\nWhat does that mean?\n''We'd send the body over the side.''\nJesus.\n''We operate under the same lack of rules as the pirates. So they're just getting hoisted by their own petard.''\nTrouble in Port\nNot long after the chinese officials arrested the pirates, Blyth was taken ashore and interrogated by two different law-enforcement agencies: the People's Liberation Army, all dressed in green outfits, and the Public Security Bureau, distinguished by khaki. Days of repetitive interviews and odd accusations -- at one point, a P.S.B. official suggested that Blyth had made the whole pirate thing up -- gave the captain the impression his ship had become ensnared in a major power play. The P.L.A. was deeply concerned with how this might look internationally (and were, therefore, sort of on Blyth's side). The P.S.B., however, seemed more beholden to provincial powers in southern China, which are widely suspected not only of tolerating piracy but also of organizing it.\nA State Department official I spoke with confirmed Blyth's on-site analysis. ''China has a huge economic interest in trade, especially by sea,'' the official said. ''On the other hand, locally it has -- how shall we say? -- an old way of doing business. The central government is trying to do something about it, but it's difficult, and it's not always clear how devoted they are to it when push comes to shove, with money.''\nIn the Petro Ranger's case, what finally happened still baffles those involved, and yet the outcome exposes the difficulty of suppressing piracy in a globally gilded economy. ''If I may say so,'' said Petroships' Tan, who flew to China to personally handle Blyth's case, ''the Chinese authorities were totally irresponsible and deplorable.''\nAfter learning of his ship's location more than two weeks after its disappearance, Tan flew at once to Haikou. His experience in China ranged from having Petroships accused of collaborating with pirates to being physically thrown out of a government building. In the end he retrieved his stolen ship -- but the Chinese kept all of the remaining 5,100 tons of fuel, nearly half the original cargo, as ''evidence'' before waiting some time and selling it off. In reaction to such cases, the International Chamber of Commerce has written that either this is a ''result of inefficiency and infighting amongst the seemingly inept Chinese authorities concerned, or part of a deeper plot to cover up China's participation in criminal activity.''\nTan was luckier in some respects that the owners of the Anna Sierra, which was ''saved'' from pirates by the Chinese in 1996. In that case, the cargo was sold and the authorities even refused to permit the owners to reclaim the ship. Without care, it took on water and to this day the ship remains beached in Beihai harbor in southern China, a rusting monument to the inadequacy of policing modern piracy.\nTan believes that the ease of piracy stems from the notion that few countries are willing to risk a serious diplomatic incident by treating foreign nationals -- even pirates -- as criminals. Others agree. ''What do you do,'' Dalby asked, almost sympathetically, ''if you're the Malaysian government asking the Indonesian government to send in gunboats to deal with a Korean shipment aboard a ship registered in Belize with a Japanese captain, and then the Philippine government gets nervous because some of the crew is Filipino? Here's what you do: nothing.''\nThis year, things appeared to change. During another routine smuggling arrest, the Chinese discovered that they had captured the pirates responsible for the brutal murders of the crew of the Cheung Sun in 1998 (the pirates had actually taken pictures of the killings and kept them around). The pirates were tried and sentenced to die. In January, China signaled its regional trading partners to the new zero-tolerance pirate policy by inviting photographers to witness what would become a surreal execution. The young pirates were allowed to get drunk on rice wine and broke into a rowdy version of the Ricky Martin song ''La Copa de la Vida.'' A few minutes later, each was tied to a chair and shot in the head and heart. All but one of the pirates was Chinese, however, making it less than a full international crisis to execute them. And, in light of subsequent events, the trial seems more public relations than tough justice.\nEarlier this month, the Chinese announced that they had found the Global Mars, a tanker missing since Feb. 23. Then they admitted that they had actually seized the ship in May and had been holding the 20 pirates -- 11 Filipinos, 9 Burmese -- for just as long. When asked whether these pirates would be tried, extradited or released, an officer with the Zhuhai Frontier Police who would only identify himself as Zhang said, ''I'm not sure about that.'' He quickly added, ''That's not our decision.''\nNo less an authority than Captain Blyth said he knew what would probably happen. He laughed into the telephone when he heard that the pirates were being ''held'' for further interrogation.\n''I remember the last time I saw Herman,'' he said. ''The authorities had beaten him severely. I don't know if they used electricity or not, but he looked like he'd aged 10 years. They prodded him with the butt of a rifle to move along. They didn't have handcuffs on him. They didn't need them. He could hardly walk. I didn't make eye contact because he never looked up.'' And yet, four months after Blyth went home, the Chinese authorities quietly released Herman and all of his men. The Chinese have refused to explain why they would let the pirates go, as they have done repeatedly in the past. A Chinese official contacted recently for a comment pronounced the question ''ridiculous.''\n''One of my old crew members phoned me up in early August,'' Blyth said. ''He's still at sea, and he told me that five of our pirates, three of the Malaysians and the two Thais, have been spotted doing piracy again, working the waters between Port Dickson and Port Klang near Kuala Lumpur. You just can't believe it, but they're back out there.''",
