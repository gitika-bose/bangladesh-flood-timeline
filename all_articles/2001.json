[{"text": "Lives Held Cheap in Bangladesh Sweatshops\n2001-04-15T05:00:00.000Z\nThe fire in the garment factory began on the fourth floor, where polo shirts, neatly folded in boxes, made a fine feast for the hungry flames. The 1,250 workers scampered for their lives, most of them hurrying to the stairway that led to the main exit. There, at the bottom, was a folding gate. It was locked.\nIn panic, the trapped people spun around, rushing back up the steps, colliding with those coming down. It was night. The lights had gone out. Some workers squeezed through windows, shimmying down an outside pipe or chancing a desperate leap.\nThe rest were caught in a human knot on the dark stairs, arms pushing, mouths screaming, hearts pounding. Some people fell and were trampled. That is how nearly all of the fire's 52 victims died, their final breaths stomped out of them on the hard concrete of the teeming steps. Most were young women. Ten were children.\nWhat Bangladesh has to offer the global economy is some of the world's cheapest labor -- and what this impoverished nation has received in return is the economic boost of a $4.3 billion apparel industry, the fuller pockets that come with 1.5 million jobs and the horrors that arise from 3,300 inadequately regulated garment factories, some of which are among the worst sweatshops ever to taunt the human conscience.\n''We still suffer from the legacy of the colonial days,'' said one factory owner, Muhammad Saidur Rehman. ''We consider the workers to be our slaves, and this belief is made all the easier by a supply of labor that is endlessly abundant.''\nFor the most part, it is the wretched of the earth who do the world's tailoring. Made in Bangladesh competes with Made in Honduras, Made in the Philippines, Made in Macao, Made in Any Steamy Reservoir of Third World Unemployment: those places where plentiful labor lacks the leverage to command high pay, and the most pitiful thing about the jobs is how hard it is to get them.\nLast November's fire at Chowdhury Knitwears interrupted a frantic production schedule. Finished sportswear was due at stores in Britain. The workers, used to a 12-hour day, were ordered to toil as long as 18. They were given a lunch break at 1 p.m., then a shorter breather at 10 p.m., when each received a piece of bread and a banana.\nHolidays, mandated by law, were a myth at the Chowdhury factory, said dozens of employees. People were expected to work virtually every day of the year. Overtime pay, another legal requirement, was also a myth. Most wages ranged from $25 to $50 a month -- or as little as 6 cents an hour. Children earned less.\n''When we'd complain, they'd lock the gates so we couldn't get out,'' said Aleya Begum, a sewing machine operator here on the outskirts of Narsingdi, 35 miles northeast of Dhaka, the capital. ''If someone complained too much, they were fired.''\nThose long hours had never included a fire drill. And, in the days after the blaze, outraged politicians demanded accountability for the senseless deaths. They decried the garment industry's callous disregard for safety and lamented the government's listlessness in making inspections. Cabinet ministers comforted the hospitalized. The prime minister offered condolences, praying that each of the departed souls would enjoy a peaceful hereafter.\nSuch hand wringing in a fire's aftermath is by now a studied ritual. Bangladesh's garment industry is barely 15 years old, but the business has grown so rapidly that it accounts for 76 percent of the nation's exports. The number of manufacturers continues to multiply, as do the recurring nightmares: the flames, the locked doors, the frenzied stampedes, the mourning. Since 1995, there have been 30 of these fires, with 17 involving fatalities, according to one labor group that has maintained a list.\nFactories are often makeshift enterprises, many of them in the rented upper floors of Dhaka's decrepit downtown buildings. Workers trudge up the narrow stairs, ready to stitch bright fabric beneath the whirling bobbins. Electrical wiring is frequently a jangle of overloaded circuits.\nThe posttragedy ritual is not a prolonged one, however. Reports of investigators are expediently moved along the bureaucracy's chain of command and then into oblivion. Accountability, so keenly demanded at first, is never quite determined at last.\nOne more tangible result is a short period of haggling. Bereaved families expect compensation for lost loved ones. After the Chowdhury fire, the factory's workers staged protest marches and were joined by thousands of sympathizers.\nThe basic demand was 200,000 taka per victim, about $3,700. That was far beyond the usual recompense. But then this had been an especially shocking tragedy.\nUpset by the catastrophe and alarmed by bad publicity, leaders of the powerful manufacturing associations met and decided to chip in, adding a sum to the Chowdhury factory's own contribution. Together, they pledged a death benefit they deemed generous: about $1,945.\nNannu Mia, a survivor of the Nov. 25 fire, had helped organize the workers' protests. ''Maybe this was a mistake,'' he said recently, permitting himself an anguished moment of reflection. ''Maybe I should have licked their boots instead.''\nFor him, the protests have proved regrettable. Among the workers' demands was a swift reopening of the factory. While this did occur only 44 days after the fire, Mr. Mia was not welcomed back. He said that being an agitator cost him his job.\nAt Chowdhury Knitwears, the hours may be a strain and the wages a heartache. But almost anyone will say that even a dreadful job is better than none.\nA Place Rich in Cheap Labor\nThe apparel business is a very tough dollar, with profit margins figured to the fraction of a penny. The actual sewing of a shirt is but a tiny part of the final pricing, which must account for cloth, cutting, dyes, packaging, freight, duties, warehousing, advertising, floor space and salespeople.\nConsumers want bargains. So retailers try to wrench lower prices from suppliers, who in turn want the clothes stitched at the lowest possible cost. For a poor nation, rich only in cheap labor, the garment industry is a well-trod pathway into the global marketplace.\nBangladesh has a population of 131 million -- about half that of the United States -- all packed into a country slightly smaller than Iowa.\nIts garment workers take home an average monthly wage of $35 for women and $40 for men, according to Rita Afsar, of the Bangladesh Institute for Development Studies. Those earnings are about 25 percent higher than the nation's per capita income.\nIn the Narsingdi area, with a population of about 3 million, Chowdhury Knitwears is one of the few major factories. Virtually all employees returned to the whitewashed four-story building after the fire. Orders for polo shirts were still unfilled. Fabric in colors with fancy names -- rust, midnight, shadow green, putty, orange peel, brilliant blue -- was piled on tables.\nThe building looked much as always, but important changes had been made. Smoke alarms were installed. Thin pipes ran along the ceiling. Excessive heat, detected by a temperature gauge, would automatically trigger a defending spray of water.\nThis new safety equipment cost nearly $20,000, complained Tanveer Chowdhury, known as Sagar, the managing director of his family's business. A heavy-set man, he was seated in a first-floor office, nervously fingering the gold chain around his neck. He expressed no regret about the loss of life. But he did have more complaints to make.\n''This fire has cost me $586,373,'' he said. ''And that doesn't include $70,000 for machinery and around $20,000 for furniture. I had made commitments to meet deadlines, and I still have those deadlines. I am now paying for air freight at $10 a dozen when I should be shipping by sea at 87 cents a dozen. That means I am paying . . .'' He pecked at a calculator with his right index finger. ''. . . 12 times the shipping price.''\nMr. Chowdhury was not there the day of the inferno, but his brother Shamim had not only been present, he also tried to fight the flames. The fire had begun with a spark from an electrical spot gun, used to spray stain remover on soiled merchandise. The blaze then spread to a can of flammable liquid, and a fireball took off.\nA try was made at smothering the flames with shirts. Then a fire extinguisher was unlatched, but it malfunctioned, painfully discharging its contents into Shamim's face.\nSagar Chowdhury, 34, described the scene, then woefully shook his head. ''When everything is O.K., this business is very good,'' he said. ''Now it is not good.''\nThe family also owns a towel factory, which exports exclusively to America, he said. Three years ago, they expanded into knitwear because ''the money is better.''\nMr. Chowdhury boastfully returned to his world of numbers, saying that in a good year the business netted $1 million. Less happily, he disputed what his employees had reported about their wages. He said while some did earn as little as the equivalent of $22 a month, others made as much as $74. He said he paid double for overtime. Then, with closer questioning, he grew huffy and distracted.\nBut he did confide the gist of his ample experience. ''Knitwear is a headache business,'' he said, flicking one hand as if to slap something away. ''Headaches with quality, size, color, everything.''\nA beleaguered businessman, Mr. Chowdhury rubbed his forehead as if this might make the aching go away.\n'Good Order' to 'No Order'\nBangladesh's garment factories run the gamut. Some seem models of progressive management, with health clinics, day care centers and brightly lighted lunch rooms. Workers wear surgical masks to screen out fibers in the air, and shiny red fire extinguishers hug the walls at regular intervals. Other factories are bleak, stuffy places with cramped aisles that dead-end into haphazard knolls of fabric. Guards are stationed at locked gates, and fire prevention largely consists of empty red water pails.\nTo export, a factory owner must be a member of one of the nation's three textile associations. These groups then have great power. And from time to time, their leaders discuss whether they have some duty to use this clout to improve working conditions.\n''Inhuman things do go on, and it's horrible, horrible,'' said Kutubuddin Ahmed, the newly elected president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the biggest of the three. ''That Chowdhury fire business, this was horrible.''\nMr. Ahmed said that perhaps the time had come for rigorous inspections, to find out what factories were in ''good order, semi-order and no order,'' and that the worst of the lot might face a suspension of their export privileges. ''But we don't want to threaten our members or create a panic,'' he added in afterthought, cautiously moderating his zeal.\nDo-gooders here are suspected of shallow thinking. Panic -- as well as American na\u00efvet\u00e9 -- is widely blamed for a misguided rescue of working children. In 1993, after news media expos\u00e9s about Bangladesh's garment factories, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, introduced a bill to ban products made with child labor.\nFrightened employers impulsively fired tens of thousands of children under the age of 14. By and large, this was not any great setback to the bosses. Very often, they had hired the children as a favor to woebegone parents. Within the next few years, as the Harkin bill became law, about 10,000 of the children ended up in special schools created by Unicef. But most others simply found more dangerous and less lucrative work -- breaking rocks, rolling cigarettes, pulling rickshaws.\n''There's no such thing as an unmixed blessing,'' said Roushan Jahan, an author of a book about garment workers. ''Progress leaves loopholes. A lot is left to the factory owner's good will, and there is a great deal of curdling in the milk of human kindness.''\nSo what can be done? If manufacturing groups are hesitant to act, if government inspectors are easily bribed, if labor unions are yet to find a foothold, if human consciences are easily held in abeyance, what can make an owner improve conditions?\nRecently, the biggest force for reform has come from big retailers worried about the bottom line. Some, like Gap and Wal-Mart, were embarrassingly linked to third world sweatshops and are now rehabilitating their image. Others fear similar scandals that might make softhearted customers feel guiltily attired.\nSome major companies now issue codes of conduct and send inspectors into their suppliers' factories to enforce the rules, counting fire exits and auditing overtime records.\nThese controls are imperfect and a few critics even deride them as farce. And they do not greatly inflate the pay. At Shanta Apparel Ltd. in Dhaka, which has manufactured goods for Tommy Hilfiger, J. C. Penney and Gap, an average employee earns $42 a month, the manager said. But the factory supplies its workers with purified water, clean bathrooms and a doctor on the premises. Doors stay unlocked. There are fire exits.\n''That's the wave of the future, buyers who order you to put in two more toilets and place more space between the machines,'' said Monjural Hoq, president of one of the other manufacturing associations. ''That's all fine, as long as they pay us more to get it.''\nAn Uncertain Future\nMost factories do not work with the major stores, however. And in Bangladesh there is motivation for owners to gobble up maximum profits before it is too late.\nFor all the garment industry's success, its future hangs by a thread. Nearly half the exports go to America, where a quota system on imported clothes has favored Bangladesh, limiting some of its biggest competitors to a smaller share of the United States market.\nBut those quotas expire on Jan. 1, 2005.\nAfter that, the lure of cheap labor may not be enough. Other circumstances make Bangladesh a less practical supplier. Power outages are epidemic. Floods wash away roads. The port is overwhelmed. More important, raw materials for manufacturing need to be brought in at added expense.\nWithout quota restrictions, China and India, which grow their own cotton, are likely to capture far more of the business from the United States.\nAnd many poor Bangladeshis -- suddenly jobless -- will find themselves poorer still.\nTwo-thirds of the garment workers are women. With Bangladesh being a conservative Muslim country, a factory job is one of the few socially acceptable ways for a woman to earn a living. In Dhaka, most of them live in mammoth slums that while deplorable for their squalor are notable for being less squalid than others.\nAround Narsingdi, workers are more likely to live in villages with the open air, ripening jackfruit and the moist green of rice paddies. Four months after the fire, the area still seems contaminated by despair. Families have yet to adjust fully to rearrangements, with newly orphaned children handed back and forth.\nMost any villager can lead a sorrowful tour. One stop was a bamboo hut, where a 14-year-old named Parina was sitting outside on a stool. Her brother Alauddin, who was 12, had died in the fire, she said. The family badly misses the $11 he earned each month, but they have nevertheless kept another son, 13-year-old Jalaluddin, from returning to Chowdhury Knitwears. ''He switched to a brick kiln,'' Parina said.\nKhodeza Begum has three surviving children, but none yet old enough to replace her son Zakir, 15, who had been the family's only breadwinner. ''After the fire, all the bodies were laid out in a row,'' she said, cupping a small photograph of the boy. ''When I saw his face I fainted.''\nRashida Begum, 18, a fragile-looking woman who has returned to the factory though an injured right hip prevents her from walking easily, was living nearby. She was trampled as she attempted to escape the fire and remembers a rampage of feet on her before she lost consciousness. ''My mistake was that I fell,'' she said glumly.\nAbdul Qader Mullah, a skilled mechanic, is a muscular young man. People think he is important to meet because of the awful twist to his story. He bravely stayed behind to fight the fire, finally lowering himself from the roof with a cable. But by the time he escaped, his younger brother had been killed, re-entering the building to look for him.\n''His body was so terribly burned up I only recognized him from his belt buckle,'' Mr. Mullah said. ''One of our friends, Liton, he also died after going back into the fire. He had been paid that day and left his money in his other pants.''\nThe surviving families are separated by a peculiar financial distinction. Only 39 of the 52 victims are officially confirmed dead, with their bodies having undergone an autopsy. Other families either refused to allow the post-mortem, thinking it an indignity, or buried their loved ones too hastily. They have been denied the $1,945 compensation.\n''Thirty-nine confirmed dead, that's the official figure,'' said Dr. Atiqul Sarwar, head of a nearby hospital and a member of the government-appointed committee that investigated the fire.\n''The blame,'' he continued, ''was actually due to management. There was a minimum of fire extinguishers. Workers were locked in. The emergency exit was itself a danger. It was too steep, sloping almost straight down.''\nOddly, and inappropriately, the doctor cracked a smile. He knew this made him appear unfeeling and he apologized. But he was recalling a friendly disagreement with the committee's chairman -- and enough time had now passed to prove him right.\nIn Bangladesh, life, like labor, is cheap, Dr. Sarwar explained. He had insisted their investigation would be a waste of time; the other man said no. ''I told the chairman we'd accomplish nothing. I told him, 'Relax, relax, just relax. The hue and cry lasts only awhile. And then it means nothing.'

The meeting is a litmus test of whether globalization can be managed to close the increasingly obscene wealth gap separating rich and poor countries.\nUnfortunately, the conference has all the makings of yet another high-cost, low-output talk shop, with Northern governments offering empty promises in place of the real policy reforms that are needed.\nMembership of the LDCs is dominated by countries in sub-Saharan Africa but extends across the world from Haiti to Bangladesh and Cambodia. Poverty is endemic. Almost half of the people live on less than $1 a day. Life expectancy is 25 years less than in the industrialized countries.\nTwenty years ago the ratio of average income in the LDCs to income in the rich world was 1-to-87. Now it is 1-to-98.\nTen years ago, at the last UN conference on LDCs, industrialized countries promised decisive action to break the vicious circle of slow growth and rising poverty. Improved market access, more aid and debt relief were to be the building blocks of a new deal. Since then they have delivered nothing except more empty promises.\nTake the case of trade. Governments in the United States and Europe make much of the market preferences provided to LDCs in the form of lower tariff barriers. Yet these preferences are conspicuous by their absence in sectors, such as textiles and agriculture, where these countries are best placed to expand exports.\nAccording to the World Bank, tariffs and quotas applied in rich countries cost LDCs about $2.5 billion annually in lost foreign exchange earnings. The United States, one of the worst offenders, accounts for almost half of this total, mainly because of restrictions on textile imports. For every $1 provided to Bangladesh in aid, the United States takes away $7 through import barriers.\nEurope offers more generous market access than the United States, but it has little else to be proud of. Pascal Lamy, the European Union's commissioner for trade, broke the mold by proposing that LDCs be given unrestricted market access for all nonmilitary exports.\n\"Everything but Arms,\" as the proposal was dubbed, was swiftly attacked by the familiar coalition of farm lobbies and agribusiness interests, who succeeded in removing commodities such as sugar, rice and beef from the liberalization commitments. The supine response of some European governments has sent the clear signal that powerful vested interests come before the interests of the world's poorest people.\nOne area of trade policy in which rich countries have been more generous is in the provision of bad advice, provided under the auspices of the IMF and the World Bank. While industrial countries have kept the doors to their markets shut, many LDCs have been required under the terms of structural adjustment programs to liberalize their markets at breakneck speed, often with disastrous consequences.\nNowhere are the double standards more painfully apparent than in agriculture. Rich countries continue to subsidize their agricultural sectors to the tune of $1 billion a day, flooding world markets with cheap grains. And while the North subsidizes with impunity, poor countries have been opening up their markets under IMF-World Bank instructions. In Haiti, the liberalization of rice markets and an ensuing surge in imports from the United States has destroyed thousands of rural livelihoods, undermining national food self-reliance in the process.\nThe record on aid is even more depressing than on trade. Having been promised more aid, LDCs have seen development assistance cut by more than $3 billion since 1990 \u2014 a cut of one-third in real terms.\nIt goes without saying that higher growth and poverty reduction will depend on actions undertaken by LDC governments. But without supportive action at an international level there is a real danger that these countries will become increasingly isolated islands of poverty, despair and instability.\nThe writer, senior policy adviser to Oxfam, contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, {"text": "Blast Endangers Bangladesh's Rise\n2001-06-19T05:00:00.000Z\nThe bomb explosion in which 22 people were killed Saturday in Dhaka, Bangladesh, sent a message that there is powerful resistance to the orderly democratic transfer of power in one of South Asia's poorest but most promising nations.\nAny disruption of electoral plans would not only discourage investors and set the economy back but also give an impetus to Muslim fundamentalists who are trying to whip up campaigns against India and against Bangladesh's 15 million Hindus.\nThe blast at the offices of the governing Awami League came less than four weeks before Prime Minister Hasina Wazed, whose party won a landslide victory in 1996, is due to step aside, handing the reins of government on July 12 to a nonparty caretaker administration until the general election is held in October.\nThis novel step to end what has been dubbed the Battle of the Begums, after the subcontinental term for a Muslim woman of rank, will be her concession to the opposition leader and former prime minister, Khaleda Zia, whose Bangladesh National Party had threatened to boycott the polls if Sheikh Hasina presided over them.\nNo doubt the prime minister hopes that this unprecedented investment in stability will ensure her return to office. Hanging over her head, however, is the threat of widespread protests against a bill to allow her to stay on in her official residence after she lays down office, with special protective measures for her and her sister, Sheikh Rehana.\nThe sisters are the only surviving members of the family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the architect of Bangladeshi independence from Pakistan. They escaped death only because they were in England 26 years ago when army officers shot dead Sheikh Rahman, his wife, two sons and several other relatives and attendants.\nAware that they cannot evade justice while Sheikh Hasina is around, the murderers have vowed to \"finish the unfinished revolutionary task\" of the massacre. There have been 10 bomb attacks in the last two years and four direct attempts on the prime minister's life.\nSheikh Hasina has two major achievements to her credit. First, her 1996 victory restored parliamentary democracy after 21 years of rule by military dictators or their nominees and a succession of violent coups. Begum Zia is the widow of General Ziaur Rahman, who seized power after Sheikh Mujib's killing but was murdered by another general some years later.\nSecond, the economy has taken an upturn. Bangladesh is no longer the basket case that the United States feared it would be at the time of its bloody birth in a 1971 war.\nSheikh Hasina says she is committed to building up a \"Golden Bengal\" \u2014 an allusion to the title of the national anthem \u2014 that is \"free from poverty, hunger and illiteracy.\" Numbers below the poverty line have declined from 47 percent to 43 percent since she took over, literacy has gone up from 47 percent to 64 percent, and a crop of 2.5 million metric tons in 1995-1996 bestowed food self-sufficiency on 125 million Bangladeshis.\nBangladesh is the fifth largest exporter of ready-made garments to the United States, and U.S. investment has spiraled from $20 million to $800 million under Sheikh Hasina.\nPresident Bill Clinton spent longer in Dhaka than in Islamabad during his March 2000 trip to the subcontinent, probably in recognition of Bangladesh's potential, especially as an energy source: The country has considerable natural gas reserves.\nBut the other begum is not giving up so easily. Begum Zia has never been reconciled to her 1996 defeat at the hustings. In her bid for power she has shortsightedly allied her party to the Jatiya Party of the former dictator General Hussain Mohammed Ershad, who is in prison for corruption offenses, and \u2014 worse \u2014 with two fundamentalist organizations that see Pakistan, or even Afghanistan under the Taleban, as their role model.\nEven if such forces helped Begum Zia to garner votes in October, they would give short shrift afterward to such an affront to Islamic orthodoxy as a parliamentary government headed by a woman.\nThe writer, a former editor of The Statesman in India, contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, {"text": "Article 2001080491844070452 -- No Title\n2001-08-04T05:00:00.000Z\n The New York Times: APInternational Find a Job Post a Job Find a Home Personals All Classifieds International National Politics Business Technology Science Health Arts Sports New York Region Weather Obituaries NYT Front Page Corrections Editorials/Op-Ed Readers' Opinions \n Automobiles Books Movies Travel Dining & Wine Home & Garden Fashion & Style New York Today Crossword/Games Cartoons Magazine Week in Review Photos College Learning Network Job Market Real Estate Help Center NYT Mobile NYT Store E-Cards & More NYTDigital.com Online Media Kit Our Advertisers &nbsp; Home Delivery \n Customer Service \n Media Kit Review Profile \n E-Mail Options \n Log Out --> Text Version \n Today's News Past Week Past 30 Days Past 90 Days Past Year Since 1996 Sign Up &nbsp;&nbsp; \n Log In Welcome, $user &nbsp;&nbsp; \n Sign Up for Newsletters &nbsp; | &nbsp; Log Out -->&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Advanced Search \n (10 Minute Update) \n August 4, 2001 \n International Index From The Associated Press \n A.P.

"}, {"text": "New Premier in Bangladesh Vows to Stamp Out Corruption\n2001-10-11T05:00:00.000Z\nKhaleda Zia, a nationalist leader, was sworn in this evening as prime minister of Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest and most populous nations, after an election in which a surprising 75 percent of the registered voters went to the polls.\nShe swept to victory with a campaign against lawlessness and corruption, but it was her Bangladesh Nationalist Party's disciplined alliance with two Islamic parties and another small faction that ensured the coalition's lopsided majority in the new Parliament.\n''My government's first priority will be to eliminate terrorism and stamp out corruption,'' Mrs. Zia said after the ceremony. ''We will also try to ensure economic emancipation for the vast majority.''\nMrs. Zia, 57, widow of an assassinated military dictator, succeeds Sheik Hasina Wazed, 55, daughter of the nation's first elected leader, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, who was killed by army officers in 1975. The rivalry of the two women, both scarred by the country's experience of political violence, has long defined the politics of Bangladesh.\nMrs. Zia, who organized many general strikes in failed attempts to bring down Mrs. Hasina's government in the last five years, has encouraged Mrs. Hasina to take her place as leader of the opposition.\nBut Mrs. Hasina, who heads the Awami League and is the first Bangladeshi leader to serve a full five-year term as prime minister, boycotted tonight's swearing-in. She said those elected from her party would boycott Parliament.\nShe has rejected the verdict of 56 million voters, though international monitors concluded that the elections, held on Oct. 1, had been free and fair.\n''Yes, I did commit that I would accept the election results,'' Mrs. Hasina said at a news conference on Tuesday in Dhaka, ''but I did not commit to accept rigged results.''\nMrs. Hasina's stance threatens more political turbulence. She called for a protest today from 6 a.m. to noon. Traffic was lighter than usual in Dhaka, the congested capital, which is home to nine million people, but the day passed peacefully.\nThat was exceptional. In the 10 days since the election, more than 40 people have been killed in political violence. Most victims have been associated with the Awami League, the Dhaka newspaper Daily Star reported today.\nAlready there are signs that Mrs. Zia's promise to halt lawlessness is running up against the power of local gangs associated with her party.\nBangladesh is plagued by unemployed young men who do the dirty work of political parties at the local level, enforcing calls for strikes, rustling up people for rallies and intimidating opposition voters. In return, the parties look the other way when the thugs commit crimes.\nNow that Mrs. Zia has come to power, people associated with her party have begun taking over extortion operations at bus terminals, truck stops and markets that were worked by the Awami League when it was in power, Bangladeshi newspapers report.\nVoters said it was a rise in criminality and public corruption, especially in Dhaka and other urban areas, that had motivated them to vote Mrs. Hasina out of office.\n''It was a big relief,'' said Hamida Tarafdar, 62, a widow who lives in Dhaka with her son and daughter-in-law. ''Now I feel we can sleep at night in peace.''\nFalan Mia, who runs a grocery, echoed the sentiment. ''It only vindicates that Allah is there,'' he said. ''We simply got fed up with the Awami thugs who regularly came to extort money from us.''\nBut in the end the arithmetic of coalition politics may have been even more salient than law and order. The Awami League won 40.5 percent of the popular vote, a larger share than it garnered in 1996 and more than the 36 percent won by Mrs. Zia and her nationalist party.\nIn many ways, the Awami League's popularity is not surprising. During Mrs. Hasina's tenure, the economy has been growing at a healthy rate of 5 to 7 percent a year, poverty and the birthrate have fallen and Bangladesh has become self-sufficient in food production.\nBut Mrs. Zia overcame Awami's electoral advantage through an alliance with the three other parties, which brought her coalition's portion of the vote to 46 percent.\nIt is Mrs. Zia's alliance with the Jamaat-e-Islami, which wants to turn Bangladesh into a republic ruled by Islamic law, that secular Bangladeshis find most worrisome.\n''Jamaat has been a nuisance, but never an electoral power,'' said Gowher Rizvi, a Bangladeshi who leads the Ford Foundation's South Asia office in New Delhi. ''We will see more intolerance, more emphasis on Islamization. And groups like the Grameen Bank that are involved in women's empowerment will suffer.''\nWhile Mrs. Zia has been supportive of the American campaign to capture Osama bin Laden, the Jamaat leader, Matiur Rahman Nizami, said in an interview that the United States did not have enough evidence against Mr. bin Laden to justify military attacks and warned that the bombing ''would definitely cause widespread anger and revulsion in the entire Muslim world.''\nThe question is how much power the Jamaat will exercise in the new government, in which it holds two of the 59 ministerial posts.\nThe election itself was wondrous to behold, say monitors who went out into the field on Oct. 1.\nFor 16 years Bangladesh was ruled by military dictators. In the last decade, the country has struggled to re-establish a functioning democracy. On Oct. 1, millions of people voted for the first time. And women, often oppressed in the largely rural society, voted in the largest proportion ever."}, {"text": "WTO Can Help World's Poor Farmers\n2001-03-28T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen prices for a farmer's harvest fall, as they have in recent years, despair haunts rural families and communities. Farmers invest less in their own land and children leave home, searching for a better life in cities. Consumers in those ever-swelling cities become increasingly dependent for their supplies of food on farmers elsewhere.\nBut farmers, especially those in the poorest nations, are not just battling a global oversupply of grain. In a distressing number of cases, they are fighting against the financial power of the world's richest governments.\nDuring recent years, industrialized countries spent, on average, about $7 billion each year subsidizing their exports of agricultural commodities such as wheat, flour, cheese, butter, poultry and beef. These programs typically work in the following way: The government buys agricultural commodities at above-market prices, benefiting their own farmers. Then those commodities flood into international markets, pushing down prices worldwide.\nAs surely as drought or any other natural disaster, those subsidized exports sap life from rural villages in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Urban consumers around the world may benefit, in the short run, from the supply of cheap food. The harm, however, far outweighs the benefit. Agricultural production can be crippled in countries that need it most.\nThis is where the World Trade Organization can help. The same body that has been vilified as a tool of multinational corporations and rich countries may be the Third World farmer's best hope, perhaps the only one, in the battle against unfair competition from subsidized agricultural exports.\nWhen WTO members meet in Geneva on Thursday and Friday to discuss agriculture issues, they will begin to address this problem. Previous trade negotiations, concluded in 1994, succeeded in limiting some export subsidies. Now is the time to abolish these subsidies altogether, along with similar unfair practices.\nOf course, some would argue that free trade itself is driving down the price of agricultural goods worldwide, and that the WTO, by promoting free trade, is destroying rural communities in the developing world.\nNo one can deny that free trade is sometimes disruptive (although the absence of free trade has proven even more disruptive and costly). This is why the WTO's rules recognize that food is something special. Poor countries such as Bangladesh and Tanzania are allowed a great deal of freedom to protect and promote domestic food production. They are permitted, for instance, to set up grain banks for food security reasons, which tend to support prices. They are also allowed to provide cut-rate fertilizer and seeds to the most vulnerable farmers.\nUnfortunately, the WTO uses the wrong criteria to determine which countries need these special exemptions. Under the current definitions, relatively well-off developing countries can qualify, along with others that are desperately poor. Oddly enough, they do not take into consideration real-life measures such as the number of malnourished people living within a country. WTO members need to establish a new category of \"food-insecure\" countries, those for whom famine is just one catastrophic harvest away, and support domestic agriculture in those nations.\nThese are only the first of many good deeds that the WTO could carry out in the cause of abolishing hunger and poverty.\nConsider, as another example, the phenomenon of \"tariff escalation.\" Cocoa bean growers in poor countries face almost no tariffs when shipping their harvest to developed countries. Yet if those poor countries set up factories to turn their beans into cocoa butter, and tried to ship this to rich countries' markets, they would have to pay substantial tariffs. If they tried to manufacture and export finished chocolate bars, the tariffs would be higher still. In this way, industrialized countries protect their industries and prevent poorer countries from taking full advantage of the raw materials that they possess. The WTO is the one organization that may be capable of reducing tariff escalation.\nCan the WTO protect the interests of the world's poor and hungry? Pessimists may doubt it, pointing out that a handful of the world's wealthiest nations set up the WTO and continue to play a dominant rule in its operations.\nBut the WTO at least provides a system of rules for world trade. In fact some developing countries have won landmark WTO cases against more powerful nations. The rules may not be perfect, but they are certainly better than no rules at all. When all that counts is raw power, the small and weak are likely to suffer most.\nThe WTO cannot make sure that everyone on the planet gets enough to eat. But it can help to prevent unfair competition that hurts the poor. We urge WTO members to keep in mind the challenge of reducing hunger and poverty during their upcoming meeting.\nEugenio Diaz Bonilla is a research fellow and Sherman Robinson is the director of the Trade and Microeconomics Division at the International Food Policy Research Institute.

"}, {"text": "PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW; Trolling and Scavenging To Fill Empty Bellies\n2001-02-09T05:00:00.000Z\nIn 1998, concerned about crucial problems in Asia of food production, population explosion and environmental destruction, the Japanese photojournalist Hiroji Kubota went to various Asian countries to bring their troubles to the eyes of the Western world.\nThe results of his odyssey, to China, the Indian subcontinent, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia, make up ''Can We Feed Ourselves? A Focus on Asia: Photographs by Hiroji Kubota,'' at the Asia Society's temporary Midtown quarters.\nAt a news conference on the show's opening day, Mr. Kubota, explaining the absence of scrawny corpses or ''big-bellied babies'' in his pictures, said he was not interested in ''sensations'' but in focusing on how people earned their bread (or rice) in the face of many obstacles.\nIn a preface to the show's catalog, Gordon Conway, president of the Rockefeller Foundation and author of the recent book ''The Doubly Green Revolution: Food for All in the 21st Century,'' published by Magnum Photos, writes, ''Today, about 800 million people, some 15 percent of the world's population, get less than 2,000 calories a day and live a life of permanent or intermittent hunger and are chronically undernourished. Over 500 million of these people live in Asia.''\nBut Mr. Kubota's 67 color photographs, many of them very beautiful, do not include many shocking scenes. They make up a rambling, informal survey that is part travelogue, part National Geographic pictorial essay, part observation of land and the way it is worked and part picturesque chronicle of the poor and hungry.\nMr. Kubota, a prizewinning member of the distinguished photographers' cooperative Magnum, also reports on other phenomena, like the cremation of bodies in Bali, compulsory Buddhist training for boys in Myanmar and a mass rally of schoolchildren in North Korea to celebrate the 80th birthday of President Kim Il Sung in 1992.\nStill, even if the show has some extraneous material, it is noteworthy for its wide-angle view of Asia's struggles, from a mother and her baby roosting on the streets of Calcutta to farmers repairing a canal damaged by flooding in Hunan, China.\nThere are photographs of children selling vegetables in Katmandu, Nepal; a boy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, scavenging for fish fallen off a boat in the Mekong River; and men squatting on the streets before a restaurant in Delhi, waiting for charitable visitors to a nearby mosque to give money to provide them with food.\nUrban scenes loom large. In Bhaktapur, the ancient capital of Nepal, men hack up buffalo meat on the street as a wistful dog watches. In the Indian town of Fatehpur, Rajastan, a man leads a camel past a bus packed with passengers even on its rooftop. A squalid vignette in Calcutta -- as squalid as it gets in this exhibition -- depicts ragpickers going through a trash dump on a corner lot. ''On the other hand,'' the caption says earnestly, some people in the same city ''live in great luxury.''\nHuge crowds are an Asian commonplace. Those who complain about traffic in New York should try the high-density city of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where a striking photograph shows a street in the old section jammed wall-to-wall with the rickshaws that make up most of the city's rolling stock.\nIn sharp contrast are scenes of the countryside, where farmers till precious land that, Mr. Conway writes, is gradually losing its productivity to environmental degradation and other disasters (a recent example: the devastating earthquake in Gujarat, India). Once-fertile farm land and buildings still buried to their roofs in an ash-and-mud mix are shown in a desolate view of the aftermath of a huge volcanic eruption of 1991 in Luzon, the Philippines.\nA tropical rain forest in Kalimantan on the island of Borneo, a rugged green carpet (seen from a plane) once second in size to its counterpart in the Amazon Basin, is expected to disappear in a decade unless environmental restrictions are imposed. In Shaanxi Province, China, a farmer plies a pick ax on dry-as-dust terraced ground near the Yellow River, prevented by the lack of an irrigation system from using its water.\nBut there are more optimistic views in which mastery of the land and extraction of its riches still pose a hopeful challenge. Among them are an image of a farmer plowing his green-terraced rice field behind a team of water buffalo against the magnificent backdrop of Mount Agung, Bali's tallest and holiest mountain. Another shows a flock of contented-looking sheep being milked in Nei Mongol, China, the highest quality grazing grass in the country stretching away in a green prairie behind them.\nIn the city of Baotou in the same province a sizable crowd of workers on bicycles reports for early morning duty at the Baotou Steel Mills, whose 60,000 employees produce 1.5 million tons of steel a year. You can't eat it, but steel, an essential product for China's modernization, has a great deal to do with keeping rice on the table.\nDespite its affecting photographs, this show is really not geared to throw much light on whether Asia can feed itself in the future. But as one man's enlightened view of a world that most of us know dangerously little about, it's an eye-opener.\n''Can We Feed Ourselves? A Focus on Asia: Photographs by Hiroji Kubota'' is at the Asia Society at Midtown, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 517-2742, through April 1."}, {"text": "Change Is in the Air as Thailand Prepares to Vote\n2001-01-06T05:00:00.000Z\nStrange things have been happening in Thailand's deeply corrupt electoral process as the nation prepares to vote for a new Parliament on Saturday.\nPlenty of cash is still being handed out, but it is mostly hidden. Some candidates are buying votes with trips to the beach, scholarships, village development projects or temple donations with strings attached. One candidate hid so much fertilizer -- a gift for rural voters -- on the top floor of a building that cracks appeared in its walls.\nThe leading candidate for prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, has been charged by a countercorruption commission of hiding his assets by transferring stocks to his household help.\nThings used to be a lot easier for what one newspaper here calls Thailand's ''election animals.'' Strict new rules have been put in place to combat corruption and vote-buying, and candidates are fighting back with imaginative new tricks. It is a risky game. If they are caught, they could be summarily eliminated and barred from office.\nBut more is at stake than the shape of the next government. The election is the latest and fiercest battleground in Thailand's slow, hard-fought democratic revolution.\nThe country's efforts at reform have put it at the forefront of a difficult and uneven shift throughout the region toward more democracy and openness, in politics and government as well as in economics. The hierarchical, father-knows-best approach sometimes called ''Asian values'' is on the defensive.\n''You can see the democratic trend all the way from South Korea to Taiwan to Thailand to the Philippines to Indonesia, and then across to South Asia in places like Bangladesh,'' said Muthiah Alagappa, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Honolulu. ''The wave in Asia is towards more open political systems. But the movement is going to be gradual and contested and with some reversals.''\nSome see Thailand as a test for peaceful reform in the region.\n''Everyone is watching whether this election will produce a legitimate government and what will happen next,'' said Kavi Chongkitavarn, a political analyst at the English-language daily The Nation.\nIn almost every arena, Thailand is changing -- or trying to change. A liberal Constitution passed in the wake of the regional economic crisis of 1997 calls for far-reaching reforms with an election commission, an anti-corruption commission, a freedom of information act and a soon-to-be activated commission on human rights.\nThe country's long tradition of top-down government is also being challenged by an increasingly vigorous civil society as individuals and groups insist on being heard.\nThe regional trend has its recent roots in Asia's decade-long economic boom in the 1980's and 1990's, when authoritarian rule came under challenge as Western wealth and ideas flooded in. In Thailand and Indonesia, resistance grew to the political dominance of the military.\nThe changes received a second push from the crash of 1997, which spurred political change -- or at least political challenge -- around Asia. Unaccountable governments that had bought social peace with growing prosperity suddenly found their legitimacy questioned.\n''All the bad luck that has happened to Thailand may have been blessings in disguise; it woke people up,'' said Sunai Phasuk, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, referring to the military crackdowns of the 1970's and of 1992, as well as to the economic shock of three years ago. It was external pressures like these that forced former President Suharto from office in Indonesia in 1998, emboldening the opposition and shaking his one-man rule.\nThough other countries may be more peaceful, every one of them is feeling the undercurrents of change.\n''All the countries of the region are going through this process,'' said William J. Klausner, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University. ''It's just a question of where you are on the spectrum.''\nIn Malaysia, the entrenched and overbearing government now must take into account an invigorated political opposition and nongovernmental groups that are making themselves heard as never before in the 19-year rule of its patriarch, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.\nSingapore, as always, has things well under control, but its always calculating leaders are tinkering, aware that they must loosen things up to stay at the forefront of the new fast-moving world economy.\nVietnam is changing despite the hesitancy of its leaders. Still Marxist, still hidebound, they have committed themselves to the increased transparency and accountability that are the price of entry into the world marketplace. The original domino in the cold war, it now faces the prospect of becoming, in the words of Mr. Sunai, one of the new ''dominos of democracy.''\nLaos, Cambodia and Myanmar -- the former Burma -- with their strongman governments, have two options: liberalize or find themselves being left behind, poorer and poorer, relics of the past.\nThe Philippines, as always, is a special case. The region's democratic standard-bearer, its uneven fortunes have sometimes been a justification, sometimes a rebuke to Southeast Asia's strongmen. It is now demonstrating how messy democracy can be with President Joseph Estrada in the midst of an impeachment trial on corruption charges.\nIn Thailand, almost every institution is being scrutinized and challenged, from the judiciary to the police to the Ministry of Interior to the Buddhist establishment to the corrupt and bloated government bureaucracy.\nSmall skirmishes fill the newspapers here almost every day: parents fighting against favoritism in school admissions, patients suing doctors for malpractice, farmers protesting against dam projects, villagers complaining about factories' pollution.\nAnd the old guard fights back; the stakes are the wealth and power structure of a nation.\n''The old system is not just going to go away,'' Mr. Klausner said. ''They are fighting every day. That's the excitement of it. A lot of people are frustrated because the game has not been won, but we are in the midst of a process, and it's a struggle.''"}, {"text": "California's Power Crisis Replays a Familiar Theme\n2001-01-25T05:00:00.000Z\nCalifornia is long used to fires, floods, droughts, earthquakes, riots, mud slides and mockery from most of the other 49 states and the world. But no problem in a century and a half of statehood can quite compare to the electricity crisis gripping the Golden State.\nAs California endures its ninth straight day of an official power emergency with no easy end in sight, things have come to this: the 35 million residents of the nation's most populous state and the world's seventh largest economy are being urged to watch the Super Bowl in groups to avoid rolling blackouts at the hours of peak demand.\nThe truth has dawned only gradually that California, the epicenter of the nation's booming high tech economy, is subject to the episodic daily failure of a vital piece of its modern infrastructure that would not seem surprising in Bangladesh but still feels mostly surreal here.\n''It's not just an economic story,'' said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a series of histories of the California experience, who said that even the devastating San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906 was not so daunting.\n''It's a cultural and imaginative story,'' Mr. Starr said. ''Once again, Californians have to be alerted to the fact that they have to earn California, that it doesn't come for free. Massachusetts knows that. New York knows that. Any place where it snows knows that. Californians have to learn that again and again.''\nThis was not supposed to be the time for that lesson. A decade after a brutal recession and a series of natural disasters that felt like Biblical plagues, California has been on a roll, with a $5 billion surplus in state coffers, record low unemployment, resurgent optimism and predictions of phenomenal growth. The state's economy grew at 6 percent last year, 1.5 percentage points above the national economy, and pronouncements that the California Dream was dead gave way to warnings that the challenge of the new century would be managing plenty.\nIn fact, it is growth, at least in part, that has fueled the current crisis. Demand for electricity outpaced older power plants, while a botched experiment with partial price deregulation and longstanding environmental opposition combined to create disincentives to build new power plants or create cheaper wholesale prices through competition. Instead, wholesale electricity prices have spiraled out of control, pushing the state's two major private utilities, which have been barred from raising retail rates, to the brink of bankruptcy.\n''You have a first-world economy that's suddenly been plunged into a third-world economic environment,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. ''There were some early warning signs, but we were probably too busy reading our own press clippings to pay attention.''\nIndeed, though it powers everything from the marquees of Hollywood to the factories and Internet servers of Silicon Valley, electricity itself is so invisible as to be taken for granted. Unlike water, which has historically been thought of as the state's essential resource, it cannot be stored in underground aquifers or behind dams, but must be generated and distributed constantly.\nThe state's two largest utilities, Southern California Edison and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, saddled with debt, have been shut out of making long-term purchases at the most favorable prices, and instead have had to scramble on the spot market. In just six days, the state has run through about one-third of the $400 million it set aside on emergency basis last week to buy power and pass it on to the utilities. And though the Bush administration extended a federal order requiring power producers to sell surplus electricity and natural gas to California, that reprieve is set to expire in two weeks.\nThough there have not been long-lasting nighttime blackouts, public patience is wearing thin. A recent statewide Field Poll found that the proportion of Californians who think the state is headed in the right direction has dropped from its average of nearly 6 in 10 voters last year to just over 4 in 10 now. Another survey, by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, found that as many Californians -- fully one-quarter of adults statewide -- cite electricity prices and deregulation as the No. 1 issue facing the state as cite public schools and education, long the paramount concern here. In past surveys, electricity had not even surfaced.\n''It's a problem that's come out of nowhere and it's put all the other issues in the state on hold for now,'' said Mark Baldassare, the institute's survey director. ''It has already shown signs of draining much of the rest of our viable resources, the terrific surpluses that we were looking to as a source of solving problems from a lack of roads and infrastructure to new schools and education.''\n''Here we are in the heart of the new economy,'' Mr. Baldassare added, ''and we're spending our money furiously just to keep the lights on. It seems as if everything we learn about this, the fixes are more and more complicated.''\nNo one will bear the brunt of those complications more than Gov. Gray Davis, the placid Democratic centrist who has presided over boom times with high approval ratings since taking office two years ago, but who had yet to be tested in a crunch. In the current crisis, Mr. Davis has been criticized in many quarters as moving too slowly and has vowed to oppose electricity rate increases at virtually all costs, a goal some other prominent politicians consider unrealistic, since higher rates would help force conservation. The State Legislature, which approved the deregulation plan four years ago, has struggled with potential solutions, including having the state take over the hydroelectric plants or transmission systems, but no consensus has emerged.\n''I'd been saying this is the worst crisis a governor had faced since the Medfly, but that doesn't do it justice anymore,'' said Dan Schnur, a longtime aide to former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who was in office when deregulation was approved. ''This is going to sound partisan, but it's just unflattering analysis: Davis has never had to make an unpopular decision. He came in during a period of extraordinary economic growth, where the government's biggest problem was how to divide up its surplus, and now he's in a situation where there are no palatable options available and he's having huge difficulty.''\nMr. Davis has insisted that his deliberate approach will bear fruit, and has refused to accept what could be the quick but politically explosive step of raising retail electric rates in a state with a strong tradition of consumer activism and anti-tax sentiment. The Field Poll found that nearly 6 in 10 Californians believe the crisis is more an effort by energy companies to force higher rates than a shortage resulting from increased demand and not enough power generation. Most political experts predict that next year's statewide ballot, when Mr. Davis is running for re-election, is apt to be studded with proposals for handling electricity rates and supplies, any one of which could prompt heavy spending by competing groups and roil the political waters.\nOne of the oddities of the crisis is that Los Angeles, the state's largest city and its most economically and culturally dominant one, has been largely immune, since its municipal utility, the Department of Water and Power, was not subject to deregulation, has its own sources of generation and has sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of surplus electricity for use in other parts of the state. But soon enough, experts predict, it will feel the cost of the power crisis as state revenues that might have gone to repair roads or build new schools are diverted to buy electricity.\nIn the longer term, Mr. Starr, the historian, said: ''Anybody who wants to put money on California going under is going to lose that money. Because it'll come back. It always does. Right now, it's like an adolescent that just spurted up by a foot and a half. But it'll adjust.''"}, {"text": "Shadowy Party Heats Up British Racial Tensions\n2001-07-04T05:00:00.000Z\nThe sudden spasm of racial violence that tore through this former mill town the last week in June, leaving in its wake burned-out stores, boarded-up windows and a shaken and angry population seemed on the surface to have come from nowhere.\nBut many Burnley residents say the growing influence of the shadowy British National Party, with its fascist roots and its implacable belief that England should be for whites only, was responsible for the violence as surely as if party leaders had stood in the streets and personally distributed firebombs to the rioters.\n''They're causing a lot of trouble,'' said Helen Smith, 52, a charity worker, pushing her baby granddaughter down St. James Street. ''Because of the B.N.P., whites here have become totally obsessed with the thought that the Pakistanis are taking over. And if you've got that obsession, it just gets bigger.''\nMrs. Smith said she knew exactly when the trouble had begun in Burnley, which has 92,000 people, about 7.5 percent of them nonwhite: when the party got 11.3 percent of the town's vote in the June 7 national elections.\nUntil then, few people realized that the party -- a more reasonably spoken, less confrontational version of the neo-Nazi National Front, which had its greatest influence in the 1970's -- had found such a foothold here.\n''It's taken us a long time to realize what was happening,'' said Stuart Caddy, the Burnley Borough Council leader, ''and we've been very poor at counteracting it. It's been a knock back for us, and we realize we've got to work hard to engage with the communities here and get a clear message across.''\nLike Oldham, about 20 miles southeast, which had its own racial violence in late May, Burnley became ethnically mixed in the 1960's.\nDuring that era, tens of thousands of people of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background took low-paying jobs in the cotton mills that fueled the economy in towns across the industrial northwest.\nThe newcomers settled in this town mostly in two predominantly Asian housing developments, Stoneyholme and Daneshouse, which together form the sixth most economically deprived spot in all of England, but many lost their jobs when the mills closed in the 70's and 80's.\nThose of Asian background in Burnley who do work tend to own small businesses, like corner shops and fast-food places, or to drive taxis.\nThere was always low-grade racism here, people say. The largest outbreaks of racial violence in Britain before have been concentrated in Afro-Caribbean neighborhoods in the south, like Brixton in London. The ethnic picture across the country began to change in the 1990's, when asylum seekers began arriving -- first in a trickle, and then in a flood, hundreds of thousands of them.\nEncouraged by often provocative language from the Conservative Party and, to a lesser extent, from the Labor government, Britons have become increasingly afraid that illegal immigrants are overrunning the country -- diluting Britishness and using scarce resources.\nRace relations has become one of the biggest anxieties facing the British electorate, recent polls indicate, and it is in this context that the British National Party has begun to thrive in a few areas.\nIt is a small party, with fewer than 10,000 members nationwide and dependent on grass-roots support, said Nick Griffin, the party chairman, who on June 7 took 16.4 percent of the vote in Oldham West, the party's best showing anywhere, in balloting for for a seat in the House of Commons.\nAside from the 11.3 percent the party won in Burnley, and 11.2 percent in Oldham East, it got 2 to 5 percent in other races around the country.\nSteve Smith, the regional organizer in Burnley, said the party's message -- that whites should fight for their heritage, that the multiracial society should be dismantled and that nonwhites should be given financial incentives to return to their countries of origin -- had touched a nerve.\n''The race relations industry is simply a massive propaganda machine designed to make people feel guilty about wanting to preserve their racial and cultural identity,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We've had multiracialism imposed on us for too long, and the indigenous population is being sidelined by the politically correct politicians who are running the country.''\nMr. Smith, 41, an accountant, spoke in his office on St. James Street, down from the town center, its windows boarded up as security against possible attacks.\nThe office has a dramatic decor with dark blue fleur-de-lis-patterned wallpaper and a chandelier overhead. On one wall an enormous red party banner calls to mind an old Soviet-realism poster. It bears a picture of Alfred the Great, the ninth-century king who is a nationalist symbol, and the party slogan: Freedom, security, identity, democracy.\nDownstairs, where Mr. Smith runs a shop and museum devoted to Burnley's heritage, an enormous German shepherd snoozed peacefully on the floor. In the copy machine tray there was a picture of Hitler.\nTo many whites in Burnley, Mr. Smith appears to be speaking plain good sense, particularly when he argues that the local council doles out too much money to Asians at the expense of whites. It is a sore point and a widespread perception, though one that is not true, the council says.\n''Asians get a much better deal,'' said Christine Witter, 29, pushing her 8-month-old baby -- her fourth child -- down the street. First there is housing, she said: Asians seem always able to jump the line ahead of whites for subsidized apartments and houses. ''I'm not racialist,'' Mrs. Witter said, ''but if they come to our country they should abide by our rules, and not get houses over us.''\nHer husband, Colin, said that he did not vote for the British National Party in the recent election -- he did not vote for anyone -- but that he sympathized with its message.\nWhen he monitors the police radio from his truck, he said, all he hears are accounts of Asians' cars being stopped and searched, and invariably drugs or weapons are found. But it is the whites who are more likely to be harassed by the police and arrested, he said.\n''There's too much ethnic niceness,'' Mr. Witter said. ''It's got to the point where the kids at school aren't allowed to say 'blackboard' -- they have to say 'chalkboard.' ''\nHis wife agreed. ''We're not allowed to say 'Paki,' '' a derogatory word for Pakistani, she said. ''I mean, if they're from Pakistan, they're a Paki, right? If they call you white scum, and you respond and call them black scum, the police take you in for racialist behavior. But nothing ever happens to the Asians.''\nFeelings are running high, too, on the other side of the town center, the scene of the riots. White and Asian youths fought in the streets, attacked cars, houses and businesses with baseball and cricket bats, faced off against the police and firebombed the Duke of York pub, now a burned-out husk.\nFor as long as anyone can remember, this has been a peaceful neighborhood.\n''We have Asian and white families living side by side here who are totally baffled,'' said Colin Dawber, 42, who owns a newspaper store. Its windows were smashed during the rampage. He said the nationalist party capitalized on two things: the area's economic privation and turf-related tensions between white and Asian gangs.\n''I don't believe people voted for the B.N.P. because deep down they believed in all its stated aims,'' Mr. Dawber said. ''People voted out of frustration with the general poverty in areas of the town. Tour around and see how economically deprived it is. It's just as bad as Los Angeles, parts of New Jersey.''\nThe violence has set race relations back considerably, he said. Four days after the rioting, all of Burnley's 342 taxis were off the road, with Asians saying they were afraid to go to work.\nDescribing the feelings of Asian residents he knows, Mr. Dawber said: ''People are feeling the pressure of having to take abuse from ignorant people. I have an Asian friend whose wife is Welsh, who was told to go back to where he came from. He said, 'But I don't want to go back to Southport,' '' a town west of Manchester.\nMr. Dawber blamed unruly thugs on both sides for the tensions. So did an elderly white couple across the street, although their sympathies lie with the whites. ''The Asians call us white bastards, and tell us to go back to our own country,'' said the woman, adding that she was afraid to give her name.\n''Live and let live, that's our motto,'' her husband said. But the Asians make it hard, he added, describing how he stands in line with other whites at the post office on Fridays, when welfare benefits, pension checks and the like arrive.\n''You see the Asians getting their money and putting it into registered letters and airmail envelopes,'' he said. ''We say to each other, 'Look at that lot, sending money back home.' They could get by on half the money they get on the dole.''\nHe and his wife said they were afraid to go into the heart of the Asian neighborhoods. It is easy to see why. Asked for a comment, a group of 20 or so Asian teenagers congregating in an all-Asian housing project several blocks away shouted, ''Jews!'' before making clear with a barrage of unprintable remarks about Jews, and reporters, that no visitors were welcome. A white police officer in a patrol car came out and stood pointedly nearby.\nAround the corner, Osama Yaqub, 20, a high school graduate in a traditional shalwar kameez -- a tunic over baggy trousers -- and a pair of running shoes, said it was youths who no longer respected their parents or their religion who were causing the trouble.\n''Muslims aren't supposed to drink or intoxicate themselves,'' Mr. Yaqub said, ''but look -- you have liquor stores all over the place, a drug dealer on every corner, rap music coming from windows.'' His contemporaries, he said, feel alienated from their roots, but they also feel alienated from whites.\nUp the hill in the Touch Wood furniture store, Mazer Iqbal, a second-generation Pakistani who rose from poverty to open his own business, only to see its windows smashed one recent weekend, said that he, too, felt little in common with the youths down the road.\nBut when the Pakistani national cricket team played the English team in Manchester several weeks ago, he found himself rooting for the Pakistanis.\nAnd he said he understood when the former Pakistani cricket star Imran Khan warned that the English team could not expect Asian support until England was prepared to support the Asians who now lived here.\n''Before this happened I thought I was British,'' he said. ''We have been in this country for a long time. But look at us: we have different skins, different religions. And now we've found out how unaccepted we are here.''"}, {"text": "Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor, Your Vote\n2001-04-08T05:00:00.000Z\nYdanis Rodriguez, a schoolteacher and candidate for City Council, went campaigning the other day in Washington Heights, home to New York City's biggest concentration of Dominican immigrants like him. Buffeted by wet gusts of wind, he called out greetings in Spanish and was rewarded with broad smiles of recognition.\nBut being popular in a neighborhood buoyed by immigrants, while comforting on a cold day, will not necessarily get an immigrant politician elected. As Mr. Rodriguez would be the first to admit, few of those who greeted him so cheerfully may be eligible to vote.\n''We have a long way to go,'' he acknowledged. ''To empower our community, it's not just a question of getting elected but of educating people so they understand they have to become citizens and to register.''\nStill, this could be a banner year for politicians like Mr. Rodriguez.\nHe is one of at least a dozen foreign-born candidates who have set their sights on the City Council elections this fall, when term limits will force out two-thirds of the incumbents and 35 seats will be open.\nMany more of the 175 people who have declared their intentions to run are second-generation immigrants with Hispanic, Asian or West Indian roots.\nIn fact, so many immigrant candidates are chasing the immigrant vote that they could cancel one another out in some races. For example, along with Mr. Rodriguez, at least five others of Dominican descent are running for the Council seat in Upper Manhattan held by another Dominican-American, Guillermo Linares.\nIt is inevitable: a wave of immigration has transformed New York City since the mid-1970's. One million legal immigrants arrived in just the last decade and by now, city planners estimate, about 40 percent of New Yorkers are foreign born.\nDespite their numerical strength, the newcomers from Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet Union have yet to win real political power. Their biggest handicap is that not all of them become citizens. And their American-born children, when they are old enough, tend to vote at the same rate as other Americans -- infrequently. But recen years have brought significant changes that could give these New York residents their best shot at shaking up local elections.\nSpurred by national laws that eliminated services for even legal immigrants, a record number of them, nearly 575,000, have become citizens since 1996. Concerted voter registration efforts by advocates like the New York Immigration Coalition also appear to have paid off. The number of registered voters in he city has topped 3.6 million, 278,000 higher than a year ago.\nAt the same time, term limits have removed the advantage of incumbency in Council races, opening opportunities for Hispanic, Asian and other immigrant candidates who had largely been ignored by established party organizations. Finally, a generous campaign finance law will give even neophytes access to public matching funds to run promotional ads and print campaign material.\n''This is a situation where you have had just a little bit of change in any one year, but when you add up 10 years, it can be substantial,'' said John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the graduate center of the City University of New York.\nHe added: ''The non-Hispanic white population is down, the immigrant population is up and there really was a lot more naturalization in the second half of the 90's. Gradually that's going to translate into greater voter registration and, sooner or later, into more votes.''\nA study by Dr. Mollenkopf of where new voters registered from 1994 through 1999 showed the biggest increases in areas that have received the greatest number of immirants. That is not so surprising. But what has happened in other neighborhoods could tip the balance in a city where voting often divides along ethnic and racial loyalties. In some non-Hispanic white neighborhoods, voter rolls actually srank.\nCandidates who try to mine the immigrant vote still face their own peculiar challenges; for instance, there is the task of focusing energy on people who can actually cast a vote on Election Day, and then getting those people to the polls. That is the kind of help that has historically been provided by the Democratic Party organization. While its power to deliver jobs and favors has declined sharply, some neighborhood clubs and county organizations still anoint their favorites and mobilize on behalf of selected candidates.\nBut few immigrant activists have advanced very far in the party hierarchy.\n''I am the only Hispanic who is a Democratic leader of any county in the state, so I am qualified to say that the Democratic Party has failed miserably to take into account this new constituency,'' said Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic Party chairman.\nMr. Ramirez, who was born in Puerto Rico, said the party structure was uncomfortable with ''the sleeping giant'' that Hispanic and other immigrant voters represent.\n''New immigrants have a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed approach to voting,'' he said. ''The problem is that the political apparatus over the years has become less eager to take advantage of them because these people look different.''\nIndeed, to many would-be immigrant politicians, the party is often seen as more of a hindrance than a help.\n''As long as you're an activist, you're welcome,'' said Inna Stavitsky, a Russian-born candidate running for the Council seat in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. ''As soon as you're a candidate, you're not, of course, because you're a rival.''\nThe enduring power of the clubs shows on Election Day. Poll workers and observers are drawn from the ranks of established party networks.\n''All sides are controlled by the clubs and for new people it's very difficult to participate,'' said Ms. Stavitsky, echoing complaints that have been raised by many Asian-American and Hispanic groups. ''Last year there was a lot of abuse. In many cases they are very old. They have hearing impediments. And they don't understand the differences between the first and last names of immigrants.''\nLabor unions, on the other hand, have shown more interest in promoting immigrant candidates.\n''They do pretty systematic phone banks,'' said Rocky Chin, a City Council candidate in Lower Manhattan who has already been endorsed by Unite, the garment workers' union. Mr. Chin is a Chinese-American seeking the seat held by Kathryn E. Freed.\n''And the unions do a better job of addressing the issue of building coalitions between minority groups,'' Mr. Chin added, ''because they have all these different groups.''\nIn some elections, though, like last year's, accumulating immigrant votes takes more than an organizational structure.\nIn parts of Queens, the Chinese-language ballots in November reversed the party headings for Congressional, state and judicial candidates, so that the Democrats were listed under the heading of Republican and Republicans under the heading of Democrat. Board of Elections officials blamed a printing error and said it would not be repeated.\nSometimes the confusion is at least partly self-generated. One example was the primary election in Brighton Beach, home to a majority of the elderly Russian-American immigrants who have flooded New York in the past decade.\nDozens of voters complained that they were not permitted to write in the name of a Russian-American candidate they favored for a State Assembly seat, but whose name was not on the ballot. Shoving matches and shouting also broke out at some polling stations when would-be voters did not find their names on the rolls.\nThe chaos was typical of many election districts with large numbers of new citizens and elderly voters who do not understand that they must register by party to vote in a party primary. In the case of many Russian-Americans, who had experience in the fraudulent elections of their homeland, being turned away is evidence of a dark conspiracy.\nThe final challenge to immigrant voting strength also comes from within. They are so diverse that their impact on the power structure is fractured.\nOutside of a few areas like Washington Heights, where most of the Hispanic residents are believed to be from the Dominican Republic, immigrants do not live in sizable enclaves that approach the critical mass of a single voting bloc.\nIn Flushing, Queens, for example, Asians make up 52 percent of the population. Several Asian-American candidates, including three who have unsuccessfully run for office before, are hoping to capitalize on the changing demographics. They are running for the City Council seat held by Julia Harrison.\nBut while Asians may be in the majority, they are not all from the same place. Aside from its large Chinese population, Flushing has also attracted substantial numbers of Koreans, Indians, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis who may have no particular incentive to vote for someone of a different national origin.\nAnd that is where candidates have to walk a thin line. On one hand, they try to appeal to immigrant voters as a fellow Chinese-American, Dominican-American or Russian-American. On the other, they may not get elected unless they have crossover appeal.\n''We have to mobilize around issues and interests,'' said Margaret Chin, a candidate for the City Council seat in Lower Manhattan, which includes neighborhoods like Chinatown, SoHo and the Lower East Side.\nFor her and other candidates in the district, the controversy over the closing of the Grand Street subway station has been fortuitous. It has galvanized the traditionally disengaged residents of Chinatown. It may even convince them of the importance of having a friend at City Hall.\nCandidates like Ms. Chin can only hope.\n''Ten years ago, you couldn't mobilize to this extent,'' she said. ''But little by little, I think, people will realize that voting is important.''"}, {"text": "World Briefing\n2001-06-05T05:00:00.000Z\n AFRICA \n SOMALIA: REGION AFFIRMS INDEPENDENCE \n Somaliland voted overwhelmingly \u2014 97 percent in favor \u2014 to remain independent from the rest of the nation, according to official results from a referendum last Thursday.

The Syrians would replace Bangladesh in a seat that is alternated among nations in the General Assembly's Asian regional bloc, which includes the Middle East.\nVoting by the General Assembly for five of the 10 nonpermanent Security Council members will be in the fall to fill seats for 2002-2003. But nations aspiring to hold the places begin campaigns early, sometimes years in advance, because the process often involves extensive of political horsetrading.\nSyria's effort, which Israel opposes, has the backing of a majority of Middle Eastern and Asian nations and several important European governments, including France and Germany, according to diplomats. The Bush administration -- still in transition and without an ambassador here until the Senate confirms its nominee, John Negroponte -- has not made a statement on Syria's candidacy and is still studying the issue.\n''Since this vote will not occur until well into the fall's General Assembly, it is simply too early to go into any additional detail on the U.S. position on any Security Council candidacy,'' said Paul Aronsohn, a spokesman for the United States mission.\nWhen Secretary of State Colin L. Powell visited the Middle East, he met President Bashir al-Assad of Syria, who surprised diplomats by offering to place oil purchases from Iraq under United Nations supervision. Iraq had expected to reopen a pipeline to Syria outside the United Nations ''oil for food'' program.\nSome diplomats here speculate that General Powell may have discussed Syria's candidacy for a Security Council seat while in Damascus and may be prepared not to oppose it. For years many nations turned a cold shoulder toward Syria, contending it had a shadowy reputation on terrorism, an intransigent attitude toward peace with Israel, and dominated its neighbor, Lebanon.\nThe Clinton administration fought a similar effort last year when Sudan tried to take an African seat. The United States and several African nations mounted a campaign against Sudan, and the Sudanese lost out.\nIsrael's ambassador to the United Nations, Yehuda Lancry, said in an interview today that although all regional groups have the right to choose any country for a Council seat, he questions whether Syria meets the criteria set down in the United Nations Charter.\nMr. Lancry gave this quote from Article 23: ''The General Assembly shall elect 10 other members of the United Nations to be nonpermanent members of the Security Council, due regard being specially paid, in the first instance, to the contribution of members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security.''\n''Here I have to stress the sad fact,'' Mr. Lancry said, ''the fact that my colleagues from Lebanon can't unfortunately portray -- that Syria is an occupying power in Lebanon. Syria does not contribute to the maintenance of peace and security.\n''Moreover, Syria feeds the lack of stability and security and peace on the Israeli-Lebanese border, using the Hezbollah movement as the tool for this destabilization. That is why we consider that this candidacy is in blatant contradiction with the spirit and the letter of this article.''"}, {"text": "World Briefing\n2001-06-09T05:00:00.000Z\n AFRICA \n ZIMBABWE: MUGABE VOWS MORE LAND SEIZURES \n President Robert Mugabe vowed yesterday to press on with land seizures from white farmers and urged supporters to rally round his government.

No longer will they spend their days baking salmon, mixing salads, pouring Champagne and waiting on tables.\n''I don't know how I'm going to send money to support my family,'' said Ramon Hidalgo, a 33-year-old cook from the Dominican Republic whose wife and three young children still live in Santo Domingo.\nThe restaurant, Mr. Hidalgo explained, was both a ladder of opportunity and a United Nations: workers came from two dozen countries, including Colombia, Cuba, Egypt, Haiti, the Ivory Coast, Pakistan, Poland and Yemen.\n''Everybody was family,'' Mr. Hidalgo said. ''Never do I hear someone say, 'I hate somebody.' ''\nJoseph Ameyaw, his eyes swollen from tears, is also trying to pick up the pieces. His wife, Sophia Addo, a 36-year-old from Ghana, has been missing since the attack. Like many of the workers, she was striving for higher things -- studying to be a nurse -- while making $345 a week working on the restaurant's housekeeping staff.\n''I cannot sleep,'' Mr. Ameyaw said. ''I cannot eat. I lost a responsible lady.'' Each month, Ms. Addo sent hundreds of dollars to Ghana to support her parents and her 10-year-old daughter.\nUnion officials could not promise much in the way of benefits. There would be $15,000 in life insurance, workers' compensation death benefits and money from the crime victims board to cover burial expenses. The survivors were urged to apply for unemployment insurance and were told their health insurance would run out in two months. ''In no way to diminish the suffering of everybody else,'' Mr. Emil said, ''the people in the food service industry were probably least financially prepared to deal with this tragedy.''\nHe is urging contributions to the Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund, c/o David Berdon & Company, 415 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017.\nMr. Emil and union officials have contacted other restaurants to urge them to hire the survivors. But with the city's hotel and restaurant industry now in a tailspin, many restaurants are laying off rather than hiring. Still, many restaurants are contributing to the new relief fund.\nFor many survivors, their biggest hope is to see Windows reborn.\n''We have to rebuild the World Trade Center and Windows on the World,'' said Asmat Ali, a cook from Bangladesh. ''I'm Muslim, and my personal feeling is we have to show these terrorists they can't keep us down.''"}, {"text": "U.N. Report Maps Hunger 'Hot Spots'\n2001-01-09T05:00:00.000Z\nHunger currently afflicts 830 million people around the world because of natural disasters, armed conflict and a grinding poverty that consigns the poor to chronic malnutrition, the United Nations World Food Program reported today.\n''From generation to generation, people don't have enough food to eat,'' Catherine Bertini, the agency's executive director, said at a news briefing, where she distributed a map calling attention to ''hot spots'' where hunger is most severe. The map identifies large swathes of territory in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia where tens of millions of people, most of them women and children, cannot get enough to eat.\n''The combination of poverty and disaster causes people to have even less possibility to build resources to end their hunger,'' Ms. Bertini said.\nThe World Food Program defines hunger as a condition in which people fail to get enough food to provide the nutrients for active, healthy lives. Those who are considered undernourished subsist on 1,800 calories a day or less. The figure of 2,100 calories is generally recommended to sustain an average adult.\nAlthough the data the program uses was collected for 1995 to 1997, officials said that their research shows that the scope of the problem has not improved, and in some places is getting worse.\nOf the 830 million undernourished people, the report says, 791 million live in developing countries. The food agency said that 200 million are children under age 5 who are underweight for lack of food.\nIn more than 20 countries, hunger has been compounded by drought, which the agency said has affected 100 million people within the last year. The agency helped feed 16 million people hit by drought last year, compared with 3 million in 1996. In other areas, internal unrest has made it harder, if not impossible, to grow crops and get them to market.\n''We've seen an alarming trend where the poorest nations are hit simultaneously by both natural and man-made emergencies, including in Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Tajikistan,'' Ms. Bertini said. ''Unfortunately, we see a potential for that to continue or even increase in 2001.''\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, 180 million people, one-third of the population, are undernourished, the agency reported. The countries worst hit by hunger include Angola, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nIn Asia the number of undernourished people is 525 million, or 17 percent of the population, with the worst hunger found in North Korea, Mongolia, Cambodia and Bangladesh.\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, 53 million people, or 11 percent of the population, lack enough food, with the worst conditions in Haiti, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Honduras.\nElsewhere, one of the countries with the greatest problem is Afghanistan, which is ravaged by civil war as well as the worst drought in decades.\nAsked about Iraq, which has suffered from United Nations economic sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Ms. Bertini said that 15 percent of Iraqis were malnourished. ''Poor children under 5 are the people most at risk in Iraq,'' she said.\nMs. Bertini said that while conditions have improved in some countries -- like Bosnia, Namibia and Botswana -- they have deteriorated in others, like Afghanistan. In Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union, the transition from Communism to a free-market economy has caused suffering for people who cannot afford to eat properly.\nThe World Food Program reported feeding 89 million people last year, including refugees uprooted by wars and natural disasters. The food agency, based in Rome, operates in more than 80 countries.\nMs. Bertini said that countries struggling to overcome hunger need not only food but also water drilling and purification equipment and better sanitation and agricultural systems. In sub-Saharan African, progress has also been impeded by heavy government debt burdens, insufficient funding for health and education and the AIDS pandemic."}, {"text": "Look Again:Islam and Economic Development Go Together\n2001-10-02T05:00:00.000Z\nSept. 11 has spawned much theorizing about Islam and modernity. The theorizing may add to Muslim paranoia.\nOne notion now doing the rounds is that there is a clear connection between Islam and lack of economic development. This is then \"proved\" by references to the likes of Algeria and Syria, or by comparing Egypt with South Korea. It is time to look at the actual records and policies of the major Muslim countries \u2014 only one of the top six of which is Arab \u2014 and compare them with their non-Muslim peers.\nThe record of mostly Buddhist Korea has been remarkable by any standard. It underlines the fact that the only countries (city-states excepted) anywhere which have proved the equal of North America and Western Europe in economic development and technological change have been Japan and two places it colonized, Korea and Taiwan.\nEgypt's record has been on a par with poor Asian performers like Catholic Philippines but way ahead of Buddhist failures such as Burma and Cambodia. Egypt's mediocre record owes much not to Islam but to two decades of the socialist, secular nationalism of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, like Ne Win in Burma nationalizing industries and pushing out dynamic ethnic minorities.\nWestern commentators have been eager to contrast Muslim Pakistan's poor economic record compared with India. In fact, for the first 30 years of independence Pakistan did better. Its subsequent failings were owed partly to the nationalizations, carried out for domestic political as well as ideological reasons, by that most secular of its leaders, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\nOther failings can be attributed to the negative impact of 22 years of war in Afghanistan. Pakistan's abysmal record in educating women may owe something to Islam but more to its feudal social structure.\nHere Pakistan contrasts with the progress made in women's education in Iran, as much under the mullahs as under the shah. More women than men now enter Iran's universities.\nAt the political level, clerical oppression and international isolation remain problems, but the slowness of economic progress has been more due to state socialism. That was mostly the left's contribution to the anti-shah revolution and was further embedded by the war against Saddam Hussein.\nTehran again has an active stock market, and privatization is being held back by the political impasse rather than by Islamic ideology.\nPost-separation Pakistan has also fared poorly compared with Bangladesh \u2013 what was East Pakistan. Despite overcrowding and lack of resources, Bangladesh, the third most populous mainly Muslim state, has pulled itself up from its basket-case status to achieve food self-sufficiency. It has outdone India in terms of progress on education and family planning and maintains a rough and ready form of democracy.\nBangladesh has a secular system without being aggressively secularist along Turkish lines. Muslim Turkey has failed to reach West European levels of economic and social development, but it has a better track record than most of its Christian neighbors in Southern and Eastern Europe. Its current economic failings and restraints on democracy owe little to Islam but a lot to the statism still practiced by the heirs of Ataturk.\nThe largest Muslim country, Indonesia, had until four years ago the best economic and social development track record of any large (100 million or more) developing nation. Even under President Suharto there was pluralism and a larger measure of personal freedom than now exists in China.\nIts current economic problems have the same causes \u2013 excessive capital flows and cronyism \u2013 that afflicted much of East Asia. Previous failings, notably the state capitalism practiced by both Presidents Sukarno and President Suharto, were copied from the likes of Brazil, where for a while it was very successful.\nIndonesia's Muslim neighbor Malaysia has had one of the world's most persistently impressive records of progress, at least equal to its Buddhist neighbor Thailand. Attribute this if you wish to natural resources, or to the 45 percent non-Muslim population, or to foreign capital. But it has taken place under the aegis of a modernizing Malay/Muslim polity.\nIn East Asia since postwar independence there is no very evident connection between dominant religion and economic and social progress. Ditto in South Asia.\nAs for the major Muslim countries as a group, and excluding oil-rich Saudi Arabia and the Gulf sultanates, their economic performance has been ahead of Russia's and Eastern Europe's and at least the equal of Latin America's, despite Latin America's cultural links with Europe and North America and abundance of natural resources.\nThere are plenty of horror stories, especially in an Arab world beset by feudalism and humiliations at Western and Israeli hands. But Asia has its non-Muslim horrors, too.\nPolitical and economic arrangements in the major Muslim countries have been the products of specific histories, of which religion is only one component. These countries are no more run by loudmouthed and megalomaniac mullahs than the United States is run by ranting Christian radio evangelists. But they just might be one day, if the West insists on demonizing Islamic states in general without looking at the facts."}, {"text": "'Humanitarian' and 'Military' Don't Go Together\n2001-10-18T05:00:00.000Z\nThose who care about the Afghan people may have been relieved when the U.S. Air Force began dropping food. But while the air drops may fill a few stomachs, they damage the effectiveness of humanitarian aidin this and other conflicts.\nThe Western coalition is trying to prove to Afghans and the wider world that this is not a war against the Afghan people, that on the contrary it wants to help them.\nBut limited food drops are a symbolic gesture. It is extremely unlikely that these few items of assistance reach the poorest and most vulnerable Afghans. The experience of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) in delivering humanitarian aid throughout the world in armed conflicts for more than 30 years has taught that untargeted and unmonitored relief, particularly food aid, rarely reaches those who need it most.\nThe food drops are a superficial and misleading gesture. Decisions on humanitarian intervention should be based on needs alone, independent of military or political objectives. Otherwise those Afghans in greatest need of food and medical assistance will go without.\nIf the military is involved in delivering humanitarian assistance, the aid can be regarded by opponents asan act of war. If humanitarian action is seen as partisan, aid and aid workers can be denied access to people in need. In Pakistan, some United Nations offices, theoretically a beacon of hope for war-distressed people, have been looted and burned.\nAid agencies have left Afghanistan for fear of being targeted because they are identified with the coalition. Security fears have forced aid agenciesin Kashmir, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya and Somalia to reduce work, depriving many people of badly needed assistance.\nHumanitarian aid promotes a concern for humanity and dignity in times of violence. Such aid relies on respect for the impartiality of aid agencies. MSF in Somalia is still paying the price a decade later for the confusion between military and humanitarian objectives.Confusion was created again during the Kosovo crisis by the presence of NATO troops in refugee camps; the camps were shelled by Yugoslav forces. When the bombing stops and humanitarian agencies can move into Afghanistan, how will the warring parties tell them apart from humanitarian bombers?\nThe military can provide help to people in danger in certain circumstances. Logistical resources are frequently deployed to respond to natural disasters, and peacekeepers have animportant role to play in protecting civilians caught in conflict. But every time a military belligerently involved in a conflict describes its actions as humanitarian, this vital concept is eroded.\nAid agencies are perceived as less neutral and less independent; staff will find it increasingly difficult to work and will be increasingly targeted.\nThe people of Afghanistan are in desperate need and have almost no assistance. Millions face starvation. The United Nations has drastically reduced operations; all but a few aid workers have withdrawn from Afghanistan and now wait across the border. On one side tons of aid and hundredsof staff; on the other side millions of people suffering.\nA large-scale, independent humanitarian relief effort aimed directly at reaching those most in need is required. This response could be led by the United Nations, with a clearly understood humanitarian mandate, in collaboration with independent relief agencies. All parties to the conflict must allow passage of large convoys bearing food, medicine and humanitarian workers who can ensure that the aid is delivered to those who need it.\nIf the coalition really wants to save the most desperate people, it should concentrate effort and resources on making this happen, rather than on symbolic air drops. The Taliban and their allies have the same responsibility toward civilians in war.\n-\nDr. Rostrup is the international president of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. He contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, {"text": "Beyond Vindaloo: A New York Tour of India\n2001-05-16T05:00:00.000Z\nFROM the outside, Mirchi is simply a glimmer of life on a stale stretch of Seventh Avenue South, where cars begin their prolonged crawl toward the Holland Tunnel. But a glance at the menu immediately brightens the outlook.\nInstead of chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo, it is filled with regional Indian dishes, like peppery Chettinad chicken from the south, chickpea cakes flavored with chilies and cilantro from Gujarat in the west and fish bathed in herbs from the Sind. Instead of watering down flavors for Western palates, the menu states: ''Entrees are on the spicier side. Milder versions can be requested.''\nAmong Manhattan's Indian restaurants, Mirchi represents a small revolution. No longer will all menus list the same 10 dishes; it is now possible to find authentic, regional Indian cuisine at neighborhood restaurants all over the city. Simply by serving Indian food with spicing and seasoning intact, these restaurants are reinvigorating a complex and fascinating cuisine that had grown dreary with repetition. Gone are lackluster chutneys and dull curries. Instead, sparkling flavors ring out, like the sauce of mint, tamarind and yogurt on the seva batata poori, little round crisps topped with diced potatoes and crunchy slivers of lentil-flour angel hair, served at Dakshin on the Upper East Side.\n''I think the American palate has changed, and restaurateurs are taking more chances,'' said Prem Tolani, the owner of Mirchi. ''There is more awareness of Indian food in America, and that has made all the difference.''\nAlong with Mirchi, the leading edge of neighborhood Indian restaurants today includes Banjara in the East Village, for succulent tandoori dishes that recall how good clay oven cooking can be; Tiffin in lower Manhattan, for fascinating vegetarian dishes like a bright, spicy smoked tomato soup; Vatan in Murray Hill, for a parade of subtle vegetarian dishes from the western state of Gujarat; Mumbai on the Upper East Side, for Goan dishes like chicken in a curry of ground poppy seeds and coconut; and Dakshin, which also has a branch in Clinton, for beautifully seasoned south Indian specialties like chicken stir-fried with chilies, ginger and curry leaves.\nA couple of old standbys on the Upper West Side, Indian Oven and Mughlai, are also in the regional vanguard.\nThese are not high-end Indian restaurants like Dawat and Shaan, nor are they fusion restaurants like Tabla and, to a lesser extent, Tamarind, presenting French or American food with Indian seasonings. And unlike restaurants in Indian neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, Queens, these places serve a largely non-Indian clientele.\nSome of the newer places, like Mirchi, appeal to a younger generation of South Asians. Its dining room is simple and spare, with none of the copper trim and stilted formality that characterize so many other Indian restaurants. The pulsing techno music suggests a culture that has more in common with London and New York than with rural Indian villages. The bar offers fancy drinks, not to mention a wine list, rather than the usual Indian beers.\nBeyond looks and atmosphere, Mirchi is set apart because it is somewhat of a joint venture among several longtime Indian restaurateurs, including Satish Sehgal, the owner of Indian Oven, and Vijay Gupta, the owner of Mughlai and Bay Leaf in Midtown Manhattan, who are involved as consultants. For Mr. Sehgal, Mirchi has become a laboratory of sorts, for testing dishes like Jaipuri lal maas, a spicy yet subtle lamb dish made with 30 red chilies.\n''Jaipuri lal maas outsells anything on the menu,'' Mr. Sehgal said.\nNot that long ago, Indian food represented excitement for many New Yorkers. Like Sichuan restaurants in the 1960's, Indian restaurants that opened in the 70's attracted adventurous diners eager to explore the world's cuisines. ''We were serving North Indian tandoori, and we had a glass-enclosed kitchen,'' said Mr. Sehgal, who opened Indian Oven in 1975. ''It was a total performance drama.''\nIn a way, Indian restaurants were victims of their own success. As more opened around New York, they could not be sustained by the small pool of trained Indian chefs, so immigrants with little cooking experience were hired.\n''They were unskilled chefs, people in professions unrelated to food, but they needed jobs and the owners didn't care, they needed bodies,'' said Suvir Saran, a restaurant consultant, caterer and teacher. ''Bad recipes became institutionalized.''\nWhat's more, many restaurants that called themselves Indian were in fact owned and operated by Bangladeshis, like most of the Indian restaurants that line East Sixth Street in the East Village. ''I realized that many chefs were from Bangladesh and were cooking foods that they had not grown up eating,'' Mr. Saran said. ''I would ask them, 'Why don't you cook the foods you know?' And they would say the owners don't think it is right.''\nLike the sham Chinese restaurants that toss a handful of chili peppers atop chicken and call it Sichuan, many Indian restaurants came to serve poor facsimiles of authentic dishes. ''It was more of a bland kind of food,'' said Mr. Tolani of Mirchi. ''That's what they thought Americans wanted.''\nPerhaps Americans did want that, at one time, but tastes evolved in the 1990's. Whether traveling to India or to London, where Indian restaurants are as British as a pint in a pub, many Americans have had more opportunities to sample Indian dishes in their full aromatic glory. And they've begun to understand that India, like Italy and China, has no single, monolithic cuisine. Instead, Indian food comprises many different styles of cooking, each a product of regional influences, from the fiery vegetarian dishes of the south to the Portuguese-influenced Goan cooking of the west to the more familiar Mogul food of the north.\nOf course, anybody who really wanted good Indian food could find it in Indian neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, while taxi driver hole-in-the-walls like the Eat Again Deli in Chelsea offer unusual specialties like makai ki roti, a grainy cornmeal flatbread, though in less-than-comfortable surroundings.\nNew excitement arrived in Manhattan in the early and mid-90's, when southern Indian restaurants like Madras Mahal, Mavalli Palace and Pongal began opening around Lexington Avenue in the 20's, serving two-foot-long masala dosas, crepes stuffed with potatoes and onions, which were visually astounding and delicious.\nFor old-timers like Mr. Sehgal and Mr. Gupta, expanding the repertory of the Indian kitchen is partly a matter of national pride, but also a question of survival.\n''I was getting worried about the tikka masala thing,'' Mr. Sehgal said. ''You have to position yourself with something different when the competition is increasing.''\nSo, over the years, Mr. Sehgal has added regional dishes to his menu. Now, he serves dosas from southern India; safed maas, lamb or chicken cooked with green chilies and coconut, from Rajasthan in the northwest; and subtle, delicate dum pukhts from the northeast, in which lamb, chicken and vegetables are cooked in a sealed vessel.\n''Across the board, people are responding to regionalism,'' said Michael Batterberry, a founder of Food Arts magazine.\nMany people who know little about Indian food have been willing to try Tabla, the Indian-fusion restaurant, where the high-end comforts and the Danny Meyer imprimatur allay fears of the unfamiliar.\n''When we opened three years ago, a lot of people said they didn't like Indian food,'' said Floyd Cardoz, the chef at Tabla. ''They'd say, 'Where's the chicken masala?' -- not realizing that there are 36 different Indian states, each with at least three cuisines.''\nNonetheless, Mr. Cardoz, who came to the United States from India in 1989, says that Americans are willing to try new dishes. What's more, he adds, as Indians themselves see the improvements in Indian restaurants, they, too, are going out more, which in turn raises the bar for restaurants. ''With these smaller restaurants opening up, I'm very excited about Indian cuisine and where it's going,'' Mr. Cardoz said.\nFew places illustrate the changing face of Manhattan's Indian restaurants like Banjara, which opened several months ago in the East Village. From its corner perch at First Avenue and Sixth Street, it anchors one end of the end-to-end block of Indian restaurants that gained popularity in the 80's. But nobody would say that Banjara gets its food from the mythical single kitchen that supplies the others.\nThe chef, Tuhin Dutta, who studied at the French Culinary Institute, experiments with fusion dishes like sharabi kababi, chicken marinated in wine and served with prunes. For more traditional fare, Mr. Dutta offers Goan-style chicken with roasted coconut, and dum pukhts, a specialty of the northeastern city of Lucknow, fragrant chunks of chicken or lamb in a velvety beige sauce, served in copper vessels covered with a skin of pastry. And if you want to remember why people once flocked to Banjara's Sixth Street neighbors, the tandoori-cooked chicken and lamb are superb.\nMore Than Tandoori\nTHESE restaurants now offer regional dishes.\nBANJARA, 97 First Avenue, at Sixth Street; (212) 477-5956.\nDAKSHIN -- 741 Ninth Avenue, at 50th Street; (212) 757-4545.

Then, encouraged by the driver's chattiness: ''Let me ask you, are people giving you a hard time out here?''\nThe driver's face slams down like a riot gate.\n''Sir?'' the passenger persists, trying to seek him out via the rearview mirror, but the driver maintains his silence, eyes on the road, all the way to 33rd Street, looking away even as he reaches back to accept the fare and tip.\nKIDS NO. 2, SEPT. 20\nIt took more than an hour to make it uptown to pick up his older daughter from her evacuated school that afternoon, another half-hour to find her on the street and an hour and a half through the semi-locked-down streets of Midtown to bring her back home.\n''It was insane,'' she said. ''It's like we were sitting in the cafeteria and we heard the fire alarm but really faintly, and we're looking at each other like, What bad judgment to have a fire drill now. You know, with everybody already freaked out as is. But O.K., so, we leave the cafeteria, everybody's crammed into the hallways and you can't even move, I went maybe 10 feet in five minutes.\n''Then they say it's a false alarm, so we go back to lunch and we're all looking at each other like, That was not cool. A minute later, someone comes in, says: 'Get out. It is a drill. Get out now.'\n''We're back in the hallway, packed, and because of the World Trade Center, a few people, me included, start thinking, Bomb. We get outside the building, I go up to a teacher and ask, 'Is this a fire drill or something else?'\n''She says: 'I don't know, I don't know. Pretend it's not a drill and just walk. Walk away now.'\n''I say, 'Should we go to our assigned evacuation spots?' She says: 'No. Just go. Go.' Then we see the bomb squad pull up.\n''The kids who have cell phones are calling their parents and then they do something so unusual. They go up to other kids they don't even know and ask if anyone would like to call their parents, you know, offering them their phones; other kids announce that they live only two, three blocks away, and if anybody wants, they can come stay at their houses if they don't want to be out in the street. Everybody became so generous. It was almost worth the scare to see it.\n''But then something happened, Dad? I don't think I'll ever get it out of my mind. There was this girl, my age, someone who I never thought of as particularly mature, kind of the opposite in fact, and, this girl, she goes up to one of the teachers and says very calmly, 'I want to get my sister from her class.' Teacher says: 'No. No way I can let you go do that.' The girl says, 'My sister is 6 years old, she gets scared easily, I know she wants me, and I am going to get her.' The teacher says: 'Look, she's with her own group, her own teacher, I'm sure she's fine. They probably told her it was just a fire drill.' And then, Dad, this girl, she says, 'But I know what's going on, and I want my sister with me.' ''\nHis daughter takes a breather, her eyes glistening with unspilled tears. ''I don't know, this girl, it's like in one minute flat, she went from being this flighty kind of kid to this instant adult. It's like she turned into iron. She was so strong and clear about things. I don't even really know her, but I felt so proud for her. . . . But I also felt so sad.''\nHer tears finally ran the rims and spilled down her cheeks. ''I wish I could really find the words to explain to you how I felt.''\nIt took her three weeks, but the words finally came, showing up on her father's desk early one morning, deposited there on her way to school.\n''Dad, it's like these days, there are adults, and there are children. Only two camps now, no intermediate zone for teenagers like myself. If you possess the information, if you understand what's going on in the world, you're an adult, no matter what your biological age; all others are children.\n''There is nothing that traditional 'adults' know that this new breed of 'child-adult' doesn't, and the gut instinct of kids my age to go to their parents and demand comfort, answers or whatever doesn't work now, because we are aware that we know just as much about the world as you do.\n''So many of us have been forced into this new group overnight, like that girl I was telling you about and to some extent, myself.\n''And along with the scariness that comes with being a member of this new group of adults without any actual adult experience, is the sadness that we bear for the years we had to surrender in order to accept this mutual burden with you.''\nROYALTY, SEPT. 29\nIt's the night of the unification bout for the middleweight belt, Felix Trinidad versus Bernard Hopkins, and the garden is boiling over with both the near-insanity of a mass gathering so soon after the events of the 11th, and the anticipation of the state-of-the-art violence to come.\nThe crowd is mad for Felix Trinidad, and there are Puerto Rican flags everywhere, reproduced on T-shirts, head wraps, pennants, scarves and, of course, flags as flags, flags so big it takes two men to display them; dozens of these tag teams work the landings between the multitiered seating sections, racing their pride around the natural oval of the building, blocking the views of hundreds of fans at a clip, although the general consensus seems to be for people to restrain themselves from shouting out something rude and to the point, because the vibes are such that anything, it feels, can lead to anything.\nAfter two interminable hours of prelims, the fanfare that precedes a title bout finally begins. First there's the spotlighting of the usually schizophrenic mix of New York royalty in the crowd: Sharpton, Trump, Spike, Latrell, etc., followed by the calling up into the ring of past middleweight champs: Jake LaMotta, Emile Griffith and other less memorable titleholders. The crowd doesn't really cut loose though until the spotlight falls on Roberto Duran. Looking more like a heavyweight these days, the ex-champ milks the cheers, grinning, dancing, bathing in the love. . . .\nBut then, in the middle of his moment, there seems to be a secondary roar overtaking the first like a succeeding wave, this one a little stronger, a little more from the gut and strangely enough, focused slightly to the side of the ring itself, people half-rising now, some to cheer more loudly, others to track down the source, and there they are, maybe a dozen New York firemen in F.D.N.Y. T-shirts and jeans, heading for their places of honor next to the cast of ''Oz,'' walking a little stiffly, some displaying awkward smiles, others giving up half-waves of acknowledgment, and one can only imagine the great sense of disorientation they must feel; heroes, grievers, survivors; the garden really pouring it on now, the fervid cheers gradually becoming more articulate, breaking down into three distinct sounds: U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A.\nTentatively, as if lowering themselves into scalding water, the city's newest royalty take their seats. (P.S.: Hopkins won the fight.)\nCABBY NO. 3, OCT. 3\n''Fifty-ninth and Madison?''\nThe cab heads uptown, flags fluttering, another Yankee Doodle express. ''So how's it shaking out here?'' the fare asks.\n''Business is bad,'' the cabby says. ''Very bad. Come 9, 10 o'clock? This city is dead.''\n''Are people giving you a hard time?''\n''Not really.'' The driver turns to face his passenger at a red light. ''They've been pretty good. Mostly it's kind of polite interrogations, like, 'Where are you from, what did you do back in your country before you came here, why did you come here?' '' The light changes and he turns back to the traffic.\n''Where do you come from?'' the fare asks. ''I'm just curious.''\n''Bangladesh,'' he says.\n''So nothing ugly? Well, that's good to hear.''\n''I tell you,'' he says, making eye contact through the mirror. ''Do you know what I miss the most? The small talk. I enjoyed that very much. Now they get in, say take me to such and such and then nothing. Except for, you know, like I said, the polite interrogations.''\n''No, I hear you,'' his passenger says.\n''Like you,'' the driver says, briefly turning again. ''Like now.''\nKIDS NO. 3, OCT. 9\n''Dad? Can I tell you something, you promise not to get mad at me?''\n''Not really.''\n''I dropped my cellphone in the toilet,'' his younger daughter says. ''It's dead.''\n''Don't worry about it. Take mine.''\n''Seriously?'' Then, with as much guilt as relief, ''What are you going to use?''\n''Not your problem. It's just, you know, with everything going on these days? It makes me breathe easier to know that I can reach you no matter what.''\nThe kid's face went taut, not what he intended.\n''Look,'' touching her arm. ''Don't get me wrong. Right now, in this city, you need to keep your eyes open. You know, use common sense, or whatever. But it's also very important that you live your life as normally as you can.'' That one opened the flood gates.\n''What if they bomb us?''\n''Who bomb us? Nobody's going to bomb us. I don't even know who they are.''\n''What if they hijack another plane?''\n''Look, here's the deal. You go to school. You work hard, no goofing off. You do your homework, you study for your tests. You go to your soccer practices. Game time rolls around? Not too many headers. Come the weekends? You hang with your friends. Saturday morning? Sunday morning? You have a contest with your sister, see who can sleep the latest, O.K.? You live your life, O.K.?''\n''O.K.,'' her face lightening. A light peck and a dash for the door.\n''Where you headed?''\n''I'm going to hang out with Cole.''\n''Hey. Do me a favor?'' stopping her with one foot in the street. ''Don't go into any big stores tonight, O.K.?''\n''What?'' A little stutter in her step. ''Why?''\n''Just . . . humor me. It's nothing.''\n''O.K.''\n''And stay out of Washington Square.''\n''What's wrong with Washington Square?''\n''Well, I never like you hanging out at Washington Square.''\n''What's wrong with Washington Square?''\n''Absolutely probably nothing. I'm just not too crazy about crowds right now, O.K.?''\n''O.K., O.K.,'' the tightness coming back into her face, but what could you do?\n''And oh,'' he winced pre-emptively. ''The subway? It doesn't exist for you, O.K.?'' then, ''Sorry.''\nBy the time the kid hit the street, she looked as if someone had strapped a boulder onto her back; her father wondering if it was more dangerous for her inside the house than out.\nHAVEN, OCT. 21\nRafiyq Abdellah, born Torrin Williams, enters the visitors' room wearing a gray Velcro-fastened jumpsuit and greets his guest with a standing hug. At first, the talk is of lawyers and postponements, but the conversation turns to the inescapable.\n''Well, I'll tell you, this is not the greatest of times to have a name like mine, you know what I'm saying?''\n''They breaking your back in here?''\n''Yeah, well, I don't want to make too much of it, but like, O.K., what was it, 10 minutes ago I come in here? The, the guard who brought me up? He's like, 'Abdellah, Abdellah, were you tight with the hijackers?' And I'm like, 'Yo, look at my face, hear my speech -- do you think I was tight with the hijackers?'\n''Yeah, and then on the other end of the spectrum, the native-born Muslims in here? Sometimes they look at the African-American Muslims and they're all like, 'You ain't praying right, you don't understand the Koran right, you this, you that. . . . ' I mean, I'll tell you, when we all go to the jumah on Fridays? Man, there is like some spirited disputations in there these days, no lie. . . .\n''I mean, most guys in here, they feel like everybody else about what happened, you know, the horror of it. . . . I mean, there's a few guys, political types, and for them, what happened, it's all about chickens coming home to roost. But I don't see how anybody could say that with an honest heart.\n''And I saw it happen that morning, did I write you about that? You get a pretty good view of the skyline from in here, and when that first building went down? Man, I couldn't even close my mouth.\n''I'd like to think the worst is over, but with the anthrax now and everything? Hey, you know how I feel about being incarcerated in here, right? But I have to say it, with what's going on out there on a day-to-day basis? Rikers might very well be the safest place in the city.''\nNOT NORMAN ROCKWELL, OCT. 24\nUnder a cracklingly blue sky, New York is trying harder than ever to proceed with its spiritual comeback; the shops are more crowded, overheard conversation veers more often to the blissfully inane and erratic bursts of laughter punctuate the soundtrack of the streets, although let's not kid ourselves, the people of this city still carry themselves with a certain humped tension, as if waiting for the next unthinkable.\n''Did you ever hear of Lord Buckley?'' she asks her friend as they cruise the ground floor of a mammoth bookstore. ''Kind of a hipster monologist from the 50's? He had this bit back then about Khrushchev and the H-bomb, and he says something like, 'In times of great uncertainty and terror, humor is the only thing that ensures us that we do not die before we're killed.' ''\n''Yeah, well, have you heard any good jokes lately?'' her friend asks. ''Because I sure haven't.''\n''How about this?'' she responds, gesturing to a freestanding six-book display easel by the information desk. The three titles running across the top row are: ''Rogue Regimes,'' ''Bin Laden: The Man Who Declared War on America'' and ''Terrorism: Today's Biggest Threat to Freedom.'' At the far left on the lower row is ''Living Terrors: What America Needs to Know to Survive the Coming Bioterrorist Catastrophe''; at the far right, ''Jihad''; and dead center, surrounded by all the others, ''New York Landmarks.''\n''Will that do?''\nBack out on the street, they wander down Broadway and notice after a few blocks that the people in front of them have come to a standstill, their eyes on the approaching uptown traffic, where a fire truck is cruising back to its house.\nSome of the people break out in applause. Others wave. The firemen wave back.\n''Can you believe that?'' she says. ''It's like the 1950's. Like Norman Rockwell.''\n''No way,'' her friend says, joining in on the applause. ''There's nothing sentimental about what those guys went through.'' She cut loose with a piercing two-fingered whistle. ''And I'll tell you something else. Right about now? This is probably the least na\u00efve city in the world.''"}, {"text": "Cuttings: A Land Rush for Compost in the City\n2001-06-16T05:00:00.000Z\n IT looked like a gathering of the nations two Sundays ago, on the parking lot of Medgar Evers College in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Only these delegates weren't talking global warming, but shoveling deep, dark compost as fast as they could. \n Every New York City resident who got there in time (this black gold went fast) was allowed 30 gallons \u2014 enough to fill a large trash can \u2014 from the Department of Sanitation, which had delivered 90 cubic yards that morning for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Urban Composting Project. \n \"My friend told me my rhododendrons are dying because my soil is so compacted,\" said a woman in an orange linen suit, having rushed over from services at the Bethany Baptist Church. \"They can't live because I don't put anything in the soil.\" She seemed on a mission, as she gingerly shoveled away, trying not to mess up her pretty dress and pumps. \n A Bangladeshi boy who now lives in Queens, 12-year-old Novel Ahmed was working alongside his mother, Zulhas Bagum, and his older sister Rumena Kabir. \"We have a backyard of vegetables, fruit, flowers, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, green chilies and jute leaves,\" Ms. Kabir said. \"We were going to buy compost from Home Depot when we saw a notice about this on TV.\" \n While Novel scraped the blacktop for the last crumbs of compost, Ms. Kabir bought a rigid black plastic composter for $20 \u2014 a big discount from the $70 store price \u2014 and the family headed home to treat their garden to this feast of nutrients teeming with micro-organisms ready to work on tired soil. \n Eilaine Li from Coney Island and Brent Li from Bay Ridge were helping their clan fill 15 rice bags with the crumbly compost that was headed for their mother's house. \"She needs it for her flowers and vegetables,\" said Mr. Li, as his relatives hefted the heavy bags into their van. \n Some arrived too late, so fast had the garden locusts descended on the pile, and Bernadette Dorvil was literally in tears. `I came so far to get here,\" said Ms. Dorvil, who lives in Canarsie. \"I'm shocked. I never saw the compost. Just the bare floor.\" She looked so sad that Suzanne Curley, a gardener from Park Slope, handed her one of her own bags. And Daxius Gregory, a composting instructor from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, offered another. \n \"You think if I shed a tear, this gentleman would help me?\" asked Rose Butler, who grows blueberries and figs on her fire escape in Bedford-Stuyvesant. She had hoped to load her blue Ford pickup with her allotment of 30 gallons and head down to Williamston, N.C., where she grows a field of corn, collards, tomatoes and squash. \n Such is the passion compost inspires, and for good reason. If you don't have a compost pile on the edge of your garden, or an indoor worm box tucked in a corner of the kitchen or basement, you are missing out on nature's own fertilizer. \n Entire books have been written on the art of composting and its benefits, from the complex \"Rodale Book of Composting,\" edited by Deborah Martin and Grace Gershuny (St. Martin's Press, 1992) to a paperback called \"Worms Eat My Garbage,\" by Mary Appelhof, who explains how redworms do the job (Flower Press, 1997). A good one to start with is \"Easy Compost: The Secret to Great Soil and Spectacular Plants,\" edited by Beth Hanson, one of the many excellent handbooks from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's 21st Century Gardening Series. \n Composting can create the kind of topsoil it takes nature about a century to create without human help, and depending on how compulsive you are, you can turn your leaves, clippings and vegetable matter from the kitchen (no meat or grease, though, as these attract rodents) into sweet- smelling nutrients in six weeks to a year. A fast \"hot\" pile has equal amounts of carbon-rich material (brown leaves, pine needles, twigs, eggshells, shredded newspaper) and nitrogen-rich material (green leaves, vegetable and fruit peelings, coffee grounds or spent flowers). \n If you turn these elements regularly, to aerate the pile, and keep it moist but not wet, an army of earthworms, sowbugs, centipedes, mites, beetles, molds, fungus and bacteria will transform this \"waste\" \u2014 which otherwise gets trucked at great cost to a landfill \u2014 into humus, a complex stew of biochemical compounds that can bring moisture, air and nutrients to worn-out soil. It can also protect roots and plants from pathogens. \n To get interested gardeners started down the fascinating road of composting, try an excellent Web site, www.soilfoodweb.com by Dr. Elaine Ingham, a soil scientist based at Oregon State University, as well as the resource lists in back of books like those mentioned above. Gardens can really thrive with the stuff, and why pay for it when it's sitting right there in your kitchen and backyard? \n Most botanical gardens and county agricultural extension services provide information and maybe even workshops on composting, and some municipalities offer free compost. \n New York City's botanical gardens also offer compost \"help lines\" and e-mail addresses: \n Bronx: bronxcompost@nybg.org or (718) 817-8543. \n Brooklyn: compost@bbg.org or (718) 623-7290. \n Manhattan: manhattancompost @nybg.org or (718) 817-8543. \n Queens: compost@queensbotanical.org or (718) 539-5296. \n Staten Island: sibgcompost @erols.com or (718) 273-0629. \n Gardeners eager for compost have another chance at a giveway: in Manhattan today from noon to 4 p.m., at the Pier 84 Urban Gardening Festival (south of the Intrepid Sea- Air-Space Museum at West 44th Street and 12th Avenue). Take a shovel and bags, and go early. First come, first served. "}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED: REINFORCEMENTS; Allies Building Force to Keep Order in a Vacuum\n2001-11-16T05:00:00.000Z\nAbout 160 British marines and American Special Operations troops flew today to Bagram airfield north of Kabul as Western nations rushed to assemble an international force to keep order in Afghan areas wrested from the Taliban.\nEight C-130 aircraft -- six British and two American -- landed at the airfield, establishing the first allied bridgehead at the base, which troops began preparing for shipments of food.\nTheir arrival came as Pentagon officials said American Special Operations forces were ''tightening the noose'' in Afghanistan as they began coordinating combat missions with Pashtun fighters in the south.\nThey also sought to make contact with Northern Alliance officers who had forwarded credible claims of capturing some Taliban commanders and at least one high-ranking Al Qaeda leader.\nIf the assertions are true, the prisoners could provide valuable intelligence about the location of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader, and Mullah Muhammad Omar, chief of the Taliban.\nSince the fall of Kabul earlier this week, the focus of the war has turned to tracking down Mr. bin Laden and capturing remaining Taliban outposts in southern Afghanistan.\nThe country appeared deeply fragmented today, with rival warlords filling the power vacuum left by the departing Taliban and with Mullah Omar vowing to fight on and ''destroy America.''\nAmerica's allies signaled today that they were prepared to fill the power vacuum. British officials said more than 4,000 British troops had been put on alert for duty in Afghanistan. France said it would also send troops to keep order in northern Afghanistan, and Canada said it was prepared to send more than 1,000 soldiers.\nTurkey and Jordan have also offered forces to maintain security in Afghanistan and the United States indicated Bangladesh and Malaysia are prepared to contribute as well.\n''We need some troops on the ground both to bring order and to bring confidence to the people of Afghanistan,'' Clare Short, Britain's top official for international assistance said. ''We need to move in days.''\nThe sense of urgency in London and Paris emerged after Taliban resistance in northern Afghanistan collapsed more quickly than expected, raising fears that the unstable situation might interfere with the delivery of badly needed aid shipments.\n''Aid is not flowing as quickly as it should be because there are still security concerns,'' said Kenneth H. Bacon, the president of Refugees International and the former Pentagon spokesman.\nMr. Bacon noted that World Food Program stockpiles in Mazar-i-Sharif had been looted and that an aid convoy had been attacked.\nAnother concern is that some ethnic groups that make up the Northern Alliance might start fighting among themselves unless there is an international security presence.\nThe rapid military developments have outpaced diplomatic deliberations over how to maintain security.\nThe idea of an all-Islamic security force, recently mentioned by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, is still no more than an option.\nThe United Nations special representative for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, favors an all-Afghan force to maintain order. That may be a worthy goal, Western diplomats suggested, but not a short-term solution.\nEven as Britain and France called for urgent action, Bush administration officials acknowledged that the allies had yet to hammer out a common plan.\nThe Pentagon is wary of contributing large numbers of troops for a security force, a position that reflects its longstanding reluctance to become involved in peacekeeping operations.\n''In terms of taking U.S. forces and having them become a part of a semi-permanent peacekeeping activity in the country, I think that's highly unlikely,'' Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said.\nAmplifying the Pentagon's view, a senior Defense Department official said he thought that the Northern Alliance could provide much of the security in the north, a view the British and French clearly do not accept.\n''I would not discount the possibility that most of the security work will be done and continue to be done by the Afghans themselves, assuming the conflict with the Taliban up there is cleared up and the pockets of resistance vanish,'' said Joseph Collins, a deputy assistant secretary of defense who focuses on relief and peacekeeping issues.\nA State Department spokesman said tonight, ''When and how foreign troops might be involved in this effort is still being determined.''\nStill, the American military is prepared to support the relief effort.\nTo help coordinate aid, the Pentagon is considering the establishment of a separate military command in Pakistan. Pentagon officials said the command would include military officials from a coalition of allies, many of which have pledged troops and aircraft for aid programs. An official from an allied nation may command the force.\nAs the allies scrambled to figure out a plan to maintain order in the north, fighting continued in the south.\nAmerican Special Operations forces, coordinating combat missions with Pashtun fighters, kept up the pressure on the Taliban.\nGen. Tommy R. Franks, commander of the military operation in Afghanistan, said for the first time today that Special Forces teams were now working with anti-Taliban militias in the south to provide battlefield advice, organize resupply, offer weapons and call in strikes by American warplanes. That is what they did earlier -- and with success -- in the north, aiding the now buoyant Northern Alliance. ''We're tightening the noose,'' said General Franks, commander of the United States Central Command. ''It's a matter of time.''\nBut the Taliban forces defending their stronghold of Kandahar continued to put up tough resistance today, Pentagon officials said.\n''We are applying pressure in the vicinity of Kandahar,'' General Franks said. Although Kandahar remains under Taliban control, ''we do see signs of some fracturing there,'' he said.\nAs more of Afghanistan falls under opposition control, American forces are scouring sites where Al Qaeda is suspected of testing or producing chemical or biological weapons. ''We have no substantial findings to this point,'' said General Franks.\nFierce fighting continued today in the northern city of Kunduz, where the Northern Alliance has trapped thousands of fighters loyal to the Taliban and Al Qaeda.\nMr. Rumsfeld and General Franks indicated that the battle for Kunduz could be particularly bloody since the enemy force has a large number of Al Qaeda's most devoted, skilled and well-armed fighters. Many are non-Afghan, which means they have few options except fighting to the end: They cannot defect to the Northern Alliance or shed their weapons and hope to fade into the local population, officials said.\nWhile American Special Operations forces are calling in airstrikes at Kunduz, concern about civilian deaths has prevented heavy bombing inside the city, officials said.\nRegarding the need for security in the north, French and British officials indicated that one arrangement under consideration would give the French responsibility for security around Mazar-i-Sharif, the northern Afghan city captured last week by the Northern Alliance, while the British would have security for Kabul and the nearby Bagram airfield, which is emerging as a crucial hub.\nFrance's defense minister, Alain Richard, said he intended to send significant numbers of French forces to Afghanistan.\n''We are working on a French contribution, probably with other coalition countries, to create a security base that would re-establish infrastructure and normal living conditions in the northern zone,'' Mr. Richard said today. The plans would be completed within days."}, {"text": "THE BLIZZARD OF 2000: THE AIRPORTS; For Travelers, the Misery Endures\n2001-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\nOf all the thousands of people at La Guardia Airport whose travel plans collapsed this weekend beneath the Blizzard of 2000, consider the plight of Sheikh Kabir, 30, a mild-mannered database manager scheduled to be married this week on the other side of the world.\nOn Saturday, when Mr. Kabir tried to fly from his home in Annandale, Va., to catch a connecting flight to his native Bangladesh, the storm grounded his plane. He tried to get another flight, and the blizzard scuttled that one, too. Finally, Mr. Kabir caught a train, slept on a bench in Penn Station in Manhattan and made his way through the snowy streets to the ticket counter at La Guardia, where he waited early yesterday with hundreds of other marooned passengers for an uncertain deliverance.\n''My marriage is on the line,'' said a red-eyed Mr. Kabir, whose wedding to a woman he has yet to meet is set for Thursday. ''I didn't think this sort of thing happened in America. Bangladesh, yes. But America? I moved here to avoid this sort of thing.''\nThe season's great storm has departed, but along with its blackening snow, it left behind airports filled with broken plans, stranded voyagers and a tangle of vouchers, reroutes, delays and cancellations.\nThe metropolitan area's three major airports -- La Guardia, J.F.K. and Newark -- all reopened late Saturday and early yesterday after the storm had shut them down. The heavy snow and the holiday traffic combined to turn the airports, where air travel is hardly stress free on the best of days, into crowded, noisy corridors of waiting and rescheduling.\nSprawled across floors and over benches and under TV monitors were hundreds of bleary-eyed travelers searching for a way home. They slept on cots, on tile floors and on luggage carousels, as motionless as the planes outside. When the sun rose, would-be passengers rushed to the ticket counters for fresh news of any newly materialized flights. Some found it; others did not.\n''There was a huge crowd when I got here this morning at 4 a.m.,'' said Barbara Antoni, who works at the information desk of American Airlines. ''When I walked up to the counter, everyone started cheering.''\nLa Guardia was closed for about 13 hours Saturday, prompting the cancellation of about 800 flights and the grounding of some 40,000 fliers, officials said. But aside from a lucky pair of flights that landed and left late Saturday night, La Guardia's runways were vacant until early yesterday morning -- nearly 20 hours. By early afternoon yesterday, 70 more flights had been canceled. Some passengers were still adjusting their pillows.\n''I'm having a bad moment,'' said Loraine Krol, embracing her 14-year-old daughter, Carrie, and beginning to cry. ''I've done so well until now. I was just starting to feel sorry for myself.''\nLike dozens of others marooned at La Guardia, the three members of the Krol family arrived early Saturday just as the storm was hitting its stride. The Krols were returning in a rented car from a holiday in western Massachusetts, en route to their home in Arvida, Colo. Some 30 hours after they arrived, Ronald Krol lay on one of the army-style cots Port Authority workers doled out the night before.\nMs. Krol propped her pillow against the window and settled down. Just outside, a worker blasted the ice from an airplane wing. ''With luck, we'll be home tonight,'' she said.\nDespite the complaints, La Guardia officials said they were pleased with their response to the blizzard, which dropped as much as two inches of snow per hour on the airport's 25 miles of runways and roads. As the storm approached, workers stood at the ready with 500 tons of sand, 500 tons of salt, 18,000 gallons of anti-icing liquid and 18 pieces of snow removal equipment, including plows, blowers and sweepers.\nStill, it was not enough. The snow fell so fast, officials said, that by the time a plow reached the end of a runway, the snow had already begun to pile up at the other end.\n''The snow was coming down faster than you could keep up with,'' said Warren Kroeppel, La Guardia's general manager.\nHolly Arthur, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Airport Executives, said that the time needed to clear a quantity of snow equal to the amount that fell on La Guardia -- about 13 inches -- depended on an array of factors, including the rate the snow came down, the wind speed and the size of the runways.\n''It totally depends on the conditions,'' Ms. Arthur said.\nDuring much of the day, airport officials said, planes were landing and taking off from only one of La Guardia's two runways. By last night, both had been cleared.\nFor all their frustration, many of La Guardia's grounded passengers bore their discomfort with good cheer. A group of second-grade teachers from Greenville, Wisc., who had come to New York for a two-day holiday, ended up spending nearly as much time in La Guardia as in the city itself. With matted hair and fading smiles, they chatted about the things they would do when they finally returned home.\n''We are all going to take bubble baths,'' said Mary Fischer, who passed more 26 hours in the airport with her friends.\nMichael Tooley was more prepared than most to be philosophical about his delay. After more than 30 hours at La Guardia, Mr. Tooley, a professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado, sat with a fellow devotee and discussed such high concepts as time travel, the nature of properties and backwards causation.\n''Just passing the time,'' he said.\nAs the day wore on, the most nagging worry for many passengers became whether or not they would make it home ahead of the New Year. Several passengers said they had already called home to cancel parties, dinners and dates.\nNot Vito Bianco, a retired New York printing worker on his way to Cape Coral, Fla. A widower, Mr. Bianco said there were many opportunities for a single man like himself, and that the woman he was hoping to see New Year's Eve would bear his absence with patience and understanding.\n''She'll wait for me forever,'' he said."}, {"text": "NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE; Asian-Americans Diving Gracefully Into Political Waters\n2001-05-06T05:00:00.000Z\nExcept for a few judges and school board members, no Asian-American has ever held elected office in New York City. None has ever filibustered against a bill or shouted down an opponent on the City Council floor.\nA telling sign of the odd fact of their absence from politics was evident at a reception at the City Hall restaurant in TriBeCa on Tuesday for 12 of the 13 Asian-American candidates for the City Council: none of them hogged the microphone. As they addressed about 150 people under the barrel-vaulted ceiling of a crowded downstairs room, they generally respected the three-minute limit.\nThough they gathered under the unifying rubric of Asian-American candidates, there were differences among them. For one, they have come from several different countries -- China, Taiwan, Bangladesh, South Korea, India and India by way of the Caribbean. And some of them are expected to oppose each other as they fight for seven Council seats in Democratic primaries in Lower Manhattan and Flushing, Queens, next September.\nBut all of them agreed that the odd fact must change. And with two-thirds of Council seats up for grabs this year because of term limits, now may be the time.\n''We have 10 percent of the population but 0 percent of the governance,'' said Parag Khandhar, a policy analyst for the Asian American Federation of New York, which sponsored the event. He called this a ''landmark year,'' however, because no more than five Asian-Americans had run in past council elections.\nFour of the thirteen candidates are women. One is Margaret Chin, who is running in District 1 in Lower Manhattan, which covers Chinatown. ''I want to move the Asian-American community into the mainstream,'' she said, ''so we can work for education reform, more housing and better access to medical care.''\nIf her list of issues sounds like it could appeal to all kinds of voters, that was probably by design. Several speakers, including Ms. Chin, appealed for support not because they were Asian-American but because, they said, they were the best candidate.\nYet, an informal poll of those gathered at the event, almost all of them Asian-American, revealed a kind of emerging political infrastructure. There was hardly a nonpolitician to be found among the networking members of tenant and civic associations, business councils and political clubs.\n''It's reminiscent of every immigrant group in New York City,'' said Matt Aubry, an advisor to John Liu, a candidate in District 20 in Flushing. ''Like the Italians, Irish and African-Americans, it's time for Asian-Americans to step into political legitimacy.'' JIM O'GRADY"}, {"text": "RESTAURANTS; Long on Subtlety, Short on Heat\n2001-01-17T05:00:00.000Z\nWHEN New Yorkers brag about the diversity and depth of their international restaurants, they tend to gloss over a couple of facts. The food map contains some very large blank spots. Regional Mexican is one. Indian is another.\nIndian restaurants of a certain kind can be found by the hundreds in Manhattan and Queens. Most fall into the Curry in a Hurry category: small places with very limited ambitions, usually operated by Bangladeshis. What Greek diners are to Mediterranean cuisine, these are to Indian. New York, with very weak historical ties to the subcontinent, cannot approach the richness and variety of a city like London, which offers everything from ghastly curry and chips shops to glamorous showcases for the best of India's cuisines.\nAda (pronounced ah-DAH) takes a step in the right direction. Or rather, two steps forward and one step back, which adds up to progress in the end. The name, in Urdu, means something done with style or flair, and David R. Shah, the owner, has definite ideas about what style can do for Indian food. The decor, for one thing, steers clear of Indian fabrics, ornate brass plates and beaded curtains in favor of cool silver and gray banquettes, cream walls decorated with white plaster bas-reliefs of a disassembled Indian dancer -- the feet look across the dining room at the arms -- and curlicue glass sconces in cobalt blue and blood red. The silverware is French. It's an oddly elegant room, with a wood-burning fireplace near the door, a spiral staircase leading to an upstairs dining room and a subtle aroma of spices in the air.\nMr. Shah is intent on giving the food an upgrade as well. The full name of the restaurant is, after all, Ada: Maison de l'Inde. The chef, Rajender S. Rana, established his reputation at the Hyatt Regency and the Sheraton in New Delhi, where he was a protege of Jigs Kalara, a well-known consultant and food writer. His outlook is Indian but with an international bent, and the dishes at Ada reflect this in conception and appearance.\nEscabeche of rock shrimp and tuna is flavored with a Goanese tamarind marinade and served in a martini glass. White truffle oil subtly suffuses a lighter-than-air biryani, or rice casserole, speckled with perfectly poached shiitake mushrooms. Ingredients like fingerling potatoes, buffalo mozzarella and mesclun greens dot the menu. Little palate fresheners might be a green-apple sorbet in milk foam, or slices of Asian pear topped by a dab of Coach Farm goat cheese and painted with dill-fig vinaigrette.\nThis Westernized reworking of traditional Indian flavors may frustrate purists, but the results, for the most part, disarm criticism.\nMr. Rana uses spices with great delicacy. Goan barbecue ribs, for example, have a down-home immediacy right down to the mango slaw and onion pakora (indistinguishable from a French-fried onion ring), but a dry rub of chilis and garam masala and the tang from an apple-vinegar marinade create a complex swirl of flavors. Crab Malabar looks like a West Coast wrap but tastes perfectly Indian, with a gentle heat supplied by mustard seed and ginger. The wrapper is a pepper-specked papadum.\nOne of the best appetizers is a slow-grilled white-pea and potato cake accented with garam masala, fennel and cilantro, and surrounded by caramelized bananas coated with creme fraiche.\nAnyone who thinks of Indian spices as hot will learn otherwise at Ada. Mr. Rana, without pulling his punches, uses his spices, and herbs, to augment flavors or add complexity to flavor combinations. Curry leaves underline the sweetness in the delicate coconut crust around a sea bass fillet, and the syrupy, sour-sweet tamarind sauce makes the ideal foil for chicken that comes out of the tandoori oven suffused with the flavors of saffron, garam masala, fenugreek and chilies.\nTandoori usually means desiccated, artificially reddened meat. At Ada, the spices and marinades penetrate every fiber of the meats, which arrive in a state of melting tenderness. A kebab does not have to have the consistency of jerky. Mr. Rana's seek kebabs, little cylinders of ground goat, cilantro and tomato baked in the tandoori oven, remain moist and tender after broiling, and marinated lamb, smeared with a ginger-mint paste, achieves a luscious velvety texture.\nMr. Rana makes some odd choices here and there, and some of his dishes misfire through poor execution. Samosas filled with cepes and shiitake mushrooms are tough. So is the fish in his escabeche. Salmon koftas, listed by the French name quenelles, are so lightly flavored that they make virtually no taste impression whatsoever. Dainty and perfectly shaped into ovals, they amount to a grace note to the main themes set down by lemon rice and a rich coconut curry. The wild mushroom biryani, although sublime, should really be a side dish.\nThe dessert menu severs almost all ties to India. Steve Klc (pronounced keltch), the executive pastry chef, uses a few Indian ingredients strategically, with some success. Coconut panna cotta, covered with a slick of ice-wine gelee and tiny apple dice, has a perfect sweet-tart balance, and a surprise at the bottom of the dish, a firm layer of coconut- cardamom rice.\nChocolate chai souffle stumbles at the outset. Chocolate without chai would be fine. Likewise, chai without chocolate. Together, the two make bad company. Mr. Klc recovers nicely with a disc of apple chutney balanced on top of a spongy layer of ladyfingers and topped with saffron cream.\nAda aims to elevate the status of Indian cuisine in New York. But it has chosen a questionable way to do it, giving authentic flavors and techniques a Western spin. It has also priced the product very high, out of fear, perhaps, that diners cannot respect any cuisine unless it carries a French price tag. For hardened veterans of the $15.95 Indian buffet wars, however, Ada arrives like a piece of good news.\nAda\n** [Rating: Two Stars]\n208 East 58th Street; (212) 371-6060.\nATMOSPHERE: In a coolly decorated, luxurious dining room, Indian food is presented in a European style.\nSOUND LEVEL: Quiet.\nRECOMMENDED DISHES: Crab Malabar, white-pea cake with caramelized bananas, Goan barbecue ribs, Kerala fish curry, ginger mint lamb chops, apple with saffron cream.\nSERVICE: Polite but tentative.\nWINE LIST: A spare list of 20 wines that have little to do with the food.\nPRICE RANGE: Lunch: Appetizers, $10; entrees, $16; desserts, $9.

In that one camp alone, more than 175 refugees, most of them children, have died in the past two months.\nGETTING BACK TO WORK, SLOWLY -- As the focus in northern Afghanistan shifted from fighting to relief, aid agencies, many of whose offices had been badly looted in recent weeks, began to get back to work and distribute supplies that can now be brought in over the border from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In the Afghan capital, Kabul, there were also signs of life beginning anew.\nSeveral dozen Marines secured the American Embassy compound where, just last September a Taliban protester had clambered up the front of the building and tried to remove the United States seal. The seal is still there, but the embassy, closed since 1989, is in a sorry state, badly in need of new paint.\nBritain is ready to take the lead in an international security force that could deploy as many as 5,000 soldiers in and around Kabul as a provisional government takes charge on Dec. 22. France and Germany have also agreed to contribute troops, and forces may also come from Muslim nations like Turkey, Jordan, Bangladesh and Indonesia.\nThough the United States has troops on the ground in Afghanistan helping to round up Taliban leaders and Al Qaeda terrorists, the Pentagon does not plan to contribute any soldiers to a peacekeeping force.\nOn a stop in Germany yesterday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell made it clear that the international force will be quite distinct from the American military presence. ''The two are very, very different forces,'' he said.\nHUNTING FOR BIN LADEN, WITH BOMBS -- In Washington, senior officials confirmed what most people in Afghanistan already know: the Taliban is finished. But, the Pentagon hastened to add, the war is far from over.\nIn eastern Afghanistan, the hunt for Osama bin Laden was still on, even as American planes continue to bomb the caves and tunnels of the Tora Bora mountains.\nFor the third time in this war, the United States dropped a ''daisy cutter'' bomb on Sunday against a mountain face in Tora Bora. The 15,000-bomb, one Pentagon official said, was dropped on a cave that would now be impossible to enter or leave.\nThe deputy defense secretary, Paul D. Wolfowitz, said the bombing raids had disrupted Al Qaeda's ability to communicate and had diminished Mr. bin Laden's authority. ''This is a man on the run, a man with a big price on his head,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said. ''He doesn't have any good options.''\nSo far, opposition forces have captured three Taliban leaders, including the former chief of staff, who is being held in northern Afghanistan by a local commander, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum.\nFrom their base southwest of Kandahar, United States marines moved in closer to the city to seal escape routes for Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's spiritual leader.\nROUNDING UP PRISONERS, GRIMLY -- There were new and gruesome details about the fate of some of the thousands of Taliban soldiers who were taken prisoner by the Northern Alliance earlier in the war.\nAccording to eyewitnesses, dozens of Taliban prisoners, including many foreign fighters, suffocated as they were transported in shipping containers from Kunduz to a prison in Sheberghan, the hometown of General Dostum.\nThe great numbers of prisoners posed a logistical problem for the Northern Alliance, which at the time was still facing pockets of Taliban resistance and fighting to put down a prison uprising in the Qala Jangi fortress outside Mazar-i-Sharif.\nOne of the prisoners in the Qala Jangi fortress-jail was John Walker Lindh, a young Californian who had joined the Taliban as a fervent convert to Islam.\nHe was one of the last men to see Johnny Spann alive. Mr. Spann, an officer of the Central Intelligence Agency who was killed during the prison uprising, was buried yesterday with full honors at Arlington National Cemetery, even as Mr. Walker was being interrogated by the United States military. He awaits a decision on whether he should be tried as traitor or as a criminal. CELESTINE BOHLEN"}, {"text": "AFTER THE ATTACKS: THE FOREIGNERS; Outside U.S., Families Keep Tortured Vigil For Their Own\n2001-09-15T05:00:00.000Z\nThe hijackers who destroyed Manhattan's twin towers may have had America in their sights, but, judging by the list of victims, they ended up taking on the world.\nIn towns and cities from Argentina to Denmark, China to South Africa, relatives and loved ones of people missing in the attacks have been ceaselessly watching television and keeping the same despairing vigils by telephone as their counterparts in the United States.\nAmong those killed were professionals who had moved to the United States with their families to further their careers, young people spending time on internships, business travelers keeping appointments or attending work seminars, workers at the many foreign companies in the buildings and tourists taking in one of New York's prized sights on a day of startling autumnal clarity.\nIn an age in which high tech communications have wired distant places into a global neighborhood, many of the poignant farewell conversations that are emerging in news reports of the victims' last moments were held between people a continent away from each other.\nDerek Sword, 29, a Scot who worked on the south tower's 89th floor, called his family in Dundee to tell them he was fine. ''That must have been seconds after the plane went in,'' his mother said. ''That was really it, and we have not heard anything else since.''\nThe parents of Ron Gilligan, 43, a British broker on the 105th floor, saw the burning building on television at their home in Liverpool and placed an urgent call to him. There was no answer, and the trans-Atlantic silence has persisted.\nIn Sheffield, in the British Midlands, the mourning is for Nigel Thompson, 33, who worked for Cantor Fitzgerald on the 105th floor of the north tower and was on the phone with his twin brother Neil when the first plane crashed into his building. ''We are under attack,'' he said. ''We are evacuating now.'' He has not been heard from since.\nCommentators in Dublin have noted sadly that in addition to the five Irish citizens confirmed dead, many of the hundreds of firefighters who perished had Irish surnames.\nMore than 30 countries have reported having citizens killed or missing in the collapse of the buildings. The highest numbers come from countries like Britain, Germany, Belgium, Japan and South Korea, which are most actively in the New York financial district, and Mexico and Bangladesh, whose nationals often labor in its service sectors. Reports from Moscow tonight indicated that nearly 100 Russians are unaccounted for.\nMore than 100 Britons appear to have been trapped in the buildings when they were destroyed. Many others escaped and told their stories to British newspapers, which filled their pages today with admiring accounts of the stoicism of New Yorkers under siege and the courage of emergency workers. They also published family album pictures of lost young men and women at their weddings and outdoor gatherings and cradling their infant children.\nThe expressions of grief around the world are most often directed at the American victims, but the loss of so many people from other lands has added to the sense that the catastrophe is a global one that subsumes national differences.\n''It is clear that given the likely death toll, there will be many citizens of other states who will have died,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said at 10 Downing Street the morning after the attacks. ''I have to say that I fear significant numbers of them will be British. So in a very real and direct sense, the interests of our country are engaged.''\nThe Mexican government is seeking information on more than 150 of its nationals who are missing. The foreign minister, Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda, told the Mexican Senate on Thursday, ''These attacks were not only acts against the United States, against democracy and against civilization, they were also attacks against dozens, hundreds and perhaps thousands of Mexicans.''\nIn the City of London financial district, bankers and traders felt a kinship with their American counterparts born of daily conversations. In interviews with British television this week, they have been expressing pained bewilderment that there is no longer any answer at the other end.\nLondon workers for Carr Futures were said to have been in direct contact with their New York colleagues during the panicked aftermath and heard anguished pleas for help. The Daily Telegraph quoted an unidentified banker here as saying, ''The London guys deal on an open outcry basis, where they shout over orders to New York, so they had speakers on their desks. They are all traumatized by what they heard.''"}, {"text": "Hundreds of Foreign Nationals Are Among the Victims in New York : Many Countries Share Terrible Losses\n2001-09-15T05:00:00.000Z\nPARIS\u2014  Countries around the globe sought to locate citizens who might have been caught in the suicide attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, with a growing number of foreign nationals feared missing beneath the 450,000 tons of rubble of the World Trade Center. \n For Britain alone, it was the worst ever toll in a terrorist attack. Thousands of Britons work in New York, many of them in the financial industry. The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said Thursday that almost 100 Britons had been confirmed killed in the tragedy. \n For Israel, the disaster was almost a hometown story, with as many as 250,000 Israeli nationals living in the New York area. Two Israelis who were on the hijacked airliners are known to have died, but dozens more are feared missing in the trade center. A special situation room at the Foreign Ministry has received more than 4,000 requests since the catastrophe. \n More than 40,000 people worked in the center. At least 4,700 were listed as missing, including hundreds of firefighters and policemen, but hopes were fading that many more would be found alive. \n More than 400 people were still being treated at St. Vincent's hospital in Manhattan. \n With about 44 million people of Irish ancestry in America, the attacks were also a national tragedy for Ireland. On board the United Airlines flight from Boston that slammed into the center's south tower were an Irish mother of 45 and her four-year old daughter. \n The plane hit the tower just as the woman's brother, Ronnie Clifford, 47, was escaping from the building. \"He's very traumatized,\" their brother, John Clifford, said in Cork, Ireland. Meanwhile, the Irish government was seeking to trace scores of its nationals who are still missing. \n Many financial businesses that have a strong presence on both sides of the Atlantic were in the twin towers of the trade center and the surrounding district. \n The financial services group Cantor Fitzgerald was one of those affected, with hundreds of staff members on the top floors of one of the towers. The British insurer Royal Sun and Alliance also issued a statement that staff members were still unaccounted for. \n Morgan Stanley; the investment banks Sandler O'Neill, Keefe Bruyette Woods and Thomson Financial; and the brokerage firm ICAP were also among companies with international staffs in the region. Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank said all their staff members were accounted for and safe. \n The British government pledged Thursday to cover medical costs for any Britons caught up in attacks who did not have insurance. \n More than 20,000 names were listed on a World Trade Center survivor database Web site: http://wtc.ny.com. The list was being updated every 15 minutes. \n The Battery Park City Authority also set up a message board to help people locate friends and relatives, at http://members2.boardhost.com/batteryparkcity/index.html. \n Asian businesses also employed large numbers of local and expatriate staff in the stricken building. In Tokyo, a Foreign Ministry official said at least 100 of its nationals were unaccounted for, including 20 who worked in the trade center and two on the aircraft. \n Twelve of the 125 Japanese staff members of the Fuji Bank were among the missing, along with about 50 of the 500 locally hired workers. Thirty-one Japanese banks, securities firms and insurance companies had offices in the twin towers, with hundreds of national employees and more than 1,000 local hires. \n It was not known how many foreigners at the time of the attacks were on the observation deck on top of one of the towers. The Australian swimming star Ian Thorpe turned back from a visit to the deck to pick up a camera at his hotel, but three other Australians were reported among the dead and about 90 were unaccounted for. \"We have little doubt that we will need to brace ourselves for more\" fatalities, said the Australian defense minister, Peter Reith. \n The Foreign Ministry in Taipei said it was concerned for nine missing Taiwanese citizens. More than a score of South Koreans also were among the missing. The caretaker leader of Bangladesh, Latifur Rahman, said it was feared at least 50 of his co-nationals had died. Hundreds of Bangladeshis worked in restaurants and offices in the World Trade Center. \n Two Chinese citizens, four Germans, a South African and three Portuguese were feared dead, while 20 Portuguese, seven Italians, seven Philippine citizens, six Zimbabweans and a Swede were among the missing. An estimated 150 Mexican nationals worked in the World Trade Center, many in a restaurant called Windows on the World, and 12 remained unaccounted for. \n In Paris, the Foreign Ministry said no French citizens had been listed among the dead, but warned that this was only a preliminary report. \n Illustrating the global nature of the tragedy, 800 million Europeans belonging to the member countries of the Council of Europe were asked to observe three minutes' silence on Friday, which President George W. Bush also designated as a national day of prayers and remembrance.

Neil MacFarquhar (NYT) "}, {"text": "The World: Why Are You Here?; Britain's Race Problem\n2001-06-03T05:00:00.000Z\nTWO things were striking about the aftermath of the race riots that raged through Oldham in the British Midlands last week in the midst of a national election campaign. First, none of the party leaders -- not Tony Blair, the Labor prime minister, nor William Hague, the Tory leader, nor Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats -- found it convenient to visit Oldham and speak to the people there. Second, nobody even seemed to notice.\n''What is really amazing and weird is that you have a riot in the middle of an election and nobody skips a beat -- they just carry on,'' said Gary Younge, a columnist for The Guardian, who is black. ''It's like some kind of child dies at your feet and you just walk over it.''\nBritain remains an overwhelmingly white country, with nonwhites making up just 5.5 percent of a population of nearly 60 million. Still, no one walking the streets of the cities here could doubt that Britain has become, to some extent, a multicultural nation. The unfamiliar accents, shop signs in foreign languages, exotic clothing and rainbow of skin tones all testify to the presence of nonwhites -- from the Caribbean, from Africa, from Asia, from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Many more are eager to come. In 2000, more than 100,000 people, including dependents, applied for political asylum.\nBut this is still very much an island nation, even if a less isolated one than it used to be. The fact that tens of thousands of people every year come to Britain seeking refuge from political oppression, or simply in search of jobs, makes many people here deeply uneasy. In response, the two major parties, Labor and the Tories, often seem to be competing over which can talk tougher and produce stricter anti-refugee policies. With the election coming this Thursday, neither is eager to entertain the idea that racial unrest may have some connection to their oratory.\nIt fell to Simon Hughes, the home affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, the country's third-largest party, to make the point. ''If politicians talk up things that encourage the view of racial differences,'' he said, ''then there is an indirect likelihood that it will resonate with people, young people, impressionable people.''\nIt was not so long ago that Britain's stewardship of its vast empire all but guaranteed a comfortable feeling of superiority toward people unfortunate enough to be members of other races. ''There is a deep inheritance of racist ideas in British culture,'' said Chris Mayant, a spokesman for the Commission on Racial Equality, which monitors the government's record on race. Now in his 50's, he was raised on children's books ''full of racist messages based on the assumption that we were top of the world, and rightly so.''\nBut though the country's transition to post-colonial status may have been painful, it's not clear how much that has contributed to current attitudes. ''We cannot any longer simply blame the perpetuation of racism among new generations on our imperial past,'' Mr. Mayant said. ''The empire helped put in place attitudes and relationships, but something is happening in our communities that perpetuates this.''\nIn Oldham that something is partly about race and assimilation, and partly about economic privation. Even after the cotton mills that once employed immigrants began to close in the late 1970's, the traditions maintained by first-generation Pakistanis and Bangladeshis helped order their lives. They lived in tightly knit communities, which were organized around mosques and social centers, and based on religious observance and respect for one's elders.\nThat structure has fallen away for the British-born second generation, but the jobs needed to ensure social mobility and economic advancement do not exist. The minority youths of Oldham -- some 50 percent of whom are unemployed -- may look Pakistani or Bangladeshi, but they speak with thick Manchester accents and, unlike their parents, consider themselves British enough to fight back when provoked.\nFor years, Asians in the area say, they have coexisted uneasily with whites, living side by side but often enduring low-grade racism in the form of looks, words and gestures. And they say that the institutions they might turn to for help, like the police and the local newspaper, The Oldham Evening Chronicle, tend to give more weight to the complaints of whites than nonwhites.\n''There is a feeling that the police have been heavy-handed,'' said Tanvir Hussain, secretary of a mosque near the scene of the riots. ''Most Asians will not go forward to the police when they are victims of racial harassment, because they won't be taken seriously.''\nWith few amenities and few job prospects, many Asian youths congregate on the street, particularly near several virtually all-nonwhite housing projects, Mr. Hussain said. That, and the fact that 60 percent of the racially motivated crimes recorded in Oldham last year were committed by nonwhites against whites, leaves many whites feeling threatened. This has made Oldham an easy target for the two white supremacist groups that began coming here in April.\nOne was the National Front, which, though prevented by the police from marching through town, distributed leaflets and made its presence known in white pubs and clubs. The other is the British National Party, which seized on a racially motivated attack by three Asian youths on an elderly white man this spring to put forward candidates for both of Oldham's Parliamentary seats in the forthcoming election.\n''Multiracial societies are inherently unstable, and creating them in a small country in which some areas are really poor -- Oldham being among the poorest areas of Europe -- is stupid,'' said Nick Griffin, the party chairman. ''We wanted to draw popular attention to Oldham and its problems, and to break through the media's curtain of politically correct silence.''\nIt is easy to dismiss Mr. Griffin, whose party has fewer than 10,000 members, as a mere racist. But some of his points -- that multi-culturalism doesn't work, that native Britons should not be expected to live peaceably with outsiders they are forced to take in -- are eerily similar to those put forward by some Conservatives.\nIn fact, both the Conservative party and the Labor government have used inflammatory rhetoric in an effort to seize control over the debate on asylum.\nLast year, the government enacted a tough new law that replaced asylum seekers' social security benefits with low-denomination vouchers for food and clothing; required that many refugees be held in secure detention centers or dispersed to remote areas far from their communities; and imposed stiff fines on people caught smuggling in refugees from Europe. Still, Conservatives accused Labor of being a ''soft touch'' for asylum seekers, who, they suggested, should be locked up on arrival.\nThe government countered with a plan to alter the 1951 United Nations convention on refugees, so that fewer people would qualify as asylum-seekers and Britain would be obligated to take in fewer refugees.\nThe number of asylum-seekers has fallen slightly in the last several months, proof, the government says, that its policies are working. Still, the issue is not expected to go away.\nMr. Mayant of the racial equality group notes that the government next year plans to put in force legislation requiring all public bodies, from schools to police, to monitor their treatment of minorities.\nMr. Mayant applauds the plan, but said it would not effect change overnight. In all likelihood, nothing will. Britain has no melting pot myth. It expects its newcomers, over time, to assimilate completely, to become ''British.''\nIT'S not entirely clear what, or how long, it takes to accomplish the transformation, only that it won't happen fast. For example, Michael Portillo, a high-ranking Tory, is the son of a Spaniard. Although he speaks with a thoroughly English accent and was educated at Cambridge, his detractors have been known to refer to him, derogatorily, as ''the Spaniard.'' When they are being particularly provocative, they pronounce his last name ''Port-EE-yo.\nNone of this means that race relations are worse in Britain than in America, Germany or anywhere else. But it does suggest that meaningful improvements may come less through sweeping legislation or popular protests than through a deliberate, utterly English process of assimilation and accommodation."}, {"text": "World Briefing\n2001-08-04T05:00:00.000Z\n ASIA \n PHILIPPINES: VILLAGERS KIDNAPPED The military said Muslim extremists kidnapped at least 16 villagers on a southern island and beheaded at least four of them.

Meeting organizers, who also have pledged to help empower women, said loans to the world's poorest people were increasing by 37 percent a year.\nMicrocredit programs make loans for as little as $40 to help poor people with no credit history start businesses. The programs are aimed mostly at lifting up impoverished areas of the third world. A total of 13.8 million people have been granted loans in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. But microloans are also made available in urban areas of the United States.\nPresident Vicente Fox of Mexico, who is scheduled to speak at the meeting, had promised to make microfinancing a pillar of his government's antipoverty strategy. But in the 10 months since Mr. Fox took office, his programs have become mired in bureaucratic missteps and stalled by an economic recession.\nQueen Sophia of Spain and Muhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi president of Grameen Bank, who gave out the first microloans in the mid-1970's, are also scheduled to be at the meeting. Grameen, known as the poor man's bank, helps coordinate microcredit investments for individual and institutional investors.\nThe World Bank has estimated that 1.2 million people around the world live on less than $1 a day, 75 percent of them women.\nFor years, microlending agencies have been criticized for overlooking the world's poorest people in favor of clients who have at least some business experience and basic financial background. Other microlenders have worried that the poorest people exclude themselves because they believe they are unqualified.\n''Too often, the standard in the field is to give loans to people who already have businesses,'' said Sam Daley-Harris, the director of the Microcredit Summit. ''Well, those are not the poorest people.''\nHe added: ''Many programs in the world are good at reaching people who already show some financial performance. But they are not strong at reaching further down.''\nMr. Daley-Harris said there was little more than anecdotal evidence to indicate the effect microloans had had at lifting people out of poverty. But two recent studies showed that microcredit clients in Mali and Honduras were more likely than nonclients to have larger businesses; to see an increase in personal income and food consumption; to have personal savings; and to feel a greater sense of self-esteem."}, {"text": "The World; What It Takes to Stop Slavery\n2001-04-22T05:00:00.000Z\nFIRST, there were reports of a ship off the coast of Benin carrying more than 200 children into slavery in West Africa. When the ship docked, however, only a few dozen were on board. There was speculation that the captain had abandoned the others on some coastal outcrop, or even thrown them overboard.\nNo clear answers about what happened on the ship may ever be known. But the case, and the international attention it drew, threw light on a troubling phenomenon: the modern slave trade.\nThe current definition of a slave, according to Beth Herzfeld of the London watchdog group Anti-Slavery International, is someone ''forced to work under physical or mental threat, and where the owner or employer controls the person completely -- where a person is bought or sold.'' It includes, she said, restrictions on freedom of movement, no pay or very little and no say over hours, holidays or rest.\nBy that measure, 27 million people or more are enslaved today, said Kevin Bales, the author of ''Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy'' and an adviser to the United Nations on forced labor. In contrast, the trans-Atlantic slave trade is estimated at about 15 million people over 150 years.\nIn West Africa, experts say as many as tens of thousands of children are transported from country to country to fill a demand for cheap labor. Around the world, the International Labor Organization says, 250 million children who should be in school are at work instead, many in conditions of slavery in mines, factories and plantations. With another 500 million young people expected to enter the labor market in coming decades -- most from the poorest parts of the developing world -- children will only be more vulnerable.\nMr. Bales and other experts say that unlike those in the 18th and 19th centuries, today's peddlers of servitude seek out not the strong but the weak: women and children. Whether providing labor for the sex trade or the carpet industry, ''You want people you can capture easily and conceal easily,'' Mr. Bales said. ''Child slaves are very, very cheap, and they are disposable.''\nBenin's mystery ship, brought to world attention by officials there, raises important questions. What moves societies to take action against a social or political evil, an industrial danger or even the potential for natural catastrophe?\nSometimes a single event becomes the catalyst for transforming movements. In 1911, a fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in Manhattan killed 146 workers, most of them women trapped in a locked, 10th-floor sweatshop. Those who jumped to escape the flames died on the sidewalk below. Frances Perkins, who became secretary of labor under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, called it ''the torch that lit up the whole industrial scene.'' Decades of labor legislation and reforms followed.\nMORE than half a century later, a chemical company's toxic contamination of the Love Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls led to Congressional enactment of the Superfund law. Last year, after concluding that the international sex trade in women and girls included the trafficking of up to 100,000 women into the United States each year, the Clinton administration and Congress worked together to pass the Trafficking and Violence Victims Protection Act.\nSo-called tipping points are not confined to industry. The recent deaths of 43 South Africans in a soccer-match stampede opened debate there on the safe handling of crowds at sports events. Similar stampedes have changed laws and practices in Europe and Latin America. The most recent earthquake in India, which left nearly 2,000 confirmed dead, prompted calls for an effective crackdown on the flouting of building codes.\nSadly, calamities do not always cause change. Overloaded ferries sink with miserable regularity in a dozen poor countries, sometimes killing hundreds. Shoddy houses, schools and hospitals are still built along known fault lines. A fire not unlike the Triangle Shirtwaist killed 52 last year in Bangladesh, where women sew for less than $50 a month. It was only one of the country's many fatal fires.\nWhat makes the difference between a Triangle Shirtwaist fire and a Bangladeshi sweatshop fire? Officials at international agencies, who in an age of globalization now deal with borderless problems, say critical factors include governmental will, callousness or corruption among local or national officials and the strength of nongovernmental organizations pressing for change (as well as the inability of monied lobbies to prevent it).\nSometimes a single person can make a difference. The late Diana, princess of Wales, focused world attention on the human devastation caused by land mines. The internationally known Senegalese musician Youssou N'Dour gives concerts around the world to campaign against child labor. In Thailand, a popular former government minister, Mechai Viravaidya, did more than anyone to help cut both rapid population growth and AIDS infections with clever public campaigns to promote condom use.\n''YOU have to move forward in a parallel manner on different fronts, and then one of them sometimes produces the breakthrough,'' said Juan Somavia, director general of the International Labor Organization in Geneva, which is beginning a campaign to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, with initial programs in El Salvador, Nepal, Tanzania and West Africa. Most important, he said, is awareness-raising and community involvement. Legislation, labor courts and labor inspections are other forces for change. So are the companies that use child labor themselves, said Mr. Somavia, a former Chilean diplomat. ''A basic element for companies today is image,'' he said. ''That's a leverage.''\nAdd to that market activism. ''This has been done in the U.S. traditionally through shareholder resolutions,'' he said. ''Today it is moving into fair trade initiatives and socially responsible investment funds.'' And a related concept is consumer choice: child labor in India's carpet industry is now monitored by Rugmark, an organization in Washington supported by Unicef.\n''Local N.G.O.'s are key,'' Mr. Somavia said. ''International N.G.O.'s bring attention to the issue because they have access to global media. But local N.G.O.'s make it happen.''\nOpposition to child slavery may be reaching a turning point. From the grass roots up in Benin, Mali and the Ivory Coast, determination to halt the trade has been rising.\n''Benin is a good example of a country that has made good progress,'' said Alfred Ironside, a Unicef spokesman. ''They have developed a system of community watches. The watchdog system has helped to prevent the abduction or spiriting away of some 3,000 children in the last three years. It may sound like a small number, but that's 3,000 kids who didn't end up in something like bonded labor.''"}, {"text": "Reclaiming Kabul\n2001-11-14T05:00:00.000Z\nThe chaotic retreat by Taliban forces from Kabul, and indeed from most of northern Afghanistan, is a dramatic development that did not seem conceivable even a week ago. But the Northern Alliance's triumph does not, by itself, achieve the basic American objective of defeating the Taliban and destroying the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. That may require more difficult military operations against the Taliban in their southern stronghold, where the United States lacks a combined Afghan force like the Northern Alliance.\nThe difficulties will be compounded unless a broadly based government is swiftly installed in Kabul and neutral peacekeeping forces introduced. Indeed, reprisals reportedly carried out against Taliban supporters by out-of-control Northern Alliance fighters may undercut American efforts to weaken the Taliban by luring away their supporters.\nThe stunning events of recent days suggest that the Taliban are closer to military collapse than generally recognized. But if Taliban forces manage to regroup in the Pashtun-speaking parts of the country where they still command loyalty, they may be difficult to dislodge.\nIn turning its attention to the fluid situation in Kabul, the United States has to act with great care. Although the Northern Alliance and its president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, are recognized by some ethnic groups as the rightful leaders of Afghanistan, they are feared and hated by others. They controlled the city after the Communists fell in 1992 and carried out violent attacks on their enemies. The United States should step up its efforts in conjunction with the United Nations special envoy to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, to assemble an interim governing authority in Kabul that reflects every ethnic, tribal or religious grouping in the country, leaving out no one with any significant power base.\nIn coming weeks, the outside powers that have taken an interest in Afghanistan must rapidly put together a multinational force that could establish security in Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan. This process has begun under the prompting of Russia, the United States and Afghanistan's six neighboring countries. Such a force should receive authorization by the United Nations Security Council and be composed of what Secretary of State Colin Powell calls ''a coalition of the willing,'' led by troops from Islamic countries, such as Turkey, Bangladesh and Indonesia.\nTo prevent a repetition of past cycles of violent reprisals, the United States, Russia, India and other countries that have supported the Northern Alliance must exert pressure on its commanders to exercise restraint on the ground in Kabul and other areas it has seized. The chain of command is weak in some places, nonexistent in others. But the entire international community must make it clear that a bloodbath in Afghanistan will destroy any chances of bringing unity to the country.\nFinally, the other urgent priority is to speed relief to Afghans in the country's mountains and deserts who have been suffering for years from war, drought and repression. Airlifts and truck convoys can bring food to these areas more easily because of the Northern Alliance's extraordinary victory in Kabul. Ultimately, saving the lives of the innocent in Afghanistan is the best way to save its stability and future peace."}, {"text": "The Future of Afghanistan\n2001-10-15T05:00:00.000Z\nNow that President Bush has committed himself to building a stable Afghanistan after military actions there end, the United States must come up with a workable plan. Mr. Bush and his aides began discussing options last week. Stabilizing Afghanistan will not be easy, given the divisions there and the lack of an international consensus about future governance of the country. Success is more likely if three basic principles are respected. No government should be imposed from outside. All the country's major ethnic, language and religious groups must be fairly represented. Political and economic reconstruction efforts will require sustained international support.\nAfghanistan's recent history underscores the difficulties. Moscow's efforts to impose a Communist government in the decade after its 1979 invasion failed disastrously. America's error was to leave the war-torn country to its own resources after Soviet troops withdrew in 1989. The guerrillas who had defeated Moscow with American assistance quickly began fighting one another, letting the country slide into anarchy and opening the way for the Taliban.\nThe Taliban government is narrowly rooted in the Pashtun ethnic group. Though this is the country's largest single group, less than half the overall population is Pashtun. In northern areas, where Persian-speakers and other non-Pashtun elements predominate, civil war has continued. The anti-Taliban Northern Alliance is also too narrow to rule the country, and America has had to calibrate its air strikes to slow the alliance's advance toward Kabul until a broader national coalition can be established.\nWashington and Moscow appear to have learned from their past mistakes and are now supporting United Nations attempts to bring a broad range of Afghan factions together. The U.N.'s special representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, has good relations with most of the country's main groups. In the past, his efforts have not been supported by Pakistan, which felt more secure with the Taliban monopolizing power. But Pakistan has now distanced itself from the Taliban leadership.\nIf Mr. Brahimi succeeds in creating political unity, the next step will be recruiting an effective administration to manage day-to-day challenges like replenishing food supplies, rebuilding the educational system and reviving the economy. To prevent the return of internal conflict, an international military force of some kind, under U.N. auspices, will be needed. Ideally, it should be drawn from Muslim countries not bordering on Afghanistan, like Turkey, Morocco and Bangladesh. Washington should be willing to help finance this international effort. The $320 million in direct American aid to the Afghan people Mr. Bush announced last week is a good start.\nConstructing a new government in Afghanistan must await the collapse of the Taliban regime, but Mr. Bush and his aides are right to start planning."}, {"text": "Kuala Lumpur Journal; On Muslim Soil, a Lesser Fear of Great Heights\n2001-10-22T05:00:00.000Z\nJan Schouten peered down from the sky-bridge at the Petronas Towers, 557 feet above the street. The view from part-way up the world's tallest buildings was dazzling -- a magic-carpet ride over the Moorish domes and minarets of this Southeast Asian city.\nBut Mr. Schouten's thoughts were on the other twin towers.\n''I was going to take my wife to New York next year to see the World Trade Center,'' he said, riding an elevator back down. ''I was booking the tickets a week before it happened. I still can't believe they're gone.''\nMr. Schouten, a forklift operator from Delft, in the Netherlands, adores tall buildings. He seeks them out in every city he visits, recites obscure facts about their design and holds forth on their engineering marvels.\nOn this morning, Mr. Schouten mused about the fragility of these late-20th-century monuments. Surely, he said, the Petronas Towers, built 24 years after the World Trade Center with the latest in high-performance steel and concrete, could withstand the impact of a commercial airplane.\nA knot of tourists stood awkwardly in the elevator, waiting to reach the ground floor. Nobody answered.\nAt 1,483 feet, the Petronas Towers have been recognized as the world's tallest since 1998, when they squeaked past the Sears Tower by 33 feet. Their completion represented a coming of age for Malaysia, a little country that loves superlatives (Kuala Lumpur also has the world's tallest flagpole).\nThese days, though, tallest is not a superlative to be coveted.\n''We're not giving any interviews because we don't want to turn the towers into a target,'' said Yasmin Abdullah, a spokeswoman for Kuala Lumpur City Center Holdings, which owns the $1.6 billion complex.\nTwelve hours after the World Trade Center attack, the Petronas Towers were evacuated for the first time, because of a bomb threat. While it turned out to be a hoax, the buildings' owners have not taken any chances, installing X-ray machines and metal detectors at every entrance.\nThe fact that a Muslim country is home to the world's tallest buildings is not lost on the people who work here. Many believe religion will prevent the towers from becoming a target.\n''We have to be ready for anything, of course,'' said Abdullah Ali, 46, who works on the 25th floor for Petronas, the state oil company and the building's namesake tenant. ''But our relationship with other countries is pretty good. We don't have much of a problem with terrorism in Malaysia.''\nMichael Teague, a British consultant who advises a subsidiary of Petronas, said: ''I thought about this a lot after Sept. 11. This is an Islamic country; the people who are doing these acts are Islamic. I think there's absolutely no chance of anything like that happening here.''\nStill, Mr. Teague said several of his American colleagues had qualms about coming to work the week after the attacks. ''I kept telling them I feel more safe here than I would in London,'' he said.\nAmong the handful of American tourists who visited the sky-bridge, there was a quiet defiance. ''You can't allow your life to be dictated by fanatics,'' said Len Salamon, 59, a civil engineer from Los Angeles.\nWhile skyscrapers were pioneered in the United States, Malaysia was determined to put an Islamic imprint on the form. Cesar Pelli, the American architect chosen by the government to design the towers, said he based them on an eight-point star, a basic motif in Islamic art.\nIt did not hurt that the prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, sent him a sketch of an eight-point star as a suggestion. Mr. Pelli softened the design by adding scalloped facades between the points. The slender shape and arabesque style of the towers is meant to echo Kuala Lumpur's mosques.\nCritics say the project has not conveyed the message its creators intended. It opened just as the Asian financial crisis devastated Malaysia's economy, making the country's high ambitions look a bit like hubris.\nYet the fetish for tall buildings persists in Asia. Half a dozen projects on the scale of the Petronas Towers are under construction or in blueprints here. Shanghai is building a 94-story tower in its Pudong financial district, while Taiwan plans two towers of more than 100 floors.\nIn Hong Kong, an 88-floor monolith is rising on one side of Victoria Harbor, while a 102-story counterpart is planned for the other side. The project's champions say the towers will form a gateway to Asia's most famous harbor; critics envision Scylla and Charybdis in steel and concrete.\n''Building a tall skyscraper is one of the best ways for an emerging society to prove it has arrived, because not everybody can do it,'' Mr. Pelli said from his office in New Haven, Conn. ''It takes money, political stability, and an economy big enough to fill the building when it's finished.\n''Bangladesh could not build a Petronas Towers. They may someday if they get their act together. But not today,'' he said.\nMalaysia has its act together. But it has been unsettled lately by a debate over how to respond to the American-led military strikes on Afghanistan. Islamic militant groups have called for a holy war against the United States, while the secular government contends that Muslim militants are a threat here.\nPrime Minister Mahathir, a moderate, has endorsed the campaign against terrorism. In a gesture to his Muslim majority, however, he has condemned the war as a futile exercise that is killing innocent civilians.\nThe tug of war between moderation and extremism is evident in the Petronas Towers themselves. Someone has scribbled ''long live Osama bin Laden'' on the wall of the one of its gleaming elevators."}, {"text": "WORLD BRIEFING\n2001-01-04T05:00:00.000Z\nEUROPE\nVATICAN: POPE AND PARKINSON'S\nThe orthopedic surgeon who operated on John Paul II in 1994 said he was concerned about the pope's health and listed Parkinson's disease as one of the pope's ailments.

(Agence France-Presse)"}, {"text": "George Harrison, World-Music Catalyst And Great-Souled Man; Open to the Influence Of Unfamiliar Cultures\n2001-12-09T05:00:00.000Z\nWE all naturally remember George Harrison as one of the cornerstones (but weren't they all?) of the late-20th-century phenomenon known as the Beatles. But for some, George, who died on Nov. 29 at the age of 58, was an icon of another phenomenon, equally influential in shaping the music of today. I'm referring to the world-music culture, which, starting in the 60's, has become an inescapable aspect of our music life. George was among the first Western musicians to recognize the importance of music traditions millenniums old, which themselves had roots in indigenous music, both popular and classical. Using his considerable influence and popularity, he was one of those few who pushed open the door that, until then, had separated the music of much of the world from the West.\nHis close, lifelong friendship with Ravi Shankar was the opening of this new world for George. They met in London in 1966, and shortly after he went to India for a six-week visit. He bought a sitar in Delhi, and not long after it was heard in new Beatles recordings, beginning with ''Norwegian Wood'' from ''Rubber Soul,'' then ''Within You Without You'' from ''Sgt. Pepper'' and going on from there.\nI never met George. But what we shared was our encounters with Indian classical music through Ravi Shankar. My first meeting with Ravi was in 1965 in Paris and, for me, the experience was as powerful, and as important for my musical development, as it was for George. I, likewise, was drawn to India and, in fact, was in Bombay in 1966 when George was there. He was staying at the prestigious Taj Mahal Hotel where he had begun studying the sitar with Ravi. (I, unknown to Ravi, was staying only a few blocks away in the distinctly unprestigious, but quite comfortable, Salvation Army lodgings.) In Ravi's autobiography, ''Raga Mala,'' (with a forward by George Harrison and many additional contributions by him), he writes generously and quite touchingly of the early years of their friendship.\nThe role that Ravi played in George's life was so important I think a few words must be included about him as well. By the time they met, Ravi was 46 -- an acclaimed master musician who had been playing and traveling in the West for decades. It's impossible to overstate the importance and influence his long-term presence has had for Western music as a whole.\nHe was first involved in the tradition of Western concert music through Yehudi Menuhin, whom he met in London in 1956, and later with many other musicians in the classical field. Besides composing a series of concertos for sitar and orchestra, he performed frequently in chamber music ensembles with his friends. In fact, I met Ravi, Menuhin and Jean-Pierre Rampal in New Delhi in January 1998 when they were wrapping up what was to be their last tour together.\nI can speak personally for Ravi's influence on the ''experimental'' music of the 60's. He was as great a mentor for me as he was for George. He set the musical direction for the first few years of my amplified ensemble, and he has remained a close friend, sometime collaborator and music confidant up until the present.\nRavi's contact with pop culture began in the 60's with Rory McEwan, whom he met in 1963. However, it was George, no doubt, who brought Ravi to a larger public. Ravi writes about the effect of George on his career in the following way: ''I was planning to leave India again in February 1967, for a long, long tour. I had already become well known by then through my classical career and the recitals I had given at some folk clubs, even before my contact with George. But from the Bombay incident onwards'' -- George was recognized by a bellhop at the Taj Mahal, which created a huge uproar -- ''there was such a big flash all around the world in the newspapers connecting him and me, about how I had become George's guru. It was like wildfire, creating such a big explosion of fascination with the sitar that there was a tremendous demand for my concerts. I had become a superstar!''\nAfter that Ravi appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967 (which he seems to have enjoyed). Later he was at Woodstock in August 1969 (which he did not enjoy at all). Still later came the concert for Bangladesh in August 1971 -- surely the most important of these events. Ravi had asked George to help him organize the concert. George, besides writing his song ''Bangladesh,'' arrived with Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Leon Russell and others. Eventually there would be a Grammy Award-winning album.\nBeyond being involved with the music of India, George was sincerely and deeply touched by its culture and religion. Anyone seriously involved with India eventually (sooner than later) will have to take on the whole culture. In my own case it led to an opera about Gandhi (''Satyagraha''), and a lifelong interest in the philosophy, history, art, people, food, et al. of India. My empathy with George comes about through this broader encounter with Indian culture, which we equally shared, enjoyed and were inspired by.\nThis rediscovered interest in ancient, spiritual traditions (mainly Eastern) seems to have swept through a host of artists, writers and musicians at this time. The likes of John Cage, Allen Ginsberg, George Harrison and many others were all deeply distressed and affected by the ethos of postmodern American-European life. It seemed that the materialism of the society as a whole had extended well past the simple consumerism of our capitalist environment and invaded the world of culture itself, producing a plethora of inhibited and cold works of art in the fields of dance, theater and music -- from trashy ''pop'' to intellectual exercises in modernism.\nMy view of mid- to late-20th-century music is born from this experience. For me the great event of the 20th century was not the continuation of the central European avant-garde to its last final gasp. I see the great musical adventure of our time as the emergence of a world-music culture, which crosses lines of geography, race and gender. From this perspective, the impact of George Harrison's life and times has been enormous. He played a major role in bringing several generations of young musicians out of the parched and dying desert of Eurocentric music into a new world. I have no doubt that this part of his legacy will be his most enduring. And not only that. He opened the doors to this new world of music with deep conviction, great energy and his own remarkable clarity and simplicity.\nAnd then, of course, there was the Beatles."}, {"text": "URBAN TACTICS; Translating for Parents Means Growing Up Fast\n2001-08-26T05:00:00.000Z\nDIANA BELOZOVSKY was 13 when she and her parents set out on a complicated getaway from the Soviet Union. At the American Embassy in Rome, the girl's elementary-school English proved indispensable to her parents for the first time.\n''This was very crucial,'' said Ms. Belozovsky, who is now 24. ''They were deciding whether we get to America or not.'' Ms. Belozovsky's parents were not only deaf but also understood no English. The daughter answered some of the official's questions directly and translated others for her parents, using Russian sign language. The official's last question to the girl was whether she would help her parents in America.\n''In fact, I've been helping them ever since,'' said Ms. Belozovsky, a resident of Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, who now works as a sign-language interpreter at Coney Island Hospital. Before her parents learned English sign language, she said, ''I went with them everywhere, from a hospital to a garage or post office.''\nEver since America has had immigrants, children have been translating for their parents. But there is a downside to this custom. Psychologists say that in the long run, the practice may buttress children's self-esteem, but it can also cause short-term stress, embarrassment and psychological and practical difficulties.\nGiven New York's yeasty ethnic mix -- one that the 2000 census has shown to be unexpectedly varied -- the need for interpreters is great. Although a state law requires that translators be provided to those seeking welfare or other public services, they are often in short supply. And in dealing with doctors or shopkeepers or others in the private sphere, non-English speakers are left on their own.\nAs a result, many immigrants come to depend on their children. But when children are their parents' interpreters, sociologists say, the dynamics of the typical family become inverted.\n''The children are forced to act much older than they are,'' said Sarah Martin, a social worker at Mount Sinai Hospital who works with immigrants in East Harlem.\nThe duties can bring great strain. Brian Palmer, associate executive director of Coney Island Hospital, which offers ambitious translation services because its patients speak many languages, recalled an Italian-American teenager who translated for his ill grandmother. The diagnosis was cancer, but the boy systematically omitted the word cancer in speaking to her. ''He did not and could not deal emotionally with his grandmother's diagnosis,'' Mr. Palmer said.\nStress can arise in other high-stakes settings, from the immigration office to the social services department. ''As the child feels increasingly responsible for not being able to solve a problem for the parent -- for example, get food stamps -- he might suffer from anxiety or even depression,'' Ms. Martin said. She told of a 9-year old who was translating to help her mother get assistance for her two other siblings and did not succeed. ''They were simply brushed off by an arrogant official,'' Ms. Martin said. ''But the child felt personally responsible.''\n''I have seen children burst into tears and cry because they don't know how to translate something,'' Ms. Martin added.\nThese burdens add to the children's natural desire to see their parents independent and deep-seated in their new society. Shaleena Khalique, a 17-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh, was shocked when she found out that her mother was being treated unfairly at work because she was too shy to use her rudimentary English. Shaleena urged her to stand up for herself, saying, ''Mum, you know some English.''\nBut for reasons of culture as much as language, many parents still do not assert themselves. ''Look, my mother was 13 when she had her first child,'' said Shaleena, whose family lives in Midwood, Brooklyn. ''In Bangladesh she lived in a village with muddy roads and cows walking around.''\nConsequently, Shaleena spends much of her time interpreting.\n''My mum pulls me out of school all the time,'' she said.\nSocial workers say the stress of translating can make some children nervous and tired at school and neglectful of homework, and when children become indispensable to the functioning of the household, the parents often find it harder to discipline them.\nMs. Martin recalled an 8-year-old Mexican boy who told his mother he had joined a gang. The only thing the mother dared to do was caution the child to be careful. ''There is a feeling among immigrant parents they can't stop their child from doing anything,'' Ms. Martin said. ''Having had to depend on their child for such a long time, they often feel responsible for whatever failure of their child.''\nChild translating can prompt several smaller problems -- including that bane of teenagers, embarrassment. Shaleena, for instance, is not thrilled to interpret for her mother at the gynecologist's. ''I don't want to hear about contraception, Pap smears and other matters,'' the girl said.\nOr consider Anna Gekker, a 15-year-old Russian immigrant whose family lives in Bensonhurst. ''At a P.T.A. meeting, my teacher said I should tell my mother I spoke too much during classes,'' Anna said. An honest girl, she translated the teacher's complaints word for word. But of course, she said, ''I was getting myself in trouble.''\nDespite the drawbacks, child translating carries a few unexpected benefits.\n''I took advantage of it many times,'' said Paul Bolotovsky, 16, a Russian immigrant from Midwood. A favorite trick was to write notes to excuse his absence from school and have his parents sign them, not disclosing the real contents.\nBut there are also more noble satisfactions. At age 8, Polina Rozen, now 17, accompanied her Russian-speaking grandfather to a voting booth. She not only read him the candidates' names but also showed him how to pull the lever.\n''It was a great day,'' said Polina, whose family lives in Staten Island. ''I was the only kid running around. I voted.''"}, {"text": "Travel Advisory\n2001-02-04T05:00:00.000Z\n LEARNING ABOUT SLAVERY, JAZZ AND BLACK ARTISTS \n Presentations on slavery and jazz, and afternoons of storytelling are among Black History Month events in February. \n Every day this month from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., interpreters in the slave quarters of Mount Vernon, George Washington's Virginia plantation, will discuss the lives of the people who built and operated the estate.

The museum, known for its suite of Chinese, Korean and East Asian Galleries, has opened a permanent gallery dedicated to the art and culture of South Asia. \n The new gallery, the Christopher Ondaatje South Asian Gallery (named for the Canadian investment broker and author who endowed the project), explores the geography, history, religions and artistic achievement of the Indian subcontinent. \n The first hall of the 2,500-square-foot gallery focuses on the shared heritage of the region, which includes modern-day India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands. A development time line is made vivid by artifacts: a fertility figurine from 1000 B.C. represents the Indus Valley civilization, while classic Hinduism is illustrated by a bronze dancing Shiva from 13th- to 14th-century Tamil Nadu in southeastern India. Exhibits on sugar cane and Ayurvedic medicine \u2014 a holistic therapy based on local plants \u2014 show the role of natural resources in cultural and economic development. \n The gallery's second hall focuses on personal adornment. In a Punjabi (northern Pakistan) stone relief from the second or third century, Kushan nobles dress as pilgrims to visit a Buddhist shrine. Exquisite miniature paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries show rajas and others in devotional or ceremonial clothing, while jewelry, textiles and armor illustrate South Asia's cultural diversity. \n The Royal Ontario Museum, 100 Queen's Park, is open daily.

ANDRA WHITWORTH "}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FUTURE; Powell Says Muslim Nations Should Be Peacekeepers in Kabul; 3 Offer Troops\n2001-11-13T05:00:00.000Z\nHours before the first reports that the Taliban appeared to be moving out of the Afghan capital, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said yesterday that it might soon be necessary to send an international ''coalition of the willing,'' led by soldiers from Muslim nations, to secure the capital and prepare the ground for an interim government.\n''There is a general deterioration of the Taliban military position,'' Secretary Powell said in an interview with The New York Times. ''Once you start something like this, it tends to start rolling, and they can't stop it.''\nHe said he expected advancing Northern Alliance forces to mass north of the capital, Kabul, within 24 hours. Soon after he spoke came the first reports that the Taliban were leaving.\nSecretary Powell said Turkey, Bangladesh and Indonesia (whose people are predominantly Muslim) have offered forces for an operation that would buttress a ''bridging political structure'' under United Nations control.\nHe excluded the deployment of Americans in this force, saying it would be better to have Muslim countries ''than one of the big-power nations coming in to do it.''\nThe secretary indicated that President Bush and his advisers had marshaled the administration's contingency planning around how to employ such a force with a United Nations presence until a broad-based group of Afghan leaders could be assembled to form a government.\n''Things are moving much more rapidly now than we had anticipated just a week ago,'' Secretary Powell said, adding that help from American Special Forces on the ground was paying off.\n''We've got a first-world air force connected to a fourth-world army -- B-1 bombers and guys on horses,'' he said of the Northern Alliance, ''and what we have done in the last five weeks is sort of connect those two.''\nA still critical factor is the Taliban's hold on southern Afghanistan, and the secretary expressed frustration over the failure thus far to mobilize a rebellion or orchestrate defections of prominent local leaders in the region, where the majority Pashtuns have mostly refused to break with the Taliban.\nMany potential defectors are under military guard by Taliban forces, he added.\nPakistan could also do more to undermine Taliban control, he said.\nHe added that the United States has a number of covert operations under way. He declined to describe them in detail, but said they were intended to foment a weakening of the Taliban's control of the center and south of Afghanistan.\nThese, he said, were ''special sorts of operations to encourage activity in the south that would not be in the best interest of the Taliban.''\nThe proposal for the large-scale intervention of foreign forces was the centerpiece of debates yesterday in the United Nations General Assembly and among delegates from the six nations that border Afghanistan, plus the United States and Russia.\nThis so-called Six-Plus-Two Group endorsed international efforts to fight terrorism, ''in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations.''\n''As things are moving very fast, we need to bring the political aspects in line with the military development on the ground,'' Secretary General Kofi Annan told reporters after a closed-door conference where Secretary Powell was said to have urged great speed in planning international intervention.\nLakhdar Brahimi of Algeria, the United Nations envoy working to galvanize the Afghan opposition to the Taliban, emerged from the conference to say, ''We are going to try as soon as possible to get hopefully a representative sample of the Afghan population together and see what kind of interim arrangements we can work together for Kabul.''\nThough Secretary Powell had suggested that Pakistan could do more in Afghanistan, he praised Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the president, and said he judges him to be ''in a secure position.'' He said the Bush administration was likely to develop a ''robust military-to-military'' relationship with both Pakistan and India while trying to freeze nuclear development in both countries.\nIn an aside, the secretary referred to General Musharraf's requests for American gestures to recognize Pakistan for its cooperation. He said that as he was leaving Pakistan last month, after conversations with General Musharraf about textile trade and debt relief, he told the Pakistani leader: ''General, I've got it right here across my forehead, two words: 'debt relief.' Say no more.''\nSecretary Powell made it clear that within the Bush administration, the debate over whether to use persuasion or force in southern Afghanistan had not been resolved. The accused terrorist Osama bin Laden is thought to be in hiding in the south, and the Taliban has its stronghold there, at Kandahar.\nThough military pressure may be necessary in the south, he said, the momentum of victory by the Northern Alliance and the food, medicine and hope it could bring to the north could inspire Pashtun leaders to accelerate the eventual collapse of Taliban control in the south.\nThese tasks, he said, would not divert the administration from its overall goal of destroying Al Qaeda, the network led by Mr. bin Laden.\n''The president will never, never step away from the goal of finding bin Laden and ripping up Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and all the other places where it located,'' he said.\nHe said he did not know where Mr. Bin Laden was but added: ''I can assure you that every day a great deal of attention is focused on where he might be. He is on the run now.''\nSpeaking with his characteristic self-confidence, Secretary Powell asserted that President Bush is overcoming criticism that the administration had charted a unilateral course in foreign policy by withdrawing or threatening to withdraw from treaties and generally conveying the sense that Washington prefers to go it alone, rather than be encumbered by collective security arrangements.\nThe secretary said that in the Middle East, the administration had absorbed the lesson that ''unless there the hope of negotiations, the hope of a political track to move toward solutions'' in the long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, ''you always have the problem of rolling back down the hill to violence.''\nHe also acknowledged the centrality of the issue to Arab leaders, saying it was necessary to ''remove the level of humiliation that exists in the region,'' reflected in Palestinian grievances, which increase anxiety and aggravate violence.\nInsisting that there was direction and movement in Middle East policy, the secretary noted that President Bush referred Saturday in his speech to the General Assembly to his vision of a state called Palestine -- and caused no great stir. Secretary Powell's own use of the word six months ago triggered an uproar.\nIn his own address on terrorism to the General Assembly, Secretary Powell said the international community had an obligation to find solutions to conflicts that give rise to terrorism.\n''But the war on terrorism starts within each of our respective sovereign borders,'' he said. ''It will be fought with increased support for democracy programs, judicial reform, conflict resolution, poverty alleviation, economic reform and health and education programs. All of these together deny the reason for terrorists to exist or to find safe havens within those borders.''\nSecretary Powell also said in the interview that President Bush is preparing to enter the Middle East peace effort more directly.\n''We are still looking for an opportunity to put down a comprehensive statement of what the U.S. stands for,'' he said, referring to Mr. Bush's pledges to work for a settlement that would establish both a Palestinian state and secure borders for Israel. He gave no timetable.\nWhen Mr. Bush ''sees progress, he will become more engaged than he is now,'' the secretary said.\nHe praised Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for showing restraint in recent weeks, and he urged the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, to work harder to quell Palestinian violence so a cease-fire can pave the way to a return to the negotiating table.\nSecretary Powell said that while he was not aware of any intelligence information connecting Iraq to the Sept. 11 attacks, contacts in Prague between an Iraqi intelligence officer and one of the hijackers, Mohamed Atta, were a source of concern.\n''I can assure you that if there are links out there that we can find and should chase, we will chase them,'' he said. ''There is a high level of interest in what Iraq may be doing in this field because they remain committed to pursuing the development of weapons of mass destruction.''"}, {"text": "Grass Roots Business: Sublime Vegetables for a Demanding Niche\n2001-01-21T05:00:00.000Z\n LOS ANGELES \u2014 Some entrepreneurs dream of ruling Wall Street while others imagine themselves as Hollywood moguls or as the next Bill Gates. But for Harbhajan Singh, founder of Samra Produce here, the quest has been to become America's \"king of okra.\" \n Raised and educated in India's fertile Punjab region, Mr. Singh, 41, came to Southern California in 1985 as a trained agronomist with a master's degree in economics. As a member of the agricultural Jat caste, it was natural for him to think about growing and selling food. He saw California as ideal for growing the kind of Indian specialties \u2014 okra, eggplant, bitter melon, beans \u2014 that he ate as a child. \n \"In Punjab, you can grow anything,\" Mr. Singh said. \"It's like California.\" \n Once he arrived, and with $500 borrowed from his family, Mr. Singh started buying vegetables from wholesalers and selling them to local Indian markets and restaurants from the back of a pickup truck. In the mid-1990's, he opened a 1,400-square-foot stall at the 7th Street Produce Market in downtown Los Angeles and started a small farm in Delano, in the Central Valley. But he found that because of the climate, the region grew only inferior versions of the okra and other produce traditionally used in South Asian kitchens. \n Mr. Singh said he lost that farm, falling heavily into debt, but he eventually found his ideal spot in a hot, dry farming area near Indio, southeast of Palm Springs. Relying largely on credit from his customers, he slowly built Samra into a substantial business. His 150-acre farm grows okra \u2014 a vegetable with a subtle, eggplant-like taste that also makes it popular in Southern dishes like gumbo \u2014 as well as chiles, opo squash and daikon radishes. He also buys from other local farmers who produce vegetables suitable for the growing Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrant market. \n \n HAT area grows the best okra in the world,\" Mr. Singh asserted, sitting in his spacious warehouse in the sprawling produce market. As the business has grown, his space has grown to 18,000 square feet. \n Being the best, he said, has always been his obsession. By producing only the highest-quality produce and delivering it quickly, he could lead a market that was largely ignored by others. \n \"At first, no one would listen to me,\" said Mr. Singh, who arrives at the market at 5 a.m. daily and usually stays past 4 p.m. \"People ignored me. But when I delivered the best quality, they got confidence. Now they see I really am the king of okra.\" \n Virtually a one-man operation in the mid-1990's, Mr. Singh's business now employs eight people. Last year, it had sales of more than $10 million, five times the 1998 total. He sells his produce \u2014 some of it delivered in a company-owned 18-wheeler \u2014 as far away as Vancouver, British Columbia; Toronto; Chicago; the New York region; and London, where there are large Indian populations. \n His success reflects a broader reality in the nation's produce market. As ethnic populations \u2014 and interest in ethnic food \u2014 grow across the country, so do the opportunities for entrepreneurs like Mr. Singh, said Richard Meruelo, president of the Alameda Produce Market, which owns the 300,000-square-foot 7th Street market, built in 1919. \n Mr. Meruelo also owns 600,000 square feet of space in the adjacent area and plans an additional half-million by 2002. He said that most of his clients were not the big produce companies that had been in Los Angeles for generations, but rather Asians and Latinos who ran small businesses with 400 to 20,000 square feet of space and sales of less than $2 million annually. They concentrate on traditional ethnic foods \u2014 Thai, Korean, Chinese, Mexican, Salvadoran, Caribbean \u2014 that are consumed by immigrants and an increasing percentage of the native-born population. \n \"The growth in this business comes primarily from Asians and Hispanics who know what sells well in their own communities,\" said Mr. Mereulo, himself the son of Cuban immigrants. \"The key is to specialize in something.\" \n Supermarket chains like Lucky's and Ralphs, he said, \"know how to sell an orange to the mass market, but these guys sell a special product that is not mainstream.\" \n Immigration from India and elsewhere in South Asia has been rising steadily over the last 40 years; the number of South Asians in the United States and Canada is now estimated at 1.4 million to 6 million, concentrated in several large urban areas. \n Wholesalers like Anuj Patel, who owns Darpan Vegetables in Maspeth, Queens, say that until they met Mr. Singh, it was difficult to acquire a consistent supply of high-quality okra and other vegetables used in Indian kitchens. \"People can tell the difference,\" said Mr. Patel, an Indian immigrant, who says his business has tripled since two years ago, when he began buying produce from Mr. Singh. \"The radishes he grows, the okra, it's like from back home. You have other growers but the quality is not there.\" \n Such concern about vegetables may seem a bit unusual to many Americans. But Mira Advani, a leading Indian food critic in Los Angeles, pointed out that many South Asians are vegetarian. Quality takes on a greater significance because produce makes up the bulk of their diet \u2014 the base for sauces, stews and soups, she said. \n \"Indians are very picky about their vegetables, their okra and their eggplant,\" said Ms. Advani, a native of India. \"Their okra has to be the best \u2014 small and firm. Nothing else will do.\" \n Such demands suit Mr.Singh well. Now the self-proclaimed \"king of okra\" hopes to enlarge his kingdom: he plans to start a farm next year in Mexico and eventually to expand to major supermarkets. \n \"It's basically a tough business, and you win by using your mind and technique,\" he said, with evident pride. \"People don't understand my kind of product. You have to know every detail. Okra and other vegetables are not boring. Okra is not just okra. It is very special.\" "}, {"text": "ON THE CONTRARY; In Genoa's Noise, a Trumpet for Capitalism\n2001-08-05T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE latest protest-riddled meeting of the world's industrialized powers is over, but not before inspiring more unease about the whole idea of these high-level schmoozefests. A single demonstrator in Genoa, Italy, was killed -- in the act of hurling a fire extinguisher at a police van -- and many influential people suddenly began to fret very loudly in public.\nAny death is sad, but it is important not to let this one obscure what these protests signify. I do not mean anarchy, although they may seem to imply that. Nor do they mean the beginning of the end of growing world trade and spreading international development. Hardly.\nNo, the protests are mainly advertisements for the strength of the capitalist democracies that provoke them. These ardent young people, who plan their trips to these conferences on the Internet, carry cell phones and arrive by jet, often without having to stop at customs because of relaxed rules in the new Europe. They are symbols for the wonders of the very system they're so worked up about.\nThe Group of 8 nations are so successful, in fact, that they can spare their young citizens the travails of pointless war, periodic famines or subsistence farming. Instead, capitalism offers them the balm of extended studies lasting well into adulthood, punctuated only by public tantrums over the failure of their imagined utopia to materialize. It's a system so adept at producing freedom, leisure and long life that it gives us ample opportunity to indulge the harmless luxury of ''a nihilist avant-garde,'' as John Updike's fictional novelist Henry Bech called it in noting its absence from what was then Communist Czechoslovakia.\nOf course, this luxury is only harmless while the grown-ups act grown up. These protesters, however, have no coherent idea what they're after. In general, there is talk of a better shake for the world's poor, yet the demonstrators appear to be against the only thing giving the world's poorest nations any hope at all: continued global economic growth, led by import-happy Americans whose purchases help put food on the table from Bolivia to Bangladesh.\nThat is why, young and handsome and idealistic as these protesters so often are, it is important to crush them -- figuratively, of course -- if they won't go home and find other means of exorcising their great guilt at their own good fortune. You may not like the collection of aging white men who, thanks in part to the power of corporations, lead the world's richest nations. But for all their flaws, the economic vision they represent is infinitely more plausible and more humane than the one their critics appear unable even to articulate.\nAnd while these demonstrators mainly demonstrate how wildly successful capitalism has been in the various G-8 countries, their ideas are a threat to the very people they seem bent on helping. The worry is that a few of the G-8 leaders, experienced at caving in to protesting train workers and the like, will lose a little of their fervor not only for international conferences, but also for internationalism generally.\nSoon after the Genoa meetings ended last month, for instance, President Jacques Chirac of France said it was time to give serious thought to what was prompting so many people to turn up in the streets. ''There is an anxiety, a concern there,'' Mr. Chirac said. ''We cannot pretend that it doesn't exist.''\nLe Monde went further. ''Public opinion will no longer support these reunions, the violence they trigger and the decisions they produce,'' it wrote. ''It is time to review the formula.''\nBut how can it be bad that some of the world's leaders meet? And what about the hundreds of millions of people around the world who benefit from the decisions that come from these sessions? For the world's downtrodden, the rise of global trade and investment is the best hope not just for a better life but also for greater human rights, political power and a more peaceful world. The other things that have been tried so far, like collectivized agriculture and huge foreign loans, are part of a litany of failures with side effects too vast to enumerate here.\nAll we need now are Western leaders with the guts to act on what they already know."}, {"text": "It Came. It Clucked. It Conquered.\n2001-03-21T05:00:00.000Z\nONE day in the dead of winter, I looked out my back window and saw a chicken. It was jet black with a crimson wattle, and it seemed unaware that it was in New York City. In classic barnyard fashion, it was scratching and pecking and clucking.\nI looked closer, blinked a few times and shrugged off the apparition. Birds come and go. Usually they're pigeons, not chickens, but like other birds, this one had wings and would probably use them. Or so I thought.\nTwo months later it's still there. Not only is it still there, but I'm also feeding it, and it's feeding me, at the rate of five eggs a week. I have made the transition from homeowner to farmer, from food consumer to food producer. All because of one mysterious chicken that came and wouldn't leave.\nThe protagonist of this story has no name. It is known simply as the Chicken, a nonname that seems right, considering its obscure origins. How it came to a small backyard in Astoria, Queens, remains a matter of conjecture. The chicken made its first appearance next door, home to a multitude of cabdrivers from Bangladesh. My wife, Nancy, and I decided that they had bought the chicken and were fattening it for a feast. That hypothesis fell into doubt when the chicken hopped the fence and began roaming around our yard. It began pacing the perimeter of the yard with a proprietary air, sizing things up with a shiny, appraising eye that said, I've seen better, but I've seen worse.\nWe now had a chicken. Very nice. But what next?\nEating it was out of the question. As a restaurant critic and an animal lover, I subscribe to a policy of complete hypocrisy. Serve fish or fowl to me in any way, shape or form, but don't ask me to watch the killing. Once I meet it, I don't want to eat it. Besides, Nancy and I had come up with another origin theory that roused our protective instincts. The chicken, we concluded, had escaped from a live poultry market about four blocks away. It was on the run.\nOur hearts went out to the brave little refugee. Returning it to the market would be tantamount to murder. Eat it? Never. We had to save it.\nBoth of us suddenly realized, however, that we knew quite a bit about the consumption side of the chicken equation, and absolutely nothing about the production side. We didn't yet know whether our chicken was male or female, for one thing. It didn't crow in the morning, and it didn't have a comb, so female seemed a safe bet. But then again, neither of us had ever had to answer the question.\nThe sex enigma was only one of many. Would the chicken freeze to death out there? What do chickens eat? Do they have to live in a coop? Do chickens get lonely without other chickens? Do they need roosters to lay eggs? As I racked my brain for chicken knowledge, about the only thing I dredged up was a piece of trivia: they are easy to hypnotize. I knew this because Al Gore often recalled happy days in Tennessee when he would line up chickens on a porch and put them into a trance.\nA colleague put me in touch with a real-life farmer, Steve Townley of Milford, N.J. He poured balm over my anxieties. ''Chickens will eat just about anything,'' he said. ''They'll eat vegetables. They'll even eat grass.'' Cold, it seemed, would not kill my chicken off. ''They just fluff their feathers,'' Mr. Townley said. A chicken coop, it turns out, is aimed at protecting the birds from predators. If there are no predators, there's really no need for a coop.\nChickens were beginning to sound like the ideal pet. Not a lot of personality, but undemanding. Why doesn't everyone in New York have one?\nThe chicken took to its new surroundings easily. Its main social task was to integrate into the local cat society, a core group of about five strays that we feed. Two of them, enormous gray tomcat brothers called Bruiser and Crusher, dwell in an igloo. They have a strong sense of territory, although they do allow a B-team of lesser cats to drop by for a meal. How would the two species deal with each other?\nOne morning, I looked out the window and saw four cats lined up at their food bowls and, right in the middle, eating with gusto, the chicken. Occasionally, it would push a cat aside to get a better position. Dry cat food from Costco suited it just fine.\nThe cats, for their part, regarded the chicken warily. To the extent that it was a bird, it was prey. But big prey. From time to time, they would stalk, press their bodies to the ground, swish their tails and give every sign of going for the kill. Then they would register the chicken's size and become gripped by second thoughts. A face-saving, half-hearted lunge would follow.\nThe two sides have reached parity. Sometimes I'll look out back and see a cat chasing the chicken. Ten minutes later, I'll see the chicken chasing a cat. When the chicken gets too pushy around the food, Bruiser or Crusher might swat it on the side of the head. I like to think they have reached the plane of mutual respect. Perhaps affection.\nOne day, I saw the chicken writhing in what seemed like a death agony. Four cats encircled it, motionless, their faces a study in mingled horror and concern. This was it, I decided. The chicken was suffering from a terminal degenerative nerve disease. I couldn't bear to watch. Half an hour later, it was fine. It had been taking a dust bath.\nThe chicken showed real character the night that terror descended from the sky. It had already proved itself indifferent to bitter cold and heavy snow. But then it displayed bravery. A police helicopter, searchlight blazing, descended over my backyard, searching house to house for something or someone. I never did find out what or who.\nBut the helicopter hovered, and the downdraft from the blades set our pine tree swaying, turned over a wooden bench, flipped the cat igloo upside down and smashed heavy ceramic cat bowls. The chicken sleeps in the pine tree. I couldn't begin to imagine what was going through its tiny mind.\nThe next morning, amid wreckage out of ''Apocalypse Now,'' the chicken reappeared, brimful of vim and vigor. I looked at it with new respect. It looked at me the way it always does, with a grudgingly tolerant expression. In the bird's-eye view of things, I am the useful idiot who brings food.\nActually, it took awhile to sort out the food. It was nice to know that the chicken could eat anything, but cat food didn't seem right. The bird expert at one PetCo recommended wild-bird seed. The expert at another branch said, ''We have birdseed for specific kinds of bird, but because the chicken is not a specific bird, we don't have any specific food.'' That stopped me cold. It's specifically a chicken, I wanted to say. I ended up buying a bag of parrot food. Finally, I did what any mature, thinking adult male would do in a crisis. I called my mother.\nIt was the right call. Mom flew into action. She drove to the local feed store in La Porte, Tex., and picked up a 25-pound bag of Cargill Scratch Grains, a blend of milo, corn and oats. She began shipping the grain in installments. The chicken, although still keen on cat food, seemed to appreciate the chicken feed, and I certainly preferred seeing it eat grain, especially after the grisly evening when I set out a treat for the cats -- leftover shreds of chicken from a stockpot -- and saw the chicken happily join in.\nIt seems to like variety and resists direction. My impression, from farmers in movies, was that chickens come running when you scatter the feed. This one runs when the cat food hits the bowls, but it looks on chicken feed as a between-meals snack. In any case, it prefers to wander throughout the day, digging here, pecking there and only occasionally stumbling on clusters of feed. In restaurant terms, the chicken prefers a grazing menu, or the tapas approach.\nOur care paid off. One morning, Nancy spied a round object on the patio. An egg. Her eye followed the probable path of the egg and saw a cozy nest at the base of the pine tree. In the nest were four more eggs. They were small, with a color somewhere between ecru and beige, but this was it, the blessed event. Along with the herbs, the tomatoes and the zucchini, we could look forward to an endless supply of fresh eggs.\nBut how did they taste? We decided to put our eggs to the test against two top-rated organic free-range eggs, Horizon Organic, produced by Glenwood Farms in Jeterville, Va., and Knoll Krest Farm in Clinton Corners, N.Y.\nHorizon (motto: ''A Clean-Living Chicken Makes Real Good Eggs!'') uses no antibiotics, pesticides or hormones, and its chickens live in ''a healthy cage-free, free-roaming environment.''\nKnoll Krest, similarly, boasts that its chickens are fed natural ingredients without antibiotics or hormones, and that, further, the eggs are hand-gathered from ''free running'' hens. Does this mean that the Knoll Krest chickens are more energetic than Horizon's? When does roaming accelerate into running? In any case, my eggs certainly qualified as organic, and my chicken both roams and runs.\nI ate the eggs in hard-boiled form and fried in a little butter. The Horizon eggs, dark brown and preciously packaged in a tricky double-layer clear-plastic carton, had a caf\u00e9 au lait shell and a pale yellow yolk. The Knoll Krest eggs were white and varying shades of brown, from pale beige to mahogany with speckles. Both were enormous compared with mine, which had a thick shell and a bright, large yellow-orange yolk, which took up nearly three-quarters of the egg.\nHorizon came in third. Some of the yolks had slightly metallic flavors, with a hint of fish. Knoll Krest was very good, with a richer, cleaner-tasting yolk. But the chicken, I have to report, carried the day. The gradations of egg flavor are very subtle, which means that freshness can easily tilt the balance. And when it comes to freshness, well, the competition was over before it began. Horizon and Knoll Krest yolks turned slightly dry and mealy with cooking, while my yolks stayed fluffy and moist. The whites had not a hint of rubberiness. No contest.\nAnd now that production is in full swing, I can count on five or six eggs a week, although there have been factory rejects. One egg was quail size. Another had a strange squiggle on top, like soft ice cream. But on balance, the chicken has been a consistent, high-quality producer.\nIt says something about New York that no one in the neighborhood seems to think it's odd to have a chicken in the backyard. People have noticed. But they don't pay much attention. After all, it could be a snarling, frothing pit bull. In the scheme of things, a chicken blends in. And it certainly settles one age-old question. It's the chicken that came first. Then came the egg."}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MONEY TRAIL; F.B.I. Raids 2 of the Biggest Muslim Charities; Assets of One Are Seized\n2001-12-15T05:00:00.000Z\nF.B.I. agents raided the offices of two of the nation's largest Muslim charities today in what Bush administration officials described as a broadening of its campaign to shut a financial pipeline to terrorist groups overseas.\nThe government announced few details about the raids on the charities, the Global Relief Foundation and the Benevolence International Foundation, both of Illinois, and refused to say what terrorist groups might be linked to them. The Federal Bureau of Investigation would not say what information it seized.\nLast week, federal law enforcement agents froze the assets and searched the office of another large Muslim charity, the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, in Richardson, Tex. In that case, the government detailed its allegations, accusing the foundation of supporting Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has taken responsibility for a series of recent suicide bombings in Israel.\nGlobal Relief and Benevolence International have repeatedly denied links to terrorism. They have insisted that the millions of dollars in contributions that they receive each year are used for vital development and emergency-aid projects around the world, focused on nations with large Muslim populations.\nThe Treasury Department said after the raids that it had frozen the assets of Global Relief, in Bridgeview, a Chicago suburb. A spokesman for the department, Tony Fratto, said in Washington, ''There was coordinated action to block the assets, because this group is suspected of funding terrorist activities.''\nAsked what terrorist groups might have received money from Global Relief, Mr. Fratto would not answer directly, saying, ''This extraordinary action was taken because it's relevant to the health and safety of the American public.''\nHe would not say whether similar action would be taken against Benevolence International, in Palos Hills, also outside Chicago.\nA lawyer for Global Relief, Roger Simmons, said that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Treasury Department had searched the charity's offices this afternoon, as well as the home of its executive director, but that the agents refused to describe the reasons for the search.\nHe said freezing the assets would affect $500,000 in donations in the United States and $100,000 held in Pakistan. Global Relief had total donations last year of $5.2 million.\n''We have nothing to hide,'' Mr. Simmons said, describing Global Relief as a ''truly humanitarian'' organization that has helped save lives in several Muslim nations, including Pakistan and Afghanistan. He noted that Global Relief officials had condemned the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in public statements.\n''I can only give theories,'' he said. ''But it appears that these people are being investigated because they are a) Islamic, b) Islamic charities and c) delivering relief in areas where there are a lot of troubles going on.''\nHe also accused the government of raiding the group's offices and freezing its assets as a favor to The New York Times and other large news organizations that have recently been sued by Global Relief for defamation. ''It appears to be helping out The New York Times,'' he said.\nMr. Fratto of the Treasury Department said the action ''had nothing to do with the independent work of the American media.''\nIn a separate statement, Global Relief said freezing its assets would halt deliveries of medicine, food and other aid and ''risk the slow starvation and gruesome death in parts of the Muslim world that rely on such badly needed aid.''\nThe statement noted the timing of the move, at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, ''when Muslim-Americans are most generous in opening up their pocketbooks to help those in need.''\nSpokesmen for Benevolence International did not return calls.

Terry Fulk, the church's missions pastor.\nBut for Calvary, one of 1,400 churches affiliated with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, the Bowerses were unique. Because they had a special need for a houseboat to carry out their mission in the Peruvian Amazon, the congregation built one for them.\n''It was actually built in the barn of one of our church members,'' Mr. Fulk said. ''It had a couple of bedrooms in it, a living room, a pilot house and a kitchen area.''\nAfter construction was completed, the church shipped the boat in sections to Iquitos, Peru. Equipped with two diesel engines, it served the Bowerses as a means to motor a 200-mile stretch of the Amazon, where they set up Bible study groups and established churches among 56 villages, he said.\n''They were just infatuated with the Amazon,'' said Mr. Fulk, who noted, too, that Mr. Bowers grew up in that region, where his father had also worked as a missionary.\nMrs. Bowers, 35, and the couple's 7-month-old daughter, Charity, were killed after the Peruvian jet opened fire on the Cessna 138 in which the family was traveling. Mr. Bowers, 37, and their son, Cory, 6, survived by clinging to the burning wreckage of the plane after it was landed on the Amazon River. They returned to the United States on Sunday. The plane's pilot, Kevin Donaldson, was wounded in the legs, but also survived and was transported to a hospital in the United States for treatment.\nThe Bowerses worked for the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism, in Harrisburg, Pa. Founded in 1927, it is a medium-size presence among the large number of American Protestant missionary organizations. Among this group, the biggest is the Southern Baptist Convention's International Missionary Board, with an annual budget of more than $257 million and a force of about 4,300 missionaries, each working for a term of two years or more. By contrast, the association has a budget of $23 million and fields 632 missionaries working for terms of four years or more, in addition to having a smaller number on shorter-term stints, according to the ''Mission Handbook'' (MARC, 1997).\nThe association works with Baptist churches of a strongly theologically conservative cast. John Greening, national representative of the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, described it as fundamentalist in the historic Protestant sense -- ''a solid, evangelical, doctrinal position.''\nDr. Greening said the organization emphasized not just preaching and converting people in the many nations in which it worked, but also establishing churches and training local people to be their pastors.\nIn an interview yesterday, Michael G. Loftis, president of the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism Inc., said he did not consider missionary work in the Peruvian jungles to be any riskier than living in some American cities.\n''I would say the chances are far higher in getting shot in an urban alley on one of the streets in America's big cities,'' he said, ''than it ever would be on the back river of the Amazon.''\nUntil last year, Sherry Boykin worked among the association's missionaries in the Peruvian Amazon, upriver from the Bowerses, whom she knew. Despite the hardships of being in a place where visitors had to take great precautions with water and food, living as a missionary on the upper Amazon was an experience of overwhelming spiritual reward, she said.\n''There are very few things in the world you can do and know without any doubt you are in the will of the Lord,'' said Mrs. Boykin, who is married to a professor at Baptist Bible College in Clarks Summit, Pa. She read aloud a passage from the Bible, Matthew 28:18-20, in which the resurrected Jesus commands his followers to ''go and make disciples'' in all nations. ''We take that seriously, and it does not feel like a drudgery,'' she said."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n2001-10-03T05:00:00.000Z\nINTERNATIONAL A3-12\n2 Israelis Die, 15 Are Hurt In Attack on Settlement\nAt least two Palestinian gunmen attacked an Israeli settlement at the northern edge of the Gaza Strip, killing a teenage couple and wounding 15 other people in the most violent assault on such a community in more than a decade.

DHIRAJ SHAH and his wife, Moklesa, didn't ask for a star-shaped house. It just seemed obvious to their architect, Dennis Wedlick, that they needed one.\n''They asked for total equality of space,'' he said, not only for themselves but for their three adult children as well. And when the entire family attended every design meeting and made each decision in concert, Mr. Wedlick knew he had more than the usual couple to please.\nOn a bulging slope of rolling countryside in Malden Bridge, N.Y., about 30 miles from Albany, the six-pointed house, with no dominant front or back, good side or bad, doesn't miss a view. Each room tapers to a sharp point, flanked by windows that blaze with sunlight, while at the center a staircase spirals around a two-story birdcage, the home of two parakeets. The house looks as much like an 18th-century folly as a modern-day response to the needs of five opinionated adults.\nWhen Mr. Wedlick, a Manhattan architect, presented his design for the first time, he never even mentioned the word ''star.'' But he needn't have worried: the family takes innovation in stride. ''Mom's a painter and Dad sculpts, so we understand that you have to give artists certain freedoms,'' said the Shahs' daughter Melissa. ''As long as we got our basic requirements, we figured he's the architect, let him do his design.'' That said, designing for five kept the architect on alert.\nDr. and Mrs. Shah came to Albany from Bangladesh in 1970, and their children, who speak fluent Bengali, make periodic trips with their parents back to Bogra. Dr. Shah is a surgeon and commutes daily to Albany, while his wife is an ardent cook and gardener and also keeps animals. They wanted a house where everyone could be comfortable together or apart.\nThe children -- Melissa, 23, who is studying cell biology at Albany Medical College; Anu, 24, who is studying architecture at Harvard; and Rajanya, 26, an Olympic coxswain, who competed last summer in Sydney -- all spend considerable time at home. Everyone wanted a separate bedroom and lots of common space, including a screened porch and a separate breakfast area, where they could gather for informal meals and family discussions. They also asked for wooden roof shingles and clapboard siding.\nThe 60-acre site had on it a 175-year-old farm with several outbuildings, including two barns. Today, Mrs. Shah paints in one and keeps llamas, sheep, goats, peacocks, and black and white swans in the other.\nIn formulating a design, Mr. Wedlick reacted more to the family dynamic than to particular space needs. He recalled their first meeting, when they all came in together. ''It was quite a presence,'' he said, noting that Mrs. Shah wears a sari and goes barefoot at home. ''Then, they all waited while Moklesa picked her spot. Anu led the conversation, but everyone had their say. There was no apparent hierarchy, but I had the clear sense that it was really going to be the mother's house.'' The birdcage was his tribute to her love of animals.\nMr. Wedlick envisioned ''five equal bubbles.'' ''I wanted there to be something special about the house,'' he said. ''Since the details were going to be traditional, the form could be exotic.'' Flipping through some old design books, he came to a heading that read ''Curiosities and Marvels of the 16th Century.'' He stopped at a photograph of a star-shaped castle near Prague. Eureka.\nMr. Wedlick has designed 40 houses, many in Upstate New York, where his own house, near the Shahs', looks like a tower attached to a wedge of pie. The Shahs had planned to spend about $350,000 (the final price was more like $700,000, but they weren't complaining).\n''People appreciate what I can do on the small side,'' said the architect, who often borrows ideas from the Shakers, a strong presence in this part of New York.\nThe Shahs did their own groundwork. Once they knew that Mr. Wedlick lived in the area, they scouted out his house, peering into windows and admiring his skill at wringing personality from a small space. ''We already knew we liked what he could do before we met him,'' Mr. Shah said.\nWhen Mr. Wedlick presented his idea for a star, he kept his head down and waited for their reaction. ''If you look like you think it's weird, then the client is going to think something's wrong,'' he said. No one objected. In fact, they were pleased. ''We never told him we didn't want an average house,'' Dr. Shah said. ''It was lucky that he figured it out.''\nOn a recent tour, a visitor was attended by four of the five Shahs, plus a large dog with tiny bells around its neck. As everyone sat down to a tandoori chicken lunch, the family laughed at the notion of presenting their architect with a united front.\nThere was plenty of friction behind the scenes. ''We shouted and screamed it out over every little detail,'' Mr. Shah said. ''So that the next time we met, it was all worked out. We respected him enough to take care of a lot of the headaches ourselves.''\nChief among their worries was the notion that the triangular rooms would end up being small, despite the house having 3,500 square feet of space. So they took string and measured out each space on the grass to make sure their furniture would fit. ''We were pleasantly surprised,'' Mrs. Shah said. ''It's smaller than our last house, but there's less wasted space.''\nThe six-pointed star, in fact, serves the Shahs well. Because the shape basically consists of one triangle angled on top of another, the entrance is no more than a flat facade with a pointed porch jutting out. Entering, a visitor is not unduly aware that the house is a star; it is possible to look straight through the spiral staircase and the enormous birdcage to the back porch. The rooms feel cozy and flow easily, partly because the next room is always in sight.\nApart from the star points, there are no corners, creating the sensation of continuously expanding space. Which is why the family can brag about being able to entertain more than 100 people at once. Within the points of the stars, Mrs. Shah has put thriving plants and, in the dining room, a grand piano.\nUpstairs, four of the triangles are bedrooms and two provide space for three bathrooms. Dr. and Mrs. Shah have two triangles for their bedroom and bath, while the two daughters have combined their spaces into a suite with a shared bathroom. The effect upstairs can be mildly disorienting. ''I never know what room is underneath the one I'm in,'' Melissa Shah said.\nAngles abound. The roof is steep, creating sharp cathedral ceilings for the bedrooms. Closets slice into the pure geometry of the triangular floor plan. It all begins to look like origami.\nThe house's unusual shape affords 360-degree views of hills and streams, the barns, a new greenhouse, a lotus pond now frozen over and a quiet country road diving around a turn (one reason star shapes make efficient fortresses).\nMost of the furnishings, a mix of Asian and contemporary, were bought in New York City. The birdcage was custom-made by a local metal artist, who attached an old farm pulley to it so that the cage could be lowered for cleaning. (Mrs. Shah actually wanted an aquarium, but the rest of the family overruled her.) The parakeets fill the house with pleasant squawks, conveniently piping down when the stairwell light is doused.\nConstruction was straightforward, though several contractors didn't even want to attempt it. Mr. Wedlick explained that once the first wedge was mastered, it could be easily replicated. Their contractor, Larry Cavagnaro, kept asking them, ''Are you sure you want to do this?''\nTo create the impression of an established compound, the architect moved several outbuildings from their original locations closer to the house. ''I wanted it to look like we'd built on top of the old foundations of a farmhouse,'' Mr. Wedlick said.\nFriends sometimes ask the Shahs if the star shape has special significance in Bangladesh. Not really.\nGathered at the breakfast table -- carefully positioned to take advantage of the very best views -- the Shahs shrug off the suggestion of Eastern influences. Mr. Wedlick, Ms. Shah said, ''chose a shape that fit us -- all of us.''"}, {"text": "A World Not Neatly Divided\n2001-11-23T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen people talk about clashing civilizations, as so many politicians and academics do now, they can sometimes miss the central issue. The inadequacy of this thesis begins well before we get to the question of whether civilizations must clash. The basic weakness of the theory lies in its program of categorizing people of the world according to a unique, allegedly commanding system of classification. This is problematic because civilizational categories are crude and inconsistent and also because there are other ways of seeing people (linked to politics, language, literature, class, occupation or other affiliations).\nThe befuddling influence of a singular classification also traps those who dispute the thesis of a clash: To talk about ''the Islamic world'' or ''the Western world'' is already to adopt an impoverished vision of humanity as unalterably divided. In fact, civilizations are hard to partition in this way, given the diversities within each society as well as the linkages among different countries and cultures. For example, describing India as a ''Hindu civilization'' misses the fact that India has more Muslims than any other country except Indonesia and possibly Pakistan. It is futile to try to understand Indian art, literature, music, food or politics without seeing the extensive interactions across barriers of religious communities. These include Hindus and Muslims, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsees, Christians (who have been in India since at least the fourth century, well before England's conversion to Christianity), Jews (present since the fall of Jerusalem), and even atheists and agnostics. Sanskrit has a larger atheistic literature than exists in any other classical language. Speaking of India as a Hindu civilization may be comforting to the Hindu fundamentalist, but it is an odd reading of India.\nA similar coarseness can be seen in the other categories invoked, like ''the Islamic world.'' Consider Akbar and Aurangzeb, two Muslim emperors of the Mogul dynasty in India. Aurangzeb tried hard to convert Hindus into Muslims and instituted various policies in that direction, of which taxing the non-Muslims was only one example. In contrast, Akbar reveled in his multiethnic court and pluralist laws, and issued official proclamations insisting that no one ''should be interfered with on account of religion'' and that ''anyone is to be allowed to go over to a religion that pleases him.''\nIf a homogeneous view of Islam were to be taken, then only one of these emperors could count as a true Muslim. The Islamic fundamentalist would have no time for Akbar; Prime Minister Tony Blair, given his insistence that tolerance is a defining characteristic of Islam, would have to consider excommunicating Aurangzeb. I expect both Akbar and Aurangzeb would protest, and so would I. A similar crudity is present in the characterization of what is called ''Western civilization.'' Tolerance and individual freedom have certainly been present in European history. But there is no dearth of diversity here, either. When Akbar was making his pronouncements on religious tolerance in Agra, in the 1590's, the Inquisitions were still going on; in 1600, Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake, for heresy, in Campo dei Fiori in Rome.\nDividing the world into discrete civilizations is not just crude. It propels us into the absurd belief that this partitioning is natural and necessary and must overwhelm all other ways of identifying people. That imperious view goes not only against the sentiment that ''we human beings are all much the same,'' but also against the more plausible understanding that we are diversely different. For example, Bangladesh's split from Pakistan was not connected with religion, but with language and politics.\nEach of us has many features in our self-conception. Our religion, important as it may be, cannot be an all-engulfing identity. Even a shared poverty can be a source of solidarity across the borders. The kind of division highlighted by, say, the so-called ''antiglobalization'' protesters -- whose movement is, incidentally, one of the most globalized in the world -- tries to unite the underdogs of the world economy and goes firmly against religious, national or ''civilizational'' lines of division.\nThe main hope of harmony lies not in any imagined uniformity, but in the plurality of our identities, which cut across each other and work against sharp divisions into impenetrable civilizational camps. Political leaders who think and act in terms of sectioning off humanity into various ''worlds'' stand to make the world more flammable -- even when their intentions are very different. They also end up, in the case of civilizations defined by religion, lending authority to religious leaders seen as spokesmen for their ''worlds.'' In the process, other voices are muffled and other concerns silenced. The robbing of our plural identities not only reduces us; it impoverishes the world."}, {"text": "The Same Mistakes After Another Central American Calamity\n2001-01-19T05:00:00.000Z\nEl Salvador is the scene of the 18th major earthquake in Central America since 1990. Again international aid is flown in. Medical and assessment teams arrive from the United States, Europe and Japan. Footage of people digging in debris with hands and shovels is on television.\nThe repeated tragedies could have taught us three simple lessons \u2014 had we paid attention.\n-\nSurvival rates of people trapped in debris can be improved.\nExperience has shown that eight to 12 hours is the maximum lapse for extricating trapped persons, if they are to survive. After that, the chances of finding people alive become negligible. In the 1980 Campania earthquake in Italy, the cutoff point for finding live survivors was about six hours.\nEpidemiologists who pick painstakingly through the mortality data after the event have pointed this out frequently.\nBut however fast international aid is mobilized, it is rarely operational at the site in less than 24 hours. In the recentdevastating earthquake in Turkey, even the local emergency team could not get to the scene of the worst hit areas before eight hours.\nLesson No. 1: Local communities in high risk areas should be prepared to undertake all immediate search and rescue type operations.\n-\nForeign donors should send in aid that is appropriate to the post-disaster situation when it actually arrives.\nThe needs of earthquake victims, three days down the road, are quite different from those on the day of the event. For example, in secondary phases specialized trauma care for crush victims and surgical and orthopedic care for survivors are often required. Food may or may not be. Equipment for clearing access roads is invariably needed, but rarely aid for disease control.\nLesson No. 2: Evaluate the needs correctly for the time when it is expected to be operational, not for the time when the decision to assist is made.\n-\nAid could systematically use the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance for channeling help and identifying needs.\nChronic hand-wringing over aid coordination at the disaster site is a result of too much money too soon to too many groups. The urgency to spend money, preferably in the shortest possible time, seems to overcome rational thinking.\nCritical aid money would be better spent if donors helped the UN office to do its job better and worked under its umbrella. That was the reason it was created by donors in the first place.\nLesson No. 3: Work under one international coordination umbrella. If the office does not function well, it is because we do not help it to function well.\n-\nResponses to the El Salvador earthquake of Jan. 13 unfortunately indicate that none of the above lessons have been learned. It appears that four separate assessment teams are due at the site. Many medical teams have been dispatched.\nEl Salvador has appealed for help, specifically cash, and international aid is imperative. There is little choice but to send in whatever aid one thinks is needed. While countries are willing to pay out generously for disaster relief, nobody has wanted to pay for a facility or network that could have mobilized a regional assessment/response team.\nYet such nearby countries as Mexico, Cuba, Costa Rica and Venezuela are not only culturally compatible but have qualified human resources to provide the immediate, necessary assistance.\nIn Central America, where significant earthquakes occur at the rate of two a year, the importance of training communities to respond in disaster situations \u2014 techniques of extrication, reinforcing of housing, response behavior in schools, hospitals and other public places \u2014 cannot be overemphasized. And it can be done. Bangladesh has reduced the death toll from cyclones through massive national efforts at community-based preparedness.\nMore than half of El Salvador's people live on less than $2 per day, according to the World Bank. Earthquakes usually affect disproportionately the poor in the community \u2014 illegal slum dwellers who cannot ask for housing compensation, women in the informal sector who are unable to claim for lost earnings.\nNatural disasters push people living at subsistence level to the margin, and those living on the margin over the edge.\nCommunity preparedness is the only practical solution for poor countries in high-risk regions. The locals are the ones who can bring any effective help in the first few hours, andit is their capacity that has to be strengthened.\nThis seems less heroic than flying in after the event waving fistfuls of dollars, but it is cheaper and demonstrably effective. We should get on with it.\nThe writer is a professor in the department of epidemiology in the School of Public Health of the Catholic University of Louvain. She contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, {"text": "Master of the Mosaic That Is New York City; Expert Keeps Tabs on Changing Population\n2001-09-01T05:00:00.000Z\nThe chief demographer for New York City lives in Census Tract 274, a bucolic sliver of the Bronx next to Eastchester Bay, where an earlier generation of immigrants raised their children to believe that the sky was the limit but a good son stayed close to home.\nJoseph J. Salvo lives eight blocks from the house where he grew up. He has lived in the neighborhood for almost all of his 47 years -- except for one miserable foray into the suburbs of Washington, where his wife's office was in a shopping mall and he had to drive to Baltimore for salami.\nDr. Salvo is the self-described homeboy in charge of tracking New York's restless eight million people, one of the most dynamic urban populations in the world. It is a population in a perpetual state of reinvention, with newcomers pouring in from Dhaka and Abuja, while others depart for the suburbs, the Sun Belt and beyond.\nHis title is director of the population division of the Department of City Planning, which keeps tabs, demographically speaking, on that enormous and mutable moving target. It is an assignment roughly comparable in complexity to that of a team of meteorologists monitoring tornadoes in the Great Plains.\nThere are Africans on the Grand Concourse these days; where are they settling? The Arab community is growing, but how fast and from where? Egyptian immigration is up. So are births to Mexican and Nigerian mothers around Brighton Beach. There are more Uzbeks in Queens, and they're Jewish.\nThe phone rings constantly in Dr. Salvo's office near City Hall. Some voice on the other end begins: Hi. I got your number from so-and-so. I understand you know everything there is to know about the city.\nThen the questions:\nHow many gay and lesbian couples are there in New York?\nWhat cities have the most Latinos?\nHow far is my apartment from the East River?\nIn Dr. Salvo's head resides a warehouse of facts. More than half of all babies here have foreign-born mothers, he can tell you. About 15 percent of the entire population of Guyana lives in New York. A useful indicator of neighborhood change can be found in travel-agency windows: are they pushing specials to Palermo or Tirana?\nIn the late 1980's, Dr. Salvo's office began noticing Bangladeshis driving cabs. The numbers showed up in the city's hack-license data. By the early 1990's, Bangladesh had surfaced at 14th place on the ranked list of countries sending immigrants to New York. By the late 1990's, it was sixth. (Ireland, meanwhile, had dropped from 12th to 35th.)\nThe number of New Yorkers over age 85 has increased by 20 percent since 1990, Dr. Salvo can tell you. It is possible to predict park vandalism by developing a ''hangout index'' -- based on the number of unemployed high school dropouts, age 16 to 21, as a percentage of the population in neighborhoods in the city.\n''Somebody calls me up wanting to know how many cats and dogs there are in the city,'' Dr. Salvo recalled recently. ''Said they wanted to know how big the cat population was. Was it bigger than the dog population? I said the census didn't get that information, maybe you should call the S.P.C.A.''\nAnd?\n''They got offended: 'Why the hell doesn't . . .' ''\nIt was Dr. Salvo's division that pointed out to the Census Bureau earlier this summer, when it released numbers on Hispanic groups in New York, that the bureau had apparently miscounted tens of thousands of Dominicans, Colombians and others, at least in part because of a change in the 2000 census form.\nIt was Dr. Salvo and his colleagues, too, who tracked down what they said were several hundred thousand addresses missing from the list the bureau intended to use for the census. Including the people at those addresses helped push the city's population count above the eight million mark, producing a financial and psychic windfall for New York.\nThese days, the seven-person population division is deciphering the census data, preparing profiles of the city's 59 community districts, advising city agencies on the implications of the numbers and mapping the racial and ethnic changes that decades of immigration have helped bring about.\n''It's like one big puzzle,'' said Dr. Salvo, a physical scientist at heart, who grew up constructing model rockets and dissecting television sets in the family basement. ''And it's a grand puzzle. You want to take it apart and put it back together and figure out how it goes together.''\nDr. Salvo's parents are Italian immigrants; his mother arrived in 1920, his father in 1951. The family lived in a three-family house in Pelham Bay. Dr. Salvo's father worked in construction, 17 hours a day. Joe, his eldest son, got beat up a lot for playing with chemistry sets.\nJoe Salvo went to Iona College in New Rochelle, then to graduate school at Fordham. He studied the Puerto Rican migration, and at 26 he received his Ph.D. in sociology. He was seen as the ethnic kid who would not leave home; his mentors encouraged him to go to Washington, to make a career with the Census Bureau.\nBut leaving was heresy. ''You're not going,'' his mother said knowingly, the moving van at the door. Dr. Salvo moved to Washington for good, and was back in a year. Having worked in the wealth statistics branch of the Census Bureau, he joined the population division in 1982 and became director in 1993.\n''I have the best job in the world because I have the best subject matter in the world,'' said Dr. Salvo, who learned from a visiting delegation from Turkmenistan recently that his looks would blend in nicely on the streets of Ashgabat. ''Right now, New York is experiencing immigration that is changing its neighborhoods, altering its environment and doing things culturally to this city in a way that we haven't seen for a hundred years.''\nBut change makes people uneasy. That is a lesson Dr. Salvo learned in neighborhoods he knew as a child and a young adult. For years, he said, the universal language there was: ''When are you getting out? Boy, the city's going downhill. See that family that moved in next door?''\nDuring high school and college, he worked as a youth counselor in the Belmont section of the Bronx. He learned to be careful where he took the Italian kids, he said, because they would beat up black kids. He asked why, and he said he was told it was because they were black.\nThe answer to fear of the unknown, he now figures, is knowing. So he makes dozens of presentations a year. If his division can serve as a source of scientific information, it is his belief that people might be less likely to listen to the anxious prognostications and prejudices of their Uncle Tony.\nChange comes in cycles, Dr. Salvo contended. He said the cycles were the same, the people different; but everyone wants the same things. He said the numbers showed clearly how people came here, settled in and worked, how they raised and educated their children, where they went when they moved on.\n''It makes people understand that where they're living is not a strange and alien place,'' Dr. Salvo said. ''It's not a place that somehow has become foreign to them. Because that's how people in neighborhoods interpret it. 'We're living in a foreign country.' ''\nHe said later: ''This is the cycle. It's somebody else's turn now. The process known as New York, you benefited from, and now you're all over the country. The new groups coming in, they'll benefit the way you did. And then, ultimately, they'll yield to another group.''\nOn a recent field trip, looking for clues, Dr. Salvo rode the No. 4 train north through the Bronx to Fordham Road, then struck out on foot, heading east, then veered south down the Grand Concourse and east again on 188th Street into Belmont, once solidly Italian.\nThe Italian presence was still there, but visible mostly in the specialty food shops along Arthur Avenue, now a destination for suburban pilgrims in search of ravioli. That strip seemed almost an artifact amid the evidence that Albanians and Mexicans were rapidly displacing the Italians. Dr. Salvo eyeballed the playground population and checked out the Mexican grocery stores, the Mexican flags hanging in apartment house windows, and the new mosque just a few blocks from Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church.\nDr. Salvo's work, he said, shares something with his hobby, ham radio. He has a 35-foot radio tower in his backyard, with which it is possible to send a signal out over the Atlantic and occasionally connect with astonishing clarity with a stranger halfway around the world.\n''Ham radio and demography kind of go together,'' Dr. Salvo said. ''They're both logical. They're both driven by scientific principles. One is, of course, a hard science much more than the other. One is much more human. That is the connection.''"}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FUTURE; U.N. Seeks Meeting of Afghans to Fill Vacuum in Kabul\n2001-11-14T05:00:00.000Z\nRushing to fill the void in Kabul created by the unexpected flight of the Taliban, the United Nations proposed today to convene a meeting of Afghan representatives quickly to start work on a provisional administration, and to deploy an ''international security presence'' in the Afghan capital until a national force can be readied.\nSpeaking to a Security Council seized with an unusual sense of urgency and excitement, the special United Nations envoy for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, said establishing order in Kabul as soon as possible was especially important because the capital carried ''immense symbolic value.'' He reminded delegates that the failure to do so after the collapse of the Soviet-backed regime brought about a devastating civil war and destroyed the city.\nDiplomats said Mr. Brahimi's plan was certain to receive unanimous approval as nation after nation lined up to endorse it, and the formal vote on a resolution could come Wednesday. An American diplomat, asked if Washington supported the plan, said: ''Totally. One hundred percent.''\nSecretary General Kofi Annan said he was sending a longtime emissary, Francesc Vendrell, to Afghanistan to take charge there. At the same time, Mr. Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister, will work on securing the coalition government from abroad. Mr. Vendrell, of Spain, was expected to enter Kabul as soon as an advance United Nations security team deemed it safe.\nAll those involved agreed that speed was required. Diplomats said delays could cause Afghanistan to be divided into a Northern Alliance-controlled region and a Taliban-controlled area in the south, around Kandahar. ''This is why the moment is imperative,'' said the French ambassador, David Levitte, adding in reference to the majority ethnic group from which the Taliban come, ''We have to show the Pashtun that they have a future in Kabul.''\nOutlining his plan to the Security Council, Mr. Brahimi repeatedly stressed that any plan must be broad-based and developed from within the country to stand a chance of acceptance. Above all, diplomats said, it could not appear to be imposed by victorious powers.\n''The bitter experience of the last 10 years shows that the solution must be carefully put together and be homegrown, so that it enjoys the support of all the internal and external players, and so that there are no spoilers from the inside or outside who would disrupt its implementation,'' Mr. Brahimi told the Council.\nNo political settlement, he said, would survive without a security force, especially given the large Arab and Qaeda bands in the country. ''The pervasive presence of non-Afghan armed and terrorist groups with no interest in a lasting peace will necessitate the introduction of a robust security force able to deter and, if necessary, defeat challenges to its authority,'' he said.\nMr. Brahimi said that the best option was an all-Afghan security force, but that this would require time, so the Security Council would have to consider sending in a multinational force. Diplomats said possible participants included Turkey, Bangladesh and Indonesia, all Islamic countries. Mr. Brahimi in effect ruled out a United Nations peacekeeping force, arguing that such forces were intended to monitor existing agreements and took a long time to set up.\nThe political plan outlined by Mr. Brahimi called first for an immediate meeting of representatives of the Northern Alliance and various exile groups to agree on a framework for a political transition. No venue was decided, but there was talk of Qatar or even Kabul. That meeting would propose concrete steps to convene a provisional council drawn from all ethnic and regional groupings and presided over by someone who symbolized national unity. No one was mentioned, but the obvious candidate was the former Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir, 87, who has been meeting with Mr. Brahimi and Afghan groups in Rome, where he has lived in exile for almost 30 years.\nNext, the provisional council would form a traditional administration and devise a plan for a political transition to take no more than two years. An emergency loya jirga, a traditional national assembly, would be called to approve the program.\nA draft resolution circulated tonight in effect endorsed all of Mr. Brahimi's proposals, though it phrased the security proposals in broad terms, calling on member nations only to ''ensure the safety and security of areas of Afghanistan no longer under Taliban control.'' Diplomats said this would give the United Nations maximum flexibility as the situation evolved in Afghanistan.\nThe American ambassador, John D. Negroponte, noted that only 72 hours earlier, President Bush had told the General Assembly that ''the Taliban's days of harboring terrorists are drawing to a close.'' In addition to giving a full endorsement for Mr. Brahimi and his proposals, Mr. Negroponte called on the Afghan ''liberation forces'' to show restraint as they continue their advance. ''Afghanistan does not need another cycle of revenge and retribution as the Taliban collapses,'' he said.\nMr. Brahimi concluded his long and detailed statement to the Council with a strong and personal plea that the world not abandon the Afghans, as it had before. Though he did not specify when, the reference was clearly to the American abandoning of Afghanistan after supporting the Afghans against the Soviet Union for years.\n''The people of Afghanistan have endured over 23 years of war and misery, and the conflict has spilled over to neighboring countries,'' he said. ''It has threatened their internal stability and placed a tremendous burden on their already limited means. I appeal to all to show the people of Afghanistan that we are not going to give up on them this time and that we are going to show genuine solidarity and real generosity.''\nMr. Brahimi also spoke of the challenge of feeding the Afghans through the winter. He said the United Nations had to ship and distribute at least 52,000 tons of food per month for the next several months.\nReports reaching the United Nations from Mazar-i-Sharif, the northern city from which the Taliban withdrew on Friday, said that it was being torn by pillaging, kidnapping and street fighting, and that 89 tons of food in United Nations warehouses had been stolen."}, {"text": "Two Uneasy States of Independence\n2001-08-15T05:00:00.000Z\nToday is Independence Day, and India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, will speak to the nation from the ramparts of Delhi's 17th century Mogul bastion, the Lal Qila. These days the address is delivered from behind a bulletproof screen. With one prime minister lost to Sikh separatists and a former prime minister to Tamil assassins, Indian security is tight. This year the fear is of a Kashmiri plot. So we celebrate a nation besieged, from without and within, by competing nationalisms. We cannot celebrate that paradox, yet we can hardly escape it.\nThe annual rituals are intended to mark the demise of the British Raj and a return to indigenous rule. But more potently, Aug. 15 marks the sundering of India in the ''Partition'' of 1947. When that sieve of hatred passed across the country, some 15 million people left their homes for good and perhaps a million lost their lives in a process that had widespread international support. And all this before ethnic cleansing became a political term of art. Partition was a superlative event, said to be the greatest mass migration in history. Perhaps it does merit a holiday.\nBut the refugees found new homes, and the dead have been replaced. Today it seems that partition is regretted more for its territorial than its human consequences. For Hindu nationalists, it represents the loss of Akhand Bharat, the sacred quadrilateral of a greater India framed by two seas and two mountain ranges. Certainly the contemporary geometry of the subcontinental map is a less edifying spectacle: a misshapen Venn diagram, with two national circumferences overlapping, ferociously, in Kashmir.\nNext door, in Pakistan, they celebrate independence the day before India does. And they see things a little differently, matching India's ideal map with a similar vision of expansive Muslim nationhood that demands Kashmir -- it is the K in the acronym ''Pakistan.'' These are not reconcilable positions. So it was no surprise that last month's visit to India by General Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, produced no peace agreement. Today the public mood, in Delhi at least, is one of regret that we made such a fuss over the general. ''We welcomed him like a son-in-law,'' people mutter, complaining about the media frenzy. But that frenzy was inevitable, because the general's visit was also an irresistibly sentimental journey.\nWe learned that Pervez Musharraf was born in Delhi and left for Pakistan at the age of 4. His life on the other side ran parallel to the future he had left behind. A missionary school education at St. Patrick's (Karachi) and Forman Christian College, in Lahore -- in Delhi it might have been St. Columba's, then on to St. Stephen's College. His military career was forged in the war years and on the battlefields we know so well: 1965, 1971, 1999, in Khem Karan, in Kargil.\nSo naturally he behaved like a son-in-law. He visited his family's pre-partition home, he embraced the old maidservant -- whose unbelievably felicitous name was Kashmira Bibi -- and called her Maa, mother. Much was made of the fact that he had an (apparently un-Islamic) affection for dogs. And what dogs -- Pomeranians! The emblematic pet of New Delhi's bourgeoisie. We looked at the enemy, and he was us.\nThere's a thin line between Pakistan and India, and it's sticky with blood and tears. We have an insatiable appetite for brutality and reconciliation. It reminds me of Dostoyevsky's Fyodor Karamazov, who destroyed his family and then grew maudlin: ''He even wept. He was sentimental. He was wicked and sentimental.''\nI live in a part of New Delhi that sprang from the same conflagrations that drove General Musharraf's family away in 1947: a refugee resettlement colony called Jangpura Extension. But other conflicts have populated the neighborhood since Mr. Musharraf left. There are Bangladeshis. There are shifting populations of Kashmiris and Afghans who have a long tradition of wintering here, driving up rents when they come, depressing the landlords when they depart. Lately the troubles in their summer pastures have made them a more constant feature and a permanent anxious presence in the telephone booths, calling home.\nI remember the day the Tibetans moved into the flat downstairs. ''Foreigners!'' said my next-door neighbor Mr. Sethi as he watched from his gate. ''They should all be sent back!''\nMr. Sethi was from Pakistan, specifically Lahore. He was already in his 80's when I got to know him, his orbit confined to the locality. Our paths used to meet at least twice a day, and he enforced the ritual of a neighborly chat with a reproachful glance as I passed his gate. I'm glad he did. Mr. Sethi remembered the days when the entire colony -- as Delhi's neighborhoods are called -- was a horizontal enclave of single-storied homes like his own. He told me that our block had originally been allotted to refugees from Model Town in Lahore, and he would reminisce about the spacious beauty of this lost neighborhood.\nOne day I had a houseguest from Lahore, from Mr. Sethi's Model Town, in fact, and he told me that the place had become littered with modern monstrosities just like our own apartment block. I liked the image of a fragment of the map of Lahore being superimposed on Delhi's landscape -- and then erasing itself, in similar ways, in both places. I imagine my neighborhood's original template back in Lahore is similarly peopled with exiles turned stolid house owners, circuiting the municipal parks with their Pomeranian satellites at dusk. And I get sentimental."}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED; A City Under the Microscope\n2001-10-07T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE faces of strangers are nothing new here. Each year, thousands of immigrants are drawn to this old industrial town by the low cost of housing. Others, it is now known, are attracted by the promise of anonymity.\nIn the stunning aftermath of the worst terrorist assault ever to have occurred on American soil, people who make their homes and businesses on these well-worn streets here are reeling from an awareness that something evil had lived among them.\nInvestigators say a handful of terrorists -- believed to have been aboard the planes that slammed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and dove nose first into the Pennsylvania countryside -- came and went from a one-bedroom apartment on one of the shabbier blocks along Union Avenue.\nBut they do not understand how it happened or how they missed it.\n''I'm shocked to some degree,'' said Jeffery Jones, the 43-year-old councilman for the First Ward, which encompasses this area. ''And I'm not sure why but I felt somewhat violated too.''\nThese days reporters and federal investigators are converging on this neighborhood of African-Americans, Hispanics and recent immigrants who speak dozens of languages, combing the gritty streets and narrow bodegas in search of clues and traces.\nIn the days and weeks before Sept. 11, Alfonso Then could be found in his bodega selling Pure Delite Citrus Punch for $1.19, and Walter Winter would be tuning an engine across the street.\nMatthew Faenza might have been filling prescriptions a few blocks away, at McDermott Pharmacy, and Rolando Calzada, whose family fled Cuba with only the clothes on their back, sold upscale Phatfarm sweatshirts in his store, Inner City Blues.\nA group of men from Bangladesh knelt for afternoon prayer in a converted storefront called the Paterson Islamic Mission.\nLife and all its ordinary acts were unfolding on any given day -- while some men in an apartment above the Then Mini-Market were planning how to attack New York City and Washington.\nLong and sorrowful days have now passed since the news spread about who was staying in the apartment at 486 Union Avenue, yet people in this polyglot blue-collar neighborhood are still in a state of disbelief.\nThe apartment building, which now belongs to history, sits little more than a half-mile northwest of the Great Falls of the Passaic, the focal point of the epic poem, ''Paterson,'' by William Carlos Williams, the symbolic heart of this 8.73-square-mile city that traces its beginnings to a plan developed by Alexander Hamilton in 1792 to harness the falls' power for industry.\nApartments here in the Totowa section, on the northwest side of Paterson, occupy two floors of the aging red brick building that rises above the mini-market's yellow awning, wrapped around two sides like a soiled Band-Aid. The white door leading to the apartments is spotted with graffiti.\nIt is here that Hani Hanjour, who is believed to have flown the plane that hit the Pentagon, passed through this door largely unnoticed to an apartment that is seen now as one of the headquarters of the hijackers.\nHow many of the terrorists actually stayed here is unclear, but neighbors have reported seeing Salem and Nawaq Alhamzi, two others on the Washington flight, visiting here as well as Saeed Alghamdi, who was on the flight from Newark that crashed in Pennsylvania, and Mohamed Atta, whose hijacked plane from Boston was the first to slam into the World Trade Center.\nBoth residents and people who make their living along this stretch of Union Avenue say the crimes committed here usually involve drug sales, with the action shifting from street to street depending on when the police crack down. Some remember when the owner of a video store was fatally stabbed in a robbery seven years ago.\nBut the immensity of the crime planned by the men at 486 Union Avenue is of another dimension entirely.\n''Some of them look familiar, but to ever say that they've been in here definitely, you don't know,'' said Pam Henderson, the 37-year-old manager of McDermott Pharmacy, several blocks up Union Avenue. ''I mean, how long did they live here? Chances are they were in here.''\nHer father, Matthew Faenza, 63, a former pharmaceutical salesman from Massachusetts who bought the pharmacy 16 years ago and now employs nine people, described the area as a ''poor working-class neighborhood'' that has changed over the years.\n''It was once heavily populated with Italians,'' said Mr. Faenza. ''And 15 years ago you had more blacks than Hispanics. Now it's there's more Hispanics than blacks.''\nHe added: ''In recent years there's been an influx of Middle Easterners, primarily from Bangladesh, and they have a mosque right across the street. They cause no trouble. They're good customers and not associated with the other groups.''\nMr. Faenza, standing in front of a display window that was covered by a large American flag, greeted a customer, Millege Primus Jr., who was about to get into his car.\n''You feeling all right?'' he asked.\n''I got out of the hospital yesterday,'' said Mr. Primus, who had a kidney removed and had a bone marrow transplant to treat his cancer. ''I used to be fat,'' he said, laughing.\nThen, in a raspy voice, he got serious. ''I couldn't believe the guy was right in the neighborhood,'' said Mr. Primus, a 56-year-old maintenance man.\nBut he added, ''This is a neighborhood for all kinds of people, so everybody blends right in here.''\nThey blend so well that Walter Winter, a 44-year-old Guatemalan immigrant who has operated an auto repair shop across from the Then Mini-Market and Grocery for five years never paid much attention.\n''I talk to the owner of the grocery,'' Mr. Winter recalled. ''He said they go in with 35 cents and ask for single cigarettes. They were very cheap, these guys.''\nA little farther up Union Avenue, the Rev. Joseph G. Buffardi was walking in front of St. Mary's Church, where he is pastor. Ten pots on the wall were filled with yellow mums, which added a brightness to the gritty street. The church, an ochre-colored brick structure in the Romanesque style is more than 120 years old, he said.\n''In the beginning, the first immigrants who were here were German,'' Father Buffardi said. ''And then it went from German to Irish and then from Irish to Italian and now to Hispanic.''\nToday, only about 100 Italian-American parishioners come to mass, he said, and of 1,400 families in the parish, 1,200 are Hispanic. Most of them work in factories, other blue-collar jobs or as domestics.\n''You can't get into the church on Sunday,'' he said. ''They're out in the street.''\nCalling his neighborhood quiet and peaceful, Father Buffardi ''You can see there's not a piece of graffiti or anything ever broken. Hispanics have an enormous amount of respect for their church, so it's nice to have a thousand eyes watching out for you.''\nNo one in his parish lost anyone in the attacks on the trade center. ''Most of my people's concerns are their sons and daughters who are in the military, who are being called up or in the National Guard,'' he said.\nIn Inner City Blues, a clothing store a short distance from the church, Rolando Calzada, 39, wondered how the men who had lived among them could hate America so much after experiencing it.\nHis father and mother brought him from Cuba as child in 1969 with little more than the clothes on their backs. They eventually settled in Paterson, where they took over a shoe repair on the other side of town. They converted it to a shoe store, and then it became Carlos Department Store.\n''Coming from where I come from, and as proud as I am of this country, I hate to see stuff like that as far as these people who don't appreciate being here,'' Mr. Calzada said.\nThree years ago, Mr. Calzada opened a clothing store in the neighborhood where sells Sean John warmup suits, Coogi sweaters and Phatfarm sweatshirts. His customers include members of the Giants, Knicks and other teams as well as Tim Thomas of the Milwaukee Bucks, who grew up here.\n''We've worked hard and my kids are doing tremendously well in school,'' Mr. Calzada said. ''I expect for them to be doctors one day. How can you not love this country? How can you not appreciate what it's afforded you?''\nAs people pondered such questions, the neighborhood was still in shock, said Councilman Jones, because terrorists were supposed to live somewhere else, not on their street, not in their neighborhood.\n''We believed the worst that would happen to us is drug sales or the occasional shooting or Miss Jones might lose her apartment because she was in the hospital,'' he said. ''We had lost sight that we are part of the world fabric and that what was happening elsewhere could easily happen to us. And now we know.''"}, {"text": "CUTTINGS; Making the Most of Free Compost\n2001-06-17T05:00:00.000Z\nIT looked like a gathering of the nations two Sundays ago, on the parking lot of Medgar Evers College in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Only these delegates weren't talking global warming, but shoveling deep, dark compost as fast as they could.\nEvery New York City resident who got there in time (this black gold went fast) was allowed 30 gallons -- enough to fill a large trash can -- from the Department of Sanitation, which had delivered 90 cubic yards that morning for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Urban Composting Project.\n''My friend told me my rhododendrons are dying because my soil is so compacted,'' said a woman in an orange linen suit, having rushed over from services at the Bethany Baptist Church. ''They can't live because I don't put anything in the soil.'' She seemed on a mission, as she gingerly shoveled away, trying not to mess up her pretty dress and pumps.\nA Bangladeshi boy who now lives in Queens, 12-year-old Novel Ahmed was working alongside his mother, Zulhas Bagum, and his older sister Rumena Kabir. ''We have a backyard of vegetables, fruit, flowers, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, green chilies and jute leaves,'' Ms. Kabir said. ''We were going to buy compost from Home Depot when we saw a notice about this on TV.''\nWhile Novel scraped the blacktop for the last crumbs of compost, Ms. Kabir bought a rigid black plastic composter for $20 -- a big discount from the $70 store price -- and the family headed home to treat their garden to this feast of nutrients teeming with micro-organisms ready to work on tired soil.\nEilaine Li from Coney Island and Brent Li from Bay Ridge were helping their clan fill 15 rice bags with the crumbly compost that was headed for their mother's house. ''She needs it for her flowers and vegetables,'' said Mr. Li, as his relatives hefted the heavy bags into their van.\nSome arrived too late, so fast had the garden locusts descended on the pile, and Bernadette Dorvil was literally in tears. 'I came so far to get here,'' said Ms. Dorvil, who lives in Canarsie. ''I'm shocked. I never saw the compost. Just the bare floor!'' She looked so sad that Suzanne Curley, a gardener from Park Slope, handed her one of her own bags. And Daxius Gregory, a composting instructor from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, offered another.\n''You think if I shed a tear, this gentleman would help me?'' asked Rose Butler, who grows blueberries and figs on her fire escape in Bedford-Stuyvesant. She had hoped to load her blue Ford pickup with her allotment of 30 gallons and head down to Williamston, N.C., where she grows a field of corn, collards, tomatoes and squash.\nSuch is the passion compost inspires, and for good reason. If you don't have a compost pile on the edge of your garden, or an indoor worm box tucked in a corner of the kitchen or basement, you are missing out on nature's own fertilizer.\nEntire books have been written on the art of composting and its benefits, from the complex ''Rodale Book of Composting,'' edited by Deborah Martin and Grace Gershuny (St. Martin's Press, 1992) to a paperback called ''Worms Eat My Garbage,'' by Mary Appelhof, who explains how redworms do the job (Flower Press, 1997). A good one to start with is ''Easy Compost: The Secret to Great Soil and Spectacular Plants,'' edited by Beth Hanson, one of the many excellent handbooks from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's 21st Century Gardening Series.\nComposting can create the kind of topsoil it takes nature about a century to create without human help, and depending on how compulsive you are, you can turn your leaves, clippings and vegetable matter from the kitchen (no meat or grease, though, as these attract rodents) into sweet-smelling nutrients in six weeks to a year. A fast ''hot'' pile has equal amounts of carbon-rich material (brown leaves, pine needles, twigs, eggshells, shredded newspaper) and nitrogen-rich material (green leaves, vegetable and fruit peelings, coffee grounds or spent flowers).\nIf you turn these elements regularly, to aerate the pile, and keep it moist but not wet, an army of earthworms, sowbugs, centipedes, mites, beetles, molds, fungus and bacteria will transform this ''waste'' -- which otherwise gets trucked at great cost to a landfill -- into humus, a complex stew of biochemical compounds that can bring moisture, air and nutrients to worn-out soil. It can also protect roots and plants from pathogens.\nTo get interested gardeners started down the fascinating road of composting, try an excellent Web site, www.soilfoodweb.com by Dr. Elaine Ingham, a soil scientist based at Oregon State University, as well as the resource lists in back of books like those mentioned above. Gardens can really thrive with the stuff, and why pay for it when it's sitting right there in your kitchen and backyard?\nMost botanical gardens and county agricultural extension services provide information and maybe even workshops on composting, and some municipalities offer free compost."}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED: POLICY; U.S. Sees Limited Mission In Postwar Afghanistan\n2001-11-28T05:00:00.000Z\nThe United States is seeking to avoid future military obligations in Afghanistan once its mission to defeat the Taliban government and destroy Al Qaeda's terrorist network is over, a senior administration official said today.\nThe official, briefing reporters at the State Department, said the United States expects to be a ''partner'' in shaping the political and economic future of the country, but has no intention of participating in an international security force that would face the task of bringing stability to a country where warlord rivalry is a perennial challenge.\nThe official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said that United States had done enough on the military front by prosecuting the war against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. And he made clear that once the Taliban was defeated and Al Qaeda rooted out, the American military role would end.\n''There's no need at that point for the coalition to still be present,'' the official said. He added that if an international force was necessary, ''I would not imagine that the United States would be a participant in that.''\nAt another point the official spoke of ''some sharing of the burden or division of labor,'' with other countries taking responsibility for security.\nAnother senior official said that an international force could be organized with troops from countries like Germany, Jordan and Bangladesh.\nDefense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has indicated that it was unlikely that the United States would be part of a formal peacemaking or peacekeeping force after Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, his terrorist organization, were defeated.\n''In terms of taking U.S. forces and having them become a part of a semipermanent peacekeeping activity in the country, I think that's highly unlikely,'' he said on Nov. 15.\nDeputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz has said that the Afghan habit of changing alliances makes it a dangerous place for foreigners.\n''One lesson of Afghanistan that we have seen and people have seen in the past is alliances shift from month to month and year to year, and the one thing that seems to unite Afghans over long periods of time is they don't much like foreigners,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said on Nov. 18.\nBut the statements by the senior official today represented the clearest articulation of the administration's intention to shift the postwar security burden to others even as it increases its activity on the political and economic fronts. It also served as a signal to the rival anti-Taliban Afghan factions that began United Nations-sponsored talks today in Bonn intended to establish an interim government and a security structure.\nAmong the options is Turkey's proposal that a security force be created from Muslim countries, the senior official said in the briefing. A classic United Nations peacekeeping force is not attractive because ''there's an understanding at the U.N. and elsewhere that U.N. forces don't do well'' when the security situation is ''messy,'' the official said.\nBoth Secretary General Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi, the special United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, have publicly expressed their opposition to the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force for Afghanistan because it would be too vulnerable to attack. They believe that the best approach is the eventual creation of an all-Afghan security force but that an international force will be needed in the short run.\nUnder the original United Nations plan for the peace talks, they were to have taken place only after an international peacekeeping force had entered Afghanistan. But the Northern Alliance, which has control of the capital of Kabul, has opposed such a deployment aHnd blocked an attempt by Britain to deploy troops near the capital.\nThe Bush administration sees its role as a partner with Afghanistan as it creates a new government and is committed to a vast reconstruction effort that will last ''for years,'' the senior official said.\nOn the political front the arrival of a Russian diplomatic and aid mission in Kabul prompted high level warnings from the Bush administration today that Moscow refrain from taking actions that confer legitimacy on the Northern Alliance and its president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, which is not seen as a ''viable successor to the Taliban,'' as the senior official put it today.\nA dozen Russian cargo planes carrying medical and food aid flew to Kabul on Monday after the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, announced that Moscow was responding to urgent pleas from the ''Islamic State of Afghanistan,'' meaning the Rabbani government, which has been recognized by the United Nations during the Taliban's rule.\nThe Russians also dispatched diplomats for what appeared to be the beginnings of a new diplomatic mission to Kabul, prompting today's warning by one United States official, who said there were concerns about countries ''rushing to establish diplomatic relations with the Rabbani government, which is not seen as viable.''"}, {"text": "Powell Says Muslim Nations Should Be Peacekeepers in Kabul\n2001-11-13T05:00:00.000Z\n Hours before the first reports that the Taliban appeared to be moving out of the Afghan capital, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said yesterday that it might soon be necessary to send an international \"coalition of the willing,\" led by soldiers from Muslim nations, to secure the capital and prepare the ground for an interim government. \n \"There is a general deterioration of the Taliban military position,\" Secretary Powell said in an interview with The New York Times . \"Once you start something like this, it tends to start rolling, and they can't stop it.\" \n He said he expected advancing Northern Alliance forces to mass north of the capital, Kabul, within 24 hours. Soon after he spoke came the first reports that the Taliban were leaving. \n Secretary Powell said Turkey, Bangladesh and Indonesia (whose people are predominantly Muslim) have offered forces for an operation that would buttress a \"bridging political structure\" under United Nations control. \n He excluded the deployment of Americans in this force, saying it would be better to have Muslim countries \"than one of the big-power nations coming in to do it.\" \n The secretary indicated that President Bush and his advisers had marshaled the administration's contingency planning around how to employ such a force with a United Nations presence until a broad-based group of Afghan leaders could be assembled to form a government. \n \"Things are moving much more rapidly now than we had anticipated just a week ago,\" Secretary Powell said, adding that help from American Special Forces on the ground was paying off. \n \"We've got a first-world air force connected to a fourth-world army \u2014 B-1 bombers and guys on horses,\" he said of the Northern Alliance, \"and what we have done in the last five weeks is sort of connect those two.\" \n A still critical factor is the Taliban's hold on southern Afghanistan, and the secretary expressed frustration over the failure thus far to mobilize a rebellion or orchestrate defections of prominent local leaders in the region, where the majority Pashtuns have mostly refused to break with the Taliban. \n Many potential defectors are under military guard by Taliban forces, he added. \n Pakistan could also do more to undermine Taliban control, he said. \n He added that the United States has a number of covert operations under way. He declined to describe them in detail, but said they were intended to foment a weakening of the Taliban's control of the center and south of Afghanistan. \n These, he said, were \"special sorts of operations to encourage activity in the south that would not be in the best interest of the Taliban.\" \n The proposal for the large-scale intervention of foreign forces was the centerpiece of debates yesterday in the United Nations General Assembly and among delegates from the six nations that border Afghanistan, plus the United States and Russia. \n This so-called Six-Plus-Two Group endorsed international efforts to fight terrorism, \"in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations.\" \n \"As things are moving very fast, we need to bring the political aspects in line with the military development on the ground,\" Secretary General Kofi Annan told reporters after a closed-door conference where Secretary Powell was said to have urged great speed in planning international intervention. \n Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria, the United Nations envoy working to galvanize the Afghan opposition to the Taliban, emerged from the conference to say, \"We are going to try as soon as possible to get hopefully a representative sample of the Afghan population together and see what kind of interim arrangements we can work together for Kabul.\" \n Though Secretary Powell had suggested that Pakistan could do more in Afghanistan, he praised Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the president, and said he judges him to be \"in a secure position.\" He said the Bush administration was likely to develop a \"robust military-to-military\" relationship with both Pakistan and India while trying to freeze nuclear development in both countries. \n In an aside, the secretary referred to General Musharraf's requests for American gestures to recognize Pakistan for its cooperation. He said that as he was leaving Pakistan last month, after conversations with General Musharraf about textile trade and debt relief, he told the Pakistani leader: \"General, I've got it right here across my forehead, two words: `debt relief.' Say no more.\" \n Secretary Powell made it clear that within the Bush administration, the debate over whether to use persuasion or force in southern Afghanistan had not been resolved. The accused terrorist Osama bin Laden is thought to be in hiding in the south, and the Taliban has its stronghold there, at Kandahar. \n Though military pressure may be necessary in the south, he said, the momentum of victory by the Northern Alliance and the food, medicine and hope it could bring to the north could inspire Pashtun leaders to accelerate the eventual collapse of Taliban control in the south. \n These tasks, he said, would not divert the administration from its overall goal of destroying Al Qaeda, the network led by Mr. bin Laden. \n \"The president will never, never step away from the goal of finding bin Laden and ripping up Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and all the other places where it located,\" he said. \n He said he did not know where Mr. Bin Laden was but added: \"I can assure you that every day a great deal of attention is focused on where he might be. He is on the run now.\" "}, {"text": "CUTTINGS; A Land Rush for Compost in the City\n2001-06-17T05:00:00.000Z\nIT looked like a gathering of the nations two Sundays ago, on the parking lot of Medgar Evers College in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Only these delegates weren't talking global warming, but shoveling deep, dark compost as fast as they could.\nEvery New York City resident who got there in time (this black gold went fast) was allowed 30 gallons -- enough to fill a large trash can -- from the Department of Sanitation, which had delivered 90 cubic yards that morning for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Urban Composting Project.\n''My friend told me my rhododendrons are dying because my soil is so compacted,'' said a woman in an orange linen suit, having rushed over from services at the Bethany Baptist Church. ''They can't live because I don't put anything in the soil.'' She seemed on a mission, as she gingerly shoveled away, trying not to mess up her pretty dress and pumps.\nA Bangladeshi boy who now lives in Queens, 12-year-old Novel Ahmed was working alongside his mother, Zulhas Bagum, and his older sister Rumena Kabir. ''We have a backyard of vegetables, fruit, flowers, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, green chilies and jute leaves,'' Ms. Kabir said. ''We were going to buy compost from Home Depot when we saw a notice about this on TV.''\nWhile Novel scraped the blacktop for the last crumbs of compost, Ms. Kabir bought a rigid black plastic composter for $20 -- a big discount from the $70 store price -- and the family headed home to treat their garden to this feast of nutrients teeming with micro-organisms ready to work on tired soil.\nEilaine Li from Coney Island and Brent Li from Bay Ridge were helping their clan fill 15 rice bags with the crumbly compost that was headed for their mother's house. ''She needs it for her flowers and vegetables,'' said Mr. Li, as his relatives hefted the heavy bags into their van.\nSome arrived too late, so fast had the garden locusts descended on the pile, and Bernadette Dorvil was literally in tears. 'I came so far to get here,'' said Ms. Dorvil, who lives in Canarsie. ''I'm shocked. I never saw the compost. Just the bare floor.'' She looked so sad that Suzanne Curley, a gardener from Park Slope, handed her one of her own bags. And Daxius Gregory, a composting instructor from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, offered another.\n''You think if I shed a tear, this gentleman would help me?'' asked Rose Butler, who grows blueberries and figs on her fire escape in Bedford-Stuyvesant. She had hoped to load her blue Ford pickup with her allotment of 30 gallons and head down to Williamston, N.C., where she grows a field of corn, collards, tomatoes and squash.\nSuch is the passion compost inspires, and for good reason. If you don't have a compost pile on the edge of your garden, or an indoor worm box tucked in a corner of the kitchen or basement, you are missing out on nature's own fertilizer.\nEntire books have been written on the art of composting and its benefits, from the complex ''Rodale Book of Composting,'' edited by Deborah Martin and Grace Gershuny (St. Martin's Press, 1992) to a paperback called ''Worms Eat My Garbage,'' by Mary Appelhof, who explains how redworms do the job (Flower Press, 1997). A good one to start with is ''Easy Compost: The Secret to Great Soil and Spectacular Plants,'' edited by Beth Hanson, one of the many excellent handbooks from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's 21st Century Gardening Series.\nComposting can create the kind of topsoil it takes nature about a century to create without human help, and depending on how compulsive you are, you can turn your leaves, clippings and vegetable matter from the kitchen (no meat or grease, though, as these attract rodents) into sweet-smelling nutrients in six weeks to a year. A fast ''hot'' pile has equal amounts of carbon-rich material (brown leaves, pine needles, twigs, eggshells, shredded newspaper) and nitrogen-rich material (green leaves, vegetable and fruit peelings, coffee grounds or spent flowers).\nIf you turn these elements regularly, to aerate the pile, and keep it moist but not wet, an army of earthworms, sowbugs, centipedes, mites, beetles, molds, fungus and bacteria will transform this ''waste'' -- which otherwise gets trucked at great cost to a landfill -- into humus, a complex stew of biochemical compounds that can bring moisture, air and nutrients to worn-out soil. It can also protect roots and plants from pathogens.\nTo get interested gardeners started down the fascinating road of composting, try an excellent Web site, www.soilfoodweb.com by Dr. Elaine Ingham, a soil scientist based at Oregon State University, as well as the resource lists in back of books like those mentioned above. Gardens can really thrive with the stuff, and why pay for it when it's sitting right there in your kitchen and backyard?\nMost botanical gardens and county agricultural extension services provide information and maybe even workshops on composting, and some municipalities offer free compost.\nNew York City's botanical gardens also offer compost ''help lines'' and e-mail addresses:\nBronx: bronxcompost@nybg.org or (718) 817-8543.\nBrooklyn: compost@bbg.org or (718) 623-7290.\nManhattan: manhattancompost @nybg.org or (718) 817-8543.\nQueens: compost@queensbotanical.org or (718) 539-5296.\nStaten Island: sibgcompost @erols.com or (718) 273-0629.\nGardeners eager for compost have another chance at a giveway: in Manhattan today from noon to 4 p.m., at the Pier 84 Urban Gardening Festival (south of the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum at West 44th Street and 12th Avenue).

First come, first served."}, {"text": "Generic Medicine for AIDS Raises New Set of Concerns\n2001-04-24T05:00:00.000Z\nRecent offers by companies in India and elsewhere to make low-cost generic drugs for AIDS, and the decision on Thursday by brand-name drug makers to stop fighting South Africa's efforts to import cheaper products, have raised hopes that the medicines will finally reach at least some of the 25 million people infected with the virus in sub-Saharan Africa. But AIDS experts are divided over whether drug manufacture in developing countries is really the best way to ease the crisis.\nSome worry about whether the generic makers are up to the task and can consistently provide reliable versions of the needed antiviral drugs. Products that are less than full strength could promote the growth of drug-resistant viruses. Some scientists also question whether developing countries, or international health groups acting on their behalf, will be able to monitor the safety and potency of the drugs and enforce manufacturing standards. Contaminated drugs for illnesses other than AIDS, some made locally and some from unknown origins, have killed hundreds of people in developing countries in the past decade or so.\nBut other AIDS experts say the situation is so desperate that what matters is moving ahead to make the drugs available, without getting caught up in red tape.\n''I feel a little uneasy in talking about quality,'' said Dr. Stefano Vella, the president of the International AIDS Society. ''There is such a desperate need for drugs. Clearly the quality is important, but it's one of the points, not the major one. This is like saying: 'We need bread. Is it fresh enough?' We need the drugs. From wherever they come they're welcome.\n''My position, and also that of Unaids,'' he said, referring to a United Nations agency fighting the disease, ''is, whoever gives the drugs, thanks a lot. It's O.K. I'm not saying quality is a side issue, but I would address it later on.''\nBut Dr. Mark A. Wainberg, the past president of the International AIDS Society and a professor of medicine at McGill University, took a different view. He said it would be ''far superior'' if the drugs were provided to Africa by the big companies that originally made them rather than by generic makers, particularly generic companies without proven track records.\n''It's not only in the best interests of big pharma to want to play this role, it's in the world's best interest as well,'' Dr. Wainberg said. ''It is ethically imperative to not treat people in developing countries with substandard versions of our drugs.''\nGeneric makers in developing countries may be able to produce good drugs, he said, noting that they are apparently already doing so in Brazil. And Cipla, the large Indian company that is already making some generic AIDS drugs, is highly regarded.\nBut other contenders are not so well-known. Drug-making requires stringent procedures to ensure quality, and at big, established companies, Dr. Wainberg said, ''the quality assurance is already there, and that's vitally important.''\nA recent editorial in The Bulletin of the World Health Organization warned that developing countries face a growing and underestimated threat from ''the rise in substandard medicines with concomitant problems of toxicity, instability and ineffectiveness.'' The medicines come from both local production and poorly regulated imports.\nQuestions of effectiveness are urgent when it comes to AIDS drugs, for individual patients and for public health, because a formulation that is not full strength may fail in the patient and may also foster the growth of drug-resistant viruses that are difficult to treat and that can be passed to other people.\nDr. Paul Volberding, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, said, ''If the costs were comparable or at least beginning to be, I think most of us would prefer to have the same drugs we use here in our patients. That's the ideal world.\n''I think the Food and Drug Administration has a worldwide reputation for the seriousness with which it approaches drug purity and manufacturing standards,'' he added. ''Why would we not want those standards applied in the developing world?''\nSince last autumn, when the World Health Organization, Unaids and other health groups called on drug companies to provide low-cost AIDS drugs to developing countries, 34 companies have expressed an interest in doing so, including 29 makers of generic drugs, some in developing countries. Because of confidentiality agreements, the companies have not been publicly identified, except for Cipla and another Indian firm, Hetero, which both announced their interest.\nDr. Yusef K. Hamied, chief executive of Cipla, which is based in Bombay, said his company was already making six drugs for AIDS, but would not try to manufacture the class of drugs known as protease inhibitors, which are included in some types of combination therapy.\n''Cipla has been inspected and approved by the F.D.A. and Australian and Brazilian authorities,'' Dr. Hamied said in a telephone interview from his home in London. ''We are an approved manufacturer.''\nDr. Hamied said that at least five other companies in India were also making AIDS drugs, including three that sell their products to Brazil.\n''I believe the quality is fine,'' he said. ''Nothing is wrong. We have checked the quality, because they are competitors.''\nHe said that some of the other Indian companies, unlike Cipla, had not been approved as manufacturers by the F.D.A. or similar agencies in other countries. ''But in due course they will be,'' he said.\nBen Plumley, a Unaids official, said his group was working with Unicef, the World Health Organization and the United Nations to evaluate the companies' ability to make the drugs. He said he hoped the evaluations would be finished by the middle of 2001.\n''It's all about quality control and sustainability of supplies,'' he said. ''Our role is to provide information on all suppliers to the governments, and then it's up to the governments, depending on their own priorities, patents and legal situations, to decide on how they proceed.''\nDeveloping countries, lacking safety nets like the Food and Drug Administration, are vulnerable in the world drug market. They may be unequipped to test drugs, and imports may pose a particular threat because in some exporting countries drugs made for foreign sales are not tested as rigorously as those meant for use at home, said Jean-Yves Videau, a pharmacist and the general manager of a nonprofit group concerned with drug safety, the Centrale Humanitaire Medico-Pharmaceutique, in Clermont-Ferrand, France.\nThe risks are real. During the 1980's and 1990's, tainted medicines killed more than 500 people in Argentina, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Haiti and India. In the most recently reported episode, in 1998 in Gurgaon, India, at least 33 children died of kidney failure caused by a locally made cough syrup that was contaminated with a toxic solvent, diethylene glycol.\nDoctors who described the outbreak in a recent issue of the W.H.O. Bulletin said investigators could not find out how the solvent got into the cough medicine. They wrote, ''there are major problems in enforcing pharmaceutical legislation in developing countries.''\nPoisoning outbreaks in the other countries also involved diethylene glycol, and have repeatedly occurred even though its toxicity has been widely known since the 1930's, when a product containing it, elixir of sulfanilamide, killed 105 people in the United States.\nMr. Videau said his group had encountered makeshift ''grass pharmacies'' in the streets in African cities and towns, selling medicines that were said to be antibiotics, but that really contained no antibiotic at all.\n''These products, we don't know from where they are coming,'' he said.\nEven legitimate products can pose problems if different manufacturing methods alter basic properties like how fast a drug dissolves. When that occurs, Mr. Videau said, ''the system of dosage has to be changed.'' The dosing of AIDS drugs is complex to begin with, and could become even more difficult if patients wind up taking products with different sets of directions.\nFor example, Mr. Videau said his group has tested seven generic forms of Lasix, which is not an AIDS drug, but is a widely prescribed diuretic or ''water pill'' used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. The generics were made in western Europe, eastern Europe and Africa. Some dissolved at nearly the same rate as the brand-name drug, but, Mr. Videau said, ''One was very different, and it was purely due to differences in the solubility of the raw material.''\nDr. Volberding said that if different manufacturing techniques changed the way an AIDS drug was absorbed in the body, its potency could be diminished, which would harm both the patient and the community, by encouraging the growth of drug-resistant viruses.\n''The vehicle matters, too -- the starches, sugars, capsules, all the things that carry the active drug to the site where it's actually absorbed, and just to that site and not past that site,'' he said. ''That has a lot to do with manufacturing standards.''\nMr. Videau said that whoever tests the drugs needs complete information on manufacturing methods and raw materials. In addition to changing the solubility and absorption of drugs, different processes can lead to novel impurities turning up in the drugs, and unless the people doing the analyses know how the drugs were made, they will not know what contaminants to look for, and some may go undetected.\nExperts say that generic manufacturers are unlikely to try to make one important class of AIDS drugs, the protease inhibitors, which include the drugs ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenivir, saquinavir and kaletra. Protease inhibitors are expensive, time-consuming and difficult to make. Even a major drug company, Abbott, ran into problems making ritonavir several years ago. The drug was taken off the market for a while, and then returned in a foul-tasting liquid form that was the only way it could be made for a year and a half, until the manufacturing problems were resolved.\nNot all patients need protease inhibitors, but many do benefit from them, and countries that want them may still be forced to depend on name brands."}, {"text": "Dance in Review\n2001-10-31T05:00:00.000Z\n A Trilogy Carefully Plotted \n Random Dance Company \n St. Mark's Church \n Nothing whatsoever seemed random about \"The Trilogy,\" which Wayne McGregor's London-based Random Dance Company presented on Thursday night as part of the Global Exchange/UKwithNY series, presented by the church's Danspace Project. \n Mr. McGregor's technically complex choreographic effects looked meticulously plotted. So did the mixed-media wizardry devised by a team of designers: Ben Maher (costumes), Lucy Carter (lighting), Timo Arnall (graphic animation) and Ravi Deepres (digital films). \n One could wonder if \"The Trilogy\" was really a clearly defined trilogy, for its parts merged without pause. But the production ticked away with clockwork precision. That was why it was initially exciting and eventually rather troublesome to behold. \n The space was enclosed by a scrim on which projections often appeared. Most of the work was performed to a strongly rhythmic taped score by a group called zoviet*france. With its sharp bends and kicks, Mr. McGregor's propulsive choreography for the opening sequences was a perfect match for the sonic agitation. And lozenges and rectangles of light were projected on the scrim. \n Later, dancers forcefully spun and lifted one another. But their physical exertions were contrasted with shadowy spectral images on the scrim. Even though their bodily outlines were clear, these projected figures still appeared to be wraiths. \n Finally, the scrim fell to the floor and the electronic sounds gave way to recordings of vigorous music for strings by the French Baroque composer Marin Marais , including his variations on \"La Folia,\" a sturdy theme popular throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. The scurrying string sounds sent the dancers moving like perpetual motion machines. \n Unfortunately, by this time the thrills of \"The Trilogy\" had begun to wear off for viewers. But the 70 minutes of demanding choreography never tired the cast: Catherine Bennett, Theo Clinkard, Claire Cunningham, Julian De Leon , Laila Diallo, Darren Ellis, Odette Hughes, Niklas Laustiola and Mr. McGregor. \n JACK ANDERSON \n Letting a Pop Idiom Speak for Itself \n 'The Look of Love' \n The Duke on 42nd Street \n Doug Elkins began exploring popular culture and its relation to dance early on, well before the current fusion frenzy. With \"The Look of Love,\" presented on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Elkins stakes a claim for allowing popular art to remain itself. \n The dances in this suite are set to music that suggests young love, both the nai\u0308ve adolescent sort evoked in the intentionally whiny songs of Daniel Johnston and the practiced kind of love that informs the juicier songs of Burt Bacharach . But Mr. Elkins is content simply to let his seven dancers fly through the songs, without much attempt at communicating meanings other than those inherent in the movement itself. The pastel- colored fatigues worn by the dancers, which were designed by Richard Cohen, enhance the light-hearted mood, as do the projections of bright cartoon flowers and eyes and Roma Flowers 's lighting. \n Several of the dances are stand- alone pieces, among them a duet set to \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" and danced by Sharon Estacio and the endearingly scruffy Alexander Escalante. Two bodies spiral, cling and fly at each other like projectiles in the duet, which is seasoned with a touch of kick boxing, to communicate a joyously and playfully pugilistic love. \n The dances look generally desultory at first. Yet \"The Look of Love\" builds to a witty, astute celebration of the worlds of these songs and their very lightness. Mr. Elkins and his fearless and personable dancers \u2014 who also include Fritha Pengelly, Brian Caggiano, Rebecca Chisman, Charemaine Seet and Bernard Brown \u2014 are serious about the material rather than themselves, an important and rare distinction. \n \"The Look of Love\" was presented by Dance Theater Workshop as the opening event in its DTW Around Town festival at the Duke. \n JENNIFER DUNNING \n A Visitor From London Blends India and the West \n Akram Khan \n The Kitchen \n Some things may just not travel well. When Akram Khan appeared on Saturday night at the Kitchen as part of the UKwithNY festival, he arrived trailing prestigious awards, dream reviews and an impressive residency in London, where he and his company are based. But the three dances and short film that Mr. Khan presented were largely a disappointment. \n Mr. Khan belongs to the fusion school of choreography now popular in Europe and the United States . The son of Bangladeshi parents, the young choreographer trained in classical Indian and Western modern dance and is known for exploring connections between traditional and new forms. \n \"Fix,\" performed by Mr. Khan to music by Nitin Sawhney, built satisfyingly from evocative slow movement on a darkish stage to a volcanic outpouring and back to near-stillness. The 15-minute solo served as a showcase for Mr. Khan's agility and cool intelligence. \"Fix\" was drawn in part from the whirling motion of Sufi dervishes, according to program notes. \n Mr. Khan offered two versions of \"Loose in Flight,\" which he danced to music by Angie Atmadjaja in a clever five-minute film excerpt and live onstage in a 12-minute solo. The excerpt recalled Maya Deren 's much better 1945 \"Study in Choreography for Camera.\" The program ended with \"Rush,\" performed by Mr. Khan, Gwyn Emberton and Moya Michael to music by Andy Cowton. The piece ranged the dancers stylishly in and across layers of space. \n Mr. Khan's vocabulary is as yet limited, with bent raised arms an eventually numbingly familiar motif through the evening. His exploration of forms settles for combining rather than connecting or juxtaposing, with a good deal too much help coming from strong lighting designs created with Michael Hulls and Charlotte McClelland. \n But Mr. Khan is young. There is time for him to live up to the claims \u2014 \"New dance territory is being created here\" is one of them \u2014 of his program notes. \n JENNIFER DUNNING "}, {"text": "The Heavyweight Goes In-House\n2001-07-08T05:00:00.000Z\nBENEATH a sign that asks ''What have you done for you lately?'' the cosmetics section of the Wal-Mart store here is a hard-working shrine to eye shadow, face powder, nail polish, mascara and all the other products that help highlight, conceal, enhance and perfume.\nThere are nationally advertised brands like Cover Girl and L'Or\u00e9al, each in its own alcove. There are popular lower-priced brands, like Jane. And then, at the end of one aisle, there is a newcomer: No Boundaries, a line packaged in silvery paper, decorated with brightly colored stickers and bearing whimsical names like Sheeny in a Bottle and Do Me a Flavor.\nThese lipsticks, mascara gels, shimmer crayons and nail enamels, which began arriving in stores in March, are the latest budget-priced, store-brand offering from Wal-Mart, the Bentonville, Ark., retailer that is the world's largest, three times the size of its nearest competitors. All the No Boundaries cosmetics cost $2.74, except for the nail polish, at $1.74. The prices are the same in every Wal-Mart in the country, including the store in Middletown, 60 miles northwest of New York City, where they are lower than all other similar products in the section, including Cover Girl nail polish ($2.46) and lipstick ($4.84) and Est\u00e9e Lauder's Jane lipstick ($3.24).\nAnd No Boundaries products are available only at Wal-Mart.\nWhether the category is makeup or cat food, Wal-Mart Stores is increasingly focused on developing and promoting its in-house, or private-label, brands across the vast acreage of its 2,634 stores and supercenters. The effort is part of a new strategy to bolster profits and assert the company's strength, as well as to attract certain kinds of consumers -- especially those free-spending teenagers -- who might not otherwise flock to Wal-Mart. The agenda was set a couple of years ago under David D. Glass, the former chief executive, and appears to be gaining momentum under the new chief, H. Lee Scott Jr.\nIt could be a smart strategy, one that the company is unusually well positioned to pull off. Many retailers, Wal-Mart included, worry about where their future customers will come from. If a teenager is not shopping in the store by, say, her 19th birthday, chances are that she never will, industry experts say.\n''It is a very, very significant acknowledgment of a major problem on the part of Wal-Mart that they are now going to do this,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail consultant. ''It is extremely critical if they don't want to lose the future.''\nCREATING exclusive products, like cosmetics and apparel, that appeal to teenage shoppers is one reason to pursue a private-label strategy. But there are many others.\nPrivate-label products are highly profitable. They can capture share from national brands and push down prices on those brands.\nStill, putting too much emphasis on such merchandise can alter the character of a store -- and Wal-Mart, like all other retailers, must walk a fine line in terms of its customers' desires as well as its relationships with brand-name manufacturers. On the one hand, all manufacturers want to have their products sold by the biggest retailer in the country. On the other hand, they usually must answer to shareholders, and if they have to lower their prices to compete with a store brand, their profit margins will suffer.\nWal-Mart, which had $6.3 billion in profits last year, appears determined to have all its private-label products be the cheapest in the store. In areas as mundane but essential as laundry detergent, its prices are well below those of the national brands. Wal-Mart's private-label products include store brands, exclusive licenses and, more recently, other companies' brands that it has acquired. And its total sales of these products are rising.\nThough the company declined to make executives available for interviews or to provide details about the strategy, citing competitive concerns, it has been discussing its plans with analysts and retail consultants in recent weeks. Late last month, the company's chief financial officer, Thomas M. Schoewe, said private-label growth meant that Wal-Mart was listening ''to customers for a void.''\nOne analyst, John R. McMillin of Prudential Securities, estimates that private-label products account for 5 percent to 8 percent of the groceries Wal-Mart sells in its supercenters -- discount stores combined with full-scale supermarkets. That number, while growing, is still lower than in the typical American grocery chain, where private labels account for 15 to 18 percent, Mr. McMillin added.\nPrivate-label sales, excluding groceries, in all mass merchandise stores rose nearly twice as much as revenue in the industry -- and, of course, Wal-Mart makes up most of the industry. Such sales reached $6.5 billion nationwide last year, up 12.2 percent, while the industry's overall revenue rose just 7.1 percent, to $62.3 billion, said Dane Twining, a spokesman for the Private Label Manufacturers Association in New York. Mr. Twining added that unit sales rose to 13.1 percent of total sales last year from 12.4 percent.\nThese days, private-label products, often packaged and displayed much more attractively and prominently than the generic products of the past, can help distinguish a retailer that wants to build shopper loyalty. Anyone who develops an affinity for No Boundaries cosmetics must to go to Wal-Mart to get them.\nAnd private-label products are hugely profitable for their owners. There is no middleman and usually no advertising budget, and the manufacturers are often the same companies that make brand-name products anyway. Quality has improved in many cases, making comparisons based on price more likely.\nALL retailers are feeling a pinch these days, as once-euphoric consumers trim their spending, period. While consumer spending has risen slightly in recent weeks, Americans are still nervous about the economy's prospects, as companies report weak earnings and lay off employees. Times like these make private-label brands even more appealing to retailers.\nWhen the retailer in question is Wal-Mart, a behemoth that racked up $191.3 billion in sales last year, double its 1997 total, by being both the largest discount store and the largest supermarket chain in America, a private-label push can have huge implications for dozens of industries.\n''Wal-Mart is being more aggressive on private label, especially in consumable areas and in health and beauty aids,'' said Emme P. Kozloff, a retail analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''They are also being more aggressive about how they present it. It's no longer the stepchild. It's being presented as a solid alternative.''\nStarting in the early 1980's, Wal-Mart introduced private-label products intermittently. But in the last two years it has gone into overdrive. Besides rolling out its cosmetics aimed at teenagers, Wal-Mart has bought the White Cloud toilet tissue brand from Procter & Gamble and has introduced its own detergent under the Sam's Choice label. (The Sam is for Sam Walton, the company's founder, who died in 1992.)\nIt also paid an undisclosed amount in licensing fees to put the Mary-Kate and Ashley label, named after television's Olsen twins, on a line of clothing for preteen and teenage girls that is ''blowing out of the stores,'' Ms. Kozloff said. The line joins an array of other Mary-Kate and Ashley offerings, whose sales to date are widely reported as approaching $1 billion.\nIn the typical Wal-Mart store, private-label offerings abound: Great Value cereal, cookies and pasta, which share shelf space with Kellogg cereals and Nabisco cookies; Great Value potato chips and other snack food alternatives; soft drinks, including Sam's Choice cola and other flavors; cat food, sold under the Special Kitty label; and Ever Active batteries. Many of the food and household products are also sold in Sam's Clubs, Wal-Mart's warehouse stores.\nThe Wal-Mart brand is unfailingly the cheapest one available. In the soft-drink aisle, for example, Sam's Choice cola costs 58 cents for a two-liter bottle, while Coke is $1.07 and Pepsi $1.08 for the same size. The name-brand and private-label products often appear on the same shelf, or very near one another. Sometimes, as in the case of Sam's Choice cola, the packaging resembles a national brand in both the label color and some of the graphics.\nTHE company has said consumers sometimes need to be ''educated'' about private-label brands, but once the education takes place, there seems to be solid results. Sales of private-label food products were up last year, compared with 1999, shareholders were told last month at Wal-Mart's annual meeting in Fayetteville, Ark. When the price of a bag of Great Value cookies was slashed to 88 cents from $1 last year, unit sales jumped 54 percent, the company told investors. If a company like Wal-Mart does not mind sacrificing a little profit, all kinds of possibilities emerge.\nThe company's stores and supercenters now carry 1,259 kinds of private-label products, up 12 percent from last year, Ms. Kozloff said, citing information provided at the shareholder meeting.\nWal-Mart says its private-label products are a response to consumer demand. ''The market has really dictated every move we have made in private-label brands,'' said a spokesman, Tom Williams. ''We create them to improve value to customers, which builds customer loyalty.''\nHe added, ''Some customers prefer name brands, some prefer private-label brands, and many customers purchase both.''\nAny move by Wal-Mart creates ripples far beyond the local supercenter, and the stepped-up emphasis on private labels is certain to affect the nation's consumer-products manufacturers. While most analysts and retail-industry experts contend that Wal-Mart will continue to emphasize low prices on national brands as a means of bringing shoppers in its doors, some say that over time, Wal-Mart could throw more and more weight behind its private-label products, creating a major shift in the way other companies make and market their soaps, soft drinks, cookies, crackers, potato chips, pet food and other products, and certainly affecting the prices charged for national brands.\nIn at least one area, liquid laundry detergent, Wal-Mart's sales of its own brand already appear to be influencing sales of leading national brands. In others, analysts say, prices for national brands can be depressed by the presence of a Wal-Mart brand. Some company executives complain -- though not in public -- that they regularly lose money on the products they sell through Wal-Mart.\nThe giant retailer reveals to the outside world relatively little about activities in its stores. And it is about to reveal even less. In May, Wal-Mart announced that it would no longer make sales data from its cash registers and scanners available to companies that compile such data, saying that the practice helped its competitors more than it helped Wal-Mart. The change takes effect at the end of this month.\nBut Wal-Mart's size alone nearly always means big changes for any retail business it touches. ''I've been to Bentonville, Ark., and it's not the end of the world,'' one food industry executive joked recently. ''But when you get there, you see it.''\nAfter only 13 years in the supermarket business, Wal-Mart this year became the industry leader. ''Wal-Mart has gotten 11 percent of the U.S. food industry by selling brand names cheaply, not by pushing private label,'' said Mr. McMillin of Prudential Securities. But ''now that they are big, now that they have scale, they can do more,'' he added. ''It bothers me, because they are so big and they put a lid on prices.'' Thinner margins on food products sold at Wal-Mart could affect a company's earnings.\nAnd it is not just food makers that are facing the challenge. At an analysts' meeting last fall in Bentonville, one Wal-Mart executive cited eye drops as an example of an overpriced consumer product that the company might be able to correct with a brand of its own, Mr. McMillin recalled. ''They sense opportunities,'' he said, ''whether it's in dog food or in something else.''\nSometimes, it is just a matter of timing. As the economy has cooled in the last six months, more shoppers appear to be turning to private-label products or the cheapest national brands. At the same time, manufacturers' costs have risen, with escalating fuel prices and increases in raw materials, and those costs are often reflected in higher consumer prices for brand-name products. Private-label competitors, meanwhile, remain at the lowest price.\n''We believe Wal-Mart will effectively use its private-label merchandise to fill any value gaps left by vendors who decide to pass on price increases,'' one analyst, Shari Schwartzman Eberts of J. P. Morgan Securities, wrote in a note to investors last month. In that note, Ms. Eberts described Wal-Mart executives as concerned about rivals' pricing, apparently the most competitive in years. ''Weaker consumer liquidity is also being displayed in the consumer's preference for opening price point'' -- the lowest-price national brand -- ''and private-label merchandise,'' she wrote. ''Sales for both are significantly outperforming store averages.''\nWHILE many consumers are skittish about parting with their hard-earned cash, one group -- teenagers -- is less so. But Wal-Mart historically has not been a teenager's primary destination for clothes, accessories and other essentials.\n''One of the problems the stores are having is that teens have been turned off by department stores,'' said Allan Mottus, editor of The Informationist, a trade magazine for the cosmetics industry. ''And as they get older, they are not department store shoppers.''\nPrivate-label offerings seem to be one way to change that, and the Mary-Kate and Ashley clothing brand developed by Wal-Mart, as well as the No Boundaries cosmetics, are aimed squarely at preteen and teenage girls.\nAs it woos teenagers, Wal-Mart has plenty of company. For years, Target has attracted style-conscious younger shoppers with various licensed designs. Recently, it introduced its Sonia Kashuk cosmetics line, named after a professional makeup artist, and even sprang for the line's own television advertisements. J. C. Penney has worked to create a teenage following for its Arizona jeans.\nWal-Mart was relatively late to join the private-label game, said George Strachan, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs. Among the company's first products, introduced in 1982, was its Ol' Roy line of dog food. Since then, there have been apparel lines (Kathie Lee, White Stag, Faded Glory), batteries, soft drinks, tools (Popular Mechanics), and a plethora of other products.\nThe Kathie Lee apparel came under attack when it was revealed several years ago that child laborers in Bangladesh were working on at least some of the products, though sales today are solid. The dog food was an immediate hit.\n''They do these things, and some of them are home runs, and some are not,'' Mr. Strachan said. But for Wal-Mart, the real value of private-label merchandise may be its usefulness in driving down the prices for brand products.\n''If you start devoting a lot of shelf space to a private-label product because you feel the branded price is not providing a good value to the consumer, it encourages the branded vendor to provide a lower price,'' Mr. Strachan said.\nThough national brands are not likely to match or undercut private-label prices -- primarily, they say, because of their advertising budgets -- the presence of a store brand can push national manufacturers to cut their profit margins at the wholesale level. That translates into lower brand-name prices for consumers, set by the retailer.\nCompanies of all sizes, including the consumer products giants, are competing with the Wal-Mart brands. A 100-ounce jug of Sam's Choice Power Clean Formula liquid detergent, displayed front and center in the detergent aisle, costs $3.84 at the Middletown Wal-Mart. Down the row, the same size of Procter & Gamble's liquid Tide costs $5.88.\nA Procter & Gamble spokeswoman said the company was not worried about comparisons, pointing out that Tide has been the market leader for most of its 55-year history. ''We work with Wal-Mart as with all of our customers to help build their business and help build ours,'' said the spokeswoman, Kelly Anchrum. ''We respect their decision to provide additional options for the consumer. We realize that they need to make decisions that go beyond our brands.''\nInformation Resources Inc., a market research firm in Chicago that tracks sales in discount stores, has recorded a jump in sales of private-label detergent in the last three years. In 1998, the private-label share of the market was just 0.5 percent; by the end of last year, it was 1.5 percent. Tide and its variants, like Ultra Tide and Ultra Tide Free, meanwhile, slipped from 37.8 percent to 36.5 percent, according to Information Resources.\nIN the toilet tissue aisle, price differences are equally obvious. A nine-roll package of White Cloud two-ply toilet paper, a brand that Wal-Mart acquired and began selling last year, costs much less than the nine-roll, two-ply Charmin.\nProcter & Gamble owned the White Cloud brand and sold it east of the Rocky Mountains until about 1995, when the company decided to sell only the Charmin brand. Now it finds Charmin competing against its former brand in Wal-Marts everywhere.\nStill, Procter & Gamble is betting that customers will choose its product over Wal-Mart's. ''Value is two things: price plus performance,'' said a company spokesman, Terry Loftus. ''We work hard to get that right so consumers will choose our brands.''\nOther retailers have been building their private-label alternatives as well. At Kmart, licensed brands include Martha Stewart Everyday, Kathy Ireland, Jaclyn Smith and Sesame Street. The company also develops private-label foods and paper products, Michele Jasukaitis, a spokeswoman, said.\n''We see them as a significant and important alternative for customers as far as price is concerned,'' Ms. Jasukaitis said. ''The customers truly believe in our brands and trust them and like the fact that they are affordable.''\nIn such a situation, of course, there are winners and losers. And one expert contends that private-label products often have the edge.\n''For the consumer, private label offers comparable quality at a lower price,'' said Laurel Cutler, a marketing consultant in New York. ''For the retailer, private label means a much higher margin. Who gets left out in the cold? The national brands.''"}, {"text": "December 9-15; FRONT LINES\n2001-12-16T05:00:00.000Z\nOSAMA BIN LADEN -- In a week that marked the three-month anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, United States forces and their allies in Afghanistan penetrated an increasingly fierce circle of Taliban fighters in the mountainous area of Tora Bora and concluded that the cave sheltering Osama bin Laden, the leader of the Qaeda terror network, might be at hand. Suddenly, it seemed possible that he would soon be apprehended -- alive or dead.\nBut Mr. bin Laden could have escaped during bombing attacks that reportedly killed several Qaeda leaders, either fleeing by land to Pakistan or by cargo ship -- Al Qaeda and its friends own several -- to the Arabian Sea or Persian Gulf. The Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was still missing, as he has since Kandahar, his last stronghold, fell nine days ago.\nVIDEOTAPE -- Mr. bin Laden may have been hiding or fleeing, but his image occupied television screens around the world. Washington released an amateur video believed to have been taped Nov. 9 at a home in Kandahar, found in Jalalabad and turned over to the C.I.A. later that month. It was broadcast by all three major networks and three all-news cable channels.\nOn it, a smiling Mr. bin Laden explains how some of the Sept. 11 hijackers were not told of their mission until just before they boarded the planes. He also expresses surprised satisfaction at the total collapse of the World Trade Center towers, saying that he expected only the floors above the airplanes' impact to fall.\nThe U.S. authorities called the tape irrefutably incriminating; many American viewers said it made them physically sick. Faces of evil, Page 1. But in the Arab world, many dismissed it as a U.S. fabrication.\nDOMESTIC BOMB PLOT -- On Oct. 17, the F.B.I. in Los Angeles got wind of trouble involving the Jewish Defense League, an anti-Arab fringe group, and asked its informant for help. The result: two arrests on Wednesday in a plot to set off pipe bombs at the famed King Fahd mosque and at the office of Representative Darrell Issa, whose grandfather was Lebanese. The suspects, the league's chairman, Irving David Rubin, and a member, Earl Leslie Krugel, are being held on conspiracy and explosives charges. Mr. Krugel's lawyer dismissed the plot as the government informant's fabrication.\nAFGHANISTAN -- Hamid Karzai, a Pashtun, was warmly greeted in the capital of Kabul, where he and three leaders from the Tajik-dominated Northern Alliance will begin next Saturday to lead the power-sharing government framed by agreement in Bonn, Germany. Marines secured the American Embassy; it was the first U.S. military presence in Kabul in 12 years.\nA B-1 bomber bound for Afghanistan crashed into the Indian Ocean; the four crew members suffered only minor injuries. Meanwhile, marines secured the airport near Kandahar, to which they are expected to move their nearby desert base. Allied troops visited the city openly, effectively strengthening the role of Gul Agha Shirzai, one of two warlords in control of Kandahar. He was governor of Kandahar Province in the early 1990's, a period of rampant corruption.\nThe United Nations has so far approved peacekeeping forces only for Kabul, but a larger force, perhaps 5,000-strong, may be needed. There have been reports of clashes between Afghan factions, and some surrendered Taliban fighters have died in custody, apparently suffocating as they were transported in shipping containers.\nBritain hopes to lead whatever force the U.N. finally calls for. Germany, France, Turkey, Jordan, Bangladesh and Indonesia have also volunteered troops.\nThe Uzbek president finally overcame his security concerns and allowed a bridge from Uzbekistan to open, but there was no rush of aid -- a sole trainload crossed, only to languish on the Afghan side, and more remained on the Uzbek side, frozen in yet more security concerns.\nINDIA -- A suicide attack on the Indian Parliament that left 12 dead could end up complicating the American-led antiterrorism coalition. India said it had evidence that Lashkar-e-Taiba, a group that operates openly in Pakistan, was responsible and demanded that Pakistan -- a crucial American ally -- crack down on it. India said it has shared the evidence against Lashkar with the United States, which will have to decide whether to encourage India to act with restraint vis-\u00e0-vis Pakistan or assent to a possible military strike on Lashkar camps in portions of Kashmir Pakistan controls.\nISRAEL -- The Sharon government broke all links with the Palestinian Authority and sent warplanes, helicopters, tanks and bulldozers to attack in the West Bank and Gaza Strip after a bomb-and-gun ambush killed 10 Israelis and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, said he could not meet Israel's demand to close all offices of the militant group Hamas. The Bush administration's first Mideast envoy, Anthony C. Zinni, who arrived in Israel late last month, began pondering whether to just go home.\nA FIRST TRIAL -- Attorney General John Ashcroft's defense of military tribunals has been so passionate that it seemed entirely possible that the first terror suspect to face one would be Zacarias Moussaoui, the French-Moroccan thought to be the 20th hijacker and the first to be charged in the Sept. 11 attacks.\nInstead, after a debate within the Justice Department -- Pentagon officials say they were not consulted -- he was sent to a federal court in Virginia, one considered amenable to imposing the death penalty for the conspiracy charges Mr. Moussaoui faces.\nANTHRAX -- The U.S. renounced biological weapons in 1969, but Army scientists, government officials admitted, made anthrax in the powdered, weapon-ready form in 1998. But they said the material, created at the Army's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, was not the lethal Ames strain involved in the anthrax attacks.\nThe F.B.I. questioned a bioweapons expert, Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, who says the attacks may have been meant to make the public see the need for biodefense. She has concluded that 15 institutions worked recently with the Ames strain.

The tradition lapsed when the family came to New York, until Mr. Miah, an audiovisual technologist at the World Trade Center, took it up with a fire-hot passion. He taught hunting to Mohammed Sadat, his 15-year-old cousin, and took him on weeklong hunting vacations.\n''We expressed our feelings,'' Mohammed said. ''We both talked about whatever we had on our minds. Three years ago, he talked about this girl, Shakila. The parents didn't want her to get married to him. So he would leave a deer caller on the machine and when she heard the deer's voice, she'd know.''\nBut Mohammed worried last year when Mr. Miah said he and Shakila were to be married. She was a computer technician who also worked at the trade center. ''I confronted my cousin,'' he said. ''I said, 'You're going to be married and leave me?' ''\nInstead, Mrs. Miah drew Mohammed in, inviting him into their new Brooklyn home, furnished with antiques and eight-point antlers. The hunting in the woods, just Mr. Miah and Mohammed, continued. ''It was peaceful,'' he said. ''All about nature. All about relaxing. He watched out for me. He was like a brother.''\nSCOTT C. VASEL\nSecond Day in a New Job\nIn June, Scott C. Vasel, 32, moved into a new home in Park Ridge, N.J., with his wife, Amy, and his two sons, Ryan, 4, and Matthew, 2. Then he took the summer off to spend it with his family -- at the zoo, at the beach, in Vermont. And on Sept. 10 he started a job at the World Trade Center as a disaster recovery specialist with Marsh & McLennan, the insurance brokerage company.\n''He said he had a great cubicle right against the window and he could see a great view of the Hudson,'' said Jenny Frantin, his sister-in-law. ''He was looking forward to the job. They had a great summer and he was ready.''\nNow Mr. Vasel's new neighbors on Pine Drive have stood by his family. They have brought over food, hired a cleaning woman and a lawn service, offered to baby-sit and shop. ''They're making dinners from here through Thanksgiving,'' Ms. Frantin said.\nThe neighbors set aside a spot in the grass for a shrine with candles and flowers. They also put up a flag-shaped wooden sign. ''God Bless America and Our Neighbor,'' it reads.\nARCANGEL VAZQUEZ\nDevout and Helpful\nArcangel Vazquez usually stayed for three Masses every Sunday at St. Barbara's Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn. He had attended the church since he was young, and at 47 he was an active member: an usher, a catechist, a leader of the men's program.\n''He could never say no,'' said his friend Diane Munez, the secretary of St. Barbara's. ''He always wanted to be in the middle of everything.''\nMr. Vazquez, who had a 21-year-old daughter and grandchildren, worked in maintenance on the upper floors of 2 World Trade Center. He was last seen helping people leave the 96th and 97th floors.\nAt his church, where co-workers noted the aptness of his first name, no one expected otherwise. ''That was like him,'' Ms. Munez said, calling him ''a comforting friend for everybody.''\n''Always listening,'' she said of him. ''He always had this smile on his face.

She was raising two daughters and working full time.\nMs. Ledesma, who was 37, worked at the World Trade Center as a maintenance coordinator at Marsh & McLennan. She was responsible for maintenance on Floors 93 to 99. The divorced mother of a 12-year-old and a 17-year-old, she lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Her mother, aunts and cousins all lived in the same building.\n''My sister was a giving person,'' said Nelson Hernandez, her older brother. ''She was always the one we turned to for anything. I had a lot of dreams. We were going to buy a house together for our mother.''\nBelkis Mercedes, a friend, said she believed that many family members still expected Ms. Ledesma to reappear.

But she decided to return to work ahead of schedule and save the day to spend Halloween with her children.\nShe told her older brother, Salvatore Venuto, of her plan in a telephone conversation on Monday night. That his sister was in her office in the World Trade Center that fateful Tuesday was typical of her, Mr. Venuto said, because she had chosen to do something special with her children, 4-year-old Gabriella and 15-month-old Vincent.\nMrs. Scibetta, 31, and her husband, Charles, 35, a mason for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, settled in Staten Island once they could afford to buy a house. But their ties were still in the old neighborhood -- Bensonhurst, Brooklyn -- where they were raised and where they met on the playground of Seth Low Junior High School.\nEach morning, on the way to work in Astoria, Queens, Mr. Scibetta left the children at his mother-in-law's house, where Italian remains the first language 35 years after Caterina and Petro Venuto emigrated from Calabria. The day before the attack, Gabriella started prekindergarten, with her mother in attendance for the first day of school.\nThat was Mrs. Scibetta's last earthly pleasure, which she recounted with joy to her brother. '' 'She's getting used to it already,' '' he said she told him that Monday night. '' 'She's such a big girl.'

He died at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, on his eighth wedding anniversary.\nMr. Fontana was a firefighter with the elite Squad 1 unit, stationed in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where he lived with his wife, Marian, and 5-year-old son, Aidan. Neighbors were shocked by the news that 12 men from the small firehouse on Union Street had died, but they took his loss especially hard.\nDave Fontana was a man's man. He volunteered his time for the Boy Scouts. He read to children. He worked tirelessly to find the names of firefighters who had fallen in World War II so that dedication plaques could be hung in the firehouses where they had served.\nA trained sculptor, Mr. Fontana was known for the elaborate Halloween costumes he and his son wore in the annual neighborhood parade.

''He killed my son. I've never had this much hate in my heart, but it's all I've got right now.''\nHer son, David, 26, a computer technician who lived in Mill Basin, Brooklyn, was at 1 World Trade Center on Sept. 11 to deliver and install a personal computer on the 106th floor. At first, he and his supervisor from Rent-a-PC in Midtown were turned away by security and told they could not park near the building. But Mr. Tirado volunteered to set up the computer while his supervisor found a parking space.\nMr. Tirado grew up in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. He enjoyed watching the Mets play and going to Coney Island, Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach. He helped elderly women carry their groceries and he gave neighbors a ride to work in his green Jeep Cherokee.\nThe older of two boys, he was born on Valentine's Day. His mother doted on him, and he on her. ''The only words I can remember him saying were, 'Anything for my Mom,' '' Mrs. Tirado said.\nROBERT DERANEY\n'Pretty Much Perfect'\nWhen Michele Haobsh learned last year that she had breast cancer, she called Robert Deraney, her brother, and said: ''What do I do?'' He provided answers, finding an oncologist and surgeon and accompanying her to chemotherapy and radiation appointments. Long before she did, he joined Gilda's Club, for people with cancer and their families, and made an appointment for her and her family. ''He got me through it,'' she said.\nMr. Deraney, 43, a financial consultant who graduated from Princeton and the Wharton School, was at a breakfast meeting at Windows on the World on Sept. 11.\nHe was the ''high energy'' family organizer, Mrs. Haobsh said. He planned the annual reunions of 70 relatives, ordering Lebanese food and creating a game -- Who Wants to be a Famillionaire? -- based on Deraney trivia.\nHis Upper West Side apartment was furnished with family antiques. He set an elegant table with china and silver for 35 and ended evenings by playing the piano. ''He was,'' Mrs. Haobsh said, ''pretty much perfect.''\nJOSEPH VISCIANO\nAlways the Best Man\nFresh out of Boston College, where he graduated magna cum laude with a degree in finance, Joseph Visciano told relatives he loved his new job as a trader for Keefe Bruyette & Woods, a securities company at 2 World Trade Center. Mr. Visciano, 22 and single, had promised his mother that he would someday give her a granddaughter, but first he wanted to focus on his career, save money and go for an M.B.A.\n''His career was really very important to him,'' said Bill Matarazzo, a cousin, adding that Mr. Visciano had been an overachiever since kindergarten.\nMr. Matarazzo and Mr. Visciano grew up like brothers across the street from each other in Staten Island, and worked through their teenage years in the family business -- an auto parts wholesale company where they did everything from inventory to sales. When Mr. Matarazzo planned his wedding, he asked his cousin Joe to be his best man.\nMr. Matarazzo acquiesced to his extended family's wishes to go on with the wedding yesterday. Mr. Visciano's younger brother, Jason, would stand in as honorary groomsman. ''No one can take his place,'' Mr. Matarazzo, 24, said of Mr. Visciano, who worked at the trade center for only six weeks. ''He will always be my best man.''\nMORTY FRANK\nA Sense of Mischief\nAbout the snake: Morty Frank smuggled it into the basement of the house in Lynbrook, on Long Island, and kept it there for three months without telling anyone, said his mother, Phyllis. ''Until the day he said: 'Guess what, Mom? We have a snake in the basement.' ''\nShe and her husband, Mel, would keep asking what kind it was, but all Morty would ever say was, ''The kind you can make boots out of.'' He was sunny but always ''a little mischievous,'' she added, and he did not much favor the name Morton.\n''When I took him to the pediatrician for the first time, the doctor said, 'What a big name for a little boy,' '' she recalled. ''It was my father's name. But to everyone, he was Morty.''\nMorty Frank and his wife of one year, Jessica, had returned from a wedding in California on the day before the attack. When Phyllis Frank watched the images of the plane hitting 1 World Trade Center -- where Mr. Frank worked at the institutional sales desk of Cantor Fitzgerald on the 104th floor -- ''I knew instantly by the way it hit, and where it hit, well. . . .'' She paused. ''I knew that I was nowhere.''\nLANCE TUMULTY\nTamed by Love\nAt Matawan High School in New Jersey, Lance Tumulty was the captain of the football team and dated cheerleaders. Naturally, Cynthia, his future wife, knew who he was. But she was shy and avoided cliques. At 22, when they met again, he asked her out, repeatedly, but she refused, thinking he would soon dump her. ''He had a reputation in high school,'' she said.\nFinally she consented to a double date. They wound up talking until dawn. ''He wasn't anything like I thought,'' she said.\nTen years later, they had a home in Wayne, N.J., and two daughters -- Sara, 3, and Caroline, 4 months. He had just started a new job as a trader at Euro Brokers, which he had dreamed of and worked toward. On weekends, he fished or hunted -- deer in New Jersey, elk in Montana -- and he was looking forward to teaching his daughters about mountains when they were older. Several of their friends are Matawan High School classmates the Tumultys had rediscovered. They call Mrs. Tumulty ''the one who finally tamed him.''\nTEDDY MALONEY\nA Name to Carry On\nPeople at his memorial Mass last week kept using the same words over and over about Teddy Maloney. Loyal. Modest. Magic with kids. A true friend.\nAt 32, Mr. Maloney was the kind of young husband who called his wife, Brinley, three or four times a day, especially since she was seven months pregnant with their second child -- another girl, they had learned. He had already made his morning call home to Darien, Conn., at 8:40 that Tuesday from the TradeSpark offices of Cantor Fitzgerald on the 104th floor, just minutes before the attack.\n''I'm not sure he liked his work that much,'' his mother, Sally Maloney, recalled. ''If he had had his way, he would have opened a string of carwashes. He always wanted to be in control of his own business.''\nAnd to be closer to home and his extended family, the girls' hockey and lacrosse teams he coached. He took the job in the city only because Cantor Fitzgerald had promised a transfer to the Darien office in February, just after the baby's arrival. Her name will be Teddy Bray Maloney.\nGEORGE MORELL\n'He Collected Friends'\nAt a Giants playoff game last year, George Morell introduced himself to the legendary halfback Frank Gifford, without knowing who he was. Even when Mr. Gifford said his own name, Mr. Morell still did not know. When his friends ribbed him, Mr. Morell replied, ''Well, he didn't know who I was either.''\nMr. Morell, 47, a bond broker at Cantor Fitzgerald, was the kind of man who shook hands with strangers and made them his friends. It did not matter if they were celebrities or not. ''George made the shoeshine guy feel like a million bucks,'' said his younger brother, Mark. ''He didn't collect cars or postage stamps. He collected friends.''\nThe elder Mr. Morell lived with his wife, Roberta, and their children, Nancy, George Jr., Kelsey and Harrison, in Bedford, N.Y. He liked to hunt and fish, and often took his family along. But his favorite pastime was telling stories about his encounters with life. He always had just one more to tell.\nKEVIN E. CONROY\nSupper Every Night\nBy day, he was an accountant at Marsh & McLennan, the insurance brokerage company that occupied seven upper floors at 1 World Trade Center. Evenings, Kevin E. Conroy, 47, the father of four children ages 6 to 12, insisted that his family get together at home in Kensington, Brooklyn, for supper (not dinner) that he often prepared.\nThere was his infamous eggplant parmigiana. Salad. Pasta. Meat and potatoes. Barbecue. ''Nothing too extravagant,'' said a cousin, Lynn Taylor. ''They were the only family I knew that cooked dinner every night. It was just important for him that the family sit together at the house.''\nThe schedules of youth leagues and school tested the custom; some nights it was just pizza ordered in. But Mr. Conroy always looked forward to the suppers and, on weekends, playing the gracious host for gatherings of friends and family.\n''We shared some great times, drank some beer, had lots and lots of laughs,'' said a letter from two other cousins, Tom and Oonagh, that was read at a memorial service last week. ''And Kevin, the barbecues were great.''\nDAVID PRUIM\nA Lifelong Honeymoon\nDavid and Kate Pruim were married 28 years ago, and Mrs. Pruim talks about him as if they were newlyweds. ''We had an 18-year honeymoon and then our daughter was born and then more joy came into our lives,'' she said. ''We just thought it would go on for another 28 years.''\nMr. Pruim, 52, a senior vice president for the Aon Corporation, worked on the 103rd floor of 2 World Trade Center. ''He was the kindest, nicest, most gentle 6-foot-4 person there ever was.'' she said. ''He made everyone he came into contact with feel good about himself, from children to adults.''\nThe two were from Michigan, and were introduced by friends, Mrs. Pruim recalled. ''I just liked his personality, and he was gorgeous,'' she said, with a full-throated laugh. They enjoyed being together, even just sitting next to each other, reading. They lived in Montclair, N.J., with their daughter Carrington, who is 10. A memorial service is being planned.\n''We're calling it a celebration of his life,'' Mrs. Pruim said. ''And if he walks in in the middle of it, boy, will I be the happiest person there.''\nFRANCIS HENRY BRENNAN\nLarger Than Life\nAt 6 feet 7 inches tall, Francis Henry Brennan could fill any room. But it was not just his stature that set him apart. He was good-natured, funny and generous.\nThe oldest of six children, he was larger than life to his younger brothers, said one of them, Brian. He had a soft hook shot that catapulted him to a starring role on the St. Agnes High School basketball team in Rockville Centre, N.Y., in the late 1960's. Teammates nicknamed him Zelmo, for Zelmo Beatty, a popular basketball player of that era, Brian Brennan remembered.\nMr. Brennan, 50, who lived in Oak Beach, N.Y., with his wife, was a senior vice president and limited partner at Cantor Fitzgerald, where he was a government securities broker for about 10 years. Before that, he owned several nightclubs on Long Island, among them Solomon Grundy's in Bay Shore.\nOf all his successes, he was most proud of his affiliation with the New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund, an organization headed by Rusty Staub, the former Mets player and a longtime friend. The night before the attacks, Mr. Brennan and Mr. Staub met to review plans for a November benefit for the wives and children of dead firefighters and police officers.\nConfirmed Dead\nFollowing is a list of the latest seven people confirmed to have died in the World Trade Center disaster, according to the New York City medical examiner's office, which said the victims' families had been notified.\nATTIAS-BELLOWS, Debbie\nGRAZIOSO, John M.\nKING-JOHNSON, Lisa\nMcNALLY, Edmund\nMONTANO, Craig\nPERCONTI, Jon A.\nWALLENS, Matthew Blake"}, {"text": "George Harrison, World-Music Catalyst And Great-Souled Man; A Childlike Simplicity, Full of Love and Fun\n2001-12-09T05:00:00.000Z\nI FEEL I have been cheated by George. Why did he have to go so soon at such a young age when I really wanted to go first?\nIn moments like this, it is so hard to express the feeling of emptiness and sadness within. Like a film flashing by, everything comes to my mind since I met him more than 30 years ago. His childlike quality, his shy but naughty little smile, his passion for all the music he loved and the serious quest for religion, particularly the old Vedic Hindu tradition, always amazed me as well as attracted me.\nThe down-to-earth quality in George was something I could relate to with such joy. He would crack up when I told him all my jokes; we had such fun! We always competed with each other in punning. When I told him that I was known as a ''pundit'' because of my punning, he said something hilarious, connecting the old Hindu scriptures of the four Vedas (Rigveda, Samveda, Atharvaveda and Yajurveda). He said: ''Do you know the four Wether brothers? They are Ric, Sam, Arthur and George Wethers.''\nThe only solid lessons on sitar he had from me were in the summer and autumn of 1966, which he couldn't pursue as much as we both wanted. He was very talented and would have become a great sitar player if only he could have given some time. His love, knowledge and understanding of Indian music developed immensely over the years. I gave him a copy of the book ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' by Swami Yogananda, and my brother, Rajendra, gave him a book by Swami Vivekananda. He had such thirst for the knowledge and wisdom of Indian traditions. In many ways he was more Indian than many Indians.\nThough I had been performing all over the world since 1954, my association with George attracted a whole young generation to sitar and to me from the mid-1960's. Even though I didn't make any records jamming with him or any other pop or rock star, I was treated like a superstar, being the Beatle George's guru. Then came Monterey, Woodstock and finally the big Bangladesh concert, which he totally handled in producing. Because of George we had Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell and other eminent musicians.\nAfter a year or so, when he spent time with me in Varanasi at my house, he suggested we make a couple of records and perhaps tour the United States. We did the first recording in the A&M Studios for his Dark Horse label. It was then that he met dear Olivia (whom he married in 1978). In the summer of 1974 the second album was recorded (''Festival of India'') at his own studio. I'll never forget those couple of months when we worked on this album. I did all the compositions on the M4 while traveling from London to his home in Henley. George created such an atmosphere with such love and regard. We would start rehearsals in a beautiful large hall with a view to his lovely garden. We would have Indian food and snack between rehearsals.\nThe recording was finished with simultaneous editing, which George was doing himself, always asking me to hear when he was satisfied. After this period of creative joy we went to tour the United States, giving more than 30 performances. George had a special 737 Boeing jetliner completely refurbished for us to travel in.\nWhat touched me so much was his worry about my health and well being. He would tell me always not to travel and exert myself so much. Then from the role of disciple and friend he became more of a son to me, especially after my own son Shubho died in 1992. He would fly and be with me whenever I was in the hospital or not well with my heart problems. His love and concern touched me deeply.\nI'll never forget how much love, care and time he gave to another project he did for me while staying in our house here in Encinitas. He went through all the details, right from choosing all the artwork, to writing the notes, to producing the four-CD boxed set ''In Celebration,'' selections from my 40 years of sitar performances and compositions. The last wonderful musical experience I had with him was when we made the CD ''Chants of India.'' We did some songs in Madras and the major part at his own studio in his mansion at Henley. His nearness and attention in producing the record always inspired me so. Even the complex compositions came out of me so spontaneously.\nAnother one of many funny incidents was when George, Olivia and their son, Dhani, came to India in 1995 and spent a few weeks. We went to Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur. In Bombay, Delhi and Calcutta people recognized George and created a stampede, which George hated. But we had no such problem in Rajasthan and he enjoyed it so much. On our last stop, Udaipur, while we were walking in the busy main streets shopping -- ornaments of silver, colourful materials, dresses, turbans, having tea and snacks -- all of a sudden there was a big crowd which surrounded us. I was terrified thinking they had recognized George, but it was actually me they were after. Then the funniest thing happened. George, realizing the situation, immediately became my bodyguard. ''Move, move. No, no. Don't bother Panditji.'' And cordoning me with both his hands, he brought me to our waiting car and saved me from those autograph hunters. The others were already seated, and when the car started, we burst out laughing.\nMy daughter Anoushka and my wife, Sukanya, also were so attached to him. He had a beautiful and loving wife in Olivia and a wonderful son in Dhani. He had a magnanimous heart and always cared so much. He was a fearless and beautiful soul always conscious of God. I loved him dearly. Though he is gone physically, he will always be alive and vibrant in my heart."}, {"text": "In India and Africa, Women's Low Status Worsens Their Risk of AIDS\n2001-02-26T05:00:00.000Z\nThe poverty and powerlessness of women in Africa and Asia are combining to make them increasingly vulnerable to AIDS, which some research groups are now calling a women's disease.\nDespite years of international conferences and declarations about women's rights, in many cultures and in the most disadvantaged societies girls and women do not have the power to reject unwanted or unsafe sex.\nA lack of individual power, or even basic human rights, has already condemned many women to death in Africa, where more than half the people affected by AIDS are women, according to United Nations reports.\nAs the epidemic grows in Asia -- particularly in South Asia, where by virtually every international measure women have the lowest status in the world -- the results are expected to be catastrophic.\nA report last week from Secretary General Kofi Annan concluded, ''The gender dynamics of the epidemic are far-reaching due to women's weaker ability to negotiate safe sex, and their generally lower social and economic status.''\nThe report will be taken up on Monday at a meeting to prepare for a special General Assembly session in June devoted to AIDS. As that session approaches, women's groups are increasing their efforts to get attention for women's vulnerability, which occupies only one paragraph in the secretary general's 29-page report.\nThe issue rekindles debates about women's rights in personal relationships, including whether they are able to insist on the use of condoms, an issue that dominated the 1994 United Nations population conference in Cairo and the international conference on women the following year in Beijing.\n''We are working extremely hard to save five years of gains,'' said Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women's Health Coalition in New York, which assists groups in the developing world.\nAt Unifem, the United Nations development program for women, Stephanie Urdang, the adviser on sex and the virus that causes AIDS, said the voices of women in the third world are clear on this issue: women there cite property laws and cultural practices among the obstacles to protecting themselves against the disease, which is particularly ravaging sub-Saharan Africa.\n''For example,'' Ms. Urdang said, ''there is the belief in Africa and Asia that if a man sleeps with a virgin, he'll be cured.''\nShe also noted the practice in which a widow is married off to her deceased husband's brother. ''Of course,'' she said, ''in many cases the husband will have died of H.I.V.-AIDS, and she might be infected and will infect his brother.''\nMs. Urdang continued: ''Another practice that is very, very devastating is that women do not have land rights and property rights in most of sub-Saharan Africa, which means they are allocated a plot of land to work on in order to produce food for the family.\n''But if the husband dies, they have no right to that land anymore, or even the house that the husband would have built for them. It's taken over by the husband's family, which is within customary law, and then they are left destitute.\n''And if he's died of AIDS, what regularly happens is that the first person to be diagnosed in the family is the pregnant wife, because she'll go to a clinic and will be tested. Then she'll be looked at as the cause of the disease.''\nNoeleen Heyzer, executive director of Unifem, argues that to combat AIDS, governments and international agencies will have to focus on the particular needs of women, who are often denied medicines.\n''We've talked for so long about the need to really look at gender in all aspects of development work,'' Ms. Urdang said. ''With H.I.V.-AIDS, it is so much clearer because it is an issue of life and death.''\n''When you look at why this is happening,'' she added, ''it's so much the cultural practices and values and beliefs that underlie our societies that discriminate against women.''\nMs. Germain, who formerly directed programs in Bangladesh for the Ford Foundation, said women's groups there and in India and Nepal were raising similar warnings about the folly of ignoring social attitudes. She said that in South Asia, the disease was spread in somewhat different ways.\nIn India, for example, ''there is quite a bit of unrecognized homosexuality, especially early among men, who then marry later, with their wives not having any idea that they had earlier relationships'' that might have involved risky sex.\nShe added that women in India are often totally uninformed about sex when they are married, that the marriages are often to older men and arranged by their families. Women are then under great pressure to produce sons, and the use of contraceptives, specifically condoms, is out of the question.\nAnd across Asia, Ms. Germain continued, ''you have intravenous drug use, which in itself is a very important part of the picture, but can also lead into sexual prostitution and trafficking.'' Migrant labor, long-haul trucking, rail networks and the military all move infections around India, she said.\nIn most of South Asia, illiteracy among women is the highest anywhere, and there are few health centers attentive to the needs of women in rural areas.\nThe American Foundation for AIDS Research (Amfar) reported recently that as many as 30 million Indians could be infected by 2010.\nProstitutes in Asia, some of them now organized in self-help organizations, have long complained that their customers refuse to use condoms, which in any case are not always available. This month the government of Vietnam said it had found that 20 percent of prostitutes it had studied were H.I.V.-positive.\n''In India,'' Ms. Germain said, ''the low status of women, the economic dependence, the marriage patterns, all of these factors are going to mean that women are much less likely than even women in Africa to be able to negotiate condom use or to have any say at all about when sex occurs. Much more needs to be understood about the relationship between women's status and the epidemic.''\nFamily-planning programs in India have played down the use of condoms, though a new government program for fighting AIDS is now trying to make them more accessible, Ms. Germain said. ''We need to work with young people and get to both girls and boys early,'' she said, ''and not in just the conventional sex education mode.''\nShe recommended more education in sexual behavior that ''emphasizes gender equality and power relations and sexuality more broadly, not just biologically.''\n''But there are a lot of taboos against doing that,'' she said. ''The need to get information to young people is critical. But the political will doesn't yet exist.''"}, {"text": "Cell Phones for the World's Poor; Hook Up Rural Asia, Some Say, And Ease Poverty\n2001-01-19T05:00:00.000Z\nThis village in northern Sumatra is home to 832 people who live on less than 50 cents a day farming the rich volcanic soil. No one can use the Internet. Cellular signals do not reach it. The nearest telephone is more than three miles away.\n''If I miss my parents, I just come back to my village,'' said Priska Ika, a gregarious 20-year-old visiting her home from college in the city of Medan, 50 miles to the northeast.\nDuring the heady days of the dot-com boom, the hope was that a coming era of telecommunications would help communities in the developing world like Sukababo narrow the digital divide between rich and poor, becoming more closely linked to the wider world. In a country where fewer than 2 of every 100 people use the Internet, the reasoning went, wireless devices on a new global standard would bring e-mail to people too poor for personal computers. And digital radio waves would embrace communities telephone lines have yet to reach.\nThe new era begins this year. From Japan, a so-called third generation of cellular telephone technology giving individuals much greater mobile access to the Internet is ready for Europe, then the United States and the rest of the world.\nBut it will not be coming here to Sukababo. With technology stocks slumping, the telecommunications industry reeling at the cost of its wireless future, and rising doubts that even rich-country users will quickly embrace the new technology, a more pessimistic forecast for the third generation, or 3G, is emerging.\n''It's an illusion to think that 3G will close the digital divide,'' said Bertrand Bidaud, a wireless industry analyst at the Gartner Group in Singapore.\nThe problem is that despite rapid urbanization, most people in the developing world still do not live in cities. They live in scattered villages like Sukababo, part of a rural sprawl too thinly spread and too poor to justify expensive new networks. Costly licenses and equipment militate against the spread of mobile phones to poor communities, especially rural ones, putting the burden on governments to lure operators into seemingly unprofitable areas.\nMore than just debunking dot-com hyperbole, this starker assessment of the potential in the developing world for third-generation wireless contradicts the very basis of the International Telecommunications Union's plea 15 years ago for the new standard's development -- to accelerate the spread of communications.\nNow, some doubt whether the time is right for the rural poor to be connected at all. Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, quarreled with some of the priorities of technology enthusiasts at a recent industry conference, saying that the Internet was useless to people who lacked basics of life.\nAt the ''creating digital dividends'' conference in Seattle a couple of months ago, Mr. Gates was highly skeptical. The premise was that ''market drivers'' could be used ''to bring the benefits of connectivity and participation in the e-economy to all of the world's six billion people.'' Mr. Gates would have little of this.\n''Do people have a clear view of what it means to live on $1 a day?'' he asked. ''There's no electricity in that house -- none.''\nWhen a moderator brought up solar power, Mr. Gates shot back: ''No. You can't afford a solar power system for less than $1 a day.'' And, ''You're just buying food, you're trying to stay alive.''\nStill, many high-technology executives, politicians and development experts insist that without Internet access, thousands of poor communities are speedily falling into the global economy's wake.\n''Those people won't take advantage of the benefits that can come out of e-commerce and access to information,'' said Bernard Drum, an official at the World Bank in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. ''And people who do take advantage of those opportunities will be ahead of the game.''\nBeing connected means more than shopping on eBay. Internet evangelists believe that the Web can help bring better education and health care to rural areas, and make them wealthier, too.\n''Poor people are poor because they're stuck in an environment that is stifling,'' said Iqbal Z. Quadir, a former New York investment banker who returned to his native Bangladesh in 1996 to build a rural cellular network with Grameen Bank. ''If they are connected, the environment changes and everyone's life gets better.''\nMr. Quadir's GrameenPhone lends money to village women to buy cellular telephones. They in turn sell fellow villagers time on the phone to do things like call relatives abroad. Today, GrameenPhone's rural resellers connect 2,800 villages and pocket $2 a day -- equivalent to a large chunk of average income.\nE-mail would not do much good in rural Bangladesh, Mr. Quadir says; only 4 of every 10 people can read. But throughout Southeast Asia, roughly 9 of 10 people can read.\nCellular operators in Southeast Asia witnessed long ago how rural populations can benefit from being connected. In Thailand, one operator found shrimp farmers calling Bangkok to get prices -- and the upper hand on middlemen. Similarly, Smart Communications, a Philippine cellular operator, learned that vegetable farmers who had never had regular fixed-line phone service were using mobile phones to market their produce in Manila.\nSukababo offers a good contrast. The village sits on a rolling volcanic plateau where people farm a variety of crops: everything from bananas to chili peppers. Rice paddies girdle the hills. Coconut palms shade ripening corn.\nModern life has intruded: traditional thatched-roof houses on stilts have given way to corrugated iron topped by power lines and satellite TV dishes. Leonardo Ginting, 11, can watch movies on video compact discs, but has never heard of the Internet. In a few years, he will head to the nearest high school, 12 miles away, a move that will cost his family almost half the average income here. Advocates of rural connectivity say that the Internet can bring the classroom to Sukababo.\nThe Internet could also help local farmers. Sukababo lost its corn crop a few years ago to blight, and farmers here have not been able to grow a decent one since, said Bagi Kita Ginting, the village headman, and no relation to Leonardo. He has never heard of the Internet, either. Farmers elsewhere are able to learn about crop diseases and resistant strains from the Web.\nIf only Sukababo could get a dial tone. In theory, the laws of supply and demand should drive the wireless industry to develop so that it can deliver some version of its product to anyone willing to pay for it. Sukababo, after all, has shampoo, store-bought clothes and television sets. Children even play with beeping toy mobile phones.\nBut communications technologies have yet to yield equivalent economies of scale. Though costs have come down significantly, many executives argue that incompatible mobile phone technologies operating at conflicting frequencies have interfered with cellular's propagation.\nIn the countryside, ''it's simply not economically feasible to put up cellular networks,'' said Ramon R. Isberto, public affairs director of Smart Communications, the Philippine operator. ''You'd have to put up a lot of base stations for very little traffic. It's not a workable business case.''\nThe International Telecommunications Union first proposed the development of third-generation cellular technology as a global standard to solve this problem. But corporate bickering over rival technologies ultimately led it to endorse three different versions. ''Unfortunately, because of some differences in technologies, we couldn't take one simple standard,'' said the group's secretary general, Yoshio Utsumi.\nWhatever the choice, the cost of building a third-generation network could be more than double the expense for existing digital networks, said Tay Soo Meng, vice president for mobile networks at Singapore Telecommunications. Raising funds will not be easy, particularly in today's tougher financial environment, analysts say.\nCellular operators in developing countries, therefore, are likely to hold off, relying in the meantime on technical upgrades of existing digital networks that offer Internet access at slower speeds. Even then, analysts say, they are likely to concentrate on cities, where incomes are higher and they can reach more customers in a smaller area.\nExperts say the only way the new technology will ultimately reach villagers is if governments play a more active role in pushing networks outward. The Philippines, for instance, required cellular operators to extend their digital service to every major population center. Because the Philippines, unlike some other countries in the region, is at least 50 percent urban, many people are now within reach of a cellular network.\nHow governments award licenses will also be crucial, analysts say. Most recommend against auctions, pointing to Britain's and Germany's multibillion-dollar auctions last year to show how fierce bidding inflates prices. Instead, experts recommend picking operators with the best network plans. Others warn that such beauty contests favor incumbents, many of them controlled by the crony conglomerates that still dominate Asian economies.\nNonetheless, the Philippines may have no choice but to auction off licenses, said Edgardo Cabarrios, director of the common carriers authorization department of the National Telecommunications Commission. The law requires an auction process if, as is likely, bidders outnumber licenses. Indonesia is also leaning toward auctions, said Sasmito Dirdjo, director general of the transportation and communications ministry.\nSome think that governments should adopt a laissez-faire approach, intervening only to ensure fair competition. ''In Indonesia, where the government has a history of confusion and chaos,'' Mr. Drum of the World Bank said, ''they should create an enabling environment, creating incentives, and let the private sector do it.''\nOthers maintain that the Internet, like power and water, is a public utility that will never be distributed equitably if left to business. The best comparison is with the development of Interstate highways in the United States, said Ken Gibson, the head of McKinsey & Company's Indonesian office. ''If it had been left to the private sector,'' he said, ''the Interstates would never have been built.''\nOther technologies could deliver Internet service to rural areas. Satellites, for instance, have been used to beam access to a few showcase villages in South Africa and Borneo. Microwaves are linking villages in Bhutan.\nBut these technologies are expensive and, so far, they lack the mass-market appeal to pay for themselves.\nMr. Utsumi says he is optimistic that third-generation technology will gain popularity in industrial nations quickly enough to bring equipment costs down to levels affordable in poorer countries.\nDevelopment experts, in the meantime, hope that plain old telephone lines can be extended to create community telecenters, where rural residents can call or use the Internet. In Indonesia, for example, no-frills Internet cafes are already springing up in cities and in college towns.\nThe key to moving the latest telecommunications to the world's hinterlands may lie not in new technology, development experts say, but in harnessing the collective buying power of the rural residents.\n''The real secret is to create a digital identity for people who are using shared access points,'' said Paul Meyer, an American who started the first Internet service in Kosovo. 'We have to get over the mentality that consumers are people who have a PC or a phone.''\nThe Internet would find a warm reception in Sukababo. ''It would be great if we could have it,'' Mr. Ginting, the headman, said after Ms. Ika explained what the Internet is. ''Now we have to go to Munte,'' three miles away, ''just to make a phone call.''"}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED: PORTRAITS OF GRIEF: THE VICTIMS; Lives Remembered, by the Families and Friends Who Shared Them\n2001-09-25T05:00:00.000Z\nThe official number of bodies found in the destruction of the World Trade Center stood at 276 yesterday, and the city medical examiner had identified 206. In all, 6,453 could be missing. Here are glimpses of some of those lives.\nDARREN BOHAN\nBanjos and Big Dreams\nLike so many New Yorkers, there was more to Darren Bohan than met the eye. By day he was a temp and for the past few months he worked on the 102nd floor of 2 World Trade Center, where he crunched numbers for the Aon Corporation. But Mr. Bohan would rather have been plucking a banjo or strumming his guitar, jamming with friends until late at night.\nAlison Kelley, his girlfriend, said he hoped to parlay his musical talents into a full-time job, perhaps as a music teacher at a public school. ''Music was so important to him,'' she said.\nMs. Kelley, also a banjo player, spent many hours playing with Mr. Bohan. Their repertory ran from Irish ballads to songs by the rock band Kiss to 19th-century American roots music. ''We'd play just about anything,'' Ms. Kelley said. The two had been inseparable since meeting at a music jam in Brooklyn seven months ago.\nLaid back, gentle and unpretentious, Mr. Bohan, 34, tried not to gripe too much about his day job, although he was not thrilled to be working 102 stories off the ground. ''He didn't like being so unnaturally high up, in a place where something terrible happened before,'' she said. ''But he'd just try to tell people it was a nice view.''\nKENNY CALDWELL\nThe Kicknic Kid\nYou know how most people have to bend down to scratch their knee? Kenny Caldwell did not, because he had hands the size of baseball mitts and arms that went on forever. ''He was a little slim Jimmy,'' said his mother, Elsie Caldwell, from his hometown, Philadelphia, ''with big hands and a big, big heart. I called him my little chocolate drop.''\nMr. Caldwell, 30, liked being a technology salesman for Alliance Consulting Group on the 102nd floor of 1 World Trade Center. But what he loved was figuring out ways to get people together. ''I used to call him the C.E.O., chief entertainment officer,'' said his older brother, Leon Caldwell. He even invented an annual event: the International Kicknic Contest, held every August in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, for an ever-expanding circle of friends and family to play kickball and catch up.\n''My neighbors used to tease me about him while he was growing up,'' Mrs. Caldwell said. ''They'd say other kids collect stray cats and dogs, but your Kenny collects stray people.''\nPETER V. GENCO\nKing of His Castle\nPeople make assumptions about high-octane bond traders. You would think, for example, that Peter V. Genco, who traded government bonds at Cantor Fitzgerald on the 104th floor of 1 World Trade Center, ''would have some kind of aggressive reputation,'' said his sister Jennifer. ''But Peter wasn't into the big loud. He wasn't into the cursing, like so many traders on the desk. And I think that's what his clients really liked.''\nAnd what Mr. Genco really liked, aside from bonds and his wife, Diane, was being the father of two daughters, Annalisa, 2, and Victoria, who was born June 2. ''He was soft spoken, so very gentle with them; he just loved his girls,'' Jennifer Genco said. In fact, on the Sunday before the attack, Victoria had her christening at St. Agnes Cathedral in Rockville Centre, N.Y. ''There were 45 relatives in the party at his house afterwards, and I remember looking at him, and his house, and his girls, and thinking how happy he was, thinking that Peter loves to be the king of his castle.''\nDAMIAN MEEHAN\nEverything Is Family\nThis summer, Damian Meehan celebrated a milestone best appreciated by other rookie golfers struggling for some semblance of par: he finally broke 100. And his foursome included three of his six brothers, so the feat did not pass unverified. Several brotherly beers were shared that day, recalled his brother Michael. The Meehan boys had played Gaelic football since childhood, but recently five of them took up golf and made a habit of getting away for a weekly game, followed by a nice dinner and animated reminiscences.\nMr. Meehan, 32, was the baby of the brothers. As they grew up in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan, they bossed him unmercifully, but he took it in stride. Last year the brothers pitched in and completely renovated the house he shared in Glen Rock, N.J., with his wife, Joanne, and their 18-month-old son. Another baby is on the way.\nIn a family of police officers and firefighters, he was the quiet and serious brother, the only one of his nine siblings to wind up on Wall Street. He was an up-and-coming trader at Carr Futures, and he loved his job all the more, said his brother Michael, because so many of his bosses and co-workers were from the old neighborhood. ''Everything with us,'' he said, ''is family.''\nDEANNA L. GALANTE\nA Knack for Hair\nDeanna L. Galante had such a knack for styling hair that she attended beauty school after high school in Sheepshead Bay, and when she ran out of heads to practice on among family members, she used her own. It was her second career, and she kept up with the trends. Braids, beads, perms and shavings, she did them all.\nOn Wall Street, Ms. Galante, 32, worked for Cantor Fitzgerald's eSpeed division as a personal assistant. At home on Staten Island, where she lived with her husband, Anthony, she did puzzles to unwind and was busy redecorating in anticipation of their first child; she was six weeks away from going on maternity leave. ''She was already like a second mom to my 12-year-old,'' said her sister, Tina. ''They were always doing their hair and nails.''\nJOHN R. CRUZ\nPlans for a Wedding\nJohn R. Cruz wasn't one of those guys who proposes marriage to his girlfriend, forks over the ring, then waits to be informed when and where to attend the wedding.\nHe had proposed to his bride, Susan Fereira, only two weeks before the disaster, when they had both flown out to California for a wedding. So, the whole weekend before the terrorist attack, the lovebirds took delight in discussing the complex details. It had to be at Sacred Heart Church in Yonkers, where Ms. Fereira lived. It would certainly be a large wedding: her family is Portuguese and his is Puerto Rican, with many of his relatives living around Lakewood, N.J.\nTheir friends from Morgan Stanley would be there, because that was where they had met, and where she still works. And certainly there must be a contingent from Cantor Fitzgerald, where Mr. Cruz was in the accounting group on the 101st floor of 1 World Trade Center. On Monday, Sept. 10, they set the date: Sept. 21, 2002.\nNow she remembers all the good things. For example, ''how he carried a Bible,'' she said, ''and read a passage every morning on the way to work.''\nMALISSA WHITE\nCaretaker of the Family\nWhen Malissa White was growing up in Bald Knob, Ark., strangers assumed she was the eldest child in the family, even though she was not. If anyone asked her older sister a question, she would answer. ''She was like the caretaker of the whole family, the spokesperson, the whole lot,'' said her brother Marc.\nWhen Ms. White married Rocky Higgins in 1996 and they set up house together in East Flatbush, she became a mother to his two sons. Marlon, the older of the two, played basketball at his high school in Queens. Ms. White kept in contact with his coaches and college scouts, making it possible for him to win a basketball scholarship to Talladega College in Alabama. She found summer jobs for Mr. Higgins's nieces.\n''She was a real family person,'' Mr. Higgins said of his wife, who was 36 and worked in the human resources department of Marsh & McLennan. Ms. White was a mentor in her church. When members of the congregation were burned out of their homes, she took them in. ''All I can say is that she is the best thing that happened to me,'' Mr. Higgins said.\nSHABBIR AHMED\nFishing Getaways\nShabbir Ahmed had worked as a waiter in his share of swank city restaurants since immigrating from Bangladesh in 1981, but Windows on the World was such a favorite that he stayed 11 years. His son Thanbir, 16, thinks it was because the management and customers treated him the same way he treated them: nicely and politely. Also, he was earning a salary that made his dream in life -- providing a college education for his three children -- a real option; his oldest daughter, 19, attends Brooklyn College.\nFishing excursions to Gerritsen Creek and Sheepshead Bay were his favorite getaways: they reminded him of his boyhood. While he preferred to let his wife, Jeba, and his children clean whatever trout, catfish or bluefish he caught, he did lend a hand with the grilling.\nWhen Mr. Ahmed, 44, was not off fishing in his leisure hours, he was tending to the backyard vegetable garden in Marine Park, Brooklyn, a responsibility he traded with his brother on an annual basis. This summer it was his turn: chilies, squash, eggplant and tomatoes made up this year's crop, but not all of them flourished. It seems he was more vigilant pursuing fish than he was yanking weeds and spreading fertilizer.\nJOAN D. GRIFFITH\nManaging a Dual Role\nJoan D. Griffith had two identities. As an office manager at Fiduciary Trust, she was known as Joan. But with her family and friends in Willingboro, N.J. -- where her pasta improvisations attracted a fan club -- she went by her middle name, Donna. Her husband, Peter, is not positive why, but he has a theory: ''She was Joan on the job, I guess, because it sounded more official.''\nShe was the mother of their 16-year-old daughter and a mother to his 24-year-old daughter, raising both girls as her own. ''That we were madly in love for 20 years is a tribute to her,'' he said.\nHer weekly routine rarely varied: Saturdays she went to the library and loaded up her book bag with romance novels to read, two per day, on her 90-minute commute to and from work. Reading was one escape from the stresses of Wall Street. She also had a rule that the home front was to be computer-free. They met in 1980 at Merrill Lynch, married in 1981, and moved out of Brooklyn in 1992 so that their children could experience an environment dominated by cornfields rather than concrete.\nLYNNE I. MORRIS\nTeaching, or Trading?\nLynne I. Morris was a cat person. Growing up in Monroe, N.Y., she and Frisky were inseparable and shared their own special pillow. At Oneonta College, she named her new cat after her dormitory, Matteson.\nShe worked hard on her tan each summer and during spring break sprees in Florida and Cancn, but according to her mother, Pat, that was her only glimmer of vanity. ''She always worried about everyone else's feelings more than her own,'' said her older sister, Chrissy, ''and she said it sometimes got her in trouble.''\nShe vacillated between wanting to teach -- she did some substitute teaching in Monroe -- and hankering after a business career with a more hectic pace, which was what took her to Cantor Fitzgerald straight out of college. Ms. Morris, 22, spent her first several months logging other brokers' trades into the company computers, but her goal was to make those trades herself, sooner rather than later. A few months ago she rekindled her relationship with her college boyfriend, Mark Chabus; the reunion took, and they were on the verge of announcing their engagement.\nANGELO AMARANTO\nKeeping Track of Leo\nEvery afternoon, Angelo Amaranto would arrive home in Borough Park, Brooklyn, from his job in the maintenance department at the World Trade Center, grab a cup of espresso, and park himself in front of the television. Mr. Amaranto, 60, was crazy about his cable TV, particularly the Italian news program and, on competing channels, the daily astrology reports: he surfed between the two shows, looking for the most positive spin on Leo the lion.\n''I always made fun of him for watching that horoscope stuff,'' said Maria, his wife of 39 years, ''but he loved it.'' He also loved the job he held for 31 years; their shared hometown, Salerno, Italy; and her. He moved to New York in 1955 but went back to Salerno to marry Maria in 1962. They have three children, and thanks to them, three grandchildren whom he delighted in spoiling with toys and Disney videos. A bargain hunter, Mr. Amaranto did much of the grocery shopping, but he left the marinara sauce to his wife. ''Angelo loved to eat,'' she said. ''Angelo loved life. I don't know what we're going to do without him.''\nMATTHEW G. LEONARD\nA Lawyer Helping Others\nMatthew G. Leonard was the kind of lawyer who would join a homeless man in singing Christmas carols in downtown Brooklyn, successfully drawing contributions from charmed passers-by. ''He probably was the kindest law clerk I ever had,'' said Peter Leisure, a federal district judge in Manhattan.\nMr. Leonard, 38, had done well as a lawyer, rising to director of litigation for Cantor Fitzgerald. But he was also known for extensive pro bono work, largely at MFY Legal Services. He started working there as an intern, helping poor Chinatown residents while he was at Columbia Law School, and served for more than a decade on its board, including five years as vice chairman.\nOn Sept. 11, he rose early, as he always did, well before his 7-month-old daughter, Christina, had awakened. ''He said he got more work done before the phones started ringing at 9,'' said his wife, Yolanda Cerda Leonard, who had met him when she was a paralegal and he a lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, a Manhattan law firm. As he left their Brooklyn apartment to go to his office high in the World Trade Center, his wife looked at the clock. It said 7:11 a.m.\nLINDSAY C. HERKNESS III\nMan About Wimbledon\nThere are few bons vivants who work for a living, and should you doubt that Lindsay C. Herkness III, senior vice president at Morgan Stanley, was among them, you have only to consider his Christmas cards, showing Mr. Herkness in top hat at Ascot, or at Wimbledon, being hustled away by two bobbies. The captions reflected his humor, too. ''I only recommended to Her Majesty that she fund an IRA account,'' read the Wimbledon card.\nFun-loving Lindsay. There was never a cloud in his sky, his old friend Bunny Whiteley said. He lived in the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a ''totally male'' apartment. He was witty and charming. Women adored him. Even the way he got into the business made an amusing tale: He was fresh out of business school, gave an investment seminar on a cruise ship in exchange for free passage, and at the end of the cruise a dozen well-heeled widows beseeched him to manage their funds. Two true loves, in addition to business and the ladies, were the Union Club and his basset, Beauregard Hound.\nMs. Whiteley said it was Mr. Lindsay's decision not to leave the building. ''We understand that when the plane struck -- he was around the 70th floor -- his statement was, 'This is the strongest building in America,' and he went back to his desk.''\nANN MCGOVERN\nThe Light of Her Life\nOn a return trip from Long Island to her apartment in Manhattan two weeks ago, Terry McGovern had the sudden idea to surprise her mother, Ann McGovern, with a visit. In her arms, she carried her newborn, Liam Andrs.\nTo her delight, Mrs. McGovern, who was in the shower, ran to meet them at the door, half dressed and dripping water, and began yelling for her husband: ''Larry, Larry, look who is here! Liam is here! Liam is here!''\nAnd that's how Ms. McGovern says she will remember her mother: exuberant, happy, full of life. Mrs. McGovern, who lived in East Meadow on Long Island, was a claims analyst for the Aon Corporation and worked on the 93rd floor of 2 World Trade Center, the first tower to collapse. A native of the Bronx, Mrs. McGovern drove a black sports car and was an avid golfer who had recently made a hole in one.\nBut her biggest thrill, Ms. McGovern said, was her youngest grandson, Liam Andrs, born two months ago. Several times a week, she would leave her job and sneak in a visit with her daughter and the baby in the Upper West Side. ''She'd drive me crazy,'' Ms. McGovern said. ''She would show up at all hours, saying she just had to see him. She called him the light of her life.''\nDAVID M. GRAIFMAN\nA Passion for Watches\nDavid M. Graifman had a sense of humor and a passion for watches. He owned dozens. Not your basic expensive watches; a Rolex would be too ordinary. ''He liked ones that didn't have hands, or with unusual mechanisms,'' said his brother, Gary Graifman.\nAn equity analyst at the investment firm Keefe Bruyette on the 89th floor of 2 World Trade Center, David Graifman, 40, often contributed his thoughts to a watch lovers' Web site called Timezone.com. Earlier this month he wrote about the trip he and his wife of one year, Christine Huhn, had just taken to Alaska, including a photograph of the bear they encountered at close range.\nMONICA GOLDSTEIN\nUnease About Elevators\nMonica Goldstein never worried about working so high in the Twin Towers before the elevators began behaving badly. In recent weeks, she told her older sister, Adrienne Triggs, elevators skipped floors and went out of service. Everyone heard a rumor about the elevator that was stopped by emergency brakes after going into a free fall. After a touch of anxiety, Ms. Goldstein laughed it off.\nShe was good at calming others' fears, too. On the morning of the attack, Ms. Goldstein commuted from her sister's home in Bay Terrace on Staten Island, taking the No. 3 bus to her job at Cantor Fitzgerald on the 101st floor of 1 World Trade Center. ''We watched a scary movie together Monday night,'' Mrs. Triggs said, ''and Monica asked me, 'Are you scared?' I said, 'a little.' And she said, 'I'll stay with you tonight.' ''\nNESTOR CHEVALIER\nInseparable Brothers\nNestor Chevalier always let his kid brother, Maurice, tag along. Though the brothers were five years apart, they were inseparable growing up in Washington Heights. They worked out together at the gym, and danced to salsa at the nightclubs. They even moved out of their mother's house into an apartment of their own in the neighborhood. ''We were the best of friends,'' Maurice said. ''We did everything together.''\nNestor Chevalier, 30, verified trades at Cantor Fitzgerald and had planned to marry his girlfriend of nine years, Lillian Fermin, in October. He loved to tell stories about his life, often exaggerating the details for even bigger laughs. He found a rapt audience in his family and friends. Just last month, Maurice took Nestor to a salsa club to celebrate his big brother's birthday. Maurice danced all night.\n''I miss him dearly,'' Maurice said.\nThe Confirmed Dead\nFollowing is a list of the latest five people confirmed to have died in the World Trade Center disaster, according to the New York City medical examiner's office, which released the list yesterday. The office said the victims' families had been notified.\nAMATO, James\nCRISCI, John\nDAVIS, Clinton\nTORRES, Luis\nWANG, Weibin"}, {"text": "In Review: Jan. 21-27\n2001-01-28T05:00:00.000Z\n Earthquake Strikes India, Killing Thousands \n The most powerful earthquake in India in more than half a century struck the western state of Gujarat, then shook the rest of the subcontinent from top to bottom. The quake killed thousands of people and buried hundreds of others in the rubble of toppled homes, schools and office towers. \n The quake, which registered a magnitude of 7.9, caused high-rise buildings to sway hundreds of miles away, and was felt even in Nepal and Bangladesh. The Indian Air Force began airlifting blankets, tents, medical supplies and doctors to the hardest-hit areas of Gujarat, as well as bulldozers, cranes and other equipment to help in rescue efforts. \n Gore to Teach \n Throughout his political career, former Vice President Al Gore's speaking style was often described as professorial. So he should need little practice when the next stage of his career begins as a lecturer at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, Fisk University in Nashville and Middle Tennessee State University in Murphreesboro, Tenn. The loser of last year's prolonged presidential race said that he had always wanted to try his hand at teaching, and that he and his wife, Tipper, also would deliver speeches and write a book about the family. As for a political future, Mr. Gore said that the only decision he had made was not to make a decision. \n Kevin Sack \n Congo Leader Buried \n President Laurent D. Kabila, who was assassinated by a bodyguard in the capital's presidential palace, was buried in a state funeral that raised grave doubts about who will control the Congo's government. \n His son and successor, Joseph Kabila, who is in his early 30's, sat at the funeral between President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. The older presidents, who are the Congo's main allies, deployed their own soldiers to guard Kinshasa, leaving Congolese soldiers on the sidelines. By the end of the week, Joseph Kabila was sworn in as Congo's new president. \n Norimitsu Onishi \n 37 New Red Hats \n By naming 37 new cardinals \u2014 10 from Latin America \u2014 John Paul II enhanced the chances that the next pope could represent a part of the Third World that is home to almost half of the world's Roman Catholics. But predictions about a conclave are invariably risky. \n Western Europe actually made the biggest gains, increasing its weight in the college of cardinals from 36 percent of the electors to 38 percent. Many of those cardinals, however, are closer to the voting age limit of 80 than their Latin American counterparts, who now make up 20 percent of the college. \n After Feb. 21, the day cardinals receive their red hats, there will be 128 voting cardinals, 118 appointed by this pope in large part because they followed his teachings and share his basic principles. \n Alessandra Stanley \n Airwave Auction Ends \n The largest auction ever conducted by the Federal government ended with $17 billion in bids for a share of the airwaves, mostly from the nation's largest wireless telephone companies and their partners. Small entrepreneurs that were supposed to receive special treatment in order to encourage competition complained that the giants dominated the auction through alliances with startups. The big winner, and the only major company not to team up with a small business, was Verizon. It will pay almost $9 billion for more than 100 licenses, including two in New York for more than $4 billion. \n Stephen Labaton \n Greenspan Backs Tax Cut \n Speaking before Senate Budget Committee, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, shifted from his position that reducing the national debt should be the focus of fiscal policy. Mr Greenspan said that improvements in the economy's long-term potential and swelling surplus projections had \"reshaped the choices and opportunities before us\" to permit a combination of debt reduction and tax cuts. His guarded endorsement gave new impetus to the Republican effort to push through the biggest tax reduction since the Reagan administration. \n Oil Spill Shifts Away From Gala\u0301pagos Islands \n After inexplicably running aground on a reef, an oil tanker on a regular supply run from the Ecuadorean port of Guayaquil to San Cristo\u0301bal in the Gala\u0301pagos Islands spilled more than 150,000 gallons of heavy fuel into waters that are the habitat of some of the world's rarest marine and bird species. An environmental disaster was avoided only because winds and currents shifted soon after the leak began, carrying the fuel away from remote islands where large colonies of sea lions, marine iguanas and blue- footed boobies live. \n Larry Rohter \n Confession in Killings of 5 at Fast-Food Restaurant \n Last spring, in a case that drew national attention because of its extreme brutality, seven workers at a Wendy's restaurant in New York City were shot, five fatally. A defendant in the case, Craig Godineaux, pleaded guilty and then stunned a courtroom packed with the victims' relatives with a harrowing account of how the fast-food workers were methodically bound, gagged and shot in a basement freezer. Mr. Godineaux, who is mentally retarded and cannot face the death penalty in New York, said that his co defendent, John B. Taylor, shot two of the workers, and then told him to \"finish the job.\" \"So after John gave you the gun, what did you do?\" a prosecutor asked. \"I shot everybody else,\" he said. \n Sarah Kershaw \n Power Struggles \n California continues to struggle with a crisis that seems surreal at its core: the state that is the epicenter of the nation's high tech economy has been repeatedly struck by the failure of a vital piece of its electrical service. State leaders edged toward a first- step solution, negotiating to buy power on long-term contracts at reasonable prices, then pass it on to the state's near-bankrupt utilities. The state would float bonds to finance the deal, perhaps in exchange for receiving utility stock that could be sold to repay the cost once the market rebounded. Consumers would also pay through an extension of recent rate increases. But officials warned that a crash program to conserve energy and finish construction of new power plants would still be needed to avoid blackouts at times of peak demand this summer. \n Todd S. Purdum \n Chinese Protesters Set Themselves on Fire \n Five members of the Falun Gong movement set themselves ablaze in the middle of Tiananmen Square, capping months of almost daily smaller acts of civil disobedience by group members. Despite an 18-month crackdown on the sect, China has been unable to suppress or even identify its followers, and on Jan. 1, its leader, Li Hongzhi, announced on his Web site that followers should not practice forbearance in the face of unreasonable attacks. \n Texas Fugitives Captured \n One of the nation's most intense manhunts in recent years ended when the authorities in southern Colorado captured six of seven fugitives who had escaped from a Texas prison 42 days earlier. The seventh shot himself to death during negotiations for his surrender. All seven had been serving lengthy terms for violent crimes and were facing additional charges in the shooting death of an Irving, Tex., police officer who interrupted a robbery on Christmas Eve. \n Television played a major role in the apprehensions. The men were found after someone recognized them on the program America's Most Wanted, and before the last two men agreed to give themselves up peacefully, they were allowed to give an interview with a Colorado Springs television reporter to complain about the prisons in Texas. \n Michael Janofsky \n Fewer Talkers in Peace Talks \n With time running short before Israel's Feb. 6 election, Palestinians and Israelis unexpectedly sat down for new peace talks \u2014 their first serious discussions since the failed Camp David summit in July. They started the day after the departure of the Clinton administration and its peace team, a ubiquitous presence at previous such sessions. \n The former president and his Middle East advisers will not be missed, the Palestinians suggested in a caustic written assessment of the unsuccessful U.S. attempt to broker a local peace deal. The Israelis are far more generous in their appraisal of President Clinton's efforts \u2014 but they, too, said the two sides appeared for now to be making more progress on their own, without any intermediaries. \n William A. Orme Jr. "}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MUSLIMS; Tough but Hopeful Weeks For the Muslims of Laramie\n2001-10-18T05:00:00.000Z\nIn the first week after the September attacks, when Saha Waheed had become perhaps the most visible Muslim in the cowboy state of Wyoming, she was walking at dusk when two men rushed up behind her and said that anyone who wore a scarf on her head should die, she said.\nA few days later, a truck jumped a lane and nearly ran her down in a crosswalk, Ms. Waheed said. And this week, the post office refused to deliver a box of cookies she wanted to mail to a friend. When she was asked for identification, she said, she produced a Wyoming driver's license, her university ID and two credit cards, but the post office still wouldn't take the package.\n''The weird thing is, I'm about as Wyoming as you can get,'' said Ms. Waheed, the only student at the University of Wyoming to wear the traditional head scarf, a hijaab. ''I moved here when I was 1 1/2 years old.''\nAnother Muslim woman, Barbara Ghaddar, was forced to flee the Laramie Wal-Mart with her two daughters when someone approached them and shrieked, ''Oh, my God -- the terrorists are here,'' she said. Mrs. Ghaddar is from Iowa, born and reared in the Midwest.\nIt has been a rough five weeks for the seven Muslim families who live in Laramie, which sits like a mirage on the wind-raked tabletop of the nation's least-populated state. Some of the families, who stand out because of their skin color or clothes, said they were afraid to go outside for days on end.\nBut it has also been a time of pleasant surprises, as other residents try to learn more about an unfamiliar religion that has taken root 7,220 feet above sea level.\nLaramie is where Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student, was beaten, tied to a fence post and left to die in 1998. But the town is now invoking Mr. Shepard's name as a call for tolerance to let Laramie's Muslims know they can live here without fear.\n''After a few of these hate calls and incidents, we decided to get together with the Muslims, and I admit that some of the pastors were scared,'' said Kenny Beauchene, a Christian minister who works for the Salvation Army. ''We were saying, 'What if they're terrorists?' ''\nAnd even before the Sept. 11 attacks, some Muslims here say, many people assumed that anyone who practiced Islam was suspect. ''The biggest misconception is that you're either a wife-beater or a terrorist,'' said Shah Dayar, who heads a small Muslim student group at the university.\nThe families have roots in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kashmir, Bangladesh and Lebanon. They still care about the fights of the countries they or their parents left. But even though many of them criticize American foreign policy for what they say is favoritism toward Israel, they say they their hearts and most of their minds are with this country.\n''This country is the very best,'' said Syed Husain, a retired University of Wyoming mathematics professor who was a pioneer 37 years ago, the first Muslim in town. ''You can't get a greater country.''\nAlthough there are millions of people practicing Islam in the United States, only pockets of the faith can be found in much of the Rocky Mountain region. ''When you talk about a minority, we are the ultimate minority,'' said Sherry Omar, a Muslim from Pocatello, Idaho.\nWyoming has just a single area code, and even the governor lists his home phone in the book. It is not hard for a single human being to stand out on the high prairie, let alone a Muslim wearing something other than a cowboy hat or baseball cap. In all of Wyoming, there are only 22 Muslim families, Muslim leaders say.\n''We are a very conservative state. Everyone is a Republican and almost everyone is white,'' Mr. Husain said.\nMr. Husain and his wife, Zubaida, raised their five children here. They knew they were exotic in Laramie, he said, but they never felt shunned or shamed. ''When my family comes to visit from Pakistan, they don't like Laramie,'' he said. ''But I have always liked it.''\nHe bought a small, blue stucco house in the city and established it as Wyoming's first mosque. The compass inside points toward a big cottonwood tree outside and beyond to Mecca. The mosque initially served as a spiritual refuge for students, but over time, as Muslim families settled in Laramie, more people began to use the blue house as their regular place of worship.\nBut after the terrorist attacks, even the long-established Wyoming Muslims suddenly felt like strangers. Rocks were thrown at the window of a home of a Kuwaiti family, the police said. The mosque was egged twice, and a caller phoned in to say, ''Why don't you go back to the desert where you came from?''\nBut even as Muslims here were feeling Laramie's back hand, they also felt a wave of sentiment of another kind.\n''We had flowers and fruit baskets left at the mosque, and people called in to say they would be willing to do our shopping, or to escort us outside if we were afraid,'' said Sadrul Ula, the spiritual leader for Laramie's Muslims.\nInside the home that Mr. Husain built nearly four decades ago, his wife was afraid. Their five children have become American success stories, with a doctor and an Army major stationed at a base in Washington State among them. But she was concerned about scattered outbreaks of hostility.\n''And then our neighbors called up, one after the other, and they told us not to be afraid to go outside, and they said they would watch the house,'' Mrs. Husain said. ''That made me feel very good.''\nNow, in the surge of curiosity about Islam, the Muslims of Laramie are being queried like never before.\n''I was afraid for awhile to have my business cards out,'' said Khurshid Khan, who runs a motel here. ''But now it is O.K. People are trying to understand Islam.''\nAt an interfaith service several weeks ago, Laramie's Lutherans, Catholics, Jews and evangelical Christians prayed with the Muslims for the first time. They also invoked the name of Mr. Shepard.\n''We said, 'How can we do right by him?' '' said the Rev. Sally Palmer. ''That murder awakened us to the worst that we can be. And we are not like that.''\nAfter praying and expressing mutual support, there was an after-church potluck. That, too, offered the Muslims a chance to teach.\n''We brought our casseroles,'' Mr. Beauchene said. ''And they brought -- oh, boy -- some of the best food I've ever had. The tabouli was incredible.''"}, {"text": "Vengeance Destroys Faces, and Souls, in Cambodia\n2001-07-22T05:00:00.000Z\nIt is a form of revenge that is intended to be worse than murder. Every time the victim looks into the mirror she will know: I am ugly now.\nThe fleeting smile of Som Rasmey is still disconcertingly beautiful. But her face is ribbed and ruined by acid, her left eye red and staring, her burned scalp barren.\nAfter the screaming, thrashing attack 20 months ago the scorned wife who drenched her with acid, Minh Rinath, returned to make the message explicit. ''He is mine now,'' she said. ''He will never want you again.''\nMiss Som Rasmey, who is now 24, had a particular kind of beauty -- lustrous, proud, the kind that could be as intimidating as it was alluring.\nThe attack, in which three other women held her down by her arms and legs and hair, has not only robbed her of her looks; it has crushed her soul.\n''I have the soul of a dead woman now,'' she said as tears streamed down her face. ''My body is alive but my soul is dead.''\nIn the past two years, there has been a horrific surge in acid attacks in Cambodia, most of them carried out -- in contrast to places like Bangladesh -- by wives against the lovers of their husbands. One local human rights group, Licadho, recorded 20 such attacks last year in a sort of imitative mass hysteria.\n''The wife does not want you to die,'' said Maniline Ek, an American volunteer at a women's shelter here. ''They want you to live and suffer. It's torture. People look at your face and they say, 'Oh, she took someone else's husband.' ''\nThese are battles among the oppressed, the harsh intersection of mutual tragedies -- woman against woman. In Cambodia, power belongs almost exclusively to men. The philandering husbands are almost never the targets of attack.\nA local women's aid group, the Cambodian Women's Crisis Center, recorded only one instance last year in which a husband was the target. And it was the only instance in which the attacker was tried and punished.\nIt is common in Cambodia for men -- particularly men of power -- to take an unofficial second wife. The betrayal of the official wife is so familiar that popular songs have been written about it.\n''Our society does not condemn the men,'' said the director of the crisis center, Chanthol Oung. ''It feels their behavior is acceptable.''\nThe most highly publicized attack was carried out in late 1999 by a woman named Khourn Sophal, the wife of Svay Sittha, under secretary of state at the Council of Ministers.\nThe victim, an 18-year-old actress and singer named Tat Marina, was horribly disfigured when the woman and several bodyguards poured about five quarts of acid over her.\nA government spokesman, Khieu Thavika, described the attack as a personal matter ''for the first and second wife to resolve.'' Although charges have been brought against Mrs. Khourn Sophal, no move has been made to arrest her. Relatives of her victim say Mrs. Khourn Sophal telephones periodically to insult the young woman.\nThree years ago, the wife of an even higher official was implicated in the shooting death of Cambodia's most popular singer, Piseth Pilika. That official is the prime minister himself, Hun Sen. No one has been arrested or charged in that attack.\nTypically, the girlfriends or second wives of powerful men are poor young women who have little but beauty to offer them hope or prospects for the future. And when that leads to conflict, they are powerless.\nAt the age of 15, Miss Som Rasmey dropped out of school to earn money for her family by selling coconuts, cigarettes and gasoline at the roadside. Three years ago she graduated to serving drinks at a restaurant.\nLike many other young women who serve drinks, she soon attracted a patron, a powerful military colonel named Lim Sok Heng. Her life was transformed: beautiful clothes, holidays at the beach, even a trip to Hong Kong. And then a baby.\nWith time, Miss Som Rasmey said, she grew frightened by the colonel's brutality and by increasing threats from his wife. She tried to leave him but he imprisoned her in a small house under constant guard.\nHis obsession with her must have driven his wife mad. When at last she attacked, she was raging.\n''I'll throw the acid now!'' she shouted as her friends pinned her victim to the floor. Miss Som Rasmey had been nursing her 7-month-old daughter and had just time enough to toss her out of the way.\nHer lips tighten as she describes what followed and her speech is clipped and angry.\n''She emptied a bottle over my head,'' she said. ''Then another half bottle. I was burning all over. I struggled and I tried to break free. I ran into the yard and she ran after me. She had one more bottle and she wanted to throw it. She was shouting, and I was shouting, 'I'm burning; please help me.' ''\nThe attack ended when a group of neighbors surrounded Mrs. Minh Rinath with hatchets in their hands.\nAs they heaved Miss Som Rasmey onto a pallet to rush her to a hospital, she could hear her little girl screaming, the last time she would hear the baby's voice. After the attack, Colonel Lim Sok Heng and his wife took the baby home and Miss Som Rasmey cannot be sure whether she is now alive or dead.\nFollowing the attack, the colonel seized Miss Som Rasmey from the hospital and imprisoned her again, this time in Vietnam, for fear she would make trouble. Six months later, she escaped and returned to her home, so disfigured that at first her family did not recognize her.\nHer anger has not subsided. Miss Som Rasmey is the first victim to pursue her attacker in court, demanding compensation and the return of her child.\nAnd it is here that the fundamental law of Cambodia asserted itself: impunity. Cambodian courts consistently bow to the power of position and the persuasion of cash.\nAs Miss Som Rasmey put it: ''The rich and the poor are completely different. Prison is only for poor people. But people like Lim Sok Heng and his wife can do whatever they want and get away with it.''\nAt the trial last fall, the judge, Tith Sothy, displayed impatience with Miss Som Rasmey, cutting her off and ordering her not to waste his time ''talking about romance.''\nBut he was not an unsympathetic man. He could see who had been wronged here. The scorned wife, he said, had acted out of understandable feelings of jealousy.\nThe judge dismissed Miss Som Rasmey's demand for the return of her child. He sentenced her attacker, Mrs. Minh Rinath, to two years in prison for misdemeanor assault, suspended."}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED: PORTRAITS OF GRIEF: THE VICTIMS; The 'Joe Torre' of River Vale, a Matriarch, a Man Who Lived a Lesson\n2001-12-04T05:00:00.000Z\nHere are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.\nANGEL R. PENA\nRain or Shine\nRain. More rain. So much rain that ball fields became too soggy even for the fairy-light footsteps of a little girls' softball team. But the season had already begun, and the Eagle Paint Minors' coach wanted his girls to be ready.\nSo Angel R. Pena held batting practice in his backyard.\nMr. Pena was the Joe Torre of River Vale, N.J., girls sports. Whether it was softball, basketball or soccer, whether his girls Melissa and Sara played or not, he dedicated himself to his teams. ''He had a sense of magic about him,'' said Walter L. Slasinski, president of River Vale's Baseball/Softball Association.\nMr. Pena, 45, and his wife, Michele, lived across from Alexander Field, and he sometimes borrowed a lawn tractor to groom the diamond before a game. He ran a bilingual law practice for 16 years and then in August went to work at the insurance company Aon at the World Trade Center.\nThat same month, before the last game of the season, Mr. Pena hung American flags and bunting around Alexander Field.\nThe girls played well, but Melissa's team lost. They celebrated anyway.\nCOLLEEN DELOUGHERY\n'She Was Not Shy'\nColleen Deloughery's tiny backyard in Bayonne, N.J., was the center of the galaxy. A pool took up most of it, leaving barely enough space for a table and chairs. But no matter how many friends and relatives showed up on weekends -- dozens, scores, nobody kept count -- they squeezed in somehow: kids splashing, adults yakking, beer flowing, luscious barbeque aromas swirling.\n''There was always room for people,'' Patricia Marrese said of her sister's universe. ''I called it the magic yard.''\nOpen, spontaneous, generous, Mrs. Deloughery, 41, laughed a lot, and said ''I love you'' too much. Perhaps that's why everyone needed her so terribly -- not just her husband, Jay, and her ''shadows,'' Amanda, 8, and Michael, 5, or her sister and five brothers, but the menagerie of nieces, nephews and cousins, and the circus of friends and co-workers at Aon (99th floor, 2 World Trade Center).\nStrangers too. Jeanette Krupinski, a friend, recalled how Ms. Deloughery had stopped one day to talk to a homeless teenage mother living with her baby on the margins of a commuter station. ''After that, she started bringing things to the woman -- a stroller, a carrier, clothes, food, milk,'' Ms. Krupinski said. ''She was not shy. She did wonderful things.''\nPABLO ORTIZ\nThe Paradigm of Patience\nPablo Ortiz had been a military man, a Navy Seal, and he had a military discipline. He was fussy. He was relentlessly neat. ''He liked his clothes ironed a certain way,'' said his wife, Edna Kang-Ortiz. ''They had to be ironed legs first and the crease had to be perfect. The shirts couldn't have any wrinkles. I tried to do it and couldn't please him.''\nFine. He handled the laundry. He ironed her clothes too, and did they look good.\nBefore they got married in March of last year, they compared their strong and weak points. Mrs. Kang-Ortiz confessed she was a terrible cook. No problem. He did all the cooking.\nMr. Ortiz, 49, superintendent of construction for the Port Authority, lived in Staten Island with his wife, and she liked to say, ''People come into your life to teach you a lesson. He taught me a lot of lessons. I was materialistic. I have become less materialistic. I learned from his strength. I learned from his patience.''\nIn May, the sister of Mrs. Kang-Ortiz had some difficulties and needed to move to the Ortiz home with her two children. Mr. Ortiz was entirely supportive. ''He would say to me, 'As long as you're happy, it's cool,''' his wife said. ''His feeling was, 'You make the wife happy, you're happy.' ''\nROBERT LEBLANC\nAn Insatiable Globetrotter\nHe had the itchiest feet. Robert LeBlanc's insatiable desire to see the world meant he would not even have embarked on one trip when he would already be sketching out the next.\n''We were due to leave for Argentina right after Sept. 11,'' said his wife, Andrea LeBlanc. ''Then we had tickets on the desk to go to India. We were planning to go to Sweden in the summer. Last year, we celebrated his birthday in Burma.''\nMr. LeBlanc, 70, was a professor emeritus of geography at the University of New Hampshire, and lived in Lee, N.H., with his wife. Though he had retired from teaching nearly there years ago, he remained an active and restless scholar. On Sept. 11, he was on United Airlines Flight 175 to a geography conference in Los Angeles.\n''He didn't just want to read books about people,'' Mrs. LeBlanc said. ''He wanted to go there. He wanted to smell the smell and taste the food and talk to the people.''\nThere were not many places he had not been. Granted, he had never set foot in Antarctica. But he did live on an ice island near Greenland on two occasions when he was in college. And he worked once on a glacier, taking core samples.\nNow his wife faces the considerable task of sorting out his frequent-flier mileage. ''There are seven different airlines he has frequent-flier mileage with,'' she said. ''It's impossible.''\nDIANNE GLADSTONE\nOn-the-Money Instincts\nAt 24, Dianne Gladstone, the meticulous young tax official, followed her romantic instincts. She would marry this fellow who had offered -- on a blind date no less -- a pricey dinner at Maxwell's Plum, in Manhattan's archetypal 1970's singles spot. A year later, she was a Mrs.\nAnd as in her public life -- 37 years at the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance -- her instincts were right on the money. She and Herb Gladstone, a crane operator, skied, hit the Broadway shows, traveled. Each year they celebrated the holidays at the Queensboro Hill Jewish Center, where they were married, and then it was off to the Caribbean.\nEven at home, she was, ''organized, maybe too organized,'' Mr. Gladstone recalled. In their Forest Hills home she had tax files going back to when they had met, he said, recalling her fondness for her tax work as section chief in Tower Two, 86th floor.\nYet in her favorite photo, on the beach at Provincetown at sunset last Labor Day, Dianne Gladstone, at 55, looked as happy as Mr. Gladstone could ever remember, perhaps because her thoughts were far away from tax codes, the paper shredder and the job she treasured. She had decided to retire -- to their new house, near the water, on the north fork of Long Island. The moving date was next April.\nVINCENT F. GIAMMONA\nBorn to Be Wild\nAt about 1:30 p.m. on Sept. 7, Lt. Vincent F. Giammona was at Coney Island, flashing his fireman's badge and, once again, pushing the limits.\nHe had just spent the morning exploring the aquarium with his wife, Theresa, and their two youngest daughters -- Nicolette, 4, and Daniella, 2. They had started back home to Valley Stream, when, suddenly, he turned the car around. He couldn't go to Coney Island without riding the Cyclone roller coaster.\nBut the Cyclone would not open until 6 p.m., Lieutenant Giammona was told. He smiled and jabbered about his upcoming birthday (he would turn 40 in four days, on Sept. 11th). Soon, the Cyclone was creaking up into the sunshine, carrying one passenger. His daughters cheered.\nHe lived for moments like this. Using fake buck teeth, an accent or his infamous Elvis costume, he would transform household errands or roll call at the firehouse into improv comedy. At sporting events involving his two older daughters -- Francesca, 8 and Toni-Ann, 6 -- his cheering was an aerobic workout. At Ladder 5 on Houston Street, he taught rookies about high-rise fires and downtown bars. They called him ''Lieutenant Fun.''\nThe morning of Lieutenant Giammona's 40th birthday, Theresa would hear his voice for the last time: he said goodbye during a brief phone call while hurrying to the World Trade Center. On Sept. 7, though, when the Cyclone started its descent, she heard him shout with joy.\nMOHAMMAD S. CHOWDHURY\nNew York: The Place to Be\nTo Mohammad Sallahuddin Chowdhury, 38, of Queens, New York was the place to succeed -- especially if you were confident, smart and very good-looking.\nHe was supporting his pregnant wife and 6-year-old daughter by serving banquets at Windows on the World, but that was only temporary. He had a master's degree in physics from Bangladesh, where he grew up, and had studied real estate and computer science in this country. After a few doleful years in Baltimore, he was determined to stay in New York. He knew something good would come up.\nMeanwhile, he had a new baby to look forward to. It was due in September.\n''If it's a boy,'' he told Baraheen Ashrafi, his wife, ''we'll have a perfect family.'' On Sept. 13, Farqad Chowdhury was born -- 8 pounds 10 ounces, with deep black eyes like his father's. ''Very expressive,'' said Mrs. Ashrafi. ''Eyes, like he's trying to tell me something.''\nROSANNE LANG\nEncircled by Family\nEven in a family of 12 siblings, Rosanne Lang stood out.\n''She danced the longest, sang the loudest -- even though she couldn't carry a tune -- and she loved the fiercest,'' said her brother, Gerard.\nAt 42, Ms. Lang was an equities trader at Cantor Fitzgerald, a job that afforded her a nicely landscaped home with a pool in Middletown, N.J., and a share, with two siblings, in a beach house in Sea Bright, N.J.\nShe was the first girl after her parents had six sons. They grew up in Brooklyn, but eventually most of them, including the parents, Rose and William, ended up in the Middletown area. Ms. Lang moved to Los Angeles with her husband and infant son, Michael, but after a divorce, she moved to New Jersey, and forged a life for herself and Michael, now 17, surrounded by family.\n''Rosanne was a self-made, successful woman,'' said William Lang, the oldest of her 11 siblings, who also lives in Middletown. ''She was successful in spite of the fact that we all had our preconceived notions about her. After all, she had six older brothers. She was this amazing woman, always smiling.''\nThe Lang family experienced a double tragedy on Sept. 11: William Lang's son, Brendan, 30, also died.\nBRENDAN LANG\nHardworking and Ambitious\nOn Sunday, Nov. 23, Sandy Lang came by her in-laws' home and told her father-in-law, William Lang, that she was going down to Long Beach Island to leave some candles where her husband, Brendan, had proposed to her. ''I asked, do you want company, and she said, 'Absolutely,''' Mr. Lang said. So together they drove through a pouring rain. As soon as they got to the beach, the rain stopped.\n''See, he's speaking to you,'' Mr. Lang told his daughter-in-law.\nBrendan Lang, 30, was a project manager for Structure Tone, and was doing work at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.\nHe called his parents to tell them about a plane hitting the first tower, and that he had a ''plan.''\nThey believe that after calling them he went to help his aunt Rosanne Lang, who worked in the first tower. Neither of them made it out.\nBrendan and Sandy were married for three years. They had recently purchased a home, next door to Middletown. Brendan was hardworking and ambitious, Sandy Lang said, but family was everything to him.\nThey had just gotten a puppy, a golden retriever they named Tucker.\nJUAN NIEVES\nInseparable From His Kids\nFor nearly 30 years, Juan Nieves, 56, of the Bronx, worked in the kitchen of the Russian Tea Room, making salads and appetizers. But when the restaurant was renovated he lost his job. He had four children. His wife, Irma, had postpartum depression and could not work. He was about 50 at the time, had no pension and had not finished high school.\nBut in 1994, he found a job making salads at Windows on the World for $7 an hour. When he died he was up to $12 an hour.\nEvery weekend he took his children to the beach or the park or the pool. He drove a mint-condition 1967 Mustang, which was new when he bought it.\nHe liked to be with his children so much that Carmen De La Cruz, his older sister, had to give him hints that they were teenagers now and wanted to be with their buddies.\nIf he was not with his children he was with his brother and sister. Two days before his death they went to South Street Seaport, where he pointed to the top of the north tower. ''That's where I work,'' he told them.\nJOSEPH MAFFEO\n'Joey Pockets'\nThere was always a project under way when Joseph Maffeo, T.J. Beinert and Robert Melloy got together. Which was pretty much always.\nAs teenagers, the friends spent a summer cruising Staten Island in a Cadillac they made into a convertible by sawing off the roof.\nMr. Maffeo was the handyman. ''He always had the right nut or the right bolt,'' Mr. Beinert said. As a firefighter, Mr. Maffeo, 30, was called Joey Pockets because he sewed so many onto his bunker gear to make room for gadgets.\nHe carried a black duffel bag with rope, gloves, water and a can of tuna. Just in case.\nThat is why his wife, Linda, kept hoping, even after many other missing firefighter's wives had given up on any hope that their husbands would survive.\n''Joey's got his tuna and water,'' Mrs. Maffeo, 26, had said. ''Joey's probably rationing it out,'' the wife of another firefighter at Ladder Co. 101 in Red Hook, Brooklyn, had added. The Maffeos, who have a 1-year-old son, Christopher Joseph, met while she was working as a bank teller. He asked her out. She agreed.\n''I wouldn't usually do that,'' Mrs. Maffeo said. ''You know when you can look at someone and tell they're a sweetheart?''\nDOUGLAS J. FARNUM\nJack of Many Trades\nDouglas J. Farnum opened a comic book store with a partner, tried his hand at stand-up comedy and worked at a series of bagel shops in Brooklyn, concocting sandwiches that sold like crazy.\nShortly after meeting Amy Leong, Mr. Farnum, 33, of Brooklyn, decided he wanted to be able to support a family. He asked his friend Gabriel Polmar to teach him about computers, and ended up finding work as a software specialist for Marsh & McLennan. He developed a talent for finding ways to make incompatible systems work, finding ''that the incompetence of others provided him with a challenge,'' Mr. Polmar said.\nLast year, Mr. Farnum and Ms. Leong married. Some things did not change. He continued to find pleasure in comic books, parking-lot frisbee games and the aisles of Toys ''R'' Us, where the couple acted ''like two big kids,'' Mrs. Farnum said.\nStill, some things changed. Mr. Farnum quit smoking and started driving like an old man -- a far cry from the stomach-churning old days, Mr. Polmar said. ''I have too much to lose,'' Mr. Farnum had explained.\nJOHN G. MONAHAN\nBastion of the Beach\nNo matter what else was going on in his life, John G. Monahan always had the beach. The beach where he went jogging and swimming. The beach where he read the newspaper before taking the train to his accounting job at Cantor Fitzgerald in 1 World Trade Center. The beach where he and his wife, Diane, courted and committed to each other and returned year after year, just the two of them, just for a few days.\nThese were along the shores of New Jersey, the state where Monahan lived his entire life. Five years ago, at age 42, he and his wife moved from Bayonne to Ocean Township, where they lived only two miles from the ocean and where they raised their two sons, Terrence, now 6, and CJ, now 3.\nBut it was farther south, at Cape May, where he and his wife found their escape. They went alone once a year, ''adults only,'' she said. The first time was in 1991; the trip was what Mrs. Monahan called a ''relationship-test kind of thing.'' ''You're at that point when nothing the other person does gets on your nerves,'' she said. ''In life, things get deeper as you move on, but that beginner phase is a really good spot too.''\nMICHAEL BEEKMAN\nAuthoritative and Calm\nAmidst the frenzy of the New York Stock Exchange, Michael Beekman, 39, was a rare figure of calm. His job was righting errors from the previous day's trading. He might spend a work day with a trader or two, explaining how they had actually lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on trades they had thought were profitable. ''A kill-the-messenger job,'' said John Furman, a co-worker at LaBranche & Company.\nBut Mr. Beekman would walk across the trading floor without hurrying and speak in a low voice. ''He would research something until he knew it completely,'' said Mr. Furman. ''He was very organized, with his little notes all lined up. When he presented the information, people knew he was right and so they never were angry with him.''\nHe lived a calm and orderly life in Staten Island, too, said Theodora, his wife. He spent most of his off-duty time with her and their two children -- Michael, 10, and Theresa, 8. If he went golfing, he would take his son. Occasionally he would disappear for a while -- and turn up at his sister-in-law's house, playing with her toddlers.\nThe Confirmed Dead\nFollowing are the names of the people most recently confirmed to have died in the World Trade Center disaster, according to the New York City medical examiner's office, which said the victims' families had been notified.\nDUFFY, Thomas W.\nGOGLIORMELLA, Michael\nMOUCHINSKI, Iouri A."}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED: THE BIG PICTURE; REBELS IN CONTROL IN KABUL AS TALIBAN TROOPS RETREAT; BIN LADEN HUNT INTENSIFIES\n2001-11-14T05:00:00.000Z\nNearly half of Afghanistan tumbled out of the hands of the Taliban today in a dramatic turn in the five-week-old war that shifted the focus of military operations to the south, intensified the hunt for Osama bin Laden and left unanswered the overarching political question of who will govern Afghanistan.\nAfter the weekend breakout of Northern Alliance forces at Mazar-i-Sharif and the rout of retreating Taliban forces, the Taliban commanders, with some exceptions, abandoned cities and fortified positions from Herat in the west to Taliqan in the northeast and then made a full retreat today from Kabul, the capital.\nUnited States warplanes bombed and strafed Taliban trucks and convoys where they could clearly identify them amid the chaos on the roads out of Kabul.\nUnited States intelligence agencies reported tonight that members of southern tribes opposed to the Taliban were massing near the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar. In the strategic eastern city of Jalalabad, residents reported that the Taliban had announced they were pulling out and turning the city over to its previous civilian administration.\nPentagon officials, who said United States Special Forces were also operating in the south, could not confirm whether Kandahar was weakening, but they said ''tribal groups'' near Kandahar and Jalalabad were apparently trying to seize airfields.\nIn Lowgar Province, south of Kabul, elders from the Pashtun tribes also announced that the Taliban had left the province.\nUnited States intelligence officials said the leaders of the Qaeda terrorist network and the Taliban high command were on the move, forced by the collapse of their military position in the north to flee to sanctuaries in southern Afghanistan, where Mr. bin Laden is believed to be now hiding.\n''This effort against terrorism and terrorists is far from over,'' said Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. ''In the short term, we will be focused on finding the Al Qaeda and the Taliban leadership.''\nGen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that virtually overnight the Northern Alliance, which had controlled only 15 percent of Afghan territory, had extended that control to 40 percent of the country.\nMr. Rumsfeld defended the attacks on Taliban columns in retreat.\n''They are not surrendering,'' he said. ''They are not throwing down their weapons, they're moving their vehicles, and it's a perfectly legitimate and attractive target.''\nIn New York, the United Nations Security Council said it was accelerating efforts to organize an Afghan high council meeting within a week in hopes that disparate ethnic groups could agree on forming a government.\nA senior Bush administration official said it was urgent to create a new civil authority. ''The closer we get to a political administration, the more there is something to defect to, and that creates an opportunity for defectors to come into this process,'' the official said.\nSecretary General Kofi Annan instructed his special envoy for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, to send United Nations political advisers into Kabul as soon as ''security conditions permit'' to pave the way for a full return of the United Nations presence there.\nReports of summary executions and other human rights abuses by Northern Alliance soldiers raised concern among a number of leaders.\nIn Washington, where President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia were meeting, Mr. Bush said, ''We continue to work with the Northern Alliance commanders to make sure they respect the human rights of the people that they're liberating.''\nBut both Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin in recent days have used their influence, first, to admonish Northern Alliance leaders against occupying Kabul, and, second, to urge them to ''recognize,'' as Mr. Bush said today, ''that a future government must include representatives from all of Afghanistan.''\nThe Northern Alliance foreign minister, Abdullah Abdullah, said that this was the goal of the alliance. He said its forces had entered the capital after having pledged not to do so only to prevent violence and looting. Mr. Abdullah, speaking in Kabul hours after the Taliban retreat, said the alliance invited all Afghan groups there for negotiations about Afghanistan's future. He said the group also had invited the United Nations to send teams to Kabul to help the peace effort.\nGen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani president, expressed frustration at the sudden turn on the battlefield that has given the minority ethnic groups of the Northern Alliance a political and military advantage over the predominant Pashtuns.\nSpeaking in Istanbul, where he stopped for consultations on the way home from New York, General Musharraf said that the military occupation of Kabul was a cause of ''atrocities of the past and they must not be repeated.'' He recommended that a multinational force led by Muslim countries intervene as soon as it could be assembled. For the first time, General Musharraf said that Pakistani armed forces would take part in such a force.\nA senior Bush administration official said tonight that this suggestion was ''not appropriate.'' He added that the United States was still discussing sending in United Nations teams to create an ''interim administration where the U.N. could help administer'' the liberated parts of the country as a ''neutral security presence in Kabul.''\nAt the same time, he said, Turkey, Jordan, Indonesia and Bangladesh all have offered troops for a Muslim-led peace keeping force, but it might take weeks to assemble them.\nIn Islamabad, Aziz Ahmad Khan, a Foreign Office spokesman, did not insist that Pakistani troops be part of any multinational force inserted into Afghanistan, but he emphasized that ''Pakistan holds the view that the Northern Alliance must not occupy Kabul.'' He said that whatever force was assembled should be sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council.\nIn London, Prime Minister Tony Blair said at a news conference that the coalition ''can make real progress toward the filling of the current power vacuum in Kabul, but we need a U.N. presence there as soon as possible.''\nMr. Blair said that the Taliban was in ''disarray'' and that its flight from Kabul opened the way for the international aid groups who have been standing by to deliver food, blankets and temporary shelter to up to seven million Afghan refugees who United Nations officials say are at risk of starvation this winter.\nThough a venue has not been selected to gather the Afghan elders who will form a new government, Mr. Brahimi said in New York today that his plan for governing a post-Taliban Afghanistan called for convening a ''provisional council'' of elders from the Northern Alliance, leaders of the Pastun tribes, the former king, Mohammad Zahir, and other groups that have been meeting in Cyprus to set up a two-year ''transitional administration'' that would preside over the drafting of a constitution.\n''The challenge in Afghanistan is going to be the creation of good governance,'' Mr. Brahimi told the Security Council. ''And that depends on the formulation of clear and fair rules of the game.''"}, {"text": "Students Get Back to Routine, but Sept. 11 Fears Linger\n2001-11-21T05:00:00.000Z\nFor many days after she returned to class, Kelly Chan, a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, could not help but be distracted by the horrific scene she witnessed on Sept. 11.\n''I would be, like, playing that image over and over in my head,'' she said. ''I just couldn't absorb what went on in the classes.''\nOn that Tuesday, like scores of other classmates, she saw the north tower spewing gigantic flames beyond the windows of her classroom. The scene looked ''like a deep cut in the knee, gushing blood,'' as one classmate described it.\nMs. Chan's grades have dipped somewhat this semester; she isn't sure whether the drop was a result of the attack. Still, her mom has worried out loud, urging her to focus on her schoolwork.\nBut sheer willpower has not been enough. Ms. Chan has already resumed all her routines. She rides the A train from her Queens home to her downtown school, takes advanced placement European history and plays piccolo in the school band. She still smiles at everybody. But from time to time she has nightmares set off by Sept. 11.\nHer lingering reactions, which come more than two months after the attack, are not uncommon at Stuyvesant, one of the city's most competitive public high schools, which is four blocks from the World Trade Center site. The urgency of earning good grades and gaining admissions to top colleges seems to have reclaimed the attention of most of the school's 3,000 students. They say that if they are losing any sleep, it is more because of stress over tests than post-Sept. 11 anxieties.\nMany students, preoccupied with appearing strong or unwilling to reopen the healing wound, would rather not talk about their fears with anyone, including the school counselors assigned to help them. And most of these teenagers want to believe that the attack has had no direct impact on their lives.\nBut in myriad ways, visible and invisible, the terror attack has left its indelible mark on their young lives.\nTake Sarah Kahn, a senior and native of Bangladesh. ''We are over it now,'' she declared. ''We don't really have time to think about it.''\nBut a moment later, she added, ''I am often scared.'' She is sure that the terrorists will some day bomb the subway, her main means of getting to school. And recently, when a G train she was riding stopped in a tunnel in Brooklyn, she thought she was going to die.\n''Some kids are really struggling with it, some are fine,'' said Holly Ojalvo, an English teacher at Stuyvesant and the student newspaper's faculty adviser. ''It's a range.''\nMs. Chan and her friends and fellow sophomores, Yvette Wojciechowski and Emily Cooperman, recently exchanged nightmares as they sat in a cafe near their school, giggling and somewhat embarrassed by their reveries.\nMs. Cooperman dreamed of a jet-powered boat speeding into tall buildings, Ms. Wojciechowski of bombs flying overhead as she rode the subway, and Ms. Chan of being stuck in the Empire State Building during a stampede in the dark.\nBut such candid moments are rare. Discussing their fears only reopens the wounds and can often be embarrassing, they said. Often, these teenagers try their best to pretend that the attack had never happened, but its reminders are abundant, on the streets, in the news media, and even within their school.\nThe students, for instance, now have to wear ID tags in school. They are no longer allowed to roam outside the building during lunch breaks. And groups of air-quality monitors, in fluorescent orange vests, sometimes come in during classes to test the air.\nThe air is safe, said the Board of Education's deputy chancellor for operations, David Klasfeld. One hundred air tests are conducted every day at the school, and no toxic substance has been found, though dust levels are occasionally higher than the standards set by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. But as many as 80 students and teachers have visited the school nurse with a range of ailments including headaches, itchy eyes, coughs and even bloody noses.\nThe majority of Stuyvesant students would rather not make such symptoms and signs a big issue. In fact, in conversations with teachers or fellow students, they try not to touch upon the topic of the attack at all.\n''Most kids don't seem to want to dwell on it,'' Ms. Ojalvo. ''They want to concentrate on their work.''\nAnticipating a great need for psychological counseling, Stuyvesant made 19 counselors available to the teenagers. But there was no influx of students seeking their help, probably because they would rather appear strong in front of their peers. ''When one of the psychiatrists came to my class and told us we could talk to him about anything, no one really went to him,'' said Edward Chan, a junior. ''He just sort of sat there.'' The Board of Education confirmed that the counselors had not been busy.\nIn fact, the students have found their own way toward catharsis. Yesterday, a commemorative magazine issue of the student newspaper, The Spectator, with articles chronicling the emotional reactions of students, was distributed throughout the New York metropolitan region with The New York Times. ''Working on the newspaper during this period and keeping their classmates informed have been therapeutic,'' Ms. Ojalvo said.\nIn classrooms, the Stuyvesant teachers have generally been quiet about the current events. ''The teachers are really busy trying to catch up with the work,'' said Ms. Wojciechowski. ''They cannot afford to lose any more time.''\nAfter the attack, Stuyvesant had students stay at home for one week and then housed them for almost two weeks in classrooms of Brooklyn Technical High School. There, the teachers had to squeeze 40-minute classes into 26 minutes due to shortened class periods.\nOne lingering preoccupation among students since the attack is concern for their Muslim classmates, who number about 30, according to the Board of Education. In the first few days after Sept. 11, when the students were still staying at home, Mohammad Alam, a senior, received many e-mail messages from his non-Muslim friends ''to show support and solidarity,'' he said.\n''When we returned to school, my friends were really cool. Nobody said anything about the attack. Everyone just understood everything,'' he said. ''My math teacher came to me and asked me, 'Are you O.K.? I have been worried about you.' ''\nBut still, Mr. Alam, 17, prefers not to talk about the attack while at school. A recent immigrant who moved to New York City from Pakistan at age 12, he said he was unwilling to make a judgment on the guilt of Osama bin Laden, or to fight in the United States military in Afghanistan even if he were drafted. Knowing that his views may be controversial, he keeps them to himself.\n''I don't want to stir up emotions in people, '' he said. ''You don't know who has suffered in what way.''\nBesides, Mr. Alam has college application deadlines to meet. His priorities right now are ''to get into a really good college, get a good job afterwards and support my parents and sisters,'' he said.\nLike Mr. Alam, a great number of students at Stuyvesant, where almost half of the school population is Asian, are new immigrants or children of new immigrants. In many cases, the parents' lack of firm roots in this country may have amplified their fear for their children. Ms. Wojciechowski said her parents, who arrived from Poland in 1985, got worried if she didn't call them on her cellphone every few hours.\nSimilarly, Adeline Lo, a sophomore, said her parents, who arrived in this country from Taiwan as young adults, would not let her visit some of the busiest parts of Manhattan, like Times Square.\nBut even in the worst of times, these teenagers have managed to discover something good. ''I see this as a training for stressful times later in life. It makes me stronger,'' Ms. Lo said. ''Before, I was easily affected by things around me. Like, when a good friend moved away or I got a bad grade, I would be hysterical.''\nFor Ms. Wojciechowski, Sept. 11 has brought a new outlook. ''My definition of a bad day has changed,'' she said. ''I sort of think if I can go through this, I can go through anything.''"}, {"text": "For a New Bay Ridge, A New Tony Manero\n2001-04-01T05:00:00.000Z\nIT was late on a Saturday night, a few minutes shy of midnight, when Maritza Gonzalez strode through the door of Club Rio in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.\nShe wore a black lamb's-wool coat with a mink fur collar and black leather boots elevated by four-inch heels. Visible under her coat was a black wrap blouse that revealed ample cleavage and, an inch or two south of her collarbone, a small tattoo of the Rolling Stones tongue logo. Walking slightly behind her was her boyfriend of a year, Steve Alonso, 32, a muscled New York City detective with a pencil-thin goatee, a small round earring in each ear and a megawattage smile.\nMs. Gonzalez greeted the doorman, a beefy man named Polo, with a kiss on his cheek and a few friendly words, and then did the same to Club Rio's owner, Nick Morone, who was surveying his domain with paternal concern. She leaned inches from his ear so as to be heard above the Latin-flavored music booming from the dance floor.\nAh, the dance floor.\nMs. Gonzalez, 36, has always loved to dance, and when she caught the beat her shoulders and hips started to sway.\nAs a child, when she would go grocery shopping with her mother, Maritza would boogie up and down the aisles, drawing stares from the other customers. As she grew older, the self-described ham relished the attention she attracted when she danced. She won a beauty contest partly because of her ability to sashay to the 1970's pop hit ''Reunited,'' by Peaches and Herb. But after a series of difficult and painful incidents, the dance floor also evolved into a refuge, a place where she forgot about the hassles of everyday life and got lost in the rhythms.\nIn this, she is reminiscent of another Bay Ridge personality: Tony Manero, the flamboyant disco king played by John Travolta in the 1977 film ''Saturday Night Fever.'' Both are never more comfortable than when they are in the center of a crush of sweaty bodies, with strobe lights flashing around them and music pounding their eardrums.\n''I shut myself off from everybody,'' Ms. Gonzalez said. ''I feel like I'm out there alone and it's like a thousand people are watching, and I'm there and you're not.''\nMr. Alonso said: ''She's an electrical fire. Something's always happening.'' Tony Manero was a wallflower by comparison.\nTwenty-five years ago this spring, New York magazine published ''The Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night,'' by Nik Cohn, the article that inspired the hugely popular Travolta film and seems to have sounded a deep truth about the times, even though the author admitted years later that much of the story was made up.\nIn both works, the lead character toils at a hardware store, waiting all week for Saturday night, when he and his friends make the scene at 2001 Odyssey, a club at 64th Street and Eighth Avenue on the northern fringe of Bay Ridge. The film calls Tony ''the Fred Astaire of Brooklyn''; the star of the article is ''the very best dancer in Bay Ridge.''\nOur Ginger Rogers, Ms. Gonzalez, is a surgical assistant at an oral surgeon's office on Fort Hamilton Parkway. But she is neither as young as Tony Manero nor as na\u00efve. She has experienced enough hardship to keep a team of screenwriters busy. And her Bay Ridge is a different place than the one portrayed in the movie.\n'The Same Bay Ridge' With Different Faces\nTwenty-five years ago, Bay Ridge was largely Italian, Irish and Scandinavian. When a Hispanic couple visit 2001 Odyssey in ''Saturday Night Fever,'' they are greeted with derisive shouts suggesting they go back to their own neighborhood. Today at Club Rio, at Fourth Avenue and 93rd Street, the dancers are a mix of nationalities, but Latinos are clearly in the majority. Every so often the D.J. draws spirited cheers when he shouts ''Boricua!'' (''Puerto Rico!'') into the microphone.\nJust across the street is a new club, Night Butterfly, which caters mostly to Russians. If you walk into Century 21, a large department store on 86th Street, you'll hear the Russian language spoken up and down the aisles. A few blocks over, near the site of the hardware store where Mr. Travolta's character worked in the movie, there are now a number of businesses serving Syrians, Lebanese and other Middle Eastern customers.\n''When I walk on Fifth Avenue I feel like I am back in Bethlehem,'' said the Rev. Khader El-Yateem, pastor of the Salam Arabic Lutheran Church, which, revealingly, had once been the Salem Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church. ''So many people are speaking Arabic.''\nThere are Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and other Asian newcomers in Bay Ridge, too. And two years ago, a Korean-American community center opened on Fourth Avenue.\n''It's still the same Bay Ridge, but a lot of the faces have changed,'' said Thomas Cucco, a Bay Ridge native who owns the Casa Calamari restaurant at 86th Street and Third Avenue. ''Sometimes I look around the dining room and it's amazing how many nationalities you see.'' Mr. Cucco serves porkless dinners to his Muslim patrons.\nThe census puts numbers on these changes. According to the 2000 data, non-Hispanic whites now make up 70 percent of the Bay Ridge population, a drop of 13 percentage points from 1990 and 24 percentage points from 1980.\nBut this family-oriented, middle-class neighborhood still has an Irish and Italian core. And the Norwegians, while few in number, still hold a parade every May 17, Norwegian Independence Day, drawing many back to the old streets.\n''As they are cruising down 86th Street in the movie, it is interesting to see what was standing in 1977 and realize that we've come a long way,'' said State Senator Vincent Gentile, a 1977 graduate of Fort Hamilton High School. ''It's changed significantly. But there are always points of contact with the past. You can still go to O'Sullivan's bar, or to Lento's for the best pizza in the city. Anybody that left Bay Ridge years ago can find the old neighborhood and certainly find some of the old haunts.''\nA growing number of national chain stores now dot the neighborhood's main thoroughfares, like the Starbucks -- the first in Bay Ridge -- that is rising on Third Avenue. But Kelly's bar still stands on Fourth Avenue, just as it did when Tony Manero strolled past it in the film.\nDespite its slowly altering face, Bay Ridge still has an insularity, a separateness that both the article and the movie tried to capture. Bounded by water to the north and west, it has always been a community with its own ethos, far from the modern spires of Manhattan that are visible just across New York Harbor.\n''People that are newcomers look at you a little differently,'' said Anthony Sayegh, a laborer with Local 79 who grew up in Bay Ridge and still lives there. ''They look at you like you are part of some kind of club.''\nThe Turbulent Life Of a Family Rebel\nMs. Gonzalez, who is Puerto Rican, is part of the new look of the neighborhood. She grew up on 54th Street in Sunset Park, just a few blocks to the north. One of eight children, she distinguished herself early on as the family rebel. ''I'm the craziest one of my brothers and sisters,'' she said. Her strict parents frowned upon her carefree ways. ''I wanted a life,'' she said. ''I wanted to live.''\nAt 13, she spent six months in a military academy. At 15, she ran away from home and moved in with her boyfriend's family. She was 17, a senior at Bay Ridge High School and pregnant, when she married her 19-year-old boyfriend, Jose Gonzalez.\nIn October 1982, a child, Venus Alexandra, was born. But during the birth the umbilical cord became wrapped around the baby's neck, causing oxygen to be cut off from her brain for a few seconds. It was enough to cause brain damage. The girl, now 18, has the intelligence level of a 10-year-old and attends a school for the developmentally disabled.\n''Everything was happening so fast,'' Ms. Gonzalez said. ''I didn't know anything about children and suddenly I have a child.''\nStill estranged from her parents, she suffered from postpartum depression as she tried to cope with her new life. She eventually got a job at a clothing store in Downtown Brooklyn -- ''some stupid store,'' she said -- and lived a straight family life for the next decade. ''The same thing every day for years,'' Ms. Gonzalez recalled. She had a second child, a son called J. J., in 1988. In 1989, she was hired at a dentist's office and began to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree at the New York University School of Dentistry.\nHer life took another sharp turn in 1992 when she discovered that her husband was having an affair. When Ms. Gonzalez learned that, she made the sign of the cross, packed a single bag of clothing, grabbed the children and fled to her mother, with whom she had improved relations. Within a month, chafing once again under her mother's rule, she found an apartment in Bensonhurst, determined to make a go of it as a single mother.\nMs. Gonzalez then tried her hand at modeling, eventually appearing in some print advertisements and fashion shows. A few small acting parts also came her way. She portrayed a gum-snapping prostitute in the television program ''New York Undercover'' and a receptionist in a police station house on ''L.A. Law.''\nDeveloping a Taste For the Night Life\nOver time, Ms. Gonzalez considered tasting the night life. With her strict parents and her stressful home life, she had never really gone clubbing.\n''It took a while,'' she said. ''I was so afraid to leave my kids with anybody. I love my kids to death. I want to do everything possible to make their lives better. I thought going out for even a second was taboo. You know, you're a mom, you're not supposed to do that. Because my daughter was the way she was, I felt so bad. But I said, 'Hello, I need a life.' I was depriving myself of having fun.''\nAnd when Ms. Gonzalez decides to do something, she goes all out. She and her friends would hit clubs all over the city, but they were regulars at Pastels, which is now called Legacy, on 88th Street in Bay Ridge. Before long, the managers knew them and let them in free.\n''We always had a good time,'' said Janette Astacio, one of Ms. Gonzalez's nightclubbing companions. ''Other friends like to sit on the side and drink. But she likes to dance. We would dance with each other like we were dating each other. And the guys would basically stare at us. We don't go out to pick up guys.''\nSome weeks Ms. Gonzalez, who continued working full time, would be on the town Thursday, Friday, Saturday and even Sunday evenings. ''Oh, my God,'' she said. ''It was like I was going to be a giant burnout.''\nWhat drew her to dance so much? Mr. Cohn's 1976 article may furnish an answer. ''It was a true sanctuary,'' he writes of his subjects' favorite club, a place where ''they took command, they reigned.''\nWith her new night life, Ms. Gonzalez was crossing into another dimension of the community.\n''There are a lot of different Bay Ridges,'' said one longtime resident. ''During the day you'll see the older residents of the neighborhood and also the young moms pushing strollers. On Thursday nights and weekend nights you'll see the singles and the bar- and club-hoppers. If you were only out on the street from noon to 4 o'clock each day, you would never know they were there.''\nTo make extra money, Ms. Gonzalez worked as a ''Bud Girl,'' going from club to club handing out Budweiser hats and T-shirts and promoting the company's products.\nIn 1996, she entered the Miss New York U.S.A. Petite Woman pageant. Ms. Gonzalez, who is 5 feet 3 inches tall, won the contest and finished third at the nationals, held in Kansas City, Mo. Her choice for the talent competition: dancing.\nIn the same year, Ms. Gonzalez, who by then had earned her Bachelor of Science degree, moved to Bay Ridge with her children and began her current job at the oral surgeon's office.\n''The office hasn't been the same since she's been here,'' said Carmela Adinolfi, a co-worker. ''Everyone used to be quiet. Now we're all out in the open. She can make anybody laugh. The patients come in really nervous and she makes them feel so much better. And she's always dancing around. One time, 'Livin' la Vida Loca' came on the radio, and she got on a dentist's chair and started dancing to it.''\nA Call From the Past With a Horrible Ending\nLife was going fairly well for Ms. Gonzalez until Nov. 12, 1998. Her estranged husband, whom she had never divorced and with whom she was still friendly, called her up at 3 a.m.\n''He was saying: 'I want to thank you for everything you've done. You've never turned your back on me,' '' Ms. Gonzalez said. ''And I said: 'Why are you talking like this? You're scaring me.' '' The next thing I heard was a big bang. I thought he had fallen. I stayed on the phone for three hours. I was just in denial. I was saying, 'Are you up yet?' ''\nFinally, Ms. Gonzalez called a friend and went over to his house, where they discovered her husband's bloody body. Mr. Gonzalez had committed suicide. He was 36.\nMs. Gonzalez, who said she had had no inkling that her husband was suicidal, plunged into a depression. She quit her job four times, always returning after a few disconsolate weeks away, and began to see a therapist. She cut herself off from her friends, changed her phone number and stopped going to church, her faith in God shaken. Ms. Astacio recalls having to spoon-feed her distraught friend.\n''I didn't know what to do,'' Ms. Gonzalez said. ''I would go places with my friends and I would get crying attacks. That was so not me. I was put on Prozac. But I didn't stay on it. I started working out like crazy in the gym, and that got me from the depression.\n''My kids have come a long way,'' she said. ''They will hear a song on the radio and they'll say, 'Remember, Dad liked that song.' I used to cry when they were sleeping because I didn't want to cry in front of them.''\nIt took a year before Ms. Gonzalez started to feel whole again. In January 2000, she started dating Mr. Alonso, who moonlights as a bodyguard for Eminem, Funkmaster Flex and other rap stars and was featured in a recent police recruitment campaign. He moved in with her six months ago.\n''I love him to death,'' she said.\nAnd Ms. Gonzalez has started going out again, with her boyfriend and a crew of girlfriends, many from the old neighborhood. Now she is a believer, not only in the ecstatic joy of dancing, but also in its redemptive powers. It has helped her through her heartbreak.\nHer night-out routine rarely changes. She has her hair done at Sonia's Unisex in Sunset Park. She says her hair is naturally auburn but that she accentuates it with dye. Her boyfriend is her colorist these days. Then it's off to Spice Nails, where Wendy Chong, the owner, works on her toenails, fingernails and eyebrows. Maybe afterward she'll go shopping. By 11:30 p.m. she's ready to party.\nLike Tony Manero, Ms. Gonzalez regards her hair as sacred. ''Don't touch my hair!'' she'll half-jokingly bark at anyone who comes too close.\nTimes change, but clubbing in Bay Ridge is still an occasion, and people come there from throughout southern Brooklyn on Saturday night. You won't see many men wearing Travolta-style platform shoes or clingy polyester shirts. Instead, in the line in front of Club Rio, the young men wear hair shaved close to the head, dark turtleneck sweaters hanging past the belt line and a chain or two on their chests. The music is different, too, but it's still loud and still all about the beat.\nOn a recent Saturday night, Ms. Gonzalez and Mr. Alonso headed to Spectrum, formerly 2001 Odyssey, the club made famous by ''Saturday Night Fever.'' The lit-from-underneath dance floor is still there, but the clientele has changed. It's now a gay club. But the couple don't care about that. They go for the music and the dancing.\nMs. Gonzalez was dressed casually, with a Marilyn Monroe T-shirt, high-heeled Steve Madden shoes and blue jeans. She ordered a Red Devil, a mixed drink that she thinks contains cranberry juice and vodka, and Mr. Alonso ordered a Heineken. After a few sips the two couldn't resist the call of the music. They headed out to the floor immortalized by John Travolta and danced until sweat poured from their bodies.\nAfter dancing her way back to the table, Ms. Gonzalez considered the state of her life: ''I guess after all the stuff that's happened to me, I'm happy.''\nShe added with an infectious smile: ''All I want is a house and a Mercedes, that's all I want.''\nThey laughed, and when these two laugh, they really laugh. A few minutes later, the conversation flagged, and that was all the incentive they needed. In an instant, they were back on the floor, staring into each other's eyes, dancing until Saturday night turned into Sunday morning."}, {"text": "Hispanic New York Shifted in 1990's\n2001-05-22T05:00:00.000Z\nNew York City's Hispanic population changed markedly over the last decade as the once dominant Puerto Ricans lost their plurality and the number of people of Mexican ancestry tripled.\nThat shift, and other contours in the city's ethnic landscape, emerged from 2000 census data that was released yesterday and provided new details about the state's increasingly diverse Hispanic and Asian minorities.\nOver all, the figures showed that the city's traditional ethnic heavyweights -- among Hispanics, the Puerto Ricans, and among Asians, the Chinese -- faced competition for the first time in the 1990's from other fast-growing groups.\nThe number of Puerto Ricans in the city slipped by 12 percent over the decade, a drop that demographers and community groups attribute to the accelerated movement of retirees back to the island and successful families to the suburbs.\nAt the same time, a surge of new immigrants from Latin America and the Dominican Republic magnified the effects of that population decline, reducing Puerto Ricans to a mere 36 percent share of the city's Latino population. In 1990, they represented slightly more than half of all Hispanics in the city.\nTheir reduced numbers, however, are unlikely to trim back Puerto Rican political dominance.\n''I don't think it changes the immediate makeup of the Latino leadership here, where Puerto Rican officials and policy makers are still the main voice speaking for all Latinos,'' said Juan Figueroa, president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund.\nInstead, he said, more diversity in the Hispanic population should ultimately produce a broader coalition of Latinos speaking on shared issues. ''It's not a zero-sum game,'' Mr. Figueroa added.\nMeanwhile, people of Mexican descent, nearly invisible in the panoply of Latino groups just 10 years ago, have become the third biggest single group of Hispanic New Yorkers, after Puerto Ricans and those of Dominican ancestry.\nStaten Island and Queens showed the biggest growth in people of Mexican background in the city, although comparable increases occurred over the decade in the suburban counties radiating out from New York, like Orange, Westchester and Dutchess.\n''New York became a destination over the past decade in part because Mexico had an economic crisis in 1994 and 1995,'' said Salvador Beltr\u00e1n del R\u00edo, the Mexican consul general in New York. ''At the time you also had a very strong anti-immigrant movement in California, so people didn't want to go there or they wanted to move from the West Coast to the East. Plus, compared with other states, the economy of New York and the Northeast in general has been strong, so there has been a lot of work.''\nColorful evidence of how that migration has become rooted in New York soil could be seen last Sunday in the shadow of Yankee Stadium, where the Diaz Mexican Soccer League opened its season with a day of music, fast food and ceremony at Macombs Dam Park.\nAs the No. 4 subway train rattled by above their heads and the mariachi band hired for the occasion took a break, hundreds of weekend sportsmen from Mexico paraded around the park in uniforms plastered with the names of beer distributors, soft drink companies, Mexican restaurants and groceries.\nThere were the Guadalajara Club, Atlas Tecuauti and Real San Sebastian, some with flags proclaiming their name and others accompanied by someone's girlfriend or sister or wife dressed in a long gown or miniskirt. The Diaz league, named for the Mexican-American businessman who owns it, is only one of at least six such leagues in the city and New Jersey.\nMost of the soccer players are relatively new arrivals.\n''When I first came, it was very hard because there weren't many Hispanic people near me,'' said one player, Martin Morales, a 28-year-old Manhattan restaurant worker who left his home in Mexico City for Manhattan in 1992.\n''But the next year, I looked around my neighborhood and in the yards I saw a few more Latinos,'' he recalled. ''The year after that, there were a few more. And now, everyone in all the yards around me is Latino. It's very comfortable.''\nDaniel Cisneros, another Mexico City native, came to New York eight years ago, at 17, with every intention of eventually returning home. But, in a typical immigrant pattern, life here began to bind him with responsibilities and relationships.\nHe started to make money working at a dry cleaner in Long Island City, Queens. He met a young woman, also an immigrant, from the Mexican state of Puebla. They married, and now Mr. Cisneros has a 6-year-old son, Christian, who is an American citizen because he was born in New York.\nAsked the name of his weekend soccer team, Mr. Cisneros responded, ''Las \u00c1guilas.'' Christian, on the other hand, answered the question in English: ''The Eagles.''\nNow, said Mr. Cisneros, it does not seem logical to go back to Mexico. ''Our country is poor,'' he said. ''We have to be here to help those who are left there.''\nCity planners say that the Mexican growth spurt largely reflects the recent migration of Mexicans to New York from other parts of the United States, and that these newcomers in turn will attract more family members from home.\n''Once you have a community here and a welcoming environment that includes social and employment connections, more people follow,'' said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission. ''What starts off as a trickle becomes a steady flow as long as it's a place where people want to come.''\nAbout half the reported growth in the population of the city as a whole and for individual ethnic groups is a result of better counting in the 2000 census, Mr. Rose added.\nNo one has accurate figures, but consular officials said that many of the area's Mexicans are probably living illegally in the country. While immigrants used to shuttle back and forth with relative impunity, they now face harsh penalties if caught at the border. The new laws, passed in 1996, appear to have encouraged more people to settle in the United States.\nThe latest census figures provided some information about Hispanics who identified themselves as Puerto Ricans, Mexicans or Cubans. All the rest -- including those of Dominican, Colombian or other Latin heritage -- were lumped together as ''other Hispanics.''\nIn New York City, long a magnet for immigrants from the Caribbean and now from South and Central America, that ''other Hispanics'' category encompasses more people than the other three combined, or more than 1.1 million people. Nationwide, by comparison, the ''other'' Hispanics accounted for less than one-third of the 35.3 million Hispanics counted in the 2000 census.\nThe trend toward more diversity in national origins was also evident among Asians, although less sharply so, according to the new census data.\nThe number of people of Chinese descent grew over the decade, but by barely 51 percent compared with growth of more than 90 percent between 1980 and 1990. The proportion of Asian New Yorkers who identified themselves as Chinese also slipped slightly.\nAt the same time, in a dynamic similar to that of Hispanics, other Asian groups appeared to grow at a faster rate than Chinese. The population of people of Indian descent, for example, increased by about 81 percent in both the city and across the state over the last decade.\nAnd the number of Asians who did not fit into one of the categories listed on the census form -- that is, people who did not identify themselves as Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese -- also doubled in the city. Among those are Bangladeshis and Pakistanis, two of the city's fastest-growing immigrant groups."}, {"text": "Hispanic New York Shifted in 1990's\n2001-05-22T05:00:00.000Z\n New York City's Hispanic population changed markedly over the last decade as the once dominant Puerto Ricans lost their plurality and the number of people of Mexican ancestry tripled. \n That shift, and other contours in the city's ethnic landscape, emerged from 2000 census data that was released yesterday and provided new details about the state's increasingly diverse Hispanic and Asian minorities. \n Over all, the figures showed that the city's traditional ethnic heavyweights \u2014 among Hispanics, the Puerto Ricans, and among Asians, the Chinese \u2014 faced competition for the first time in the 1990's from other fast-growing groups. \n The number of Puerto Ricans in the city slipped by 12 percent over the decade, a drop that demographers and community groups attribute to the accelerated movement of retirees back to the island and successful families to the suburbs. \n At the same time, a surge of new immigrants from Latin America and the Dominican Republic magnified the effects of that population decline, reducing Puerto Ricans to a mere 36 percent share of the city's Latino population.

The Diaz league, named for the Mexican-American businessman who owns it, is only one of at least six such leagues in the city and New Jersey. \n Most of the soccer players are relatively new arrivals. \n \"When I first came, it was very hard because there weren't many Hispanic people near me,\" said one player, Martin Morales, a 28-year- old Manhattan restaurant worker who left his home in Mexico City for Manhattan in 1992. \n \"But the next year, I looked around my neighborhood and in the yards I saw a few more Latinos,\" he recalled. \"The year after that, there were a few more. And now, everyone in all the yards around me is Latino. It's very comfortable.\" \n Daniel Cisneros, another Mexico City native, came to New York eight years ago, at 17, with every intention of eventually returning home. But, in a typical immigrant pattern, life here began to bind him with responsibilities and relationships. \n He started to make money working at a dry cleaner in Long Island City, Queens. He met a young woman, also an immigrant, from the Mexican state of Puebla. They married, and now Mr. Cisneros has a 6- year-old son, Christian, who is an American citizen because he was born in New York. \n Asked the name of his weekend soccer team, Mr. Cisneros responded, \"Las A\u0301guilas.\" Christian, on the other hand, answered the question in English: \"The Eagles.\" \n Now, said Mr. Cisneros, it does not seem logical to go back to Mexico. \"Our country is poor,\" he said. \"We have to be here to help those who are left there.\" \n City planners say that the Mexican growth spurt largely reflects the recent migration of Mexicans to New York from other parts of the United States, and that these newcomers in turn will attract more family members from home. \n \"Once you have a community here and a welcoming environment that includes social and employment connections, more people follow,\" said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission. \"What starts off as a trickle becomes a steady flow as long as it's a place where people want to come.\" \n About half the reported growth in the population of the city as a whole and for individual ethnic groups is a result of better counting in the 2000 census, Mr. Rose added. \n No one has accurate figures, but consular officials said that many of the area's Mexicans are probably living illegally in the country. While immigrants used to shuttle back and forth with relative impunity, they now face harsh penalties if caught at the border. The new laws, passed in 1996, appear to have encouraged more people to settle in the United States. \n The latest census figures provided some information about Hispanics who identified themselves as Puerto Ricans, Mexicans or Cubans. All the rest \u2014 including those of Dominican, Colombian or other Latin heritage \u2014 were lumped together as \"other Hispanics.\" \n In New York City, long a magnet for immigrants from the Caribbean and now from South and Central America, that \"other Hispanics\" category encompasses more people than the other three combined, or more than 1.1 million people. Nationwide, by comparison, the \"other\" Hispanics accounted for less than one-third of the 35.3 million Hispanics counted in the 2000 census. \n The trend toward more diversity in national origins was also evident among Asians, although less sharply so, according to the new census data. \n The number of people of Chinese descent grew over the decade, but by barely 51 percent compared with growth of more than 90 percent between 1980 and 1990. The proportion of Asian New Yorkers who identified themselves as Chinese also slipped slightly. \n At the same time, in a dynamic similar to that of Hispanics, other Asian groups appeared to grow at a faster rate than Chinese. The population of people of Indian descent, for example, increased by about 81 percent in both the city and across the state over the last decade. \n And the number of Asians who did not fit into one of the categories listed on the census form \u2014 that is, people who did not identify themselves as Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese \u2014 also doubled in the city. Among those are Bangladeshis and Pakistanis, two of the city's fastest-growing immigrant groups. "}, {"text": "George Harrison, Former Beatle, Dies at 58\n2001-11-30T05:00:00.000Z\n George Harrison, the Beatles' lead guitarist and the composer of several of the group's most beautiful songs including \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Something,\" died Thursday at a friend's home in Los Angeles. He was 58. \n Mr. Harrison had surgery for throat cancer in 1998 and was treated for lung cancer and a brain tumor this year. He lived in Friar Park, a Victorian mansion in Henley-on-Thames, England, and had a home in Hana, Hawaii. \n His wife, Olivia, and son, Dhani, 24, were with him when he died at the home of Gavin De Becker, a longtime friend. \n \"He left this world as he lived in it, conscious of God, fearless of death, and at peace, surrounded by family and friends,\" the Harrison family said in a statement. \"He often said, `Everything else can wait but the search for God cannot wait,' and `love one another.' \" \n One of the two surviving Beatles, Paul McCartney, told reporters outside his London home today: \"He was a lovely guy and a very brave man and had a wonderful sense of humor. He is really just my baby brother.\" \n The other surviving band member, Ringo Starr, said, \"We will miss George for his sense of love, his sense of music and his sense of laughter.\" \n John Lennon, a founding member of the group, was shot to death in New York in 1980. \n In the 31 years since the Beatles broke up, Mr. Harrison made a series of variably successful solo albums, issued a small but varied catalogue of recordings by other performers on his own Dark Horse label, and was the executive producer of Handmade Films, an independent production company that had several hits between the late 1970's and the early 1990's. \n He made two albums with the Traveling Wilburys, a tongue-in-cheek supergroup that included Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison. He published several collections of memoirs and lyrics, and contributed copious commentary for books by friends. He also organized several philanthropic projects, including a 1971 concert to aid refugees in Bangladesh, an event that set the pattern for all-star charity rock concerts. \n In recent years, Mr. Harrison took part with his former colleagues in the Beatles' \"Anthology,\" a retrospective that included a 10-hour video history, six discs of previously unreleased recordings and a book. He also supervised an expanded reissue of his 1970 solo album, \"All Things Must Pass,\" and was planning to remaster the rest of his recordings. \n A new album was also in the works, despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 health problems that included treatment for throat cancer in 1998 and lung cancer and a brain tumor this year. Mr. Harrison also survived a stabbing attack by an intruder at Friar Park in December 1999. \n Mr. Harrison will unquestionably be best remembered for his work with the Beatles, in which he was the youngest and most reticent member. He was 19 when the group made its first recordings, in 1962, yet from the start he projected an air of intense seriousness. \n On stage he appeared more concerned with getting the details of a guitar solo right than with inciting the shrieks of the group's fans, and film clips show him looking bemused by the ruckus. He was the first to find the screaming crowds tiresome, and the first to advocate abandoning the concert stage, arguing that it was pointless to perform for audiences that were making too much noise for the group to be heard. \n \"I always really enjoyed in our early days, before we got too famous,\" he once said in an interview. \"We used to play clubs and that kind of stuff all the time. And it was fun, it was fun. It was good, because you get to play and you get to get quite good on the instrument. But then we got famous, and it spoiled all that, because we'd just go round and round the world singing the same 10 dopey tunes.\" \n In the summer of 1966 the others came around to his point of view, and after that the Beatles confined their work to the recording studio. At the Beatles' recording sessions, Mr. Harrison worked diligently on solos that were compact but often innovative. \n His solo for Lennon's \"I'm Only Sleeping,\" recorded in 1966, when the Beatles were experimenting with tape manipulation, is an example of his fastidiousness. It was decided a guitar solo, recorded and played backwards, would best mirror the dreamworld quality of the lyrics, so Mr. Harrison devised his solo, wrote it down in reverse order and overdubbed it onto a recording of the song that was running backwards. \n To complicate matters, he insisted on recording two versions of the solo \u2014 one clean, one distorted \u2014 and combining them. His contribution to the three-minute song took six hours to record. \n Although Lennon and Mr. McCartney, as the group's principal composers, always held the brightest spotlight, Mr. Harrison had a decisive influence on the Beatles' sound. \n During the group's formative years, in the late 1950's and early 1960's, he shared the others' passion for American rhythm and blues, Motown soul and the more aggressive rock of Little Richard and Elvis Presley. But his passion for rockabilly artists like Carl Perkins \u2014 a taste he shared with Ringo Starr, the Beatles' drummer \u2014 brought the twangy coloration of Country and Western music to the group's repertory. He also had an interest in jazz chord voicings, which colored the harmonies in some of the band's early arrangements. \n Mr. Harrison's fascination for Indian music \u2014 which began in 1965, after he became curious about the exotic instruments on the set of \"Help!,\" the group's second film \u2014 pushed the Beatles' sound world in yet another direction. And as with everything the Beatles did, imitators were plentiful: after Mr. Harrison played a sitar solo on Lennon's \"Norwegian Wood,\" and began writing his own songs based on Indian motifs, dozens of rock bands, from the Rolling Stones to Jefferson Airplane, adopted the sitar, and \"raga rock\" flourished briefly. \n Mr. Harrison also brought a variety of electronic gadgets to Beatles' recording sessions, ranging from a simple volume pedal \u2014 used on \"Yes It Is\" and \"I Need You\" \u2014 to the Moog synthesizer, which he played on \"Abbey Road.\" \n Still, he drew the line at devices that in his view led to the mechanization of rock music, and later spoke disdainfully about drum machines, samplers and computer-driven instruments. When he released his \"Cloud Nine\" album in 1987, he made a point of describing it as \"real music, made by real musicians who play real instruments.\" \n Of the four Beatles, Mr. Harrison was the most aloof from the music business and the most troubled by the trappings of fame and the invasions of his privacy that it brought. \n \"They gave their money and they gave their screams,\" Mr. Harrison said of the Beatles' fans during an interview for the \"Beatles Anthology\" in 1995. \"But the Beatles kind of gave their nervous systems. They used us as an excuse to go mad, the world did, and then blamed it on us.\" \n Even at the height of Beatlemania, he was characterized by the press as \"the quiet Beatle.\" Caught in the right mood, though, he could deliver barbed quips. Asked at a 1965 news conference how the Beatles managed to sleep with such long hair, Mr. Harrison shot back, \"How do you sleep with your arms and legs still attached?\" \n Later, Mr. Harrison did his best to put the world at a distance. He rarely gave interviews. Multilingual signs posted outside his estate brusquely warned away sightseers. And he was often impatient with autograph-seekers, his typical responses ranging from tearing up the item he was asked to sign to signing perfect replicas of all four Beatles' signatures. \n But he had a generous side as well. The concert he organized to raise money for famine relief in Bangladesh has been widely acknowledged as the model for other rock charity events like Live Aid and Farm Aid. Mr. Harrison also performed on Heartbeat '86, a concert to raise money for a hospital charity, and in the Prince's Trust charity concert in 1987. \n In 1990 he established the Romanian Angel Appeal to provide support for orphaned infants in Romania, and he assembled an album of rare recordings by American and British colleagues on the appeal's behalf. \n George Harrison was born in Liverpool on Feb. 25, 1943, and was the youngest of Harold and Louise French Harrison's four children. His father drove the bus that brought him \u2014 and also Mr. McCartney, who was a year older \u2014 to the Liverpool Institute. He showed little interest in academic work, devoting himself instead to the guitar. \n By the time he was 14, the year he met Mr. McCartney, he had formed a band, the Rebels, and began taking his guitar to dances in the hope of being asked to play. Mr. McCartney had only recently joined Lennon's group, the Quarry Men, as a guitarist (he later switched to bass), and early in 1958 he invited Mr. Harrison to a Quarry Men performance, after which he auditioned for Lennon. \n Mr. Harrison could do something that neither Lennon nor Mr. McCartney could do: he could play the solos from American rock records. Lennon, who was three years older than Mr. Harrison, considered the guitarist talented but sullen, and still a child. But Mr. Harrison continued to tag along with Mr. McCartney, and within a few months he was in the band. He continued to work with other Liverpool bands, but by October 1959 he decided to throw in his lot with the Quarry Men, who Lennon renamed the Beatles in 1960. \n Mr. Harrison's songwriting interests were limited in the group's early years. He collaborated with Mr. McCartney on \"In Spite of All the Danger\" in 1958, and with Lennon on \"Cry for a Shadow,\" a Duane Eddy-influenced instrumental that the band recorded in Germany in 1961. \n But as the Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership flourished, he was content at first to take a subsidiary role, playing his solos and occasionally stepping up to the microphone to sing either rock classics like Carl Perkins' \"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\" and Chuck Berry's \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" or Lennon-McCartney songs written for him, like \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" or \"I'm Happy Just to Dance With You.\" \n In the summer of 1963 he decided to try his hand at songwriting, and produced \"Don't Bother Me,\" a song the group included on \"With the Beatles,\" its second album. \n \"I don't think it's a particularly good song,\" Mr. Harrison wrote in \"I Me Mine,\" his 1980 autobiography. \"It mightn't even be a song at all, but at least it showed me that all I needed to do was keep on writing and then maybe, eventually, I would write something good.\" \n Another year and a half elapsed before Mr. Harrison was able to interest the band in another of his songs, but two of his compositions, \"I Need You\" and \"You Like Me Too Much,\" made it on to the \"Help!\" album in 1965. Neither had the ingenuity or dimension that the Lennon-McCartney team were giving their songs of the time, yet traces of Mr. Harrison's later style \u2014 most notably the slightly mournful quality of his melodies \u2014 were beginning to emerge. After that Mr. Harrison had at least one and as many as four songs on each of the group's albums. \n At the end of 1965 Mr. Harrison used a sitar on a Beatles album for the first time, and he soon began studying the instrument formally with the sitar master Ravi Shankar. To put his sitar studies to practical use, Mr. Harrison began writing songs in an Indian style, and inviting Indian musicians to Beatles' sessions to help record them. The first of these was \"Love You To\" (on the \"Revolver\" album, 1966). \"Within You Without You,\" Mr. Harrison's lushly orchestrated contribution to \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\" took this influence further. \n In 1967 he was commissioned to provide soundtrack music for \"Wonderwall,\" and produced a score (released as the first album on the Beatles' Apple label) in which East and West mingled freely. While in Bombay recording the Indian sections of the soundtrack, he taped an ensemble playing a traditional raga, and set words to it from Lao-Tzu's Tao Te Ching. None of the other Beatles perform on the song, \"The Inner Light,\" but it became the first of Mr. Harrison's compositions to be released on a Beatles' single (albeit on the B-side, with \"Lady Madonna\"). \n Mr. Harrison's work with Indian music led to an interest in Hinduism and Indian philosophy. Listeners who thought the other Beatles were merely indulging his exotic tastes were incorrect: Mr. Harrison's spiritual interests addressed the other Beatles' concerns as well, and when he was won over by the Transcendental Meditation techniques of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, his band mates followed him to India to study meditation. \n \"Everybody dreams of being famous, rich and famous,\" Mr. Harrison later said about the start of his spiritual quest. \"Once you get rich and famous, you think, `This wasn't it.' And that made me go on to find out what it is. In the end, you're trying to find God. That's the result of not being satisfied. And it doesn't matter how much money, or property, or whatever you've got, unless you're happy in your heart, then that's it. And unfortunately, you can never gain perfect happiness unless you've got that state of consciousness that enables that.\" \n The others soon gave up on Eastern philosophy, but Mr. Harrison remained a devotee of Hinduism, or Krishna Consciousness, as he preferred to describe his beliefs. In his music, though, he returned to a more conventional Western style. \n His contributions to \"The Beatles\" (known as the \"White Album\") and the soundtrack of the animated film \"Yellow Submarine\" (both released in 1968), showed a new compositional maturity. There were six in all, ranging from the proto-heavy metal of \"All Too Much,\" to the poetic \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\" \n By the time of the \"White Album\" sessions, Mr. Harrison was writing so prolifically that the Beatles could not accommodate all his work, something that became a source of tension in the band's final year. He was also undertaking private musical experiments, including the synthesizer pieces released on his \"Electronic Sound\" album. And he was forging musical relationships outside the Beatles, most notably with Eric Clapton, the virtuoso guitarist who was then in the band Cream and had played the solo on Mr. Harrison's \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\" \n By early 1969 Mr. Harrison was finding the Beatles too confining, and a few weeks into the sessions for the \"Let It Be\" album, he quit the band, returning only after the others agreed to give up a plan to perform live again, and to give his songs greater consideration. \n As it turned out, the \"Let It Be\" sessions yielded only one finished Harrison song, \"For You Blue.\" A second, \"I Me Mine,\" was recorded in January 1970 for inclusion on the \"Let It Be\" album, and was the last song the group recorded before its breakup three months later. \n But during the summer of 1969 \u2014 with the \"Let It Be\" album shelved pending the completion of the accompanying film \u2014 the group recorded what it considered its swan song, \"Abbey Road.\" \n Two of Mr. Harrison's finest Beatles compositions, \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun,\" were included. \"Something\" became the first of Mr. Harrison's songs to be released as the A-side of a single, and was widely recorded by other performers. Frank Sinatra once described it as his favorite Beatles song (although he misattributed it to Lennon and Mr. McCartney). Soon after the Beatles split, Mr. Harrison assembled Mr. Starr, Mr. Clapton, the guitarist Dave Mason, the keyboardists Gary Brooker and Billy Preston and the pedal steel guitarist Pete Drake and began recording the songs that the Beatles had not had time for. The sessions were so fruitful that the resulting album, \"All Things Must Pass,\" included two disks of new songs and a third with jam sessions. \n The Hindu notions of the transitory nature of the physical world, and the search for a path to God, were Mr. Harrison's principal subjects here, but there were lighter-spirited, secular songs as well. The album's success was gratifying for Mr. Harrison, but it caused him problems as well. One of his new songs, \"My Sweet Lord,\" bore a striking similarity to that of the 1963 Chiffons' hit, \"He's So Fine,\" and that song's publisher sued Mr. Harrison for copyright infringement. \n The suit dragged on for 20 years, and Mr. Harrison was found guilty of \"unconscious plagiarism.\" In the end he bought his antagonist's company and ended up owning both songs. His \"This Song\" (1975) was a satirical look at the lawsuit, and for the reissue of \"All Things Must Pass\" he recorded \"My Sweet Lord (2000),\" a version that avoids the melodic similarities to \"He's So Fine.\" \n As a former Beatle with a hot album, Mr. Harrison had considerable clout in the rock world in 1971, so when Mr. Shankar brought the famine in Bangladesh to his attention, he was quickly able to put together a band that included Mr. Starr, Mr. Clapton, Bob Dylan, Leon Russell and Billy Preston. An album and a film were made from the two shows at Madison Square Garden, and although disputes over distribution rights and taxes held up their release, the proceeds were eventually donated to the United Nations relief efforts. \n Mr. Harrison's \"Living in the Material World\" (1973) followed the agenda set forth by \"All Things Must Pass,\" in that its centerpieces explored a spiritual agenda. Everyday venality was not ignored: \"Sue Me Sue You Blues,\" for example, touched on the squabbles between the former Beatles. \n But the public was tiring of Mr. Harrison's religious fascinations. His next album, \"Dark Horse\" (1974), was criticized as preachy and whiny, and an American tour made matters worse: Mr. Harrison, not used to singing a complete concert set, lost his voice during the rehearsals, and was hoarse for the entire tour. \n Mr. Harrison reconsidered his approach on \"Extra Texture\" (1975) and \"33 1/3\" (1976), albums that touched on traditional blues and continued to refined a quirky, humorous personal style, best heard in \"Crackerbox Palace\" and \"This Song.\" Satire replaced sermonizing as his signature style, and it was better received. \n Nevertheless, Mr. Harrison took a three-year break from recording after \"33 1/3.\" He devoted some of that time to ending one entrepreneurial enterprise and starting another. In the early 1970's he had started the Dark Horse label, which released about a dozen albums by Mr. Shankar and a handful of bands, among them Splinter, Stairsteps, Attitudes and Jiva. None of the recordings sold well, though, and after 1977 Dark Horse was primarily Mr. Harrison's imprint for his own work, which was first distributed by A & M and later by Warner. \n A sideline career as a film producer was more successful. When the Monty Python comedy troupe needed financial backing for \"The Life of Brian,\" in 1978, Mr. Harrison underwrote the film, laying the groundwork for his own production company, Handmade Films. Handmade quickly became a respected company, and produced 27 films \u2014 among them, \"The Long Good Friday,\" \"Mona Lisa,\" \"Time Bandits,\" \"Withnail and I\" and \"Shanghai Surprise\" \u2014 before Mr. Harrison sold his interest in 1994. \n Mostly, though, Mr. Harrison used his three years away from music to sort out his personal life. He met his first wife, Pattie Boyd, on the set of the Beatles' first film, \"A Hard Day's Night,\" and they married in 1966. Their marriage broke up in 1974, when Ms. Boyd began living with Mr. Clapton (whose song \"Layla\" was written for her). The romance did not ruin the friendship between Mr. Harrison and Mr. Clapton: the two men and Ms. Boyd perform a version of the Everly Brothers' \"Bye Bye Love\" together on Mr. Harrison's \"Dark Horse\" album, and Mr. Harrison and Mr. Clapton toured Japan together in 1991. \n Mr. Harrison married Olivia Arias in 1978. She and their son Dhani, 24, are survivors, along with a sister, Louise Caldwell, and his brothers, Peter and Harry. \n Mr. Harrison's return to recording in 1979 yielded \"George Harrison,\" an album notably lighter in spirit and broader in subject matter than his previous few, with songs about several of his new passions, among them automobile racing (\"Faster\"), hallucinogenic mushrooms (\"Soft Hearted Hana\") and Olivia (\"Dark Sweet Lady\"). But sales were disappointing, and when he delivered his next album, \"Somewhere in England,\" to Warner, the label demanded that he rework the set to make it more commercially appealing. \n Mr. Harrison responded, characteristically, by recording a new track, \"Blood from a Clone,\" that skewered the label's complaints, and another, \"Unconsciousness Rules,\" that took a swipe at disco, then popular in clubs. But another of the remakes was a quasi-Beatles' reunion. While Mr. Harrison was reworking the album, Lennon was killed. Mr. Harrison quickly wrote a tribute to Lennon, \"All Those Years Ago.\" Mr. McCartney and Mr. Starr performed on the recording, and it became a hit. \n But Mr. Harrison was dispirited by his experience in the music business. He made another album in 1982, the good-humored \"Gone Troppo,\" and then stepped away from music for another five years. His return, \"Cloud Nine,\" was a resounding success, his biggest hit since \"All Things Must Pass.\" Not least among its charms was Mr. Harrison's skewering of Beatles' nostalgia, \"When We Was Fab.\" \n His renewed success notwithstanding, Mr. Harrison kept his distance from the music world, and neither his success with the Traveling Wilburys' two albums (\"Traveling Wilburys,\" 1988; Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3,\" 1990) or his 1991 tour of Japan with Mr. Clapton's highly polished band, were able to rekindle an interest in leading a public musical life. \n \"Although I have guitars all around and I pick them up occasionally and write a tune and make a record, I don't really see myself as a musician,\" Mr. Harrison once said, explaining his ambivalence to the life of a rock star. \n \"It may seem a funny thing to say. It's just like, I write lyrics and I make up songs, but I'm not a great lyricist or songwriter or producer. It's when you put all these things together \u2014 that makes me.\" "}, {"text": "Business; Solar Power Is Reaching Where Wires Can't\n2001-09-09T05:00:00.000Z\nTWO hours outside Durban, South Africa, deep in the Valley of a Thousand Hills, Myeka High School had no electricity. Students struggled to read by candlelight, and few textbooks and newspapers were available. The school was clearly having a hard time doing its job: only 30 percent of the students graduated, and even those had little hope of going beyond their isolated village.\nThen, in the spring of last year, solar energy came to town. Photovoltaic solar panels, firing up 2.4 kilowatts of power, were brought into the school by the Solar Electric Light Fund, a nonprofit group based in Washington. SELF also persuaded Dell Computer and Infosat Telecommunications to donate computers and a satellite uplink so that the students could have Internet access.\nNow that the students can download materials from the Internet and have access to the Learning Channel, the graduation rate has shot up to 70 percent. Some students have won science awards, and many are applying for college. ''I never thought the sun could do all this,'' said Melusi Zwane, the school's principal.\nMyeka is a vivid example of the impact of computers on society. But what makes this tale stand out is the arrival of solar power. ''It's the reason for all that we have now,'' Mr. Zwane said. ''Everything comes from power.''\nBusiness has long been keenly aware of the potential of providing energy to deprived areas. And interest in narrowing the world's much-discussed digital divide, between the connected and the unconnected, has only made the opportunity more inviting.\nThat is why energy projects like the one at Myeka High School are not solely philanthropic. Though many financing hurdles remain, there is money to be made, especially for solar energy companies, when markets like these go online.\nIn fact, according to Strategies Unlimited, a market research firm in Mountain View, Calif., for the solar industry, roughly 40 percent, or $1.2 billion, of the $3 billion worldwide solar business last year came from rural markets like the Valley of a Thousand Hills. In the United States, for example, solar has had decent sales as an environmentally friendly complement to the existing power grid, but there is a more immediate need for it in rural areas. Strategies Unlimited predicts that the leading companies in the industry, like the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Siemens, BP, Sanyo Electric, Sharp, Kyocera and AstroPower, will continue to have revenue growth of about 20 percent a year from these markets. That will make the remote rural market alone worth roughly $2.5 billion by 2005.\nTwo billion people, roughly 30 percent of the world population, are off the energy grid, living in areas without utility services. And a billion of them have the means to pay for power, said Prof. Daniel M. Kammen, director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley.\nAccording to solar industry vendors and analysts, many of these billion people spend $5 to $10 a month on kerosene, almost exclusively for lights. Solar power, of course, has many more uses, and by amortizing the start-up costs over perhaps five years, the total cash outlay is about the same.\n''There's a lot of money to be made in converting those people to solar,'' said Dr. Allen M. Barnett, chief executive of AstroPower, a publicly traded company based in Newark.\nIn July, for example, Shell Solar signed an agreement with the Sun Oasis Company, a distributor in Beijing, to supply systems for up to 78,000 households in rural western China.\nASIDE from selling directly to remote areas, solar energy companies are expected to achieve much of their growth in powering telecommunications companies that want to extend their services, including the Internet.\n''In some cases the economics involving off-grid power, such as power generators, don't allow telecom carriers to go further out,'' said David Dunsworth, director for power systems of Hutton Communications, a Dallas-based distributor of telecommunications equipment. ''Solar allows them to do it.''\nRobert A. Freling, executive director of SELF, said, ''There's no question that telecommunications and computer availability are major issues when trying to get communities online, but without energy you can't even talk about those.''\nSolar power has become the energy of choice in many rural markets, in large part because the price has dropped considerably in the last few years. Prorating over roughly 10 years, the upfront cost of solar panels and accompanying batteries gives the energy a cost of roughly 18 cents a kilowatt-hour, competitive with any off-grid power.\nMoreover, solar energy has no moving parts, unlike other renewable sources, including wind and hydro, which makes it easy to maintain in areas where technicians are hard to find.\nSolar power's attractiveness off the grid, and an overall interest among governments, corporations and international organizations in bridging the digital divide, have put it in a sweet spot.\n''I think getting people online in rural areas will be a huge growth driver going forward for local solar companies,'' said Steve Cunningham, an investment officer for the Energy House Capital Corporation of Bloomfield, N.J., one of several private American equity firms that have millions of dollars to invest in energy companies in rural markets in the developing world.\nBut big challenges remain. Though they can last for 20 years, solar panels and batteries cost a minimum of $500 for a small house. That would be a huge upfront payment for many people, said Charles Gay, a director of Greenstar, a nonprofit group based in Los Angeles that promotes the use of solar energy in bringing remote areas online.\n''Coming up with a viable financing arrangement is definitely one of the biggest challenges,'' Mr. Barnett of AstroPower said.\nInternational organizations like the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program have started to put money into projects, and businesses, to help solve the financing problem.\nTwo years ago, the International Finance Corporation, the private investment arm of the World Bank, began investing $30 million through its Photovoltaic Market Transformation Initiative for solar projects in developing countries like India and Morocco.\nBut some people contend that even though these projects provide power for remote areas, many people in those areas have more pressing priorities than spending their scarce dollars on computers and Internet access.\n''Clearly, for those numerous people in the developing world that are hungry or sick, food and health must take priority over everything, even education,'' said Lester Brown, chairman of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington.\nBut many people who are involved in solar projects say the access to power can help deal with those issues, too.\nIn some remote villages, the economy is ''a barter system where they exchange crops for kerosene, kerosene for medicine and things like that,'' Mr. Gay said. ''You have to give them the resources to transform themselves into a real currency-earning society.''\nIN Parvathapur, a remote village in south-central India that is off the power grid, Greenstar is starting to find evidence of that. Last year, Greenstar invested about $75,000 in solar panels, computers and Internet access to provide the village with money-generating tools.\nThe village now sells its music, art and calendars online to customers who include expatriate Indians in the United States. Fifty-five percent of the revenue now goes to Greenstar to pay back the initial solar and infrastructure expenditure. ''Within four years, we expect to have recovered our investment,'' Mr. Gay said.\nOnce the money is paid back, Greenstar's share will fall to 10 percent, which will go toward financing other projects in places like Jamaica, Ghana and the West Bank or future ones in Brazil and Tibet. ''It's a self-replicating finance mechanism,'' he said.\nIn return, villages like Parvathapur receive not only a way to build a micro-economy for their music and arts products, but also a tool to better support their principal source of income, agriculture.\nMr. Gay said the village is using the Internet to learn the most efficient times to plant and harvest crops and the best markets in which to sell them. ''The village is making more money than before,'' he said.\nOver the last two years, with a similar goal in mind, the Grameen Bank has financed more than 30 rural communities in Bangladesh for energy projects. It gives interest-bearing loans to people in those areas to buy Internet connectivity products like solar panels and phone equipment. Enough entrepreneurial activity has emerged to achieve a 90 percent payback rate on the loans.\nSELF has provided revolving-credit loans to various areas for home lighting. When it comes to projects with fully integrated Internet access, SELF relies on grants and does not have a specific repayment plan. It says it hopes that some type of commerce arises from the efforts.\nBuilding such commerce appears crucial. Many vendors and project managers agree that if a village cannot set up a business model and generate enough income from the new energy and the Internet access, it will eventually be in the dark again.\n''I've seen it many times,'' Mr. Gay said. ''If the community isn't self-sustaining after a while, none of this will work.''"}, {"text": "PRACTICAL TRAVELER; Carry-On Rules: List Grows Long\n2001-10-21T05:00:00.000Z\nDO not try flying US Airways with a pinned-up hem, or for that matter, with a red, white and blue ribbon affixed to your shirt. Because a safety pin -- along with all sharp objects and anything else that could be used as a weapon -- will be confiscated if you try to take it aboard, according to signs posted throughout La Guardia's US Airways terminal.\nCigarette lighters and hockey sticks are also on the carrier's list of prohibited objects. The list was taken from an Federal Aviation Administration directive issued after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and has inspired just some of the adjustments passengers will have to accept as part of the attempt by the United States to make the skies safe.\nOther changes include how much time to allow for check-in, where you can check in, how much carry-on luggage you can take on board, what documentation you'll need to get to the gate and, with at least one airline, how you get a pet on board.\nContraband\nThe F.A.A. has always banned items from the cabin, some obvious, others more obscure. Firearms, ammunition, tear gas and pepper spray are no-brainers, while dry ice, scuba tanks and self-inflating rafts come less readily to mind.\nNew directives, issued periodically after the attacks, say that no knives of any size, or made from any material, are permitted on flights. This is meant to be interpreted broadly, said Rebecca Trexler, an F.A.A. spokeswoman, meaning that anything that could be interpreted as a cutting instrument or anything that ''might be construed as dangerous'' will be confiscated.\nWhat does this encompass? The list is long and includes recreational equipment (bats, ski poles, camping stoves, pool cues), personal care products (metal emery boards and combustibles like nail polish, nail polish remover and hair spray). Such household items as scissors, cutlery, lawn equipment, ice picks and corkscrews are also forbidden. But the most recent directive, dated Oct. 8, indicates that passengers can take aboard nail clippers, tweezers, safety razors and eyelash curlers.\nEvery major airline contacted said that it was making an exception for medically necessary objects like syringes, but requires that they be accompanied by medication with a ''professionally printed'' label that identifies the medical office, pharmacy or manufacturer.\nThe F.A.A. has issued no directives regarding what happens to confiscated articles, but according to Rick Weintraub, a spokesman for US Airways, many airports are requiring that material confiscated at the checkpoints be turned in at the end of the day. Asked if the airports are holding onto it so passengers can retrieve it on their return, he said from what he is hearing ''most of them are not.''\nEach airline has been issued the new safety directives (which are not available to the public) and encouraged to add items at its discretion. But while the major airlines said they were adhering strictly to the F.A.A.'s list, interpretation, along with the attitudes and dispositions of security check-point personnel vary widely; so to be on the safe side, carry on board only the items you will need while in the aircraft, advised Ms. Trexler.\n''If you've got a question about an item, put it in a checked bag,'' she said. ''We're trying to get people to understand that limiting the things they try to carry on will make the whole screening process go a lot faster -- and make people feel a lot safer.''\nAnd remember, said a spokesman for US Airways, ''this is an evolving process.'' Contraband items will be added to and deleted from the list as time goes on.\nThe Screening Process\nBy now we've all heard stories about snaking lines at security checkpoints, of check-ins taking hours. Others say the dearth of people willing to fly has made the process a breeze. After a recent trip, Lena Sorensen, a nursing professor at the University of Colorado in Denver, concludes that it depends on the airport.\nLeaving for Boston on Sept. 28, she arrived at Denver International Airport 3 hours and 15 minutes early but almost missed her flight because of the long line at security (the airport has centralized security, so everyone flying on every airline has to enter through the same checkpoint). On the way back, she got to Logan Airport two and a half hours early and found herself sitting at the gate with two hours to spare. Ms. Sorensen attributed the difference to the centralized screening and the fact that the Denver airport had not posted signs warning passengers that all laptop computers had to be removed from their carrying cases for inspection.\nAcknowledging the disparity in check-in times, most airlines are still recommending that passengers arrive at least two hours early for domestic flights and three hours early for international flights (Continental is an exception; its spokesman said an hour to an hour and a half is enough for domestic flights because passenger loads are light).\nMost airport parking lots have security agents searching cars, and officials are stressing that no-standing policies in the passenger drop-off and pickup lanes are being strictly enforced. Drivers will be ticketed and unattended vehicles towed, so allowing a little extra time to park on top of what airlines are advising wouldn't hurt. Goodbye times may be shortened, though, as the F.A.A. has declared all airport concourses sterile areas, meaning that only ticketed passengers are allowed beyond the checkpoints. Parents or guardians of unaccompanied minors and escorts of passengers requiring special assistance are exempt from this policy but must be cleared at the ticket counter.\nPolicy on Pets\nMost carriers have not altered their policy on pets (United and Southwest had a wholesale embargo on pets before Sept. 11, which they maintain), but Continental is now requiring a special pass for animals both in the cabin and shipped as cargo. To get one, you must complete a security form (which can be downloaded from www.continental.com), submit it at least 10 days before departure for animals that haven't flown on Continental before and at least three days before departure for those that have, have a telephone conversation with one of the airline's ''live animal specialists'' who will then (if satisfied with your answers, though Continental would not reveal the type of questions) supply a PetPass number for you to present to the check-in counter.\nThe F.A.A. has issued an industrywide limit for carry-on luggage of one bag no larger than 10 by 16 by 24 inches and one personal item. Pets and duty-free items are considered personal items, as are purses, briefcases, laptops, diaper bags, camera bags, food containers and backpacks. Assistive devices for passengers with disabilities and child-restraint seats will not be considered carry-on or personal items, and may be taken on board in addition to the above. The limit on checked bags has not changed, but airline officials advise passengers to be prepared to have those bags searched at the check-in counter.\nCheck-in at the ticket desk has changed little in recent weeks. Passengers are still required to produce a government-issued photo ID and are asked the same security questions -- although one US Airways agent, who did not want to be identified, said he had noticed that no one jokes now when asked them. Curbside check-in, initially suspended nationwide, has been reinstituted at some airports by most airlines, limited by strict new F.A.A. requirements (again, not released to the public) that some locations cannot meet, airline representatives said.\nA sampling of curbside check-in practices:\nAmerican and T.W.A.: All up and running.\nDelta: Operating at most airports.\nUnited: Operating at all airports except for Seattle-Tacoma in Seattle and Logan in Boston, where the airport authorities do not permit it.\nContinental has a long list of locations where curbside check-in is operational, including its hubs: Houston, Cleveland, Newark and La Guardia.\nNorthwest: Operational at hubs: Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis, and on a limited basis at other airports throughout the country.\nSouthwest: Operational ''in a handful of cities.''\nUS Airways: Operational at most airports.\nChecking in at the gate, an option questioned in the days after the attacks, is allowed but only for passengers without bags to check. E-ticket holders on most carriers can check in at kiosks, wherever they exist, before going through checkpoint security. Airlines without kiosks, or without kiosks at certain airports, require either a paper ticket (acquired at the counter) or documentation of a ticket in the form of a receipt or an itinerary from a travel agent or printed off the airline's Web site.\nOf course, if your name sets off alarms in the computer, you may experience more difficulty. Mahiuddin Ahmed, a 20-something cancer researcher traveling from La Guardia to Fort Lauderdale to visit his parents on Sept. 28, tried to check in at a US Airways kiosk but received a message directing him to the ticket counter. A New Yorker of Bangladeshi descent, he was told that his name was a few letters different from a name or names in a database of suspected terrorists, and agents called the police over to interview him, called his parents and called his workplace to verify his identity. It took ages, but Mr. Ahmed was not upset by the delay. ''It's necessary,'' he said. ''We all want to fly safe.''"}, {"text": "Bin Laden's Statement\n2001-11-03T05:00:00.000Z\n Following is the translated text of Osama Bin Laden's latest statement, as posted on the British Broadcasting Corporation's web site. \n We praise God, seek His help, and ask for His forgiveness. \n We seek refuge in God from the evils of our souls and our bad deeds. \n A person who is guided by God will never be misguided by anyone and a person who is misguided by God can never be guided by anyone. \n I bear witness that there is no God but Allah alone, Who has no partner. \n Amid the huge developments and in the wake of the great strikes that hit the United States in its most important locations in New York and Washington, a huge media clamor has been raised. \n This clamor is unprecedented. It conveyed the opinions of people on these events. \n People were divided into two parts. The first part supported these strikes against US tyranny, while the second denounced them. \n Afterward, when the United States launched the unjust campaign against the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan, people also split into two parties. \n The first supported these campaigns, while the second denounced and rejected them. \n These tremendous incidents, which have split people into two parties, are of great interest to the Muslims, since many of the rulings pertain to them. \n The polls showed that the vast majority of the sons of the Islamic world were happy about these strikes. \n These rulings are closely related to Islam and the acts that corrupt a person's Islam. \n Therefore, the Muslims must understand the nature and truth of this conflict so that it will be easy for them to determine where they stand. \n While talking about the truth of the conflict, opinion polls in the world have shown that a little more than 80 per cent of Westerners, of Christians in the United States and elsewhere, have been saddened by the strikes that hit the United States. \n The polls showed that the vast majority of the sons of the Islamic world were happy about these strikes because they believe that the strikes were in reaction to the huge criminality practiced by Israel and the United States in Palestine and other Muslim countries. \n After the strikes on Afghanistan began, these groups changed positions. \n Those who were happy about striking the United States felt sad when Afghanistan was hit, and those who felt sad when the United States was hit were happy when Afghanistan was hit. These groups comprise millions of people. \n The entire West, with the exception of a few countries, supports this unfair, barbaric campaign, although there is no evidence of the involvement of the people of Afghanistan in what happened in America. \n The people of Afghanistan had nothing to do with this matter. The campaign, however, continues to unjustly annihilate the villagers and civilians, children, women, and innocent people. \n The entire West, with the exception of a few countries, supports this unfair, barbaric campaign. \n The positions of the two sides are very clear. Mass demonstrations have spread from the farthest point in the eastern part of the Islamic world to the farthest point in the western part of the Islamic world, and from Indonesia, Philippines, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan to the Arab world and Nigeria and Mauritania. \n This clearly indicates the nature of this war. This war is fundamentally religious. The people of the East are Muslims. They sympathized with Muslims against the people of the West, who are the crusaders. \n Those who try to cover this crystal clear fact, which the entire world has admitted, are deceiving the Islamic nation. \n They are trying to deflect the attention of the Islamic nation from the truth of this conflict. \n This fact is proven in the book of God Almighty and in the teachings of our messenger, may God's peace and blessings be upon him. \n Under no circumstances should we forget this enmity between us and the infidels. For, the enmity is based on creed. \n We must be loyal to the believers and those who believe that there is no God but Allah. \n We should also renounce the atheists and infidels. It suffices me to seek God's help against them. \n God says: \"Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion.\" \n It is a question of faith, not a war against terrorism, as Bush and Blair try to depict it. \n Many thieves belonging to this nation were captured in the past. But, nobody moved. \n It is a question of faith, not a war against terrorism, as Bush and Blair try to depict it. \n The masses which moved in the East and West have not done so for the sake of Osama. \n Rather, they moved for the sake of their religion. This is because they know that they are right and that they resist the most ferocious, serious, and violent Crusade campaign against Islam ever since the message was revealed to Mohammad, may God's peace and blessings be upon. \n After this has become clear, the Muslim must know and learn where he is standing vis-a-vis this war. \n After the US politicians spoke and after the US newspapers and television channels became full of clear crusading hatred in this campaign that aims at mobilizing the West against Islam and Muslims, Bush left no room for doubts or the opinions of journalists, but he openly and clearly said that this war is a crusader war. He said this before the whole world to emphasize this fact. \n Anyone who lines up behind Bush in this campaign has committed one of the 10 actions that sully one's Islam. \n What can those who allege that this is a war against terrorism say? What terrorism are they speaking about at a time when the Islamic nation has been slaughtered for tens of years without hearing their voices and without seeing any action by them? \n But when the victim starts to take revenge for those innocent children in Palestine, Iraq, southern Sudan, Somalia, Kashmir and the Philippines, the rulers' ulema (Islamic leaders) and the hypocrites come to defend the clear blasphemy. It suffices me to seek God's help against them. \n The common people have understood the issue, but there are those who continue to flatter those who colluded with the unbelievers to anesthetized the Islamic nation to prevent it from carrying out the duty of jihad so that the word of God will be above all words. \n The unequivocal truth is that Bush has carried the cross and raised its banner high and stood at the front of the queue. \n Anyone who lines up behind Bush in this campaign has committed one of the 10 actions that sully one's Islam. \n Muslim scholars are unanimous that allegiance to the infidels and support for them against the believers is one of the major acts that sully Islam. \n There is no power but in God. Let us investigate whether this war against Afghanistan that broke out a few days ago is a single and unique one or if it is a link to a long series of crusader wars against the Islamic world. \n Following World War I, which ended more than 83 years ago, the whole Islamic world fell under the crusader banner - under the British, French, and Italian governments. \n They divided the whole world, and Palestine was occupied by the British. \n Since then, and for more than 83 years, our brothers, sons, and sisters in Palestine have been badly tortured. \n Hundreds of thousands of them have been killed, and hundreds of thousands of them have been imprisoned or maimed. \n Let us examine the recent developments. Take for example the Chechens. \n They are a Muslim people who have been attacked by the Russian bear which embraces the Christian Orthodox faith. \n Russians have annihilated the Chechen people in their entirety and forced them to flee to the mountains where they were assaulted by snow and poverty and diseases. \n Nonetheless, nobody moved to support them. There is no strength but in God. \n This was followed by a war of genocide in Bosnia in sight and hearing of the entire world in the heart of Europe. \n For several years our brothers have been killed, our women have been raped, and our children have been massacred in the safe havens of the United Nations and with its knowledge and cooperation. \n Those who refer our tragedies today to the United Nations so that they can be resolved are hypocrites who deceive God, His Prophet and the believers. \n Are not our tragedies but caused by the United Nations? Who issued the Partition Resolution on Palestine in 1947 and surrendered the land of Muslims to the Jews? It was the United Nations in its resolution in 1947. \n Those who claim that they are the leaders of the Arabs and continue to appeal to the United Nations have disavowed what was revealed to Prophet Mohammad, God's peace and blessings be upon him. \n Those who refer things to the international legitimacy have disavowed the legitimacy of the Holy Book and the tradition of Prophet Mohammad, God's peace and blessings be upon him. \n This is the United Nations from which we have suffered greatly. Under no circumstances should any Muslim or sane person resort to the United Nations. The United Nations is nothing but a tool of crime. \n We are being massacred everyday, while the United Nations continues to sit idly by. \n Our brothers in Kashmir have been subjected to the worst forms of torture for over 50 years. They have been massacred, killed, and raped. Their blood has been shed and their houses have been trespassed upon. \n Still, the United Nations continues to sit idly by. \n Today, and without any evidence, the United Nations passes resolutions supporting unjust and tyrannical America, which oppresses these helpless people who have emerged from a merciless war at the hands of the Soviet Union. \n Let us look at the second war in Chechnya, which is still underway. The entire Chechen people are being embattled once again by this Russian bear. \n The humanitarian agencies, even the US ones, demanded that President Clinton should stop supporting Russia. \n However, Clinton said that stopping support for Russia did not serve US interests. \n A year ago, Putin demanded that the cross and the Jews should stand by him. \n He told them: You must support us and thank us because we are waging a war against Muslim fundamentalism. \n The enemies are speaking very clearly. While this is taking place, the leaders of the region hide and are ashamed to support their brothers. \n Let us examine the stand of the West and the United Nations in the developments in Indonesia when they moved to divide the largest country in the Islamic world in terms of population. \n We should view events not as separate links, but as links in a long series of conspiracies, a war of annihilation. \n This criminal, Kofi Annan, was speaking publicly and putting pressure on the Indonesian government, telling it: You have 24 hours to divide and separate East Timor from Indonesia. \n Otherwise, we will be forced to send in military forces to separate it by force. \n The crusader Australian forces were on Indonesian shores, and in fact they landed to separate East Timor, which is part of the Islamic world. \n Therefore, we should view events not as separate links, but as links in a long series of conspiracies, a war of annihilation in the true sense of the word. \n In Somalia, on the excuse of restoring hope, 13,000 of our brothers were killed. In southern Sudan, hundreds of thousands were killed. \n But when we move to Palestine and Iraq, there can be no bounds to what can be said. \n Over one million children were killed in Iraq. The killing is continuing. \n As for what is taking place in Palestine these days, I can only say we have no one but God to complain to. \n What is taking place cannot be tolerated by any nation. I do not say from the nations of the human race, but from other creatures, from the animals. \n They would not tolerate what is taking place. \n A confidant of mine told me that he saw a butcher slaughtering a camel in front of another camel. \n The other camel got agitated while seeing the blood coming out of the other camel. Thus, it burst out with rage and bit the hand of the man and broke it. \n How can the weak mothers in Palestine endure the killing of their children in front of their eyes by the unjust Jewish executioners with US support and with US aircraft and tanks? \n Those who distinguish between America and Israel are the real enemies of the nation. They are traitors who betrayed God and His prophet, and who betrayed their nation and the trust placed in them. They anesthetize the nation. \n These battles cannot be viewed in any case whatsoever as isolated battles, but rather, as part of a chain of the long, fierce, and ugly crusader war. \n Every Muslim must stand under the banner of There is no God but Allah and Mohammad is God's Prophet. \n I remind you of what our Prophet, may God's peace and blessings upon him, told Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him. \n He told him: Boy, I am going to teach you a few words. Obey God, He will protect you. Obey Him, you will find Him on your side. If you ask for something, ask God. If you seek help, seek the help of God. \n You should know that if all people come together to help you, they will only help you with something that God has already preordained for you. \n And if they assemble to harm you, they will only harm you with something that God has already preordained for you. God wrote man's fate and it will never change. \n I Tell the Muslims who did their utmost during these weeks: You must continue along the same march. \n Your support for us will make us stronger and will further support your brothers in Afghanistan. \n Exert more efforts in combating this unprecedented war crime. \n Fear God, O Muslims and rise to support your religion. Islam is calling on you: O Muslims, O Muslims, O Muslims. \n God bear witness that I have conveyed the message. God bear witness that I have conveyed the message. God bear witness that I have conveyed the message. \n God's peace and blessings be upon you. "}, {"text": "First Aid\n"}, {"text": "Clinic Casts Lifeline to Isolated Migrant Workers\n2001-03-13T05:00:00.000Z\nIt was 11 o'clock one night at the Hudson Valley Migrant Health Clinic and the pager affixed to Vince LaSalle's waist started beeping. Mr. LaSalle, a physician's assistant at the clinic here, had been closing up for the night.\nThe call was from an anxious mother whose baby's raging fever would not break. So Mr. LaSalle and an outreach worker, Kenny Gould, jumped in their cars and headed out for a house call, winding through the unlighted back roads of the apple orchard country of Ulster County.\nThe woman and her family were farmworkers living in a trailer tucked away on a farm down an unpaved road. The baby had a 103-degree fever and an ear infection, which Mr. LaSalle treated with amoxicillin. The family had no car and no phone in their trailer -- just a pay phone outdoors near the apple warehouse. ''God forbid I had to call 911,'' Mr. LaSalle said recently of the incident. ''They'd never find that place with an ambulance.''\nJust 70 miles from New York City, in an area known for comfortable weekend homes and the rugged beauty of nearby Shawangunk Mountains, farmworkers live a bare-bones existence, mostly hidden from view. Here, health care delivery often takes on a literal meaning for the staff of the farmworkers' health clinic. They confront the usual challenges posed by serving the poor and uninsured -- and then some.\nMost patients are illegal immigrants and wary of institutions. Many are from Mexico and Central America, speak little English and require cultural understanding in equal doses with medical care. The migrants typically follow the harvests: to Florida in the winter and back up to the Hudson Valley for vegetable and apple crops in summer and fall, making continuity of health care a goal more than a reality.\nBut it is the workers' sheer physical isolation on those farms, unwired to the outside world, no buses and only the rare car for transportation that shapes how clinic providers operate.\n''The most important things to know about health care for farmworkers is they're poor, they don't get sick days and they lose pay if they take a day off to come to the clinic,'' said James O'Barr, director of the migrant health program. ''Outreach is our link to the workers. And it's a killer sometimes, driving all over the county picking people up, delivering them to the clinic.''\nThe outreach workers must be fluent in the cultural nuances of the Mexican, Jamaican, Guatemalan, Puerto Rican and Bangladeshi workers they encounter. They must also be sensitive to the farmworkers as immigrants, many in the country illegally, maintaining a low profile. While the clinic's confidentiality rules prohibit discussing particular patients' cases, and patients themselves are reluctant to talk, they clearly appreciate the clinic.\n''The clinic is very good; the people are very nice,'' a Mexican man whom Mr. Gould chauffeured to the clinic said in Spanish.\nOn a recent winter evening, Olga Bracero, an outreach worker, headed out in the clinic's van to begin her scheduled tasks for the night. First stop, an apple farm in Plattekill to tell a woman the good results of her mammogram and to drop off bread donated by a local bakery outlet. Inside the tidy cedar-shingled cottage, Ms. Bracero embraced the woman warmly, conveying the test results and reminding the woman that she would need a mammogram next year. Down the dirt road, Ms. Bracero stopped off at the trailer of a man with a gallbladder tumor, taking an appointment slip for a surgeon.\n''Sometimes it's hard to find people because they go by nicknames,'' Ms. Bracero said. ''I tell the crew leader, 'I'm looking for Jose Perez,' and he says, 'There's no one here by that name.' It turns out that everybody calls Jose 'Botija' -- the little fat guy.''\nThe next stop is a boarding house in Modena to pick up a patient for her clinic appointment. ''My knees are bothering me,'' the woman says in Spanish. ''Maybe it is arthritis.''\nBefore heading back, Ms. Bracero finds her way to another apple farm nearby to drop off medication for a sick child. She comes out of a trailer holding three Delicious apples, a gift from the family.\nClinic staff members grapple with the chronic ailments that plague farmworkers. According to 1997 data collected by the migrant health program, hypertension caused by poor diet and the workers' precarious, stressful way of life was the single most common diagnosis.\nNext were skin problems, like rashes and inflammations, caused by exposure to pesticides, fungi in the soil and other natural allergens. Diabetes is often diagnosed, especially among Latinos, who are predisposed to the disease. Ear infections are also common. Muscular-skeletal problems, especially back and shoulder pain, are common among field and apple workers, who climb ladders and haul apple buckets. So are depression and anxiety, which are harder to diagnose, said Vera Wisniewski, a licensed practical nurse who works at the clinic.\nThe New Paltz clinic is run year-round by Hudson River HealthCare, a Peekskill-based community health center, as part of its 12-year-old migrant health program. There is another year-round clinic in Goshen, in Orange County, and in the growing season, the program reaches farmworkers in Dutchess, Putnam and Columbia counties with a mobile health van and a trailer-clinic based at a corn farm. The migrant health program is one of just three in the state serving farmworkers and their families, whose numbers range from 30,000 to 90,000, depending on who is counting.\nThe program receives $90,000 from the state and $280,000 from the federal government to provide primary care and support services. Mr. LaSalle estimates that each patient visit costs the clinic $150, for which farmworkers pay $10 for a first visit, and $5 afterward. ''The way I approach it, we're saving tax dollars that would go to hospitals for acute care for these patients,'' Mr. LaSalle said.\nMigrant health programs date to the early 1960's when the federal government responded to CBS television's classic expos\u00e9 ''Harvest of Shame'' on the plight of farmworkers. Last year, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, a unit of the Department of Health and Human Services, awarded $80 million to 400 clinics serving farmworkers in 42 states. Some are run by public health agencies, while others are operated by nonprofit groups like Hudson River Health Care. All together, the clinics reached more than half a million farmworker families last year -- still a fraction of a population estimated at four million nationally.\nIn Ulster and Orange Counties, where a majority of the Hudson Valley farmworkers are, the year-round clinics serve a growing number of workers and their families who remain in the area in winter. Some work for orchard owners pruning trees or in apple packinghouses; others find nonfarm work.\nAbout 85 percent of patients have no health insurance, while the rest have Medicaid and Child Health Plus, the state's health insurance program for uninsured children. In 2000, the migrant health program in Ulster served 2,600 patients, 700 of them at the New Paltz clinic.\n''I'll tell you who's getting a bargain,'' said Mr. O'Barr, the migrant health program director. ''The growers. They're getting a federal subsidy for health insurance for their employees.''\nMary Troncillito is one grower who appreciates the clinic's services. She and her husband, Alan, own Troncillito Farms, a 75-year-old orchard in Marlboro, N.Y., which grows apples, peaches and plums. ''We can't afford health insurance for our employees; we can barely provide it for ourselves,'' said Mrs. Troncillito.\nHer contact for the clinic is Mr. Gould, who visits her farm to pick up and deliver patients. ''Kenny gives a lot of himself,'' she said. ''He has even driven to La Guardia Airport when they come home.'' Mrs. Troncillito also calls the clinic when she needs Spanish translation for workers who do not speak English.\nThe clinic shares space with several businesses in a sprawling renovated Victorian house on the outskirts of New Paltz. The staff also includes a patient representative, Nellie Baez Brown. A physician comes once a week for serious cases and a nurse midwife visits every other week to provide women's wellness care.\nClinic doors open at 2 p.m. but the waiting room will not fill up until after 5 or 6, when the workday is over, and in the growing season doors may not close until 11:30 p.m. For Ms. Bracero and Mr. Gould, that means another hour or more ferrying patients back home to farmworker camps scattered around the county.\nThe clinic staff offers an impressive array of services both medical and social: pediatric exams and immunizations; screenings for tuberculosis and sexually transmitted disease, including H.I.V.; Pap tests and contraception, and enrollment in Medicaid, Child Health Plus and a food subsidy program for pregnant women and children. Ms. Brown, Ms. Bracero, Mr. Gould and Ms. Wisniewski -- all fluent in Spanish -- are certified to do pre- and post-H.I.V. test counseling. They escort women to Vassar Brothers Hospital in Poughkeepsie for mammograms and for prenatal care.\nFor diagnoses that require specialist care, the clinic makes referrals to two local doctors who are willing to see farmworkers at a much-reduced fee. ''I send the dermatologist about five a month and the surgeon the same,'' Mr. LaSalle said. ''I abuse the guys we have.''\nThe dermatologist charges just $25 a visit, while the surgeon charges $75, half his usual fee. The man with the gallbladder tumor received the diagnosis after Mr. LaSalle sent him for a sonogram after he complained of stomach pain. The man, an apple worker, could never afford an operation. ''I'm going to send him to the surgeon, and the social worker will try to apply for emergency Medicaid for him,'' Mr. LaSalle said.\nThe clinic has also had luck with Dedrick's Pharmacy in New Paltz, which provides prescription medicines at cost for the farmworkers. ''They do the decent thing,'' Mr. LaSalle said. ''Patients pay a $20 co-pay. They carry their weight, unless they're desperate.''\nFor all the difficulties inherent in their work, clinic staff members clearly relish what they do with an almost missionary zeal. Their mission -- to boldly go where no doctors or nurses have gone before, to seek out new patients -- is what health care delivery is all about.\n''You couldn't pay a doctor to be here,'' Mr. LaSalle said. ''So I'm a doctor to people who will probably never see a real doctor. And in 12 years, I've never had a complaint. The people I see need access. They're grateful for the care. They don't care about titles.''"}, {"text": "For Arab-Americans, a Time of Disquiet\n2001-09-30T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE day after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Abdel Sharab was tending his store in southwest Yonkers as usual when two local men burst in and began cursing him. One threatened to bomb the store, which sells Middle Eastern food.\n''I told them you can't say that, it's a felony,'' Mr. Sharab recalled, standing over a counter display of sugar-dusted Turkish Delight.\nThe men left without doing any harm, and one of them came back later and apologized, Mr. Sharab said. Other local people, hearing about the incident, have come to his store to express their support and offer help.\nStill, he seemed shaken as he recounted other incidents of Arab-Americans being threatened or harassed merely because they come from the same part of the world as the suspects in the Sept. 11 attack.\n''All Americans are victims of this,'' Mr. Sharab said. ''We love the flag just as much as they do.''\nThe anxiety spawned by the attacks is palpable in southwest Yonkers, where most of Westchester County's roughly 20,000 Arabs live. Until recently, the cluster of Middle Eastern restaurants, markets and stores here known as ''Little Arabia'' drew little notice. But business is down in the wake of the attacks, several merchants said, and they keep a nervous eye on the street.\n''Many Arab Muslims feel we have suffered a double blow,'' said Ahmed al Khatib, the director of the National Muslim Merchant Association and a member of the Westchester American Muslim Association. ''Hundreds of Arabs worked in the World Trade Center, and many are missing. I myself know of 20, and their families are devastated.''\nAt the same time, Mr. Khatib said, Muslims have seen their religion unfairly characterized as a violent faith that lends itself easily to terrorism. Many Arab-Americans say their friends and families have been threatened, harassed and cursed in the street. District Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office is investigating four possible bias attacks since Sept. 11, including one in which a man sprayed mace in the face of an Arab-American store owner in Ardsley.\nIn Westchester, most Muslim women were afraid to go out while wearing traditional Muslim headdress, known as the hajib, Mr. Khatib said.\nEven if the current wave of suspicion subsides, there are fears that Arab-Americans could suffer disproportionately from layoffs as the economy heads toward a recession, said Joseph Sayegh, a former head of the Westchester Arab American Foundation. There could be similar damage to the community's efforts to gain political representation, he added. No Arab-American has held elective office in Westchester, though two are running for seats on the Yonkers City Council this fall.\nMost of the Arabs in Yonkers are not Muslims but Christians of Jordanian or Lebanese descent -- a distinction that is lost on many who have threatened or harassed them, said Majed Samarneh, president of the Arab American Council of Westchester.\nThe first Arabs came to Yonkers in the mid-1950's, said Issa Ereifej, executive director of the Arab American Foundation. They were Jordanian Christians, and that group continues to be the most well-educated and affluent in the community, with many professionals and business owners. Most of them came to the United States in search of better jobs rather than for cultural reasons, and were followed by Arabs from other countries, with a growing portion of Muslims.\nAs in Brooklyn and Queens, which have the largest Arab populations in the East, many left in the 1980's to try their luck in Arizona and California or to join the even larger Arab enclave in Detroit, Mr. Ereifej said. But others continued to arrive from the Middle East.\nToday, the Arab community in Yonkers is roughly the same size as the two other major suburban Arab communities in the region, Jersey City and Paterson, N.J.\nAll the Middle Eastern restaurants, markets and stores in Yonkers now have American flags placed prominently in their windows, and often a statement of solidarity with the victims. Many local merchants seemed especially eager to be friendly.\n''Salaam aleikum,'' said Niazy Tawfik, 62, as he greeted a reporter entering the Madaba Deli on South Broadway. ''That means 'peace on you.' We say that all the time.''\nMuhammad Khalil, the owner of the deli, said there had been no real trouble so far.\n''Two detectives came in the day after the attack,'' he said. ''They said there was a threat to blow up the store. Maybe they just wanted to look around and see if we had any bombs here,'' he added with a smile. ''Anyway, they said they would come back the next day with dogs, but they never came back.''\nOthers have said the police and local governments have been helpful, and seem eager to make the Arab community feel safe. But they also know their neighborhoods may well become targets for law enforcement in the domestic struggle against terrorism.\nTen days after the terrorist attack, Abbas Hamideh was speaking to a reporter in front of the apartment building his family owns in Yonkers when a group of armed men from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York City Police Department walked up and asked to speak to him.\nAs it happened, the agents only wanted to ask him some questions about a man named Muhammad Hamideh who apparently sent an e-mail boasting of his involvement in the terrorist attacks. Mr. Hamideh told them he had no relatives by that name, and after a few more questions they thanked him and went on their way.\nStill, as the agents walked away Mr. Hamideh, who was born and raised in this country, seemed uneasy.\n''That's the first time I've been questioned,'' he said. ''I wonder if they'll be back.''\nOne side effect of the added scrutiny, Mr. Hamideh said, has been reluctance to criticize American policy in the Middle East.\nMr. Hamideh, for instance, is co-chairman of Al-Awda, a Palestinian human rights group that has been strongly critical of United States support for Israel. The group had planned a march on the Israeli mission in Manhattan for Sept. 23, but called it off after the attack.\n''We decided it would be very insensitive, while the city is torn apart,'' he said. The group also received a death threat from someone who said he planned to kill group members at the rally.\nPerhaps the most painful thing for many Muslims like Mr. Hamideh has been a public perception of Islam as a violent or anti-American religion.\n''Believe me, these terrorists are not Muslims,'' said Muhammad Ali, 56, a lay spiritual leader of the Westchester Muslim Center who wore a long white beard, and was dressed in a full-length white jalabia and the traditional Muslim cap, or kaffiyeh.\nHe pointed to a verse in a bilingual copy of the Koran that forbids suicide, and to another that forbids murder. ''We need to bring the news to people, to show them this is not the way of Islam,'' he said.\nThe Muslim Center's mosque, a brick building shielded by hedges on Brookfield Road in Mount Vernon, is the largest in Westchester.\nMost of the center's 1,000 members are from Pakistan, Bangladesh and India, but there are smaller clusters from other countries, and about 10 percent are African-Americans, said Shafi Bezar, the chairman of the center's board.\nAs they arrived for Friday prayers at 1 p.m., about 150 men removed their shoes in the vestibule and sat down on a green rug to listen to a 20-minute sermon before the five minutes of prayers began. The women pray in a separate room downstairs that houses the center's school.\nImam Hafiz Amjad announced ''the conduct of a Muslim'' as his theme for the day. He emphasized the importance of moderation, and spoke about the dangers of extremes, mentioning the terrorist attack as an example.\nThe previous week, the sermon addressed the attack and its victims.\nSeveral leaders of the Arab and Muslim communities have made special efforts to reach out to Christian and Jewish leaders. In Rockland County, Dr. Mohamed S. Bhana, former president of the Rockland Islamic Center, attended the Jewish New Year ceremonies at Temple Beth Torah in Upper Nyack.\nAfter the prayer, as men milled around eating a catered Pakistani lunch in front of the mosque, several said they had been far less concerned about their own safety than about that of their wives and children.\nSome of the children attend Darul Arkam, Westchester's only Muslim school, which is in the basement of the Muslim Center's mosque. Founded two years ago, the school has grown rapidly, and now has 105 students, mostly from lower Westchester. It offers classes in English and Arabic for children in kindergarten through fourth grade.\nOn the outside, it seemed like the safest possible place for a Muslim child. As the men arrived for prayer, laughing children played tag on a sheltered lawn next to the mosque with their teacher, a young woman in a black gown and hajib. At one point a police car nosed gently into the center's parking lot, and the officer leaned out and asked with a smile if everything was all right.\nBut one parent who gave her name only as Fatima said she was moving her children to a conventional public school. She was worried that her child's isolation in Muslim school would make him more vulnerable to discrimination, she said.\nAnd when asked about their experiences over the last two weeks, several teachers spoke bitterly of insults and a climate of fear. All of them said they had been afraid to wear their hajib in public, sometimes even to go outside at all.\n''Yesterday when a man was cursing me in front of my children I felt so weak,'' said Lydia Haider, who came to this country from Yemen at age 11. ''And a woman shouted at my friend in the street, 'You better pray to God that he'll forgive you for this.' ''\nMs. Haider added that the expressions of bias seemed particularly unfair because Americans do not seem to care when Muslims lose their lives in other countries, particularly Israel.\n''Six thousand people are important, but millions of people have been killed because of U.S. policies,'' Ms. Haider said. ''Isn't that terrorism too?''\nAnother woman who identified herself only as Shereen said that an assistant in a Westchester doctor's office refused to speak to her, and then told her she should have her tubes tied so that she could have no more children.\nNazim Khan, the principal of the school, said: ''I don't see why we're being treated like this. We're law-abiding citizens.'' His own wife, he added, who had never gone in public without her hajib for 25 years in this country, went without it during the week after the attack.\nEven in the more affluent suburbs of central and northern Westchester, Muslim women have been anxious.\n''For the first week I did not leave the house,'' said Malika Niazi, 43, who lives in Chappaqua and with her husband arranges a weekly prayer meeting for 50 Muslim families in a room provided by the Mount Kisco Presbyterian Church.\nMs. Niazi's daughter Zareen said one of her Muslim classmates at Horace Greeley High School had reported being harassed, and there were several anti-Muslim notes on a message board in the school in the week after the attack.\nBut the school administration has been very kind and supportive, she said, and she and the other Muslim students felt safe.\nAnd one good side effect of all the scrutiny has been that Americans, after a few missteps, seem to be learning more about their Muslim fellow citizens.\n''I'm finding that the press is starting to show Islam in its true light,'' Ms. Niazi said. ''That's a wonderful thing.''"}, {"text": "New Pollution Tool: Toxic Avengers With Leaves\n2001-03-06T05:00:00.000Z\nAs scientists struggle to find cheaper, easier ways to clean up polluted soil and groundwater, they are increasingly wielding a novel tool: plants.\nIn the United States alone, the cost of decontaminating tens of thousands of toxic sites on factory grounds, farms and military installations is expected to eventually surpass $700 billion, several analyses show.\nThe main approach so far, digging out offending chemicals and carting them to special landfills, is costly and disruptive, often requiring fleets of trucks, forests of mechanical wells and other equipment.\nAfter a decade of field and greenhouse tests, a variety of techniques harnessing the absorptive power of plants' roots appear poised for a much expanded role.\nHundreds of species of plants, together with the fungi and bacteria that infuse the rhizosphere, the ecosystem around roots, represent the botanical equivalent of detox centers, seeking and often breaking down molecules that can harm most other life, soil scientists and botanists say.\nThere are sunflowers that capture uranium, ferns that thrive on arsenic, alpine herbs that hoard zinc, mustards that lap up lead, clovers that eat oil and poplar trees that destroy dry-cleaning solvents.\nIn fact, poplars are so effective that people in the fast-growing ''phytoremediation'' business have a new name for them. ''A stand of poplars is a self-assembling solar-powered pump-and-treat system,'' said Steven A. Rock, an environmental engineer in the National Risk Management Research Laboratory of the federal Environmental Protection Agency in Cincinnati.\nThere, Mr. Rock is part of a team tracking research into ways plants can fight pollution. Small tests have been run at some sites on the federal Superfund list of worst toxic spills, and a growing number of larger projects have successfully cleaned plots where pollution is not as severe but still violates standards.\nIt is this kind of pollution problem -- with low, dispersed, but harmful levels of contamination -- that has proved least amenable to conventional technologies and is likely to be the most valuable niche for plants, Mr. Rock and other experts said.\nStill, he and many scientists stress that there are still many questions to resolve before a particular project gets going.\nPlants must be chosen not only for their ability to go after the chemicals involved, but also for their tolerance of weather and other conditions at a site.\nSome plants that meet these requirements may actually make matters worse. For example, research is still under way to determine whether some solvents extracted from the ground by trees end up evaporating through pores in leaves.\nFor now, it appears that very little gets into the air, and what does is usually quickly degraded by sunlight, a variety of scientists say. But more work is being done.\nAlso, care must be taken to avoid the chance that insects or wildlife might eat plants that have accumulated high concentrations of toxic materials. Some laboratory studies are showing that insects avoid plants with high metal concentrations, and that pattern may explain how the metal-accumulating trait evolved in the first place.\nPerhaps the biggest limitation of plants is that they take time to grow and time to work, with several crops over months or successive seasons often needed to eliminate pollution.\nAt sites requiring urgent action, there will always be the need to ''dig and dump,'' said Dr. Steven P. McGrath, senior principal scientist at the Institute of Arable Crops Research, in Hartfordshire, England, and an expert in the use of plants to purge metals from the soil.\nBut he is one of many experts who still see enormous potential worldwide for the greener method.\n''These techniques offer the promise of cleaning up the legacy of pollution in a cost-effective way,'' Dr. McGrath said. ''With biological methods, prices come down by orders of magnitude into an area where as a society we can afford it.''\nSo far, the market appears to agree with Dr. McGrath. A recent analysis of the phytoremediation business by Dr. David J. Glass, a biologist and environmental business analyst in Needham, Mass., projected that the industry, with $50 million to $86 million in revenues in 2000, is likely to see an annual income of $100 million to $170 million by next year and reach $400 million a year by 2005.\nThat does not count the possible market overseas, Dr. Glass said, where low-cost cleanups will find many uses as developing countries eventually grapple with the side effects of industrialization. ''Twenty-five years from now, it'll be the rest of the world that's cleaning up,'' Dr. Glass said.\nA Mystery of Chemistry\nAnother potential impediment to acceptance of plants in toxic cleanups is that, to a significant extent, much remains unknown about just how they do what they do, Mr. Rock said. The rhizosphere and the chemical processes that carry pollutants into roots and then stash them harmlessly in plant tissue still constitute ''a green box,'' he said. ''We know what goes in, we know what comes out, but we're not at all sure what's going on inside.''\nFor years, this mystery kept regulatory agencies -- long focused on traditional technologies -- from taking phytoremediation seriously, he said. But with a growing list of successful projects, the method is proving its worth -- even if some of the physiology and chemistry remains murky, he added.\n''The most important thing is to make sure nothing bad is leaving a site,'' Mr. Rock said. ''You have the same cleanup standard whether you dig it, burn it or grow something on it. It's got to be the same level of clean. It's just another tool in the toolbox.''\nWhat is known is that plants' roots evolved as extremely efficient mechanisms for pulling necessary nutrients, water and minerals out of the ground.\nDr. Ilya Raskin, a professor of plant biology at Rutgers, who is widely credited with coining the term phytoremediation 12 years ago, said the lengths of the maze of roots and tiny root hairs of a single sunflower plant could total many miles.\n''Plants can't run around hunting for food,'' Dr. Raskin said. ''So they must harvest it. Root systems are a giant solar-driven harvesting mechanism that permeates every nook and crevice in the soil.''\nDr. Raskin conducted early tests of ways to exploit this mechanism to sop up radioactive substances and heavy metals. One of the most striking tests took place in 1995 in a small pond within sight of the Chernobyl nuclear power plants in Ukraine, where sunflowers were grown on Styrofoam rafts with their roots dangling in the water.\nThe pond, like everything for miles around, was contaminated with Strontium 90, Cesium 137 and other harmful radioactive substances released during the reactor fire in 1986. Within days, the sunflowers, which have dense mops of roots, accumulated levels of cesium and strontium that were several thousand times as high as the concentrations in the water.\nOften, plants gather nutrients and other chemicals in the soil in tandem with bacteria and other soil life. Through photosynthesis, the plants pump oxygen and specialized enzymes down into the ground, helping the micro-organisms break down organic material.\nAs far as botanists know, the rigors of natural selection -- at least until well into the 20th century -- did not involve surviving exposure to substances like trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, a metal-degreasing solvent, or ethylene dibromide, a pesticide used to kill soil nematodes that has been banned in the United States but sometimes taints aquifers beneath farmland. Even so, some plants effectively dismantle these synthetic compounds, according to a variety of studies and field tests.\nAt an E.P.A. research laboratory in Athens, Ga., studies showed that an enzyme produced by a common aquatic weed, parrot feather, effectively destroyed trinitrotoluene, better known as TNT. This has led to several successful pilot projects in which artificial wetlands removed the chemical from water that had flowed under military firing ranges.\nFrom Ecuador to the Hudson River Valley, similar constructed wetlands are already cleaning up polluted water from landfills, slaughterhouses, cider mills, sewage plants, fish farms and parking lots.\nPutting Trees to Work\nOne of the most established techniques is using trees, mostly poplars and willows, to pump and treat groundwater from aquifers contaminated with solvents or other toxic organic compounds.\nPhytokinetics Inc., based in North Logan, Utah, is one of more than half a dozen companies deploying trees to treat such sites. At the peak of the growing season, said Dr. Ari M. Ferro, a biochemist and Phytokinetics' president, each tree can pump more than 15 gallons of water each day. At former oil refineries in Wyoming and Montana, the company has planted plots with 1,000 trees per acre, resulting in a pumping rate of 10 gallons a minute per acre.\n''The trees are pumping like crazy,'' Dr. Ferro said. ''The contaminants get sucked up into the root zone and biodegraded.''\nOther trees are being put to work, with plantings of koa on a pineapple plantation in Hawaii extracting ethylene dibromide from groundwater.\nThe quickest growth in the business is in the use of plants to remove heavy metals from soil.\nOne of the notable successes in this area came last year in Detroit, when Edenspace Systems, a phytoremediation company in Chantilly, Va., completed a cleanup of a lead-laced plot of land tucked amid a complex of DaimlerChrysler buildings.\nThe top four feet of soil was bulldozed to a nearby area and planted in sunflowers and then Indian mustard, both of which are known to accumulate lead. The lead concentration in the soil was reduced 43 percent, bringing it below federal and state limits. The project cost $900,000, according to Michael Curry, the remediation project manager for the company. But that was more than $1 million less than it would have cost to cart the 5,700 cubic yards of soil to a hazardous waste landfill. Instead, only a few cubic yards of tainted plant material had to be disposed of, he said.\n''It's not a magic bullet, but it's very cost effective,'' Mr. Curry said. ''We'd definitely consider doing it again.''\nJust as botanists have been scouring the plant world for promising drugs, now they are seeking particular species that have evolved the ability to target roots at hot spots of a variety of toxic heavy metals and other elements in soil and accumulate concentrations so high that some of them, when dried, are up to 5 percent metal by weight.\nDr. Alan J. M. Baker, a botany professor at the University of Melbourne in Australia, is one of the veteran plant prospectors, having found promising species from New Caledonia to Crete. The count of metal accumulators is more than 440 species, he said.\nIn France, researchers studying the zinc-loving trait of alpine pennycress, a wild European herb, recently showed that its roots seek out the hottest hot spots of the metal, which often accumulates in farmland and is toxic to many other plants.\nA Plant That Loves Arsenic\nThe latest discovery came at a central Florida lumberyard where the ground was badly contaminated with arsenic compounds from wood preservatives. Arsenic is so toxic to most plants that it is an ingredient in some herbicides. But after scientists at the University of Florida tested 14 plant species growing there, last year they found that the brake fern, common in the Southeast and other parts of the world, had arsenic in its fronds and stems at more than 200 times the concentration in the soil.\nThe work was reported last month in Nature. Under a licensing deal, the fern is being sold by Edenspace to filter the element out of water. The E.P.A. recently reduced limits for arsenic in drinking water in this country, and it also contaminates thousands of wells in Bangladesh.\nDr. Lena Q. Ma, an associate professor of soil and environmental chemistry at the university and the study leader, said her main interest was determining how the plant works. ''It not only tolerates arsenic, it loves it,'' Dr. Ma said. ''It has to have some mechanism to take it up and store it in a form that doesn't interfere with the plant and kill it. That's our next work.''\nThe next frontier, as in so many other areas of biology, is genetic manipulation, as scientists seek to blend the best attributes of different plants -- and not just plants. Already, yellow poplars have been grown with a gene taken from bacteria that transform a toxic form of mercury into a safer one.\nAnd last June, research described in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences successfully inserted into tobacco plants a gene for a mammalian liver enzyme that breaks down a variety of toxic organic chemicals.\nThe gene functioned ''spectacularly'' in one plant, said Dr. Lee A. Newman, an author of the study who teaches at the University of South Carolina School of Public Health.\nShe was involved in the Hawaiian project using koa trees and has also used poplars in successful TCE cleanups in Oregon and Washington.\nThe next goal would be to try to insert the mammalian gene in trees or other larger plants that could extract much larger amounts of the particular chemicals, she said. But she acknowledged that even though such plants would never turn up in a taco shell or other human food, the prospect of genetic manipulation would probably be looked at skeptically by the public.\nIn all of the cleanups, she said, even with unaltered plant species, great care will have to be taken to avoid mistakes.\n''If you have a couple of big flops people will lose confidence,'' she said."}, {"text": "At Home, Mexico Mistreats Its Migrant Farmhands\n2001-05-06T05:00:00.000Z\nIf Patricio G\u00f3mez had left his country to work illegally on farms in the United States, Mexico's new president would call him a national hero and insist that he enjoy decent working conditions. But instead Mr. G\u00f3mez provides food for American grocery shelves from this side of the border, and the Mexican government has not paid the same attention to his plight.\n''No one defends us,'' Mr. G\u00f3mez, 33, said while hauling wooden stakes taller than himself to a field of sweet red peppers on a farm near here in the western state of Sinaloa. ''They do not pay us what they promised. And if we are sick, they do not give us the medicine we need.''\nBy noon on a recent day, Mr. G\u00f3mez, as haggard as a scarecrow, had been at work seven hours. He expected to work until sunset for a little more than $5 for the day. His barefoot children -- ages 8, 10 and 11 -- worked at his side.\nAsked whether they attended school, Mr. G\u00f3mez lowered his eyes and shook his head to signify no. Each one was an important breadwinner, he said. And the $1,500 the G\u00f3mez family hoped to take home at the end of the harvest was just about all the money the family would have for the year. ''If the whole family does not work,'' Mr. G\u00f3mez lamented, ''we all starve.''\nLike birds that follow migratory patterns set by the seasons, Mr. G\u00f3mez and his family are among the one million Mexicans who abandon their homes for part of the year to move north with the harvests.\nPresident Vicente Fox has been an outspoken advocate of Mexican laborers in the United States, pressing Washington to improve their working conditions. But in his five months in office, he has not devoted a speech to the cares of migrant workers at home. And after his election it was discovered that children as young as 11 worked at the Fox family's own plants packing vegetables.\nFrom November until May, tens of thousands of migrants circle the Gulf Coast states to cut sugar cane and pick oranges and cotton. Others fan out across Mexico's heartland to pack cauliflower and broccoli and tobacco. And in the nation's largest migrations, hundreds of thousands migrate along routes that cut a long figure eight along Mexico's Pacific northwest to harvest millions of boxes of fruit and vegetables, most of it for export to the United States.\nAbout 200,000 people settle in nearly 150 work camps across Sinaloa, arriving on fleets of buses sent by the growers. The migrants -- the poorest of Mexico's 40 million poor -- are called jornaleros (hor-nah-LAY-ros), a name derived from the Spanish word for a day's wage. And their lives look like a twisted reflection in a carnival mirror of the experiences of unskilled Mexican workers in the United States.\nThey do not leave their homes because they are looking for better wages; they leave because they are looking for any wages. Many of these internal migrants earn nothing at all at home -- there are no paying jobs around -- and survive only on the beans and corn that they manage to grow on little plots outside their tumbledown houses.\nThey do not travel in gangs of single men, but mostly as families or entire communities. Almost 40 percent are Indians who do not speak Spanish well.\nAnd although their work has made Sinaloa the largest producer of vegetables in the nation, for the months that they are here they live as outcasts in ramshackle work camps made from tin. Half are women and girls, farm worker advocates report, and at least 30 percent are children under 15.\nPresident Fox has created a new cabinet-level agency to work on issues of Mexicans abroad. He has pressed President Bush to open the border to a freer flow of Mexican workers. Members of Mr. Fox's cabinet are involved in negotiations with Washington over the creation of programs to give the Mexican workers more power to demand fair wages and decent living conditions.\nAnd in a May Day celebration last Tuesday, Mr. Fox honored as ''heroes'' those Mexicans who had been forced by economic hardships to pursue a better way of life north of the border and who send nearly $8 billion of earnings back to their homeland.\nBut Mr. Fox, the son of ranchers, has not devoted any significant political capital to the abuses against migrants who labor on Mexican soil. And when Mexican reporters discovered that children had been employed in packing plants owned by his family, a violation of Mexican law, the president sought first to distance himself from the matter, saying: ''This is not an issue for me. It is an issue for others whose names are Fox.'' Later, Mr. Fox's family dismissed more than 20 minors from the operations and the president acknowledged the violations as a sad reality of Mexican life.\n''This is an issue for all of Mexico,'' he said. ''It is an issue we want to resolve.''\nWithout his usual fanfare, Mr. Fox went on to increase spending for the single federal program aimed at building housing, schools and day-care centers for migrant farm workers by 25 percent. But five months after his budget was approved by Congress, officials said, money for the project is still being held up as officials decide how it should be used.\nMexico's minister of social development, Josefina V\u00e1squez Mota, said that the Fox administration had increased spending on migrant farm worker programs more than on any other of the agency's programs. And when asked about labor violations, especially the use of child workers, she said corruption continued in all sectors of Mexican society. She added, ''The lack of respect for the law in the countryside hurts the most vulnerable people in our country.''\n''We not only recognize the grave inequalities that are endured by the jornaleros, we are worried about them,'' she said. ''And we are determined to make improvements.''\nMs. V\u00e1squez said that in an effort to create jobs in the south, President Fox had promised to lure border plants away from the industrial north and to offer micro-loans so that peasant farmers could start small businesses at home.\nThe government has also spent $52 million in the last five years to improve worker camps. In Sinaloa, officials said, some 20 percent of them are in ''decent condition.''\nBut all sides agree -- government officials, growers and farm worker advocates -- that the overwhelming majority of Mexican farm workers endure dangerous and unsanitary conditions.\n''I know that conditions for Mexican workers in the United States are bad,'' said Hubert C. de Grammont, a sociologist who has studied Mexican agriculture and the plight of migrant farm workers for more than 20 years. ''But it is difficult to try to defend the human rights of migrants in the United States when migrants are ignored and disrespected in our own country.''\nCamp Caimanes near this town seems a microcosm of Mexico's dark side, a shantytown of 2,000 people at the edge of a field of tomatoes where residents take relief from the heat in the brown-green water of a canal; where children, exhausted after a day at work in the fields, never protest bedtime; and where drug abuse has increasingly become the most popular form of recreation.\nThe workers live in long, flat barracks with primitive cement hearths out front for cooking. Each family gets one room, about the size of a garage, and many families come with a dozen relatives each.\nFresh out of college, 22-year-old Viviana Parra Flores is one of two social workers assigned to worker problems. But during a walk around the camp with her and a colleague, they made clear that the camp often escaped their control. After leaving the fly-infested day-care center, the counselors said that four children had died during the harvest.\nOnly the night before, a fire had destroyed some hovels at the camp. No one was injured, the social workers said. But most of the workers who had lived there, about 20 families, lost everything, down to every cent they had earned for the season.\nRuperta Tolentino Fern\u00e1ndez, her long braids matted with mud, said her family lost about $1,000. She and her husband have five children, ranging in age from 3 to 14. All but the 3-year-old work, she said.\n''Now we will be beggars when we go home,'' she said.\nSinaloa's governor, Juan S. Mill\u00e1n, said: ''Just a couple of years ago, there were only a few camps where I could take visitors without feeling ashamed. Today, there are a few more decent camps. But there is so much more that needs to be done.''\nIn Sinaloa, agriculture is a $600 million industry controlled by an elite group of fewer than 20 families, said Mar\u00eda Teresa Guerra, a human rights lawyer who has written a book about the state's farm workers. Sinaloa is the largest producer of vegetables in the nation thanks to its 11 rivers and a sprawling system of government-built dams and canals.\nOne grower, Roberto Gotsis, took a visitor on a tour of a camp he had just built for 200 of his company's 1,000 workers. His family, he said, had been growing cucumbers, tomatoes and red peppers in Sinaloa since the 1920's.\nMr. Gotsis, who has a degree from the University of Arizona, estimated that the company sold tomatoes in the United States for almost $7 a box. Peppers, he said, fetch about $15 a box. As for his workers, he added, they earn about a nickel for each box they filled.\nOn a tour of the day-care center he had built in the new camp, the 36-year-old Mr. Gotsis proclaimed the arrival to power of a ''new generation'' of growers who ''understand that our workers must live better.''\nLorenzo P\u00e9rez, who spent the season at another camp, Penjamo, was pretty happy with life one recent Saturday. He had made about $7 that day, a couple of dollars more than usual. But what was most exciting, he said, was that he had finally picked more tomatoes than his father. ''Now I am the fastest cutter in my family,'' he gloated.\nDiana Ram\u00edrez, 14, was washing jeans in the canal below. She smiled as Lorenzo bragged and vowed that he would stop picking tomatoes one day and drive a tractor.\nWhen asked about her own hopes, Diana's mind cast forward as far as tomorrow. ''Women do not drive tractors,'' she said with a shrug. ''I will work in the fields.''\nMade in Squalor\nArticles in this series are examining third-world production for first-world markets.

He was 58.\nThe cause was cancer, which he had been fighting since 1998.\nNews of his death saddened fans, who turned out by the hundreds in places of special significance, like Abbey Road in London, the site of the EMI recording studio, and Strawberry Fields in Central Park, planted in memory of John Lennon.\nWith a look and a wardrobe that seemed to zigzag along with the vicissitudes of the 1960's, 70's and 80's, Mr. Harrison often took a back seat to the more flamboyant Lennon and Paul McCartney. He was known as the reclusive one, ''the quiet Beatle,'' during the group's manic touring years.\nYet he served as an anchor for the quartet, leading the others on a spiritual quest toward Eastern philosophy that influenced their music in the latter part of the 1960's, epitomized for millions of fans by the sitar he played on ''Norwegian Wood.''\nSome of his best compositions, like ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps,'' and ''Something,'' stand alone in the Beatles' canon for their introspective beauty. Others, like ''Taxman'' and ''Piggies,'' were brutally mundane.\nBefore the group broke up, he helped steer it to exclusively studio recording, a compatible environment for experimentation. And afterward, he continued composing and singing, with hits like ''My Sweet Lord'' that resonated with faith.\nHis quiet nature hid a dark sense of humor, even about his own mortality. When ''Horse to Water,'' a new song that he wrote with his son, Dhani, appeared last month on ''Small World Big Band,'' a new album by the British keyboardist Jools Holland, it carried the publishing credit ''Rip Ltd., 2001,'' apparently implying ''Rest in Peace.''\nIn the 31 years since the Beatles broke up, Mr. Harrison made a series of variably successful albums, including two with the Traveling Wilburys, a tongue-in-cheek supergroup that included Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison.\nHis 1971 concert to aid refugees in Bangladesh -- for which he enlisted Mr. Dylan and the musicians Eric Clapton, Leon Russell and Billy Preston and another former Beatle, Ringo Starr -- created the concept of the all-star charity rock concert. Live Aid, Farm Aid and the recent Concert for New York followed its pattern. He also produced a small but varied catalog of recordings by other performers for his own Dark Horse record label in the 1970's.\nBeyond his musical career, he was the executive producer of Handmade Films, an independent production company that had several hits between the late 1970's and the early 1990's. He prepared several collections of memoirs and lyrics for Genesis Editions, a British publisher of expensive limited-edition books, and provided copious commentary for the books the company published by Derek Taylor, the Beatles' former press aide, and Ravi Shankar, the sitar master with whom he studied in the mid-1960's.\nIn the 1990's Mr. Harrison participated with his former colleagues in the Beatles' ''Anthology,'' a retrospective that included a 10-hour video history, six discs of previously unreleased recordings and a book.\n''I am devastated and very, very sad,'' Sir Paul told reporters yesterday outside his home in London. ''He was a lovely guy, and a very brave man and had a wonderful sense of humor. He is really just my baby brother.''\nMr. Starr, the other surviving Beatle, issued a statement saying: ''George was a best friend of mine. I loved him very much and I will miss him very greatly.''\nMr. Harrison's recent projects included the production of an expanded reissue of his 1970 album, ''All Things Must Pass.'' He was also planning to oversee the remastering of his other recordings, and an album of new material was in the works.\nSerious From the Start\nBut Mr. Harrison will unquestionably be best remembered for his work with the Beatles. He was 19 in 1962 when the Beatles made their first recordings for EMI. Yet from the start he projected an air of intense seriousness.\nOnstage, he appeared more concerned with getting the details of a guitar solo right than with inciting the shrieks of the group's fans, and film clips show him looking mildly astonished by the ruckus.\nIndeed, the Beatles' appearances onstage conveyed a sense of both their relationships and personalities. Lennon often stood to the right, regarding the audience with a challenging defiance, with Sir Paul to the left, charming listeners with winks and nods. Mr. Harrison sometimes joined one or the other, but more often stood a few paces back. That isn't to say he looked dour; he had a winning smile, and when a performance clicked, he sometimes executed deft dance steps on his own.\nHe was the first Beatle to advocate abandoning the concert stage, arguing that it was pointless to perform for audiences that were making too much noise to hear the music.\n''I always really enjoyed, in our early days, before we got too famous, we used to play clubs and that kind of stuff all the time,'' he once told an interviewer. ''And it was fun. It was fun. It was good, because you get to play, and you get to get quite good on the instrument. But then we got famous, and it spoiled all that, because we'd just go round and round the world singing the same 10 dopey tunes.''\nIn the summer of 1966, the others came around to his point of view and confined their work thereafter to the recording studio. At the Beatles' recording sessions, Mr. Harrison worked diligently on the compact but often innovative solos that were his moments in the spotlight.\n6 Hours for a Brief Solo\nHis solo for Lennon's ''I'm Only Sleeping,'' recorded in 1966, shows his fastidiousness. To mirror the dream world quality of the lyrics, Mr. Harrison devised a solo guitar line, wrote out its notes in reverse order and overdubbed it onto a recording of the song that was running backward. To complicate matters even more, he recorded two versions of the solo -- one clean, one with the guitar distorted -- and combined them. His contribution to the three-minute song took six hours to record.\nAlthough the Lennon-McCartney composing team always held center stage, Mr. Harrison had a decisive influence on the Beatles' sound. During the group's formative years in the late 1950's and early 60's, he shared the others' passion for American rhythm and blues, Motown soul and the more aggressive rock of Little Richard and Elvis Presley.\nBut his passion for rockabilly artists like Carl Perkins -- a taste he shared with Mr. Starr, the Beatles' drummer -- infused the group's repertory with the twangy coloration of country music. He also had an interest in jazz chords, which colored the harmonies in some of the band's early arrangements.\nMr. Harrison's fascination with Indian music, which began in 1965 -- after he became curious about exotic instruments on the set of ''Help!,'' the group's second film -- pushed the Beatles' sound world in yet another direction. And as with everything the Beatles did, imitators were plentiful: after Mr. Harrison played his sitar solo on ''Norwegian Wood'' and began writing his own songs based on Indian motifs, dozens of rock bands adopted the instrument, and so-called raga-rock flourished briefly.\nMr. Harrison also introduced the Beatles to electronic gadgets, ranging from a simple volume pedal, used on ''Yes It Is'' and one of his own songs, ''I Need You,'' to the Moog synthesizer, which he played on the group's final album, ''Abbey Road.'' Still, he drew the line at devices like drum machines, which in his view led to the mechanization of rock. On releasing his ''Cloud Nine'' album in 1987, he described it as ''real music, made by real musicians who play real instruments.''\n'An Excuse to Go Mad'\nOf the Beatles, Mr. Harrison was the most aloof from the music business and the most troubled by fame. ''They gave their money and they gave their screams,'' Mr. Harrison said of the Beatles' fans during an interview for the ''Beatles Anthology'' in 1995. ''But the Beatles kind of gave their nervous systems. They used us as an excuse to go mad, the world did, and then blamed it on us.''\nBut if he was the most reticent of the Beatles, he sometimes delivered barbed quips. Asked during a 1965 news conference in Minneapolis how the Beatles were able to sleep with such long hair, Mr. Harrison shot back, ''How do you sleep with your arms and legs still attached?''\nMr. Harrison rarely gave interviews. Multilingual signs posted outside Friar Park, his Victorian mansion in England, brusquely warned sightseers away. And he was often impatient with autograph-seekers, his responses ranging from tearing up the item he was asked to sign to creating perfect replicas of all four Beatles' signatures.\nBut he had a generous side as well. In addition to organizing the Concert for Bangladesh and the recording and film it yielded, he established the Romanian Angel Appeal in 1990 to provide support for Romanian orphans. To raise money, he assembled ''Nobody's Child,'' an album of rare recordings by American and British colleagues. He also performed in Heartbeat '86, a concert to raise money for a British hospital charity, and in the Prince's Trust charity concert in 1987.\nThe Boys on the Bus\nGeorge Harrison was born in Liverpool on Feb. 25, 1943, the youngest of Harold and Louise French Harrison's four children. His father drove the bus that took him and Paul, who was a year older, to the Liverpool Institute, a secondary school. He showed little interest in academic work, devoting himself to the guitar. By the time he was 14 and met Paul, he had formed a band, the Rebels, and began bringing his guitar to dances, hoping to be asked to play.\nPaul had only recently joined John's group, the Quarry Men, as a guitarist (he later switched to bass), and early in 1958 he invited George to a Quarry Men performance. After the show, George auditioned for John, reportedly on the upper deck of a bus. He could do something that John could not: imitate the solos on American rock records.\nJohn, three years older, at first considered George talented but sullen, and still a child. But George tagged along, and within a few months he was in the band. He continued to work with other Liverpool bands, but by October 1959, he threw in his lot with the Quarry Men, which John renamed the Beatles in 1960.\nMr. Harrison's songwriting interests were limited in the group's early years. He had collaborated with Sir Paul on ''In Spite of All the Danger'' in 1958, and with Lennon on ''Cry for a Shadow,'' a Duane Eddy-influenced instrumental recorded in Germany in 1961 during the band's backup sessions for the British singer Tony Sheridan. But as the Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership flourished, Mr. Harrison was content at first to play his solos and occasionally step up to the microphone to sing rock classics like Carl Perkins's ''Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby'' and Chuck Berry's ''Roll Over Beethoven.''\nIn time, there were Lennon-McCartney songs written with Mr. Harrison's voice in mind, like ''Do You Want to Know a Secret'' and ''I'm Happy Just to Dance With You.''\nA Songwriting Success\nIn the summer of 1963, he decided to try his hand at songwriting and produced ''Don't Bother Me,'' a song the group included on ''With the Beatles,'' its second album.\n''I don't think it's a particularly good song,'' Mr. Harrison wrote in ''I Me Mine,'' his 1980 autobiography. ''It mightn't even be a song at all, but at least it showed me that all I needed to do was keep on writing and then maybe, eventually, I would write something good.''\nAnother year and a half elapsed before Mr. Harrison was able to interest the band in another of his songs, but two of his compositions, ''I Need You'' and ''You Like Me Too Much,'' made it onto the ''Help!'' album in 1965. Neither had the ingenuity or dimension that the Lennon-McCartney team were giving their songs of the time, yet traces of Harrison's later style -- most notably, the slightly mournful quality of his melodies -- were beginning to emerge. Thereafter, Mr. Harrison had at least one and as many as four songs on each of the group's albums.\nSitars and Spirituality\nAt the end of 1965, Mr. Harrison used a sitar on a Beatles album for the first time, and soon he was studying the instrument formally with Mr. Shankar. To put his studies to practical use, Mr. Harrison began writing songs in an Indian style and inviting Indian musicians to Beatles' sessions to help record them. The first of these was ''Love You to,'' on the 1966 ''Revolver'' album. ''Within You Without You,'' Mr. Harrison's lushly orchestrated contribution to ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' took this influence farther.\nIn 1967 he wrote the score for the film ''Wonderwall,'' in which Eastern and Western musical influences mingled freely. In 1968 the soundtrack was the first release on the Beatles' own record label, Apple. While in Bombay recording the Indian sections of the soundtrack, he taped an ensemble playing a traditional raga and set words to it adapted from Lao-tzu's Tao Te Ching. None of the other Beatles performed on the song, ''The Inner Light,'' but it became the first of Mr. Harrison's compositions to be released on a Beatles' single (albeit on the B side, with ''Lady Madonna'').\nMr. Harrison's interest in Indian philosophy and spiritualism addressed the other Beatles' concerns as well, and when he became interested in the transcendental meditation techniques of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, his bandmates followed him to India to study.\n''Everybody dreams of being famous, rich and famous,'' Mr. Harrison later said about the start of his spiritual quest. ''Once you get rich and famous, you think, 'this wasn't it.' And that made me go on to find out what it is. In the end, you're trying to find God. That's the result of not being satisfied. And it doesn't matter how much money or property or whatever you've got, unless you're happy in your heart, then that's it. And unfortunately, you can never gain perfect happiness unless you've got that state of consciousness that enables that.''\nLeaving the Beatles\nThe others soon gave up on Eastern spirituality, but Mr. Harrison remained a devotee of Hinduism, or Krishna Consciousness, as he preferred to describe his beliefs. In his music, he returned to a more conventional Western style. His contributions to ''The Beatles'' (known as the ''White Album'') and the soundtrack of the animated film ''Yellow Submarine'' (both released in 1968), ranged from the proto-heavy metal of ''All Too Much'' to the sublimely poetic beauty of ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps,'' and showed a new compositional maturity.\nBy the time of the ''White Album'' sessions, Mr. Harrison was writing so prolifically that the Beatles could not accommodate all his work. He also undertook private musical experiments, including the synthesizer pieces released on his ''Electronic Sound'' album. And he forged musical relationships outside the Beatles, notably with Mr. Clapton, who had played the solo on Mr. Harrison's ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps.''\nBy early 1969, a few weeks into the sessions for the ''Let It Be'' album, he quit the band, returning only after the others agreed to give up a plan to perform live again and to give his songs greater consideration. As it turned out, the sessions yielded only one finished Harrison song, ''For You Blue.'' A second, ''I Me Mine,'' was recorded in January 1970 for the ''Let It Be'' album. It was the last song the group recorded before its breakup three months later.\nDuring the summer of 1969 -- with the ''Let It Be'' album shelved, pending the completion of the accompanying film -- the Beatles recorded ''Abbey Road.'' Two of Mr. Harrison's finest Beatles compositions, ''Something'' and ''Here Comes the Sun,'' were included. ''Something'' became the first of his songs to be released as the A side of a single, and was widely recorded by others. Frank Sinatra once called it his favorite Beatles song.\nSoon after the Beatles split, Mr. Harrison assembled Mr. Starr, Mr. Clapton, the guitarist Dave Mason, the keyboardists Gary Brooker and Mr. Preston and the pedal steel guitarist Pete Drake and began recording the songs that the Beatles hadn't had time for. The sessions were so fruitful that the resulting album, ''All Things Must Pass,'' included two discs of new songs and a third with jam sessions. The search for a path to God and the Hindu notions of the transitory nature of the physical world were Mr. Harrison's principal subjects here, explored in songs like ''What Is Life,'' ''My Sweet Lord,'' ''The Art of Dying'' and the title song. But the album included lighter, secular songs as well, and reached the top of the Billboard charts.\nA Not So Sweet Hit\nThe album's success was gratifying for Mr. Harrison, but it caused him problems. One of his songs, ''My Sweet Lord,'' bore a striking similarity to that of the 1963 Chiffons hit, ''He's So Fine,'' and Mr. Harrison was sued for copyright infringement. The suit dragged on for 20 years, and Mr. Harrison was found guilty of ''unconscious plagiarism.''\nHe ultimately bought his antagonist's company and ended up owning both songs. He wrote ''This Song'' (1975) as a satirical look at the lawsuit, and when he reissued ''All Things Must Pass'' last year, he added ''My Sweet Lord (2000),'' a new version that avoids the melodic similarities to ''He's So Fine.''\nMr. Harrison's ''Living in the Material World'' (1973) followed the spiritual agenda set by ''All Things Must Pass,'' although mundane venality was not ignored. ''Sue Me Sue You Blues,'' for example, touched on the squabbles between the former Beatles. But the public was tiring of Mr. Harrison's religious fascinations. His next album, ''Dark Horse'' (1974), was criticized as preachy and whiny, and an American tour made matters worse: Mr. Harrison, not used to singing a complete concert set, lost his voice during rehearsals and was hoarse for the entire tour.\nHe reconsidered his approach on ''Extra Texture'' (1975) and ''33 1/3'' (1976), albums that touched on traditional blues and continued to refine a quirky, humorous personal style, best heard in ''Crackerbox Palace'' and ''This Song.'' Satire replaced sermonizing as his signature style, and it was better received.\nNevertheless, Mr. Harrison took a three-year break from recording after ''33 1/3'' and devoted himself to ending one entrepreneurial enterprise and starting another. The business he wound down was Dark Horse, the record label he started in the early 1970's and that released albums by Mr. Shankar and a handful of rock and soul bands, among them Splinter, Stairsteps, Attitudes and Jiva. None of the recordings sold well, and after 1977 Dark Horse became Mr. Harrison's imprint for his own work.\nA sideline career as a film producer was more successful. When the Monty Python comedy troupe needed financial backing for ''The Life of Brian'' in 1978, Mr. Harrison underwrote the film, laying the groundwork for his own production company, Handmade Films. Handmade quickly became a respected independent. Among its 27 films were ''The Long Good Friday,'' ''Mona Lisa,'' ''Time Bandits,'' ''Withnail and I'' and ''Shanghai Surprise.'' Mr. Harrison sold his interest in Handmade in 1994.\nVacationing From Music\nMr. Harrison also used his three years away from music to sort out his personal life. He had met his first wife, Pattie Boyd, on the set of the Beatles' first film, ''A Hard Day's Night,'' and married her in 1966. Their marriage broke up in 1974, when Ms. Boyd began living with Mr. Clapton, whose hit ''Layla'' was written for her.\nThe romance did not ruin the friendship between Mr. Harrison and Mr. Clapton: they and Ms. Boyd performed a version of the Everly Brothers' ''Bye Bye, Love'' together on Mr. Harrison's ''Dark Horse'' album, and Mr. Harrison and Mr. Clapton toured Japan together in 1991.\nMr. Harrison married Olivia Arias in 1978. She and their son survive him, as do two brothers, Peter and Harry, and a sister, Louise Harrison Caldwell.\nMr. Harrison's return to recording in 1979 yielded ''George Harrison,'' an album notably lighter in spirit and broader in subject than his previous few, with songs about several of his new passions, among them automobile racing (''Faster''), hallucinogenic mushrooms (''Soft-Hearted Hana'') and his wife (''Dark Sweet Lady''). But sales were disappointing, and when he delivered his next album, ''Somewhere in England,'' in 1980, his label, Warner, demanded that he rework the set to make it more commercially appealing.\nMr. Harrison responded by recording a new track, ''Blood From a Clone,'' that skewered the label's complaints, and another, ''Unconsciousness Rules,'' that took a swipe at disco. But another of the remakes was a reunion with Mr. Starr and Sir Paul on ''All Those Years Ago,'' a tribute to John Lennon, who was shot to death while Mr. Harrison was reworking the album. ''All Those Years Ago'' became a hit, but Mr. Harrison was dispirited by his experiences in the music business, and after another album, ''Gone Troppo'' (1982), he stepped away from music for another five years.\nA Man of Many Identities\nHis 1987 return, ''Cloud Nine,'' was a resounding success, his biggest since ''All Things Must Pass.'' Not least among its charms was a gentle parody of the Beatles in ''When We Was Fab.'' Still, neither the success of his two albums with the Traveling Wilburys, in 1988 and 1990, nor his 1991 tour of Japan with Mr. Clapton's highly polished band were able to rekindle an interest in leading a public musical life.\nIn addition to battling cancer, Mr. Harrison survived a stabbing attack by a deranged intruder at Friar Park in December 1999, which resulted in a punctured lung. More recently, he was treated for lung cancer and a brain tumor and had therapy last month at the Staten Island University Hospital and the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center.\n''Although I have guitars all around and I pick them up occasionally and write a tune and make a record, I don't really see myself as a musician,'' Mr. Harrison once said, explaining his ambivalence about the life of a rock star. ''It may seem a funny thing to say. It's just like, I write lyrics and I make up songs, but I'm not a great lyricist or songwriter or producer. It's when you put all these things together -- that makes me.''"}, {"text": "Leisure Class to Working Class in Saudi Arabia\n2001-08-26T05:00:00.000Z\nTo coax skittish young Saudis into working on an assembly line churning out 300,000 packages of cookies a day, the managers at the National Biscuits & Confectionery Company have learned to maintain a certain degree of flexibility -- and patience.\nOne Saudi man objected to wearing overalls, embarrassed when acquaintances rolled down their car windows and joked that he should avoid police patrols looking for illegal immigrants. Another disliked the job title of laborer assigned to the roughly $6,000 per year entry job, wanting to tell his new bride he was a technician. A third insisted that he belonged in management, not production.\n''A Saudi who is working on our factory floor came and said 'Why can't I become a supervisor? I graduated from college and I have a diploma and I am working among all these people from Nepal and Bangladesh and India,' '' said William Menzies, the New Zealander running the factory. ''That is a case of false expectations.''\nIt is an affliction that permeates Saudi society, rooted in the impression that a country with seemingly bottomless oil reserves would always be rich.\nBut the relaxed life is slowly vanishing. Saudi Arabia faces problems more typical of any other developing country, and young Saudis are confronting the fact that they will have to work at real jobs -- if they can find them.\nIt is a rocky transition for a country where the generation that came of age in the 1980's lived as if they had won the lottery. They garnered monthly stipends from the government for enrolling in college, and upon graduation were guaranteed a spot on the public payroll with hefty wages and a 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. workday -- basically a license to sit at home and do nothing.\n''There is an Arabic word, itikali, when you always want someone else to do something for you,'' said Prince Abdullah bin Faisal, 51, a nephew of the king and chairman of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority. ''Like now, some Saudis don't want to take work. They became lazy, spoiled.''\nSaudi Arabia has managed to lift virtually everyone out of poverty. But today, even with lofty oil prices, the petrodollars do not stretch as far, not least because they are being spread among more Saudi citizens.\nThe baby boom generation spawned by 1970's oil wealth is wading into a job market that can only generate one job for every two men. Prospects may only get worse considering that half the 14 million Saudis are under 18.\nThe tradition of ruling princes spending the country out of any problem (and please don't bother us with any silly questions while we're doing it) no longer functions smoothly. But no one envisions what can replace it.\nAs a result, the kingdom is an anxious country unsure how to open itself to the world at large, especially the West. Suddenly, it must find ways to relax its rigid traditions in order to make the economy grow. It needs jobs for a new generation whose parents napped contentedly beside the public trough. It needs to refurbish its once awe-inspiring infrastructure of soaring airport terminals, freeways and phone booths pitched in the middle of the desert. It needs power and water to reduce rolling blackouts and water rationing.\nTo some extent the future hinges on the unresolved question of how to pass down the absolute monarchy once all 44 sons of the founder, King Abdel Aziz al-Saud, are gone.\nAnd now that the royal clan numbers roughly 7,000 princes, there are also questions about how much longer some members can treat the kingdom like their private club.\nSince the discovery of oil, Saudi Arabia's wealth has existed in uneasy proximity to the country's ascetic Islamic foundations. Oil wealth allowed the Saudis to live suspended in a state of creative ambiguity.\nThe secular merchant class lives in its world and the fervently religious live in theirs. Where the interests of the two groups collide, the rules exist in shades of gray.\nThe insurance business -- suspect to the religious because they believe God wills accidents -- dwells outside formal laws, for example, because commerce depends on it. Women's driving, however, remains banned because convenience does not outweigh religious opposition.\n''The thing that people overlook or don't know or pretend they don't know is that Saudi Arabia is not an ordinary Islamic country; it is the heartland of all Islamic countries,'' said Wahib Binzagr, 68, the unassuming patriarch of a Jidda merchant clan. His affluence is only noticeable in subtle ways -- like the gold studs used to close his white robe. ''But we have to choose whether we want to be isolated or part of the world as a whole.''\nNot in Love With the Job\nFirst, Being Hired; Second, Showing Up\nTwo unusual but telling pictures appeared recently on the front page of Saudi Arabia's main business newspaper. Each showed a young man wearing a somewhat outlandish costume, opening car doors and helping to carry suitcases into the Hyatt Regency Jidda. A young Saudi taking a bellboy job here is front page news. ''The major challenge now is the growth of the population -- you have a lot of young people growing up,'' said Abdulrahman al-Tuwaijri, secretary general of the Supreme Economic Council. ''You need schools, you need health care and you need jobs.''\n''Saudization'' laws passed five years ago mandated gradually eliminating the need for millions of expatriate workers. According to the law, the number of local workers in any business had to increase five percentage points a year, which meant that by this year one-quarter of every company's employee roll was supposed to be Saudi.\nIt has not happened.\nSome employers -- banks, with marbled, air-conditioned interiors and abbreviated hours -- exceed the new levels easily. But companies that deploy thousands of street sweepers employ virtually no Saudis. The National Biscuits & Confectionery plant here is considered exemplary; it has more than 50 Saudi workers, or 11 percent, though strict adherence to the 25 percent would require 110 Saudis.\n''If I hire, on an annual basis, 200 Saudis, I find at least 150 will leave,'' sighed Muhammad H. Kadi, general manager for human resources at the factory and its sister companies.\nHiring Saudis is one thing; getting them to show up is another. Managers at the cookie factory found that 18 percent of the 80 workers brought from Nepal were absent during any given month, while more than half the Saudis did not come to work.\nStill, managers sense that the aloof attitude toward work is receding. Per capita income exceeded $28,000 in the early 1980's, matching that of the United States. The population of native Saudis has nearly doubled since, to 14 million, while the per capita income has sunk below $7,000.\nYoung Saudis fear they will never attain the same standard of living as their parents. Prospective workers no longer ask first about status issues like the size of their office.\nThe pressure of marrying young, not to mention buying a house and car, is convincing many young Saudis that even a factory job is better than none at all.\nTen years ago unemployment was a nonissue. Now it is officially pegged around 18 percent, and is probably much higher among recent graduates.\nThe picture is not likely to improve. An estimated 100,000 young men enter the labor force each year while the public and private sectors generate about 50,000 jobs.\n''It won't be long before this goes from being a concern to being a major problem,'' said Brad Bourland, chief economist for the Saudi American Bank.\nThe strain already shows. When the military college in Riyadh advertised 10 jobs last year, several prospective applicants were injured in the melee that resulted when more than 1,000 people showed up.\nAnd this is even before the kingdom considers broadening job opportunities for women. Aside from the ban on women driving cars, the obstacles to hiring women in places like factories are considerable. The legal separation of the sexes mandates an entire separate production line, separate entrances and other facilities. For the moment only a small percentage of educated women work outside the home, mostly in medicine and education. But like their male counterparts, many women crave greater opportunity.\nOfficials remain sanguine for now.\n''We don't, in the government of Saudi Arabia, admit there is unemployment, basically because there are the jobs,'' said Prince Sultan bin Salman, who is in charge of creating a tourism industry. ''There are six or seven million expatriates working in the kingdom. Many of those jobs can be done by Saudis.''\nAn Aging System\nDirty Secret Lurks Behind the Fable\nJidda, the city that styles itself as the bride of the Red Sea, harbors an extremely dirty secret. A toxic sea of raw sewage pumped from the city's septic tanks festers just inland, fed daily by at least 1,000 trucks dumping an additional 50,000 cubic meters of sewage. (About 20 Olympic-size swimming pools each day.) The fouled water then seeps into precious aquifers.\nThe fact that three-quarters of Jidda, a cosmopolitan port of some three million people, lacks a sewage system is merely the most pungent of Saudi Arabia's shortcomings.\nThe kingdom is rapidly outstripping the fabled infrastructure it bought with oil largess. The highways are still phenomenal, but the water, power and telephone systems all show their age. Big cities like Riyadh and Jidda endure rolling blackouts and water rationing, especially during peak summer demand when desert temperatures often hover around 109 degrees Fahrenheit.\n''The economy can't grow enough anymore just by dumping all the oil revenue into it,'' said Mr. Bourland of the Saudi American Bank. ''It is not enough money to fuel growth for an economy of more than 20 million people.'' Ibrahim A. al-Assaf, the finance minister, says that Saudi Arabia needs to spend $100 billion in the next 15 years to keep up with electricity demand, and that water treatment needs $27 billion in the next few years.\nTo obtain overseas investment, the kingdom is using the leverage of its oil reserves and its natural gas deposits, considered fourth in the world behind Russia, Iran and Qatar. A gas deal signed this summer will reopen the country to foreign oil companies despite fierce opposition from the domestic oil giant, Aramco.\nEight companies will explore for gas on the condition that they spend part of their initial $20 billion investment on building plants for desalination and electricity.\nBeyond that, Mr. Assaf, the finance minister, and other leading Saudi economic officials stress that Saudi Arabia intends to overhaul its entire economy with new foreign investment laws in the works, new tax laws, a new capital-markets law, new commercial laws and at least a stated goal of joining the World Trade Organization.\nJoining the W.T.O., the finance minister said, would give Saudi Arabia the seat at the international trade table it deserves as an economic player.\nTwo months ago import tariffs were lowered to 5 percent from 12 percent, and foreigners are now allowed to own property outside the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Saudi Arabia also hopes to expand its economy by creating a tourism industry and becoming a manufacturing hub for the region.\nMany Saudis, however, find the kingdom long on reform announcements and short on bricks-and-mortar achievements.\nSaudis and foreign investors alike bemoan the country's legendary sluggishness and protectionist habits. The trumpeted changes to lure foreign investors came with a long list of areas closed to non-Saudis. Called the Negative List, it includes oil exploration and production, wholesale and retail trade, printing, transport, fishing and some medical services. The finance minister calls it temporary. To the Saudi business community, the best opening for change is the possibility of joining the World Trade Organization, nudging the kingdom toward the kind of financial transparency it has long avoided. Saudi law, for example, is drawn solely from the Koran and the Hadith, the practices of the prophet Muhammad. Although there is wide latitude for interpretation, principles developed in the 7th century are sometimes in conflict with 21st-century needs. Take mortgages, for example. In the late 1970's, any Saudi could get an interest-free, $80,000 housing loan from the government in days. The amount remains the same, yet the waiting list now stretches 10 years.\nThe growing population craves housing, however, and home building could provide an economic lift. But Islam forbids interest, making mortgages difficult.\nIn addition, the religious establishment, which dominates the legal system, has a knack for propagating random edicts that can abruptly destroy any venture. For example, Pok\u00e9mon, the children's game, became the target of a ban this year because it was said to encourage un-Islamic behavior like gambling, and was somehow considered Zionist to boot. It was whisked off store shelves, and the manufacturer had no means of redress.\nRoyals and Citizens\nOn the Lookout For Fresh Leadership\nIn the 1930's, King Abdel Aziz kept the treasury of his newly unified kingdom in wooden boxes, calling for bags of coins to dispense as needed. Many Saudis feel that the al-Saud rulers still treat the treasury that way, except now an estimated 7,000 royal princes camp at the front of the line.\n''A lot of them have the mentality of 'I own this country and you are here to serve me,' '' said one Saudi economist.\nDuring the oil boom years, the tacit understanding was that the government would pay for everything and the people would not ask questions. Now, an increasingly educated population surveys a country hobbled by its isolation, yet unable to make the far-reaching changes needed because of a certain stagnation at the top. ''They don't understand the concept of giving people their rights; we are their subjects,'' said an American-trained Saudi lawyer.\nCrown Prince Abdullah, effectively running the kingdom for five years because King Fahd has been ill, has pushed to open the country by letting in foreign oil companies again and lowering barriers to foreign investment. But he can only take matters so far, since he is not yet king and is 77 years old. What's more, succession is complex. Just how Saudi Arabia will change depends on who will run the country.\nSuccession does not seem a major concern to most Saudis, but some worry about the kingdom's lineup of aging monarchs at the very moment it needs energetic, worldly leaders. King Abdel Aziz established the system of inheritance according to age and family consensus in the hope of avoiding fratricide. The one rule is that any king must be his direct descendant. King Fahd is the fourth son to hold the throne since King Abdel Aziz died in 1953. More than 20 other sons survive from among his 22 marriages.\nThere is no doubt that the proliferation of princes grates among the professional classes.\nA waiter glides up to a senior government official settling onto a couch in a hotel lobby to tell him that it is permanently reserved for a local prince. ''Another prince?'' the official snapped, before regaining his composure. ''Please don't quote me on that,'' he said to a reporter.\nBut to some the unhurried system of succession is delaying decisions by senior princes who worry that one mistake might hurt their standing. In addition, they sometimes appear to be creating personal fiefdoms with an interlocking network of personal loyalties.\nPrince Abdullah used to run the national guard, a job now held by one of his sons. The defense minister, Prince Sultan, made one son, Prince Khalid -- former commander of the Persian Gulf war forces -- his deputy. The same holds true for Prince Nayef, the interior minister, who at 65 is considered third or fourth in line.\nBut royals deny that anything is preordained. ''There is no acquired right in this issue and there will not be any,'' Prince Nayef said in a rare interview. ''I want to stress that they were chosen as normal citizens, not as members of the royal family and the sons of this one or that one.''\nWith Abdel Aziz's sons dying off, Prince Nayef said, the move to the next generation could come either through a family vote or by a future king picking a member of the next generation as crown prince.\nEducated Saudis would prefer a more formal system of government. One reason business leaders back World Trade Organization membership, for example, is that they hope it will force the country to eliminate whimsical rulings. (And royal whim is one reason no Saudis want to be quoted by name when discussing their rulers.) Having one-quarter of the world's oil reserves has always allowed them to make their own rules.\n''Money is spent on palaces, not think tanks; we have 300 palaces in Jidda alone,'' said a former member of the 120-seat Consultative Council, which the king appoints. It was designed to give greater public participation in decision making, but the king sways the agenda. ''We need to clarify who owns the country, the people or the king,'' he added.\nFor the moment, nobody knows what awaits when Saudis earning a living surely start wondering aloud about the way they are governed. Members of the younger generation are prone to want change.\nOne indication of that came at 11 p.m. on a steamy summer weekend, during rush hour along the wide pedestrian quay circling the marina of Durrat Al-Arrus, a Red Sea beach resort town north of Jidda.\nSaudi young men, some bristling out of their muscle shirts, sauntered past young women wearing stretch jeans. A few women dared let their hair float free; occasionally they even broke Saudi law by driving.\nThe scene would be tame elsewhere, but it is shockingly risqu\u00e9 for keep-it-under-a-robe Saudi Arabia. A young man with a ponytail said the resort felt like a foreign country. He and his friends said they wanted changes but did not want Saudi Arabia to ape the West. They shook their heads no when asked if they wanted someplace to dance in Durrat al-Arrus, for example. They abhor the idea of their sisters mingling with men who are strangers. But they do seek a greater sense of personal freedom.\n''Ten years ago we really used to suffer, but in another 20, a lot of things will change,'' said the young man with the ponytail. The others around him all nodded.\nThe Perils of Plenty\nArticles in this series are examining how sudden wealth from natural resources can bring unexpected problems for countries struggling to come out of poverty. The first article, last May, looked at whether Chad can escape the corruption often associated with oil riches. Later articles will look at other problems as political and economic systems elsewhere react to newfound wealth."}, {"text": "Headlines From the Cutting Room Floor\n2001-12-23T05:00:00.000Z\n THE world did not stop on Sept. 11; it only seemed that way. Many people, riveted by the extraordinary, paid little attention to anything else. \n Life went on, of course. Argentina is in trouble, the Yankees lost the World Series, the Democrats and Republicans are fighting about everything but terrorism, and V. S. Naipaul won the Nobel Prize. Muggles in droves went to the Harry Potter movie. \n What follows is a selection, arbitrary and incomplete, of some of the events of the past 100 days that were overlooked or that might have played out differently had the world's gaze not been fixed on terrorism. \n The Higher Cost of Drugs \n From George W. Bush to Edward M. Kennedy, there was widespread agreement in the 2000 campaign that the nation's elderly badly needed some assistance to cope with the soaring costs of prescription drugs. Nobody thought it would be easy to enact that benefit, but 2001 was considered the most auspicious year. \n That changed in September, when terrorism and a slowing economy transformed the agenda in Washington and created some grim new budgetary realities. Creating a substantial prescription drug benefit for a group that uses more drugs than any other is an expensive proposition. As the surplus slipped away, lawmakers quickly realized that prescription drug benefits \u2014 like so much else on the domestic agenda \u2014 were too. \n Health advocates had also hoped to provide new assistance for the nation's uninsured, who numbered just under 40 million last year. That effort also failed, even as experts warned that the recession would leave many more Americans without insurance. \n Now, many experts are warning of a health care crisis, a \"perfect storm,\" as one study put it, fueled by soaring increases in health care costs and a wave of layoffs. Governors, meanwhile, are warning that the basic safety net program for low-income people \u2014 Medicaid \u2014 is under immense pressure as well, and have pleaded for help from the federal government. \n ROBIN TONER \n Remember What's Her Name? \n Whatever happened to Lizzie Grubman? She was going to provide the best of tabloid headlines for months, as well as a convenient standard of youthful decadence against which Americans could feel virtuous. \n Just as Leona Helmsley served as a symbol for the greedy 1980's, Elizabeth S. Grubman, a 30- year-old publicist with a mind like Rolodex and a father who was Madonna's lawyer, became Public Enemy No. 1 when, at 12:40 a.m. on July 7 she backed her father's 2001 Mercedes-Benz S.U.V. into the wall of the Conscience Point Inn, a popular Southampton, N.Y., watering hole for the cellphone and champagne set. \n Sixteen people were hurt and Ms. Grubman was arrested several hours later and charged with six counts of first-degree assault, one count of reckless endangerment, one count of second- degree assault and one count of leaving the scene of an accident involving physical injury. She was freed on $25,000 bail. \n According to a sworn deposition of a security employee at the club, Ms. Grubman had balked when told she could not park in a fire lane in front of the club. Reportedly, she had also called another employee \"white trash.\" \n Today, the bad behavior of the rich seems less symbolic of anything and Ms. Grubman looks a lot like a young person driving under the influence of too much money, going too fast in the wrong direction. \n WILLIAM NORWICH \n For Immigrants, a Colder World \n On Sept. 6, President Vicente Fox of Mexico urged a rare joint meeting of Congress to grant legal status to millions of his countrymen, saying they brought cultural and economic benefits to the United States. President Bush expressed support for Mr. Fox's proposals. \n Five days later, all that seemed like a dream, and since then, American immigration policy has undergone a sea change. Gone are the lofty words from Mr. Bush about how hard-working immigrants seeking a better life should be given a chance. In their place is a darker, more mistrustful view of immigrants. Congress last week easily approved legislation requiring visas issued to foreigners after 2003 to be tamper-resistant and include biometric data. The bill also tightens the screening of foreign students and authorizes the hiring of 1,000 new border inspectors and 1,000 immigration investigators over the next five years. \n The immigration debate has been recast to focus on border security and homeland defense. The administration plans to establish military tribunals to try suspected terrorists who are noncitizens. More than 600 National Guard troops have been dispatched to help patrol the Canadian border, and immigration officials will work to track down the estimated 250,000 illegal immigrants who were ordered deported but remain in the country. \n Mr. Fox's countrymen aren't sure they want to stick it out. Immigration experts say tens of thousands of Mexicans living here without legal residency are returning home, unwilling to risk staying here in the current political climate, and unlikely to return anytime soon to jobs in the hotel, restaurant and agriculture industries that rely on their labor. \n ERIC SCHMITT \n And the Winner Is . . . \n For the first nine months of this year, the political world argued over who really won the Florida presidential election and eagerly awaited a comprehensive review of the uncounted ballots by eight news organizations. \n After the attacks, the debate shifted from from \"Who won?\" to \"Who cares?\" \n \"After 9/11,\" said Chris Lehane, who served as former Vice President Al Gore's spokesman during the 2000 campaign, \"questions about `dimpled chads' were overshadowed by questions about the `evil- doer.' \" \n The review itself produced a mixed result, with George W. Bush winning under some counting methods and Mr. Gore prevailing under others. But Democrats seized on clear signs in the examination of 175,000 uncounted ballots that thousands of Floridians intended to vote for Mr. Gore but were foiled by bad ballot design and faulty voting instructions. \n Under normal circumstances, the media project might well have provoked a vigorous debate about weaknesses in the American electoral system or even the legitimacy of President Bush's election. Instead, the story generated one day of headlines and was quickly lost in the stark terrain of Afghanistan. \n JOHN M. BRODER \n A Truce in the Culture War \n Moviemakers are patriotic Americans after all. Who knew? \n A year ago, when Hollywood executives went to Washington, they were chastised by senators for corrupting America's youth. When violence in schools or neighborhoods made news, Hollywood filmmakers were blamed for encouraging such behavior. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, made attacks on the industry a major theme of the campaign. \n Once in office, President Bush showed little interest in Hollywood-bashing, but then his administration showed little interest in Hollywood, period. \n That changed immediately after Sept. 11. Karl Rove and other administration officials met with Hollywood executives to brainstorm about morale-building and educational efforts, from U.S.O.-style shows for the troops to public-service films heralding the spirit of America. As Mark McKinnon, one of President Bush's top media advisers, put it when Hollywood executives visited the White House this month: \"We are much less interested in attacking you than in offering cooperation.\" \n RICK LYMAN \n The Penalty of Death \n In August, the highest appeals court in Texas unexpectedly stayed the execution of a death row inmate whose case had attracted international attention because he was 17 when he murdered the father of a federal judge. For death penalty opponents, the case was another victory in a year in which polls suggested that the public was growing increasingly concerned about the fairness of capital punishment. \n But any such public attention to the death penalty effectively ended with the attacks. The media coverage that had provided the forum for the death penalty debate immediately disappeared. \n Still, the death penalty debate seems likely to continue in 2002, if on a lower boil. Prior to the terrorist attacks, state legislatures across the country had passed a range of laws related to capital punishment. Seventeen states passed laws providing inmates with access to DNA testing, while five banned the execution of the mentally retarded. Over all, the number of executions dropped from 85 in 2000 to 66 in 2001, and five inmates were freed from death rows, bringing the total to 98 since 1973. \n Early next year, a blue-ribbon commission convened by Gov. George Ryan of Illinois is expected to make recommendations about whether the death penalty system in that state can be fixed, and, if so, how. (Mr. Ryan placed a moratorium on executions in his state after a series of high-profile exonerations of death row inmates.) And in February, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on the constitutionality of executing the mentally retarded. Of the 38 states that use the death penalty, 20 allow the execution of the mentally retarded. \n JIM YARDLEY \n Stealth Anti-Environmentalism \n George W. Bush was a man with a serious environmental problem throughout his campaign for the presidency. And shortly after he took office, environmental groups successfully managed to cast him as \"pro arsenic,\" for his administration's attempts to change water safety standards. \n Then came Sept. 11, after which the biggest environmental groups fell silent, fearful that attacking the president would make them appear unpatriotic. \n In response, the administration pressed ahead as quietly as possible \u2014 largely through the regulatory process \u2014 to allow road-building in national forests, reverse the phase-out of snowmobiles in national parks, make it easier for mining companies to dig for gold, copper and zinc on public lands, relax energy-efficiency standards for air conditioners, bar the reintroduction of grizzly bears in the Northwest and make it easier for developers to eliminate wetlands. Most recently, the administration approved the largest timber salvage operation in the nation's history in the Bitterroot National Forest, openly skirting the public appeals process, a move that has been halted by the courts. \n The administration also pushed for drilling for oil in a wildlife refuge in Alaska as an attempt to bolster national security. And the fog of war has obscured, too, the administration's policy on global warming. Last summer, after President Bush rejected the international Kyoto treaty on global warming, he pledged to start research programs to study climate shifts and find new technologies to cut emissions without harming the economy. But government scientists say that administration officials are now telling agencies not to expect additional money to pay for new efforts. \n Many of these actions would have received front-page coverage as part of the evolving \"pro-business\" tilt of the Bush White House. \n KATHARINE Q. SEELYE \n Tune In, Turn On, Pay Up \n While the world wasn't looking, the recording industry introduced two long-awaited online music services this month that allow consumers to download songs and listen to music streamed live via their computers \u2014 for a fee. \n RealOne is the first service to be based on MusicNet, a partnership of Real Networks and three major record labels, Bertelsmann, AOL Time Warner and the EMI Group. For $9.95 a month, users can download 75 songs, but they must keep paying to continue to listen to that music or new selections. \n Pressplay, backed by Sony Music Entertainment and the Universal Music Group, has similar capabilities but a different catalog of music, and some songs may be permanently copied to a computer or CD. \n Whether \"renting\" music will catch on, particularly among a generation conditioned to getting music for free, is unclear. Even if the two ventures attract customers, however, the five major music labels are now the subject of an antitrust investigation by the Justice Department into whether they are trying to illegally dominate the Internet market. \n AMY HARMON \n The Struggle to be Heard \n The countries of sub-Saharan Africa have always had to fight for America's attention. Lately, most have fallen off the map. \n Nowhere is that clearer than in Congo, which has been ravaged by a three-year civil war with five foreign armies taking part. Earlier this year, President Joseph Kabila, whose father and predecessor, Laurent D. Kabila, had been assassinated in January, promised to revive flagging peace accords and won praise from Washington. But recently there have been setbacks, little noticed in the United States. Peace talks to lay the groundwork for a transitional government collapsed in October. In November, the United Nations reported that countries like Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe were continuing to plunder Congo's riches, while relief agencies say soldiers engage in widespread looting and extortion. \n In Eritrea, the year began with a a cease- fire with Ethiopia and a determination to rebuild. But days after the Sept. 11 attacks, the authorities arrested several former cabinet ministers and about 11 journalists and closed several privately run newspapers in a crackdown on government critics that has received little notice abroad. \n In Burundi, a power-sharing government took office in November, bringing hope to a country where 200,000 people have been killed in a long-running civil war. The fighting continues, however, and rebels killed at least six civilians near the capital this month. \n Zimbabwe rounded up more than a dozen so-called terrorists in November, all of them members of the opposition party that is challenging President Robert Mugabe in an election set for March. \n And while the world looked away, AIDS continued its relentless creep across the continent. In November, the United Nations reported 3.4 million new cases of H.I.V. infection in sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS is now the leading cause of death. Dr. Peter Piot, who heads the U.N. AIDS program, said the attacks in New York and Washington dealt \"a major blow to the global AIDS agenda,\" making it harder to get desperately needed contributions to an international fund for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. \n RACHEL L. SWARNS \n This is a Job for Ken Starr \n Congress, the media and a special prosecutor spent years and millions of dollars trying to unearth information about President Bill Clinton's links to a small real estate investment called Whitewater. But the political ties of Enron , the energy giant that collapsed last month in the largest bankruptcy in history, has so far prompted only a smattering of scrutiny. \n Houston-based Enron and its longtime boss, Kenneth W. Lay, were top supporters of President Bush. The company and it employees gave Mr. Bush nearly $2 million between 1993, when Mr. Bush was the governor of Texas, and the presidential election. They were among the top supporters of members of Congress as well, especially Republicans. \n Enron helped shape the shift toward deregulated electricity markets. It also persuaded Congress to pass legislation exempting the energy products Enron trades from direct government regulation. And the Bush's administration's new energy plan endorsed a vision for electricity restructuring that Mr. Lay had outlined in a memo he gave Vice President Dick Cheney in a private meeting last spring. Two people Mr. Bush selected as federal energy regulators had Mr. Lay's backing. \n Did Enron's money buy access? Did the company escape oversight because of its political ties? A few House Democrats are asking, including Henry A. Waxman, the ranking minority member of the House Committee on Government Reform. But so far there has been no proof, nor any noticeable investigative zeal in the Democratic Senate, and with a war on no one seems interested in hiring a special prosecutor. \n JOSEPH KAHN \n From Hussy to Helpmeet \n Several days after the attacks, Judith Nathan was asked by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York to oversee the move of the victims and family assistance center to Pier 94 from the 69th Regiment Armory. It was a big responsibility for Ms. Nathan, a volunteer. But even more significant was the public reaction: there was none. \n Ms. Nathan is Mr. Giuliani's girlfriend. Last summer, the mayor's marital problems had become so public and so tawdry that some supporters worried about his future in politics. He had moved out of Gracie Mansion and was living with two gay friends. He was locked in messy divorce proceedings with his wife, Donna Hanover. And Ms. Nathan, cast by some in the news media as the home-wrecking other woman, went into virtual hiding. \n Then came Mr. Giuliani's metamorphosis into the city's heroic leader. His personal life remained a mess, but nobody seemed to care. There was no more public feuding about the divorce. No more scrutiny of Ms. Nathan. And no more hiding. \n Ms. Nathan showed up at Mr. Giuliani's news conference on Sept. 11 and never looked back. She has been with him everywhere, from funerals for firefighters to a recent visit to Israel. \n \"The world is different now,\" Ms. Nathan said in this month's Vogue. \"Everybody wants to help. There's a new awareness and willingness among people to do something to make a difference.\" \n DEAN E. MURPHY \n Raiding the Lockbox \n Remember the Social Security lockbox? \n It was not long ago that both parties in Washington swore on all that is holy not to touch the portion of the federal budget surplus generated by the retirement system. To do so would invite certain political death. \n Now, with the nation mired in a full-scale recession, the first in a decade, and President Bush having gotten his $1.35 trillion tax cut, the surplus has turned into an almost- certain deficit for the next few years. The lockbox has been broken open. \n The goal of paying off the national debt now seems unrealistic. Both parties will have to shelve their more ambitious and expensive proposals, like overhauling Social Security. In addition, Democrats will have to decide whether to stick to their Clinton- era position that fiscal responsibility brings benefits in the form of lower long-term interest rates, and Republicans will have to decide whether they are willing to accept chronic budget deficits as the price of higher defense spending and continued tax cuts. \n RICHARD W. STEVENSON \n Stem Cell Redux \n All summer, the debate over human embryonic stem cell research dominated the news. And on the morning of Sept. 11, the National Academy of Sciences had scheduled a news conference to release a report that, in effect, criticized the strict limits President Bush placed on federal financing for the research. Mr. Bush had restricted he financing to studies of existing colonies, or lines, of stem cells, estimated at about 60. The report said a bigger supply would be needed. \n The news conference, of course, was canceled, as was a Senate hearing scheduled for that week to debate the adequacy of Mr. Bush's plan. Suddenly, the stem cell controversy, which pitted questions about the morality of embryo experiments against the promise of treatments for diseases from Parkinson's to diabetes, seemed irrelevant. \n On Nov. 7, when the National Institutes of Health released a long-awaited registry showing that 72 cell lines fit President Bush's criteria, few even noticed. \n Now stem cells are coming back. Next year, lawmakers are expected to consider two bills related to stem cells, one that would expand Mr. Bush's plan and another that would ban any type of cloning, including cloning experiments aimed at obtaining stem cells. While Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, predicted \"a knock-down, drag-out fight,\" no one expects the debate to generate the same fervor. \n SHERYL GAY STOLBERG \n Going, Going, Yawn \n When Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants slammed his 71st home run of the season on Oct. 5, the breaking of the most prestigious record in sports was met with emotions just as mixed as those the spectacular but churlish Bonds has evoked his entire career. \n Partly, the attacks had caused the country to take its eye off the ball, as it were. Only when the New York Yankees made their run at the World Series did baseball begin to seem important again. \n The thrill was also dulled by the fact that Mark McGwire's record had stood just three years, compared with Roger Maris's 37. Moreover, Bonds, who is generally as warm and fuzzy as a frozen pool ball, was in an even worse mood than usual: he had just attended the funeral of a good friend, and his homer came during a loss that knocked the Giants out of the pennant race. \n Nonetheless, the 37-year-old Bonds wound up posting what might have been baseball's best season ever: beyond a final total of 73 home runs his .863 slugging percentage and 177 walks broke records held by Babe Ruth. \n Bonds seemed slightly underwhelmed by his record: \"I don't know if it is going to exist next year.\" \n ALAN SCHWARZ \n A World of Weary Travelers \n The bodies turn up everywhere. Perhaps 400 people killed when a ship capsized off Indonesia in October. More than 200 Haitians feared drowned by Hurricane Michelle in November. Eight dead in a sealed freight container in Ireland this month. About 200 corpses a year along Mexico's southern border, prey to accidents or bandits. \n And then there are the bodies just languishing in detention: 2,500 in the Australian desert, thousands in Vanatu who couldn't even reach Australia. Nearly as many in France near the Channel tunnel, which was closed when dozens broke in to walk to England. \n Tides of migration flow around the world and \"new and reliable data on the magnitude of trafficking and irregular migration is hard to come by,\" said the International Organization for Migration in Geneva. But it estimates that, if one counts everyone from vegetable-truck stowaways to students taking a year abroad, 3 percent of the world is on the move every year. As borders fall and as pockets of war and drought make people more desperate, the tides surge. \n Well before the Taliban fell, many of those in the pipeline were Afghans. Kurds from Iran, Iraq and Turkey, Romanians and Moldovans, Indians, Bangladeshis, Chinese, Mexicans and others swell their ranks. For the unscrupulous, they represent easy money. Whether it's $1,000 for a guided walk across the Texas-Mexico border or $20,000 to leave China hoping for Britain, smuggling people is a business worth $8 billion or more. \n DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. \n Privacy Gives Way to Security \n Last week the Center for Democracy and Technology unveiled an ambitious Web site to help people protect their privacy online. The site probably would have gotten much more attention if it had appeared, say, last June. That was when a polling firm, Public Opinion Strategies, found that 67 percent of those surveyed claimed that privacy was their most important issue, ahead of fighting crime (55 percent) and preventing nuclear attack by building a missile shield (22 percent). \n But the new site was largely ignored, privacy, like much else, having been shunted aside as the nation focused on war and homeland security. Still, some counterterrorism measures, including new laws that increase the power of government to tap electronic communications, could diminish privacy rights, advocates said. And businesses don't appear to have stopped collecting data on consumers. So the threat to privacy isn't going away, said Ari Schwartz, associate director of the Center for Democracy and Technology. \n JOHN SCHWARTZ \n Continental Drift \n Quietly, the European Union is moving toward an enlargement that will alter the nature of the continent. \n It's not just the euro \u2014 the new European currency that is about to go into circulation in 12 of the 15 member nations of the European Union. In the next couple of years, it is likely that 10 more countries will join in a sort of Big Bang, uniting the continent in a way not seen since the Nazi occupation. \n This time, however, the integration is both voluntary and peaceful, without even the threat of the Soviet Union to create a strategic bond. \n A Europe of 25 nations will be both more important in the world and less coherent. The area from Portugal to Poland, Sweden to Cyprus covers an enormous variety of ethnicity, history and wealth \u2014 and of governments, each striving for reelection, sometimes using big bureaucratic Brussels as a convenient target, much the way presidential candidates attack Washington. \n Just last week, a European Union summit ended in silliness and acrimony over where to put a new agency for food safety. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy objected to Finland, plumping for Parma instead, because of its famous ham. President Jacques Chirac of France suggested that on that basis, Sweden should get the agency for modeling, because of its pretty women \u2014 thereby offending almost everyone. \n But there is a new Europe a-borning, with attitudes and policies that are not American, a huge trading block, market and slowly thickening federation, to which real attention will have to be paid. \n STEVEN ERLANGER \n Trouble, Still, in the Balkans \n The Balkans \u2014 the last place the United States went to war \u2014 remain an area of simmering tension, despite slow-moving efforts to get beyond the hatreds and suspicions that helped to tear Yugoslavia apart. \n Macedonia, which spent the first half of the year a hair's breadth from civil war, has been moving fitfully toward peace. Its Parliament dragged its feet for months before approving the final pieces of a peace deal, which included an amnesty for fighters. In the meantime, there have been several Albanian attacks on police, and Macedonian police have not yet returned to all parts of the north. The main rebel leader also has not yet left his mountain command. \n Serbs have been keeping their eyes on The Hague, where former President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia is facing charges of genocide. Relations with the West have been improving, but the nation continues to struggle with its past. Hundreds of bodies, for example, have been uncovered in mass graves in Serbia proper. They are believed to be the corpses of Kosovar Albanians, killed in Kosovo during the war in 1998 and 1999 and then transported to Serbia. \n Kosovo, where Albanians say their aim remains independence from Serbia, has elected its first Parliament since the war, but it has failed to chose a president \u2014 this month defeating the bid of a longtime Albanian moderate leader, Ibrahim Rugova. \n Montenegro, too, has continued to demand independence from Serbia, and Western leaders worry that any redrawing of the borders could set off yet another round of ethnic and national struggle in the region. \n IAN FISHER \n The Former Root of All Evil \n The case didn't change, but the politics surrounding it did. \n In late September, a federal judge declared that \"recent tragic events\" made a \"quick resolution\" of the Microsoft antitrust case \"increasingly significant.\" The court-appointed mediator echoed those sentiments and on Nov. 2 the Justice Department and Microsoft announced a settlement to the long-running suit. \n With its new Windows XP operating system combined with ambitious plans for the Internet, Microsoft appeared to be repeating many of the same tactics that became central accusations in the antitrust case. Its actions brought complaints not only from industry rivals, but also privacy and consumer advocates as well as some government officials. But the essential policy issue about Microsoft \u2014 whether a dominant company has the power to be a \"gatekeeper\" to innovation in some distant future \u2014 just seemed a lot less pressing after Sept. 11. \n STEVE LOHR \n Faith Fails in Congress \n Congressional supporters of President Bush's initiative to channel unprecedented government support to \"faith-based\" social services acknowledged that the legislation would not pass the Senate this year. The bill passed in the House hit heavy opposition in the Senate over whether it would allow religious groups to discriminate in their hiring practices. But some Senators are working on salvaging the incentives for charitable giving and block grants to social service programs. \n LAURIE GOODSTEIN "}, {"text": "'Almost'\n2001-09-09T05:00:00.000Z\n Ihave this boyfriend who comes to visit me -- it's mostly a sex thing. Unless I visit him, in which case it's mostly a babysitting thing. I'm not sure which turns me on more. You don't think of British Jews, if you happen to know any -- and I didn't until Daniel Jacobs -- as world-class lovers, but he must be an exception, or it could be the antidepressants he takes, which not only keep the blues at bay, but orgasms too. In Daniel's case, for, oh, forty-five minutes, give or take a few. My friend Henderson calls him the Bionic Man. \n That's how I'd have begun this story if I'd sat down to write it two months ago, instead of now. I'd have put it firmly in the present tense, the intense present, a time that felt electric to me and that I know I don't want to part with yet. Two months ago, the story would have been all about the sweet madness and the math. And why not? When the numbers are in this range, you feel some obligation to history to keep a record. Remember that old Irving Wallace novel The Seven Minutes, about what goes through this woman's mind in the seven minutes of intercourse? Not one reviewer griped, Seven? That's it? Not one of them said, Irving, you sure this isn't autobiography? \n Without my telling him, the doorman knows not to buzz me if packages, even groceries, arrive after he's seen dashing Daniel come upstairs. Phone messages on my machine pile up as thickly as pink While You Were Out slips impaled on an upright skewer. I always turn off the ringer on the phone and mute the voices on the machine, incoming and outgoing, so that we're not distracted. Or bombarded. My almost-ex sometimes calls, in tears, to say he wants me back, and my editor, practically in tears, to remind me that my novel based on the life of Lili Boulanger is budgeted for this year and I am eleven months late. And my other editor, a guy I call the Eighth Deadly Sin, who tries to tempt me to ghost another celebrity autobiography. He is a twenty-seven-year-old manic depressive with his own imprint who hired me to write the life story of a daytime TV personality, which I finished in three months and is about to be published without my name on it, thank God. \n As book-writing goes, other people's autobiographies are child's play. You're handed the central character, the dramatic highs and lows, the bittersweet, inspirational ending, a deadline that leaves no room for writer's block, and money, real money. Enough to leave my husband, Will O'Rourke, and dog Henry, move back to New York, and live for a while in this studio-with-alcove furnished sublet in Greenwich Village with two walk-in closets, galley kitchen, central air, and a look of Pier One exoticism on the cheap. An abundance of wicker, batik, cotton throw rugs, and bayberry-scented candles that I often light when Daniel leaves. \n The other people I don't want disturbing us are my mother, whose memory is on the fritz, and who sometimes calls to ask how old I was when my father left, and my best gay friend, Henderson, whose messages I love, except when they're broadcast into the boudoir, as this one was on an overcast afternoon: \"Sophy, I trust you're not picking up the phone because you and Daniel are having one of those marathon sessions. Hi, lovebirds. Would you believe I lost the name of that guy who does interventions again? My birth father was absolutely blotto last night at Cosi\u0300 fan tutte, and my wicked stepmother and I have decided it's time to send in the Eighty-second Airborne. I hope this is a quickie, because I really need to talk to you before the sun goes down.\" \n Since I moved back to the city in March, my life often feels surreal and overloaded, like an electrical extension cord with too many attachments, on the verge of blowing a fuse. Henderson claims I'm suffering from what Jack Kerouac called \"the great mad joy you feel on returning to New York City,\" though I think it's the generic great mad joy of jettisoning a tired old life for a shiny new one. Some days I'm Gene Kelly doing his waterlogged soft-shoe and singin' in the rain, happy again. On more difficult days, I'm Dorothy, wide- eyed at the phantasm of Oz but terrified I'll never find my way home, or never have another home to find my way to. Being able to focus completely on Daniel for several hours at a stretch keeps me from going off the deep end. Or maybe -- maybe Daniel is the deep end, and we are a couple of ordinary junkies who don't even know we have a problem. You forget, being married, that sex can take up so many hours of the day. \n A quickie in Daniel's book is half an hour, and never mind foreplay, never mind the nerves on the back of my neck, the world of whispering and slowness. Daniel's cut-to-the-chase is an acquired taste, I know, but now that I've got it, I'm not sure I want to go back to the evolved, sensitive-guy approach. When I told my best woman friend, Annabelle, that on my birthday Daniel and I were at it for forty-three minutes -- according to the digital clock on my microwave, which I can see in certain positions from the bed across the room -- Annabelle said, \"That's a very good birthday present, Sophy.\" Afterward he gave me another present, a framed gelatin print of a photo of my beautiful, sad-eyed Lili Boulanger he had an art dealer colleague in Paris track down, wrapped in wrinkled Pocahontas gift paper. Then we staggered to his house at the end of Waverly Street, stopping at Balducci's and Carvel to pick up dinner for his four Vietnamese orphans, Tran, Van, Vicki, and Cam, two boys and two girls. \n Of course they're not really orphans, because Daniel is their legal father, but so far they have lost two mothers apiece, the Vietnamese women who bore them and Daniel's wife, Blair, who is, as it says on all those old tombstones, Not Dead Only Sleeping, in a nursing home on the North Fork of Long Island, with a spot-on view of a meadow, a salt marsh, and the daily sunrise, none of which she is ever likely to lay eyes on again. \n Daniel explained all of this to me over coffee, days after I had moved back to the city and we met at the gay-lesbian-all-welcome AA meeting in the gay-lesbian-all-welcome neighborhood where we live. But by all welcome, they don't only mean boring straight people like Daniel and me; they mean cross-dressers, transsexuals, and a surprising number of people who haven't made up their minds. He and I ended up there separately and by accident, thinking it was nondenominational, but we stayed because, story for story, it's the best theater in New York, a darkly inspirational, Frank Capra-in-drag movie that could be called It's a Wonderful Life One Day at a Time. It's also a place where a man telling his life story can say, \"During that period, which went on for five years, I was so busy drinking -- I mean, honey, I was taking Ecstasy as a mood stabilizer -- that I forgot to meet men and have sex, which brings us to Fire Island,\" and seventy-five people will howl with sympathetic laughter. \n Daniel and I innocently sat next to each other, and he invited me out after for coffee at Dean & DeLuca on Eleventh Street. I was still thinking about the speaker at the meeting whose name was Robert S., and who wore a platinum pageboy wig and a chartreuse DKNY miniskirt and said to us, \"Girls\" -- though I was the only one in the room -- \"I am waiting for God to work her magic,\" and I suppose I was waiting myself. That's what made me ask Daniel, at the start of our first date -- as I began to take inventory of all the ways he appeared different from my gray-haired, salty-looking husband -- where he stood on God. \n \"Off to the side,\" he answered, \"quite a way. But here I am, knee-deep in drunks who talk about the Almighty as if he lives next door. It's a lot for an Englishman to sign up for. We have a long tradition of drinking ourselves to death quietly and all alone. Then again, this wasn't my idea.\" Daniel had the look of a youthful Tom Wolfe, long-limbed, clean-shaven, wearing a suit I didn't know then was an Armani; and there was not a strand of gray in his fine brown hair. He might have been my age, mid-forties, or a few years younger. \n \"Whose idea was it?\" \n \"My physician advised me three years ago that I'd die in short order if I didn't quit. And what about you? Where do you stand on God?\" \n I said that for the first ten years I went to meetings, I had a difficult time overcoming my godless Unitarian upbringing, but in the last six months, I found myself leaning in another direction, dispensing with some of my skepticism. I wasn't a practicing Unitarian any longer, I told him; I considered myself lapsed. Trying that out for the first time, the \"lapsed.\" Daniel laughed out loud. But I wanted to play it for laughs; I was flirting like crazy. I hadn't slept with anyone but my husband for the ten years of our marriage, plus the two years before, and I wasn't leaving anything to chance. \n \"And what's at the core of a lapsed Unitarian's belief system?\" he asked. \n \"Nothing to speak of, so there's room for reconsideration, but not much motivation for it. What about you?\" \n \"I'm Jewish,\" he said, \"but in the English style, sort of half a Jew, as if it were only one of your parents, and you're not certain whether to take it or leave it.\" \n \"What's the other half, in your case?\" \n \"Pure capitalist. I come from a long line of merchants. Fur and microchips. My great-grandfather was furrier to the czar. My father was the last furrier in London to move away from the East End when the Bangladeshis moved in. He went to Golders Green in 1962 and sold dead animals until the PETA people threw a can of fuchsia paint on my mother's full-length sable, which coincided roughly with the discovery of the microchip. He and my older brothers are computer consultants to the Queen. They have the lucrative gift of being able to endure long hours of bowing and scraping. I'm the youngest of four sons and, some say, the family rebel. Instead of software, I peddle paintings.\" \n In AA, of course, you are not supposed to tell anyone your last name, but Daniel blithely told me his. I knew it from going to galleries during all the years I lived in New York and reading art reviews in the Times during all the years I didn't. \n A cappuccino or two later, we were swapping infertility stories like girlfriends, by way of explaining how he ended up with four imports and I ended up with no offspring at all, except this gryphon-like dog Henry, whom I had left with my husband until I got settled. I didn't tell Daniel that night that Henry had been Will's present to me when I quit trying to get pregnant. \"I still carry around a picture of him, ugly as he is.\" \n \"Your husband?\" Daniel said, visibly startled. \n \"The dog.\" \n And I didn't tell Daniel about the immense sadness that had made me stop trying to have a baby. It was our first date, after all, and I wanted him to think my past was safely behind me, buried like nuclear waste, in airtight containers, even though I'd walked out on it only a handful of days earlier. Instead, I entertained Daniel with stories of my test-tube encounters with Green-Blue, the code name for the nuclear physicist at the California genius sperm bank I had wanted to be the father of my child, after it became clear that Will's sperm motility wasn't what it had been when he'd fathered my two grown, soon-to-be-ex stepdaughters. \n \"Green-Blue is six-one, IQ of one fifty-six, and the father, as of two years ago, of thirty-one children of lesbian mothers and straight single women scattered across the fault lines of Southern California. They Fed Exed me the stuff in tanks of liquid nitrogen. But I ovulate funny. It was like waiting for three cherries to come up on a slot machine. And my husband was convinced that the only sperm donor in the joint was the skaggy-looking guy who ran the business and called me at seven in the morning -- mind you, that's four A.M. in California -- to say, \u2018Sophy, I have to know, is your temperature going up or down?'\" \n Daniel told me that he and Blair had done the temperature business, test tubes, and Pergonal injections. She had even made an appointment with a faith healer named Falling Rain Drop, who insisted they participate in a fertility dance in Washington Square Park every day at dawn for a week. Daniel refused. \n The years of trying piled up, and Blair, pushing forty-three, grew impatient and fearful. In one fell swoop, they adopted three siblings, two boys and a girl, ages approximately six, four, and two, who had been living in an orphanage in Hoa Binh for six months, and a fourth child, Vicki, whose sad face in a photograph Blair could not resist. They nearly emptied out the orphanage and filled every room in the narrow, turn-of-the-century brownstone Blair had inherited from her stockbroker father. \n Adopting all those children, you could say she was Mia Farrow minus Woody, and now, poor lamb, poor Blair, she is Sunny von Bulow minus the millions. Not that they are destitute; Daniel's two art galleries are doing record business, despite his long afternoon absences. He was a willing partner in the international quest for children, and he is a devoted father, though he is often sleep- deprived and frequently flummoxed, as when his five-year-old said to him, \"If you don't buy me a Beanie Baby, I'll say the F word all the time, starting right now.\" \n He wants me to think and seems to believe himself -- and it may be the truth -- that his essential nature is now subsumed by the condition of being overwhelmed. \"I used to have a personality,\" he will say, \"and a life I rather liked. Now I run an orphanage on a street where I am the only heterosexual man for ten blocks in every blinking direction.\" \n On the other hand, I'm not sure what that personality was, the one he claims to have had. He can predict whether a client will prefer a Miro\u0301 etching to an obscure Delvaux oil painting, and he is consulted by museums and foreign governments to detect forgeries, but in matters of his heart, nuance is a rare commodity. When I asked him how his marriage had changed over the years, all he said was, \"Once the children arrived, we quit having sex on Saturday afternoons.\" \n My friends are divided over the nature and severity of Daniel's affliction. Those who have spent time in England insist that his passport is his destiny, and his answer to my question about his marriage passes in that population for soul-searching. Other friends ascribe his limitations to gender. \"He sounds just like a man,\" Annabelle said, \"but worse.\" It may be most accurate on any continent to say that he is what Winston Churchill said about Russia: a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. \n But there is something else you should know about Daniel: I think he is still in love with Blair. She has this embalmed, waxy, forever-thirty-nine, Dick Clark quality. Perfect, silent, stricken, enveloped in the aura of her New York Stock Exchange pedigree and a life of excruciatingly good deeds. She founded and ran a literacy-and- reading center for inner city families and was always getting plaques and certificates from the mayor, the governor, Channel 7, the Amsterdam News, El Diario, and the Helen Keller Foundation. Daniel sells modern masters, wears Armani underwear, and a wristwatch as thin as a quarter, but his living room walls are now crammed with three-dollar pressed-wood plaques and ersatz diplomas from local TV news anchors who think Blair should have shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela. \n Poor thing was hit by a UPS truck the year before while bicycling on Hilton Head Island, where she was attending her only sister's wedding. Can Daniel marry again without divorcing his brain- dead wife? The subject has not come up between us. We are efficient communicators in the sack and above-average conversationalists on terra firma, but on the question of our future -- I mean anything beyond tomorrow -- we are neophyte speakers of English, permanently stalled in the present tense. \n Blair is a tough act to follow, though I give it all I've got. In addition to baking Christmas cookies with Daniel's children in June, I frequently do a full-dress imitation of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, which they have seen on video twenty-five or thirty times. I braid my hair and wear a polka-dot pinafore and a pair of glittery red shoes I found in a thrift store; and I rigged up a little stuffed dog, attached to a real leather leash, which I drag up the stairs of their brownstone and then sling over my shoulder, squealing, \"Toto! Toto! I don't think we're in Kansas anymore!\" \n One night I made the mistake of imitating their father for them. I put on one of his silk suits over my own clothes and carted four metal lunchboxes and a handful of naked Barbie dolls into the bedroom where they waited for me, perched on the edge of Vicki's bed - - Vicki, the oldest, Vicki, who keeps a shelf of books about children who have no parents. This child who first heard English spoken three years ago has read The Secret Garden, Anne of Green Gables, Peter Pan, Pippi Longstocking, and, in a category of loss entirely its own, The Diary of Anne Frank. \n That night I studied each of their faces and said in the lowest growl I could summon and my best English accent, \"What's all this blinking mess in here?\" I pretended to trip and sent the lunchboxes and Barbies flying. They landed hard and clattered across the bare wood floor. From downstairs, Daniel hollered, \"What's all that blinking noise up there?\" and we collapsed with laughter, and I was still laughing when Tran said to me, \"Now do Mommy.\" \n \"But I don't know Mommy.\" \n \"You don't know Dorothy, either,\" Vicki said. I knew only that I was bound to fail in this, but four pair of beautiful, almond- shaped black eyes were on me, and I could not deprive them of another mother, even of the flimsy imposter they knew to expect. \n I slipped out of Daniel's clothes and tried to organize a game of Chinese checkers with them, tried to be a funny, light- hearted, old-fashioned, TV kind of Mom, before TV moms were cops and cardiologists, but my heart wasn't in it, or maybe I mean that I didn't want them to see how much it was in it, so I held back, and the whole thing fell flat. \"Who wants peanut butter?\" I said lamely. \"Who wants to take a Tarzan bubble bath? Who wants an enormous plate of asparagus for dessert?\" But none of them laughed, and I was relieved when Van said, \"Do Dorothy again.\" \n At breakfast they have said to me, \"Do our dad, please.\" \n \"The school bus is outside.\" \n \"Then do Toto.\" \n \"Honey, let Sophy finish her cereal.\" \n \"One little time, and we'll never ask you again.\" \n \"I will,\" said Cam, the youngest, always out of synch with the consensus. \n \"Don't get dressed up,\" Tran said. \"Just talk funny and throw the Barbies.\" \n Early on, when Daniel and I were in bed and it was dark and our skin was as slippery as the inside of an oyster, he whispered, \"Do me.\" \n \"What?\" \n \"Do me.\" \n \"Baby, I am doing you.\" \n \"Imitate me. The way you did today at lunch.\" \n \"Now?\" \n \"Now.\" \n \"You pervert.\" \n \"Don't stop moving.\" \n \"You narcissist.\" \n \"I'm guilty.\" \n \"You're out of your blinking mind.\" \n \"Do me.\" \n \"\u2018I have a little, uh, Chagall etching in the vault, uh, you might find enchanting. Once in the collection of His Majesty the Shah of Iran. Or was it the Duke of, uh, Windsor? Two-point-five.'\" \n \"His etchings never sold for that much.\" \n \"\u2018For you, then, two-point-three.'\" \n \"I never bargain. Or mix up monarchs.\" \n \"You are out of your mind, Daniel.\" \n \"I know.\" \n \"I know you know.\" \n The truth was we both were. Fourteen days before, in a howling March nor'easter, on an island called Swansea, off the coast of Massachusetts -- a place as desolate as the Hebrides that time of year -- I had left my husband and a hideous hybrid hound dog with pointy ears. He was not only my consolation prize for not having a baby, but a sign from God, I'm sure, that had I succeeded, the poor creature would have been Rosemary's Baby. I had driven away from a ten-year marriage with what I could fit in a rented Toyota and a promise I did not think I would keep: to reconsider my decision when I got to New York. \n So much has happened since then. For one thing, the dog is gone. For another, I've just begun to write the story of my own life, at a desk in the house on Swansea that I walked out of in March, and I'm on a firm deadline. The story starts on a high note: a woman leaves her husband in search of happiness and ends up on a big-city roller-coaster ride that feels for moments at a time like sheer bliss, an urban fairy tale come true. Then, out of nowhere, her new life takes a plunge, then another, and a few dips, and before long she feels like Job. But there isn't much of a story to tell unless a few things go wrong, is there? \n I'm not going to trouble you with the story of my entire life since before my birth, like David Copperfield. I think it's best to stick to what's happened lately, starting two months ago, the morning of June twenty-second, when I was still in New York, still caught up, for the next few hours, in the great, mad joy of just being there, the morning of the day the police called. \n Excerpted from Almost by Elizabeth Benedict.

"}, {"text": "Selections From the U.S. Attacked Forum\n2001-09-19T05:00:00.000Z\n On Tuesday, September 11, the NYTimes.com's Readers' Opinions area opened a forum for readers from around the world to share their thoughts on the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Here is a selection of comments, excerpted from the forum's first three days. They range from outpourings of sympathy and grief to eyewitness accounts, to analyses of what to do next. \n They - we - weren't soldiers. We're just tourists and service and office workers... now many are gone in a war that they never thought about. Unspeakable... pray for those we knew and those we didn't know... those tourists and service and office workers that are us. \n mikejacobs \n I \u0301m writing these words from Spain, and I think that today, all the Europeans and all the citizens of the world (or the civilized people), are Americans. I \u0301m sure that we feel this awful terrorist attack, as an agression to our common way of life, and I \u0301m sure that together, we will win. I hope that the guilty/ies pay a terrorific price for this action. God bless America. \n franciscomunoz2 \n In all tragedies, even the greatest ones, we must seek comfort in the goodness that inevitably arises. When I heard that there were people waiting in line for 4 or 5 hours to give blood, saw footage of people helping each other remain safe, heard about the police officers and firefighters who gave up their lives trying to protect people, and even when reading messages on these forums, where people who are normally at each others throats put aside their differences to say \"I'm glad you are okay\", it was things like that that made me realize that people still have plenty of goodness in theri hearts. At times like this, we need to stand together, putting aside all political, religious, and ethnic differences and help each other get through this very difficult time. \n I have received good news that my friends and family members are okay. I have heard other people say they received similar good news. I hope many more people get that same good news. \n Normally, I can't stand Giuliani, and I have criticized him many times over the past 8 years. But yesterday, he came across as the most rational person I saw on TV or heard on the radio all day. He knows that we are strong enough to get through this, and we will. He encourages people to remember that we need to focus on the individuals who were responsible for this mess, not the people who may share their ethnicity. \n On that note, Wshort, you are correct. I fear there will be some backlash against totally innocent people. I work next door to a 7-11, and many of the people who work there are Palestinians. They are friendly, decent, hard-working people who I fear may be targetted by some yahoo who thinks he will be making a point. I hope things like that don't happen, anywhere! \n A few minutes ago, I went outside for the first time this morning. I could smell a faint hint of smoke in the air, but otherwise, it was a beautiful, sunny day with glorious blue skies. It just doesn't seem right. \n It's time for me to head off to work. I want to wish all of you a very safe day, and remember...we are going to get through this. \n urbanshock1 \n Being a citizen of the United Kingdom, I would like to express mine and my family's sincerest condolences to all the victims and their families of this atrocity. My thoughts go out to you and your proud country. \n simon0071 \n If anything even remotely good comes out of this appalling tragedy, it has to be that America learns she must relinquish her role as the bullying policewoman of the planet. It is superpower, superdominant behavior that leads to tragedies like these. \n gemister2000 \n I am from Poland. It is hard to believe... It is terrible tragedy that has hit USA and indeed the rest of the world. It is attack for our freedom. World never been the same... I and my friends from Poland would like to extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to the victims, employees, families and friends. \n yoosti \n I thought I was taking a Path train to the WTC but I got off in a war zone... \n heyerjm \n We have to understand...when you trade freedom for safety, you get neither....Americans need to decide whether they want to wait 2 hours for a flight, be searched every time they are on a plane...have no carry on baggage.....and pay for sky marshalls..are we will to pay more for airline travel? Do we want to wait, be searched all the time? We have to decide, but dont let anyone do it for us...especially the punks who did this stunt.... \n bszemere \n I want to give my condolences to the American people over this tragedy that caused so many innocent lives. With horror and inmense sorrow I have watched the towering inferno in that wonderful building I was last year enjoying that wonderful city of New York and the view over the city and the Statue of Liberty. I hope that the people responsible for this will be found and brought to justice and I sincerely hope that my government, I am Dutch, will give the US government every help they possibly can, even if this has to be military. My country owes the US to stand by her side after the US stood by the side of Europe in our darkest period, World War II and the economic crisis afterwards. Again my condolences to a nation in mourning, to people who have lost spouses, children, mothers and fathers, to people who have lost colleagues and my prayers are with those few people who were lucky enough to escape but are now fighting for their lives in the hospitals of New York. \n amgeel \n I'm from Russia. We were shocked when two years ago several houses were exploded and many people died.. And now it repeats and it's much more horrible than it was! I can't understand what makes people doing this to others, and I cannot express my feelings.. What horror, oh my God!! \n Dear Americans! Hold on! Try to live further. We all are with you and we sympathize you. \n irina_mew \n Hi, this is Silvie from Germany. Me and my family would like to assure you (and the American people) that we are very shocked about what happened not only to NY and Washington but also to the whole civilized world. People here are very sad about this, take flowers to the American embassy, go to church, say prayers for the victims and their families and so on. We mourn with you! We hope very much that the democratic countries will manage one day to stop terrorism. And if we want to do so we can only do it TOGETHER!!! \n So let \u0301s try to elect the people who can help us do this best! \n We pray for you, \n Silvie and family (9 persons), Nettetal (North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany) \n silvie2 \n I propose we each endeavor to: \n \u00a7 Recognize the fact that all Americans are our fellow citizens and are part of the national family. \n \u00a7 Uphold the ideals of justice, confidence, and grace as much as it is within our power as individuals. \n \u00a7 Resolve, in our commitment to battle terrorism, not to be prejudicially fearful or hostile to the other citizens of the world, but to regard them as siblings in the family of man, and as such, to treat them with the justice and dignity deserved of every person upon the earth. \n Finally, let us show that though we are proud to be American, we remain citizens of the world, grateful for our role as the leading republic in the struggle for democratic principles. Let us show the world that we remain steadfast in our commitment to uphold the democratic principles of our founding. \n I am certain that there is nothing this nation cannot do when all of its people are united. \n hudson1486 \n As a last year`s exchange student from Germany staying in Toledo/Ohio, I would like to express my condolescences about the terrible actions against America and the democratic system of the free world that took place yesterday. I surely can tell you that not only me but the whole German and all of the other European nations stand behind you. \n I really had such a great time when I stayed in America and got to know so many nice and friendly people. It is such a tragedy to see how many of these open-hearted American people have died now. \n I cannot remember having ever seen something as cruel and sad. I still cannot believe what I saw, I never had expected reality being so extreme and cruel. \n Yesterday evening I went to the American embassy in Frankfurt and there were lots of hundreds of people laying down flowers and mourning. It was so sad. I hope noone of you has personal losses to claim. \n Today, there will be a \"march of mourning\" through the city of Frankfurt where hundreds of thousands of people will be expected. \n I am sure your nation will recover from these acts but it will take a long time and the world will never be like what it was before. \n Andreas Schuster \n aschuster77 \n FROM ARGENTINA,my heart is with you,I pray for you my soul bleeds for you and your great people. MY DAUGHTER was just made an AMERICAN CITIZEN and she is expecting her baby October 18.So there will be one more proud little American citizen soon. \n martinbeck3 \n We just want to tell the people of New York, particularly those who have lost loved ones or have suffered through yesterday's traumatic experiences, that our thoughts and sympathies are with you from Bristol, England. This is an unbelievably horrible thing. \n vivamus \n I'm not a New Yorker, but I almost feel like one. In the few days I spent in New York, I felt like home. Now, that the unbelivable happened, I'm still stuned. I hope Y'all have the power and strength to become once again the city I love. (I still can't imagine the skyline without the Twins...) I offer my fullest condolances to all of you. Andras, from Budapest, Hungary \n akaakiraly \n Hello New Yorkers , I'm a student from India, heard about the massive attacks on WTC and Pentagon.We, the Indians are always with you. We are just a call away.God will punish the attackers. We are from such a place where love and peace are our best friends.But in spite of this we are having inhuman activities from the terrorists in the north-west border line.So we can feel your grief. I am feeling guilty in my inability to do anything to the victims in Ny and Pentagon.You are not alone in your sympathies.We , the rest of the world , were, are ,will be with you. Good bye America. God Bless you. Have a nice day.Love you. \n Diptendu ( On behalf of the Indian students who love USA). God bless you. \n binayak17 \n Yes, we will exact the heaviest of prices. Yes, thousands upon thousands will die. To be sure, the full might of our country will effect the twin goals of retribution and deterence. Suffice it to say, the geopolitical landscape will not look the same. \n I can only hope that, as a country, we respond to this horror, this tragedy, will cool intellect and not rascist rage. I greatly fear an anti-arab backlash much like the anti Japanese backlash which occurred after Pearl. Now we know just how wrong it was to lump every japanese together; I hope we can learn from that lesson. There are millions upon millions of Arabs and Arab-Americans who condemn this act, and all acts like it. \n We are Americans, not bigots. We will fight. But it must be the good fight, and in so doing, we must never forget what made, and makes us, strong. \n mhamaway \n It was a harrowing day from many families yesterday. I was turned back as I tried to commute into work yesterday. As I got home, my neighbor's wife came out crying. Her husband worked on 49th flr of 2WTC and she had just watched it collapse. \n He finally was able to call around 2:30 PM and the sigh of relief was palpable. \n Our condolences to all the families still waiting...Good Luck! \n mayank17 \n The west windows of my workplace in downtown Brooklyn look directly at downtown Manhattan. From a sense of accomplishment at having cast our early-morning votes in a free, democratic election we went to horror and shock as we literally watched this terror unfold before our eyes. Almost equally distressing this morning was seeing footage of young children's being encouraged to laugh and rejoice at such a horrible act, the bitter fruit of hatred and ignorance. We must not only offer love to the innocent and brave victims, but do everything we can to stop the corruption of young minds the world over--in this country no less than elsewhere, no matter what the ostensible \"cause\". Peace, please. \n sazsa \n It's chilling to hear our Secretary of State and other top government officials echoing a reprise of the very same thing this government itself condemned only twenty years earlier: invading Afghanistan. Must we become monsters ourselves in order to combat wickedness and evil around the rest of the world? \n sthomas1957 \n A CALL FOR HELP In the wake of yesterday's terrible tragedy there is a group of often forgotten victims: the PETS and ANIMALS of those who can never return home to care for them. Many dogs, cats, birds, horses, etc. may be stranded without food, water or other care in apartments, homes, or barns of the single people who lost their lives yesterday. If you have a friend, neighbor, or family member who was among those taken suddenly and senselessly yesterday, please honor their memory and most certainly their wishes by seeing that the animals dependent upon their care continue to have their needs met. Many animals shelters are already filled beyond capacity. Please consider adopting a now homeless animal and allowing the spirit and love of those lost to live on through the animals they loved and cherished. \n bluzstar77 \n We need to recognize that people like Osama bin Laden can not operate without the cooperation and assistance of the international financial community. This was a well coordinated and financed attack. 3-5 hijackers per plane, some had New Jersey driver's licenses. Someone internationally is making money off of financing bin Laden's estimated fortune of $ 300-400 million. It is time to go after the financiers of terror, especially the Swiss. They have been making money for years off of the misery of others, all the while pretending that they are just financial managers. If you cut out the money, the terrorists could not do this kind of stuff. And it is time for the international community to quit pretending that money is anonymous. It is time to go after the Swiss and shut down the banking practices that make attacks like this possible. \n keithalanj \n Words are inadequate to express the horror I feel at these cowardly attacks. My sincere sympathy to the bereaved and to the injured. So many times have I experienced such cowardly terrorist attacks here in N.Ireland over 30 years. If I may appeal to the American people,and others, not to support Terrorism/IRA, politically or financially,and think that every $ is a bullet into a human being, your brother or sister. May God be with you all, in this time of need. \n strangford \n First and most importantly, sincere condolences to all who have lost loved ones in yesterday's unprecedented tragedy. Yet, in light of the turn of events, a most unfortunate misconception is befalling many of my friends and myself. The many men and some women who wear turbans in the New York Metro area and beyond, are SIKHS. We are not Moslems. As I live in an area with a large Orthodox Jewish population, a feeling of hatred and contempt is not difficult to discern as I walk down the street. Sikhs are not Moslems. Sikhs are not Hindus. Sikhs are Sikhs and twice daily we pray for the welfare of all peoples. We too, are not strangers to religious and political persecution. Please do not judge people by their outer appearance. Please do not judge any people - leave that to God. \n hkkaur \n As an Australian who has visited and loves NYC, all I can do is offer my heart-felt condolences to all involved in this horrific tragedy. I do know, however that you will survive, because you are New Yorkers! \n egrantsk \n Memo to the people of NY: People in Houston are lining up for hours to donate blood in the event you need it. It's the first thing we can do to help, and I have a feeling y'all will need it. Mayor Lee Brown first asked for Houstonians to go out and do it. When I left at 1:00, Tommy Thompson was asking all Americans to donate. I got to one of the many donations centers at about 1:30; it was wall to wall people, and about ten outside filling out forms. When I left at 5:00, bandage on my left elbow, there were 50 people outside with two news trucks. The Blood Center said they would stay open until the donors stopped coming in. Food was being donated left and right for the donors and employees. I'd imagine it was a long night last night for them. \n Help is coming. . .I hope you can hold on. All our thoughts and prayers are with you through this difficult time. \n And to the rest of you: we are not Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans, Polish-Americans, African-Americans, whatever. We're Americans, and we've ALL been attacked. Thank you. \n amyred3 \n I was in school, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, when the news hit---just ten to twenty minutes after the first plane crashed, I believe. The first time I heard, I thought it was just some kid's idea of a joke, until our teacher started telling us that school was still open and we were all to remain in class. And then, kids began excusing themselves to go talk to their parents, my friends came up to me and started panicking, and in my next class, the teacher didn't even try to give a lesson---instead, he pulled out a hand-cranked radio and we started listening to the news, interrupted by loudspeaker announcements calling people up to the auditorium to speak to their parents. It felt like I was in those stories of World War II, like hiding in a bomb shelter not knowing what was going to happen next. \n Afterwards, we heard that public transportation was shut down, we weren't allowed out of the building to get lunch, all the bridges were closed, and many of us who lived in the outer boroughs had no way of getting home. People who lived in upper Manhattan opened their homes to those who could not get home. Many had to leave school early. We were told to sign out at the lobby of the school, so that they could keep track of us and where we went. At last the subways opened, and my parents came to a friend's house where I was staying and brought me home. Others however had to walk over the bridge and wait for cars to pick them up or stayed overnight in Manhattan. \n It was one of the most bewildering and most bizarre experiences I ever had. One of my friends attended another school, one that was near the World Trade Center, and we had heard rumours about the school being on fire. We wanted to know whether she was all right, but we simply couldn't remember the number of her new cell phone. The noise, the confusion, the vague anxiety about something though we weren't sure what... \n There were other stories: a girl had ran back to her apartment on the thirty-fourth floor and took pictures of the New York skyline, with huge gaping hole where the Twin Towers used to be, an older student was crying in the hallway because a person she knew worked on one of the very top floors of the World Trade Center, the smoke that could be seen down Madison Avenue even up to Ninety-Fourth street... \n Of course, we all immediately speculated on who it was. There is a large Jewish population at our school and the PLO was mentioned more than once. Some people were shouting angrily that the Palestinians were cheering in the streets. Even if you didn't suspect the PLO, everyone certainly agreed that it was the work of Arab terrorists. Osama bin Laden was another name, and apparently our personal suspicions were shared by the government itself. We are considered \"gifted\" students, so we immediately began a wild host of know-it-all speculations about the U.S. response, the impact on American politics, the reason why we were attacked now. But the questions of \"Who did this?\" paled in comparison to questions of \"Is my mother okay?\" or \"Are we going to be alive tomorrow?\" \n For one day, the usual energetic and mundane bustle of the schoolday disappeared, to be replaced by a sense of crisis. But even that soon gave way to concerns about getting home, about finishing our homework for tomorrow. I never understood the meaning of resilience until I saw people in hysterics for one moment suddenly calm down and start eating their lunch the next. \n I have no dramatic observations or detached expressions of condolence or even political commentary to make. I didn't even see the pictures of the towers collapsing until the end of the day, despite the fact that I was in Manhattan when it happened. Living in the same city, it still feels like something that just happened somewhere else. But yesterday, for me, is still unforgettable, because it's the day that a war began and I was affected. \n glasperlenspiel1 \n What can be said about the events of yesterday...words can never describe it. People here in Ireland are as stunned and silenced as those in the US. People all over Europe still react as if it all has taken place in a surreal movie. Hard to believe it has happened yet it says so in every newspaper on on TV. The fact that the main tragedy took place in New York touches not only the lives of those who were born in America but also those who live there. New York was never an American city in the same way as Boston or Dallas. No where on earth is there a more multi-cultural and multi-ethnic melting pot. By attacking New York, the US will not share its grief alone. The pain will be spread through Ireland, the UK, Spain, Eygpt, Somalia, China, the list could easily take in every nation of the world. Every nation is affected. Every people affected. What has changed by the act of barbarisim no one will truly know. All I know is that two weeks ago both myself and my friends stood beside those streets and today stare at the TV wondering if this is all for real. \n But I would caution to watch for the lies ( see some previous messages ), the half truths, the recriminations. No nation could plan this, no people who have suffered could allow such an act to happen. Only the insane who hide behind some mask of convienence could plan such an act as only the insane could carry it out. \n My deepest condolances New York. \n flahertyg \n I was sitting on a NYC subway train at Chambers Street when the conductor announced a delay due to \"police activity\" at the Cortland Street Station (World Trade). It sounded like a fairly common event - a sick passenger, or a minor arrest; something that might cause a few minute delay. I now know that it was the first of the planes had hit. \n The train continued on to the Wall Street stop and I got out at William and Wall St., a few blocks east of the Trade Center. Upon exiting the station at about 9:04/9:05 the air was filled with papers, almost like a ticker-tape parade, except that it was accompanied by a thick plume of black smoke and the cloud of papers were business sized sheets . When a piece of something fairly heavy fell right next to me I realized that seeking cover would be a good idea, and even though I knew it already it was something horrible, this shocked me out of the \"wow it looks like a movie\" mode into a state of subdued shock. \n After staring up for as long as my stomach could bear it, with what may have been a million others I got caught up in a migration of people north, away from the buildings. There was a sense of something very different - a great migration of people in shock. The crowd was orderly and helpful (made me proud to be a New Yorker - we moved here 5 years ago and I have often felt I was an outsider, almost proud to be from \"up north\". Now I am from New York. \n On the way out on the far east side of Manhattan Island several buildings and businesses opened their doors to the \"migrants\". I needed a toilet and was escorted into the Tenement Museum on the Lower East side where they offered water, sandwiches and use of their facilities. \n I walked uptown, 7 or 8 miles with my back to the scene most of the time not really wanting to look and quite honestly already in the beginning of a grief process first for the people in and around the buildings, for my City and certainly for the Country and the world. \n It's hard to imagine who could consider that the world will be a better place for this. I'll confess a certain complacency (and denial) as to how my Country has conducted its foreign affairs. We may have made enemies that I did not consider my enemy. That was then. I sense the sleeping giant is awake as many of us, myself included, know we have an enemy. I know I am angry. I doubt that any of the creatures who are responsible for this care and fear may be a human trait that they have left behind. I am confident of one thing. They have changed my world and I am determined that I (and many other Americans) will do whatever we can to change theirs. \n richardsf \n New Yorkers, you should all be very proud of your brave firefighters, police officers and other rescue team members, as well as the doctors, nurses and hospital staffers who have done and continue to do such a wonderful job helping the injured in your great city. \n And Mayor Giuliani, whatever else you might think of him, conducted himself with strength, calm and compassion. \n Really, you should all be very proud of yourselves for the way NY reacted to this despicable attack. New York is still the greatest city in the world. \n For my part, here in Cincinnati, I'll be giving blood today. I hope it helps. \n originalray \n I came in from a jog and turned on the tv to see tower 1 burning. I ran to the roof of my building in the west village. As I arrived I saw the second plane hit. People on the roof panicked and ran about. We all watched as bodies fell from the buildings. My cell phone rang- it was my mother in tears checking on me and also to tell me my brother was on a flight that morning from La Guardia and my neice had just started a new job at the WTC. I panicked. It was not until an hour and a half that my neice called and that she was fine. My brother was on a Chicago bound flight and promptly rented a car and drove back to New York. Now I am at my office and we are calling patients who we know worked at the WTC. There are too many answering services picking up. \n franch2 \n It is amazing to read through these messages and see more than half of them as being sensible. I appluade the rational of thought here and laugh until I cry at the pasties that keep jumping like gibbons about war declarations. \n I will no longer run with three of my friends, but they would have loved to see some of this posts. \n enough74 \n We should not play blaming games on tragedies of such scale. We should go after the perpetrators with iron fists. However, we should think deeply after we get them. What's the underlying reasons for this attack? Why would people take their own lives to do this? What can we do to prevent people from even attempting such acts? \n The CIA and the FBI spend enough money each year already. Our defense budget is more than the rest of the world combined. Obviously enhancement in those agencies is not going to solve the problem. If we double the CIA's capacity, we may get more terrorist attempts foiled. But some still will succeed. We have to make the idea to terrorism disappear. \n Most of the attack attempts against us are from the Arab world. The obvious question is the effectiveness of our Middle East policy. \n orientalexpress \n I'm from Saudi and I feel sorry for this tragedy. Unfortunaly I listend to Sen. Orrin Hatch saying every Plaestinian rejoice the tragedy should be punished!! I feel sorry for what hapenned, but everybody should understand the feelings of those doing this. Innocent civlians, including kids & women in the occupied areas in Palestine are being killed everyday by American F16s, American Apaches, American guns and misslies!!!!! Everyday. Everyday, with full American blessing. So, don't blame those people if they go crazy, they think there isn't a fair just world around them. America is a wonderful country, they just need to act more honestly and deal more responsbiley in the middle east. God bless the killed lives anywhere in the world. I belief Israel should be hold responsible for what happenned in NY. God bless America. \n romamanus \n We are neighbors and like all neighbors we have had our disagreements in the past but in times of distress we offer you our full support and assistance. \n We are so sorry for what has happened. How can we help? How can we be there for you? Our blood donor clinics have been swamped with people giving blood and our rescue units are on stand by. Can we provide clothing or donate money for the rescue effort? Please let us know what we can do. \n We send our love and sympathy to the families and friends who have lost loved ones. \n The world changed forever on September 11, 2001. The world will never foreget. \n From your friends in Canada. \n T.M. Wilson Edmonton, Alberta \n 56word \n Let me just say that this attack is innumerable times worst than the attack carried out by Japan on Pearl Harbor seen how the Japanese targeted military bases and not defenseless civilians. \n On days like these I am glad a large chunk of my taxes go to a defense budget, and I really hope some of it goes into so called \"black-budgets ops\" as conspiracy theorists will have us believe. \n Let us NOT let the perpetrators of this crime think that they have in ANY WAY made us isolationists or afraid. If anything, it has made us more resolute to defend our way of life. And the changes in our congress that will be seen in the upcoming weeks should only be to RETALIATE until crows and maggots eat the scorched flesh of the last coward affiliated to these maniacs. \n As I went to work out of the city and became aware of what was happening my first concern was of my wife who is attending school close to the twin towers. \n Fortunately we were all running late today in getting ready for the day so I knew it was unlikely she, or her train were close to the area at the time it happened. But as I saw the catastrophe it only made me more resolute to contribute in any way to the expunging of these ignorant, zealous idiots. \n It is amazing how this city has pulled together. Everyone helping each other out. \n Let whoever did this know THIS: there are still another 200-something million Americans who live and work for the BEST economy in the world! A nation that through wise use of its intellectual and material resources has become the envy of the world! 1/2 or more of those Americans pay a high percentage of their earnings in taxes, which mostly go into defense. A defense, which we all hope will act to let all those who contributed to this directly or indirectly know how erroneous a step it was. They may have hurt a few tens of thousands personally. They may have set the nation on a real recession, because the logistical and budgetary nightmare coming up to rebuilt the nation will be THAT, a nightmare. But all of it, to the last scratch, will only serve to make us more resolved to scorch those responsible off the face of the Earth. \n And we will recuperate, and we will look back at a different skyline of NYC. Nevertheless, it will be prosperous all the same, and what is best, we will know that those responsible for today's actions will not be around to see it thanks to us being determined in defending our way of life. \n The only thing they have done is really waken up the bigotry, ignorance and hatred of some Americans who will now make living in this nation difficult for those who are seen as ethnically-related to those who committed this crime. And the toll and shock of what's happened is so great that very few conscientious Americans will stop it. And for those I am sorry. \n ogodei \n You don't see Americans dancing in the street when innocent people are killed in Palestine. We don't hand out candy. We don't cheer when bombs go off, tanks plow under their buildings, or children are killed in a crossfire. \n Honestly, the U.S. is the only thing holding the Israelis back from completely annilating the Palistinians. \n But it's nice to know who our real friends are, and it will be counted. \n entheogen \n I am a New Yorker living in Germany and I was watching TV and was horrified at the site of the Twin Towers just crumbling down like that. I can't stop crying and mourning for those people. I have family that was right in the middle of it and one said that he saw the people jumping out of the windows. I just can't believe what happend. Ny will never be the same NEVER. Nor will the US. A new chapter in history was just written, and sadly enough it was of tradgedy. My prayers are with the family members of those in the Aircraft and in the towers, and slo in the pentegon. Words cannot express what we are all feeling. God Bless everyone! September 11th will never be forgotten by me it is my birthdate. I celebrate life as others mourn the lives of others. \n latinacipriaso \n My husband worked on the 36th floor of 2 World Trace. If he had not called me immediately after he got out of the office after the first crash, I would have experienced a horrible waiting period!!! I thank God for His protecting hands upon my husband. By the way, I was outraged about the phote on today's (9/12/01) New York Times page A7, the photo of a man falling headdown from the tower. I find it very distastful and insensitive to the families of the victims!!! What if the family of this man recognized him on the photo? I just pray none of his family recognize him. My prayer goes to this man's family, and the families of other vicitims. May God comfor their heart. \n buccigm \n As a muslim, I condemn this terrorist attack, and I'm really surprised that some say that it is Arabs and Muslims who are behind these acts, because in the Quran \"Our Holy Book\", it is forbidden to kill innocent people, and those who are killed yesterday were all innocent, and all Arabs and Muslims are agianst these acts, cause it will serve nobody. Some would say that Arab hatred against the U.S. has reached its maximum these days, but this hatred is actually against the U.S. policies in the Middle East and not against innocent people in the U.S. or anywhere in the world. No one would beleive that a true muslim is happy when hearing about the attacks, because in our religion it is FORBIDDEN to kill innocent people. And if few persons went to streets to celebrate when hearing about the attacks they thought again and again and discovered that all the victims are innocent people who have nothing to do with politics, they are normal people going to their work as any other day. But we have to remember in this day, the children and innocent people who are killed everyday in this world in Palestine, Iraq, and now in the United States of America. May God bless all those who are killed in the U.S., Palestine, and Iraq. And may God help us building a better future all around the world. I offer my condolences and my deepest sorrow to all those who are killed in New York and their families and may God help them. And all the best of luck for those who are injured. \n mlattouf \n I have lived in New York for only a year - but have come to love it like most New Yorkers do. This morning, as I walked down a deserted 5th Avenue, and looked up at the dust cloud where there used to be those monoliths, all I could think of was \"What have they done to my city?\" It felt exactly as if someone I loved had been mugged and beaten up, and I guess many of us in this city feel the same way. \n I am Indian, and this is not the first time something like this is happening to me. We have suffered for years at the hands of Islamic fundamentalists, sponsored by Pakistan and the Taliban. People in India have come to accept terror as a way of life, 20 bombs simultaneously going off in Bombay and killing thousands was just another incident. Heavy security has been accepted as a part of life. A hundred deaths does not raise eyebrows any more. Maybe just a little prayer, hoping that we are not victims of the next such incident. A peace-loving people who have never truly known peace. \n Let this not happen here. The constant struggle for peace is a tiring thing, and even though New Yorkers and Americans will never again take peace for granted, let them at least not have the spectre of terror constantly hanging over their heads. Retaliate with all you can, wipe these madmen out of existence. And one billion people in India will be cheering you, and uttering prayers of thanks. \n legolas1 \n Isn't it intersesting that footage of a few palestinians (most of them children) celebrating was shown to millions and all of a sudden the conclusion is reached that 'the palestinians' rejoice in the death of americans? Is it any wonder that 'they' hate americans because of the same ignorant stereotyping that most of the people on here seem to be exibiting. My heart and prayers go out to the families of those killed and hurt and missing, and I feel a profound anger and feeling of helplessness, but it makes me want to see the people RESPONSIBLE for this unspeakable act punished appropriately, it does not make me write off a people in hate. \n colches \n I am from India and our whole nation condems this dastardly acts of crime commited by people who claim that it's a 'Jehad'. \n People in the States now must be feeling the same pangs of anger that we Indians feel when ever terrorists strike and kill our people in the name of obtaining freedom for a non-existent country. \n I appeal to all the people of the States, that not only strict action be taken against those who actually carried out the crime but against also those countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq etc. who harbour such sadist criminals in the name of religion. \n Once again my condolances to all those who have lost their near and dear ones. We stand by you in this hour of grief. \n bappa \n Now the media has picked up on the term \"At War\". If this editorial incompetence continues we will find ourselves securely in the arms of neo-facism. We are not at war. It was a terrorist attack using our own civilian systems of transportation. We are not and never have been invaded, nor have we faced militarily led attack. Let's stay focused here. I refuese to belive that this requires military intervention. \n stephennnn \n Dang it all to heck, but while Mr Bush may personally be a Christian ... America is not a \"Christian nation\"!!! \n Please stop claiming that it is such. \n kwicklund \n I visited NYC in 67, when the WTC was under construction. The city was a little too much for me and when I left, I had no intention of returning. But after watching yesterday's tragedy unfold on national TV, I have reconsidered my point of view. The people of NYC have got to be the greatest people in the world! Their cooperation and help in searching for survivors, their strength, and their pride were inspirational to the rest of the world! We on the west coast stand with you. We hurt with you. God bless you, the citizens of New York. I now look forward to the day in which I will return to your Great City!!! Bob Weber, Fresno, California \n rwebman \n Interesting that Phil Gramm wants to renounce the ban on the assasination of world leaders. Does he have someone in particular in mind? What mindless chatter. I was glad to hear Colin Powell dismiss such crazy notions. At the moment, Powell seems to be the only reasonable federal official speaking on the crisis. Maybe we should ask for a gag order on Congress. \n gintaras_2k \n I have read some of the postings and I see we'er off and running. I would first like to express my condolences to those who lost love ones in this tragedy. There is no excuse for what was done. Unfortunately all we're getting from our appointed president is platitudes and bs. The race card, as in Arabs, has been played by the right wing. It's been picked up by the media and they're running with it. This democratic society(as we have seen by the last election) may find it difficult to deal with this one. Justice(hopefully not like what was handed out by the five stooges of the Supreme Court in the last election) should be swift. \n Given what we know we can't move too quickly. We know that the airline industry is concerned with our safety. Some of their entry level pilots, at least for American Airlines, make as little as $13,000 a year and qualify for welfare. We can safely say we have welfare receipients piloting our planes. That is known as multinational corporate caring for safety program perhaps developed by the IMF or WTO. \n Now let's say that the Arab terrorist are responsible. Of course these are different than those in the Okalahoma bombing. You do remember those Arab terrorists? Now let's say it's that Osuma guy. Now let's say he was trained by the CIA. Now we know they wouldn't have trained him in flying state of the art airliners just to terrorize the Russians for invading Afghanistan. Now let's say that we're not technically responsible for the terror he commited because we only trained him and sent him on his way. Where do we start on that one? \n Hold it! Don't go away! Now let's say that we allowed our tax dollars to be used to recruit and train terrorists in Chile and Salvador, just to get our monies worth out of the School of the America's, not to mention Gaza and the Far East. Along with this let's say we generated between 10 to 100,000 orphans some who may have organized to express their appreciation for the forign aid we sent to them and their love ones. WHO COULD THESE EVIL PEOPLE BE who did this to us and where will we start to make them pay? \n paread \n It is my fervant hope that we will deal with this tragedy not only with retaliation(because violence begets more violence), but with things positive and constructive, so that the dead and injured would not be in vain. So that the perpetuators, and those that think to follow after them will understand that they cannot win. So that the perpetuators, and those who seek to follow after them, will finally understand that humanity and justice can, and will, be above religion, nation and ideology. So that the perpetuators, and those who seek to follow after them, will finally understand that the world will never tolerate this kind of action---and will do whatever it takes to end it. So that all of this will serve as a source of inspiration, action and understanding, that this world, and the peace that we all seek, will not perish. \n osec23 \n \u201cI am afraid that as a Christian Nation, with a Christian President we are about to be put to the test.\u201d \n I am filled with sorrow but not hatred. \n I think we have to retaliate, with reflection on our foreign policy flaws or not. It is a matter of credibility for the future. But we must retaliate responsibly with proof and with restraint against killing the innocent to get even. \n Practically speaking, I think we can vastly reduce the chance of similar occurrence: a civilian plane being used as a missile. Pilots are to be locked into the cockpit during all flights; no exceptions. And we can reinforce the door and walls to the cockpit. \n We MUST gradually but surely reflect on our foreign policy misdirection, however. \n These terrorists were fanatical and rabid, but they were NOT cowardly. In fact, they were quite brave, quite courageous for what they believe in. Is this not quite obvious? \n This bigoted cry of \u201cwe as a Christian nation\u201d and \u201cChristian President\u201d is the vivid symbol of our blind-spot. \n While I would condom the public use of nondescript words like \u201cprayers\u201d, I fervently object to Bush\u2019s citation of scriptures from the Bible during last nights speech intended for ALL Americans. This grotesque insensitivity to non-Christians or the non-religious in this country is quite symptomatic of and causative to our foreign policy bias toward Israel, a Judio-Christian state. \n The religious display in Congress is just as insensitive, just as bigoted, and just as symptomatic of and causative to our problem and blind-spot\u2014and now grief. \n Can we keep religion OUT of the public and (hence) remove religious biases toward those who are religiously more similar and against those who are more dissimilar with the private religious conviction of most Americans? \n jeffchurch1 \n A Young Girls Words \n It makes me sad that I'm now in fear of walk in to a public building or any place like that. I can't get out of my mind that my city has lots of places that could effect the USA if they were lost. So who's to say they won't come here. The night of the crashes I couldn't sleep, just thinking about the people that died and the ones that are dieing. The thought of it brings me to tears. I never thought that anything like this could ever happen, but it did and it was only a few hours from my home. What is this world coming to? I could never understand why groups of people hate each other so much and are willing to kill each other. So what we have different skin color, have different beliefs, different ways of life, and we live and different parts of the world. None of that should matter, the only thing that should is that we are ALL people. We all feel, care, love, hurt, bleed, live, die. We all have families and people that we love. Is it really worth losing those people over differences? Why can't we look past what makes us individuals and look at what makes us the human race. If we don't learn to live together, are going to end up killing are selves off. The way it's looking now this world won't have much longer of a life. Right after the attacks happened the people of the United States stared pointing fingers and saying \"lets get even, lets make them suffer.\" Do we really what to go down to the leave of the people who did this? Why don't go above them and bring justice NOT war. The people that are behind this horrendous attack need to pay for what they did but they need to pay in a civil way. If we start a war, more innocent people will die. Do really need any more killing, loss, hurting, and sorrow? I know that my words won't be heard by many, but if I touch at least one person, I will then know I don't stand alone. Just by knowing that I will feel a little safer in this unsafe world. Rest in peace \n Erika Dennis 9/12/01 age 16 \n ejc11901 \n I'm amazed (but not suprised) by the overwhelming and constant pro retaliation messages being advocated throughout the media by supposedly professional journalists. Why aren't we spending most of our time committing to acts and behaviors of compassion, pulling in the victims and their families? One visitor to this board even expressed utter surprise at an apparent 20% dissension from that view. \n I only wonder how many of the other 80% consider themselves christians and how a retaliatory view makes you different from those who executed this egregious and inhumane act? \n rplummer \n jeffchurch1: the president's words were meant to comfort and to stregnthen the resolve of the nation. I don't believe he intended to be insesitive to non-christians. \n mayank17 \n A message for the President.... ___________________________________ Dear Mr. President, \n We, the billion odd Indians, do share the grief of all those who have been tragically affected by this barbaric act of terrorism. It will take some real long time before we will be able to get back to our normal lives; but in the meantime, you have to take note of one simple fact that this was certainly an avoidable tragedy. Allow me to explain.... \n From an isolated & prima facie perspective, a barbaric act of terrorism like this is seen as a localized tragedy in context of humanitarian & monetary losses. But, an honest introspection will reveal an altogether different story. These attacks are always against the whole humanity, and not against a particular societal group. Period. \n The primary motivation behind these fanatical acts is one-fold : enjoying a sense of psychopathic control over local governments, and thereby, terrifying the people whom these governments are supposed to protect. Therefore, terrorism can be effectively dealt with only if global initiatives are taken to crush these fanatics, in a continuous and synergistic manner. In capacity of globally accepted superpower, USA is the country best suited for undertaking such initiatives because of its military, economic and political resources. In some isolated cases where American people or properties were affected, retaliatory actions were undertaken. But, these reactions always looked like more of a personal vendetta, rather than a well resolved act of the most advanced democratic country on earth. \n In nutshell, Mr. President, the root cause of these never ending barbaric acts is that global leaders like you have never looked beyond the shores of your own countries. That is why Osama Bin Laden is on your target list, but Pakistan is not. Time and again, so many US senators have explicitly condemned Pakistan's terrorist acts against India, but US leadership didn't declared it a 'terrorist state' as Pakistan was not a direct threat against US. That is why British government goes all out against IRA, but known conspirators of Mumbai bomb blasts (1993) are not being extradited. This story goes on and on... \n Mr. President, we (the human race) will have to do away with an attitude prevailing amongst almost all of us : If somebody just stumbles across my newly manicured lawn, I'll raise the hell; but, if someone else's house is even bulldozed, I'll secure my vested interests even before raising a voice. I hope that USA will be able to hunt down and punish the culprits responsible for this massacre, as you've promised. But, more than that, I hope to see some long term & meaningful measures being taken by countries like US or UK to put an end to the global terrorism, even if doesn't concerns immediate interest your own countries. \n It will only then be possible to anticipate, avoid and neutralize these terrorist attacks before they become a reality in any part of the world. That is the reason why I started this letter by saying that \"this was certainly an avoidable tragedy....\". Whatever has already happened can't be undone, but maybe we can protect our future. \n May the sole of all those who died rest in peace, and a healthy recovery is blessed upon the injured ones. \n Warm regards, Rakesh Misra Chairman, MD & CEO MisraSoft Pvt. Ltd. INDIA \n msoft025 \n \"Why aren't we spending most of our time committing to acts and behaviors of compassion, pulling in the victims and their families?\" \n You act as if having and expressing compassion for the victims and expressing hatred for the perpetrators are mutually exclusive. Just because someone is standing in a four-hour-long line to donate blood, or donating money or needed items to aid the rescue effort or even being on the scene, helping to find survivors of these attacks doesn't mean that their hearts aren't full of desire to attack and retaliate. A lot of what you're seeing now is posturing and blowing off steam. Let it happen. \n kgmaximus \n \"I don't believe he intended to be insesitive to non-christians.\" \n But his speech was insensitive to non-Christians or the non-religious. \n Do you believe it is appropriate for the President of the USA to cite scriptures from the Bible in a speech intended for ALL American, and especially in a trying time like last night? \n I am 100% certain that it was NOT. \n Why can't one comfort without being religious? What is so compulsive about religious comments? \n This is the fundamental source of our bias in American life and policy in the ME. \n jeffchurch1 \n I watched yesterday's events unfold from my office window in terror. My wife works - or used to work - in the trade center. Thankfully her office was low and most got out. My heart sank with the trade center along with any hope that things would ever be the same again. \n Lets not kid ourselves - did another group target the same building? No. they finished what they started in 1993. \n I heard one woman say \"there must be a better way to get your [i.e. the terrorists'] message accross.\" \n Unfortunately the medium is the message. Death to America is the chant often heard; people celebrated in the streets of Palistine. \n These terrorists have no apparent political goal other than to damage America. If Isreal were turned over to Islam (lets not kid ourselves about the fight being limited to \"rogue\" states) today would the attacks end? Theirs is an attack on the American way of life and Western thinking generally. \n No amount of concession will stop the violence. They are apparently willing to die for their cause so why not cut to the chase and start killing them before they kill off the greatest mode of social change known to our planet - a free democratic populace. \n Who are \"they\"? Lets start with those who are known terrorists, their supporters and affiliates, their income sources and trade partners and suppliers. And most of all those who celebrated yesterday's attack. \n If we are not prepared to condemn Isreali actions such as the recent assinations then we should either join in the eradication of our enemies or resign ourselves to life as their target. I'd just as soon get off the fence and get on with it - let the best God win. \n quisseparabit \n I'm for retaliation if it is just. I am not for levelling whole cities. If we lose what we are to respond in kind, then we never had the decency we claim to have. \n I think our President and the Senate and House will behave as they should no matter how difficult that is. Now is the time to show the world what justice really means. It is not blindly flailing at any target to mete out vengeance, but the prosecution of the guilty. \n The world is watching very intently for leadership right now. We can be neither bloodlusty nor fearful of taking necessary action. \n michael543 \n I am as concerned as the whole world. The fact is that as part of a beautiful Brazilian youth I feel devastated just to imagine a war could start in minutes. I am young, and want to live a wonderful life and want to keep in touch with all the people I have met all around the world during my traveling. They are my friends. They live in America, Europe and Oceania. Young people from all the world, whom I suppose must be chocked as I am right now. I am sure all of us have this need of freedom and peace. I don \u0301t want to loose friends, I don \u0301t want to see a war starting!!! The macabriest thing is that yesterday we didn \u0301t know if we had been watching a start of dark times, I couldn \u0301t assure my friends living in NY were alive and the worst feeling, I couldn \u0301t be sure that a day after I would ever talk to friends all around the world. The most frustrating and terrible feelings came up on my young mind. There is no need for another catastrophe! My generation has been growing up with ideals of democracy, freedom and respect for all human races and ethnic groups, so it came as impossible to believe there are still people in this world that aren \u0301t able to accept individuals differences and cultural, economical and political diverse status. The attack wasn \u0301t held only against American citizens, Americans symbols or to democracy in itself, it was millions times worst: it was a straight attack against people \u0301s liberty, and that \u0301s why the world youth fears. We have the great mission to change the world, and combat with poorness and hunger. But we still must have the chance to do it! \n brtata \n -Hi, I know its very sad moment right now. But here is what, I think, we can do to put a halt to this menace of plane-hijacking. \n Simply, seal of the space occupied by the pilots ,and, rest of the passengers and crew members. This will stop anyone from entering pilot's cockpit and hence hijacking of the plane. Let the pilot's do the job of flying and, in case, they are warned that some terrorists have taken passengers hostage, just land the plane to nearest airport and let the authorities take care of these guys, in other words, storm the plane. \n kalia2 \n Strange times are upon us - an american living in Geneva. It seems so surreal to learn of the news from here in Geneva. New York isn't exactly next door to my home state anyway but I have a cousin and friends there and, well, my shock goes beyond words. We are in some strange times. I feel very removed from everything - the public reaction, the collective ire of the United States. I simply cannot understand the anger that people must feel to celebrate such a gross demonstration of violence. Everyone here has been disgusted by the celebrations shown on television of the street demonstrations in Palestine. \n I dread the possibility of a series of escalating reactions and counter-reactions that ends in war, or worse a never ending quip pro quo. My unlce dispensed some wisdom to my brother and I once that I have never forgotten; \"Never get in a fight with someone less to lose than you do\", and we all have so much to lose. There is so much at stake and in the end I fear it would only deepen the divide between nations, isolating everyone, and breeding racism and distrust. And yet part of me holds the notion that these explosions of tension and expressions of violence are indicative of something so deep rooted, only a major, defined conflagration will bring everything to the surface so that real healing can begin. Although, that has the peculiar taste of vengence mascarading as logic, like vinegar and sugar. \n Only 3 days ago, I sat on my balcony speaking with my friends about the bomb in the rural south that burned down a predominately black church, killing three little girls. That act of violence, as we had discussed it, galvanized support for the civil rights movement in the United States. People that were 'on the fence' so to speak, developed opinions and sought to distinguish themselves from the gross and cowardly acts of hate-mongers. I can only hope for a similar galvanization of support against terrorism, both by individuals (Bin Laden, McVeigh) and state sponsored terrorism (Israel, Palestine, Afghanistan, and the United States). Although generating that type of reaction seems too much to ask right now, too positive, too \"happy ending just around the corner\". I do not seek to cheapen the loss of life by saying that we will all gain something positive. I only hope that decency and respect will somehow prevail. Hatred in any form will breed more hatred. Terror will not gain anything but recicprocal cycles of hatred, as will a swift and extremist reaction by the United States. \n My tangible world of daily preoccupations which felt so real up until now feels so trivial. I almost feel guilty about continuing on with my life as if it has not been affected. Compared with many people, I have not been affected - I lost no family, etc. But mentally I feel a grave loss and a dread for what this is to mean for the future. I think the world is walking on eggshells waiting for the next shoe to drop. The reactions from my friends here in Geneva (Swiss, Brazilian, Chinese, Egyptian, German, etc.)have been of sympathy, support, and dismay at the nature and scope of such an act. I think the world is holding its breath until it is sure the moment will pass. In general, I am a spriritual but not a religious person, but I pray to my God for the good of us all. \n imforrest \n Yesterday was the worst day of many people's lives, a day never to be forgotten. It was also the day my new son, Emilio Santiago Muul, turned 14 weeks old. The shocking headline's will remain in his baby book until he is old enough to understand gratitude and compassion. I thanked God he was too young to have any idea what was happening around him. I thanked God he was still able to laugh when daddy kissed him on his tummy before he took his bath. I thanked God for him, my family and my loved ones. I thanked God for my freedom. \n After watching President Bush's conference last night, we turned the TV off and went to the beach. The sun was slowly setting and a soft light was reflecting off the waters of Puget Sound. There were no TV's, no radios, no news. We took our sons socks off and rolled his pant legs up and put his feet in the sand for the first time in his life. He curled his toes and opened his eyes wide and smiled at the new sensation. We took him to the waters edge as the tide was coming in and he again, opened his eyes wide and jumped as each wave licked the shore below us. I felt such peace and such sorrow as I thanked God again. I hope my son will always be able to feel the sand, hear the water and see the sun. \n As I write this, tears are running down my face. My thoughts and prayers go to all the people who have lost family or loved ones. I am so sorry. \n mari70 \n I went to school in brooklyn till a month ago and i took the NJT to get to new york.Most of my fellow passengers used to get off at penn.station ,newark to catch the path train to the world trade centre.I have no idea what their fate is today.The most exciting part of my day was looking at the manhattan skyline from the train just before entering the city.The twin towers of the world trade centre standing tall,black and mighty over the morning new york fog.As i watched the towers fall it reminded me of two lovers saying their last goodbye.It seemed that the second tower collapsed not just because it's steel melted due to the immense heat but it was heart broken to see it's partner on the ground and just did not want to stand there alone.They fell in a cloud of dust changing the life of new york and its people forever.The terrorists did not just strike america but the whole world where people want to be free and choose to be all they can be.But i have faith in the new yorkers for i have seen in them an energy found nowhere in the world.I am sure the city will put the unprecedented tragedy behind them and will return to its former vibrant self.I am equally confident that the towers will rise again from their ashes and form a part of the magnificent manhattan skyline ;the symbol of the free world.They might not be called the world trade center towers again but if they should be renamed they should be called the towers of PHOENIX. The cowards who were responsible will die and be damned forever but the spirit of the city will live for an eternity. \n gauthamnaidu \n Yes, please understand that those Palestinians live in a remote world. We in USA are used to a television, and now computer, in every house, with information flowing constantly from countless sources. Our Internet access is a liberty that brings us perspectives from around the world. \n The dancing Palestinians are only acting on what they have been told since birth - that we are evil. They do not know us. They do not have free access to internet, television, libraries....do not blame them for their repression. Their government keeps them truly ignorant of who we are. \n datdoo \n Frankmar: Did you listen to his speech? \n GWB cited a scripture from the Bible. He did not only make reference to God. \n I too believe in God, but many people in the USA do not. \n In fact, I think a public official on official capacity should not make reference to God in front of an audience of diverse or unknown religious composition. \n We need to be conscientiously religion-neutral now than ever before, in order to remove bias in our daily lives as Americans and to achieve a more balanced foreign policy positions. \n The inclusion of God can be many times more painful, and conspicuous, than deletion. I urge you to consider. \n jeffchurch1 \n Agree heartily about leaving ALL gods out of it. Whatever you call your god - Jesus, Blessed Mary, Buddha, Mohammed, Krishna - we must remain religion neutral. Religion is a matter of personal choice and should be kept to one's individual level. This is a matter of worldwide humanity uniting against terrorism. \n datdoo \n I am not a bush fan but at this point I see no purpose served by Bush bashing and the nation needs to rally behind the president not the individual. We can debate his ability or lack of ability to convey sympathy another time. \n r.m.kelley \n I used to travel regularly to New York on the QE2cruise liner. Like millions of others, I fell in love with your vibrant city. I have so many happy memories of it. I am so sorry for what has happened to your people. All the United Kingdom is truly united at this time. We are united by grief for your losses, and will undoubtedly stand by the United States in this time of crisis. God bless America. With deepest sympathy, Anthony Drummond. \n ad60uk \n I am part Asian and I have been assaulted during the Gulf war by people who thought that I am Arab. \n I am well aware of these hate attacks and I condemn them. However, I do not see any reason we cannot discuss the loyalty to the US of Arab Americans. I also know that to an Albanian Muslim, Gulf war of Osama ben Laden may not mean anything. \n There are Christians among Arab Americans (George Mithcell, Spencer Abraham) and you cannot paint them all with the same brush. That is why I would like to have a detailed discussion. I have pointed out that even Muslim British scholars admit that the a majority of British Muslim (mostly from pakistan/Bangladesh) put their country of origin ahead of UK. This was discussed in detail in an article in The Friday Times whose archives are not available at the moment. What is the situation here? \n One cannot say that all British Asians put their country of origin ahead of UK. Most British Indians do not do that. Similarly many muslims would strongly support the US at the hour of crisis. Why can we not discuss this? \n Web magazines (such as www.pakistanlink.com) show that a majority of comments/opinion/articles published by Muslim tend to be pro-jihadi. Is this a correct estimate? Why can we not discuss this? I may be making a mistake in my calculations and I would very gladly like to corrected. \n mbenner1 \n May I please use this media to send my most heartfelt sympathy to ALL Americans. The terrible events which have taken place are just too much to comprehend, even from the distance of the UK. I can't imagine what it must be like in New York, Washington or indeed anywhere in the US. In the UK today the British people have been extremely subdued, sharing your tremendous grief. I think the idea suggested by deronhusak earlier is an excellent way to remember the innocent victims of this atrocity. My prayers are with you. \n caroline5848 \n i'm from israel, and as a jewish man i'm telling you that i THINK most palestinians are shocked themselves. \n of course those of them who set policy and are now their leaders were the pioneers of the hijacking art. \n everyone in israel (the jews of course) is shocked and is sorry for your people. \n to those who think that american pro-israeli policy is the cause, than i guess it's the equivalent of blaming the raped women for being raped. \n melech1 \n Both Israelis and Palestinians share the blame for the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Anyone who sees things in black and white reveals their bias. It's a shame that trying to discuss the issue in a rational manner typically results in the anti-semite label being thrown about. Demonizing Arabs as barbaric savages is fine and dandy, but suggest for a moment that implicit U.S. support for Zionism crosses the line between separation of church and state and makes America a target of terrorist attacks and all hell breaks lose. \n sinverguenza28 \n Hi everyone... \n I'm from the United Kingdom. I would like to take this opportunity to send my sympathy to all those involved in yesterdays terrible tragidy. I watched in terrible shock as I watched as the World Trade Centre Towers collapse, sobbing uncontrolably. It's hard to find words to describe the way I feel, sick in the stomach, is one. I CANNOT imagine what people are going through or how they feel. All I know is how I feel and it's bad. I have friends in NY and I've only heard from one......All I can do, like many, is waite..... \n Michelle \n newton1967 \n I was downtown in New York city when the World Trade Center was attacked and later collasped. I will never forget looking up at the huge holes 20 stories high burning, with debris and people falling from the buildings. My cellphone did not work, pay phones did not work. I went to my office the electronic keys did not work..a man came onto our hall claiming washington dc was bombed..My co-workers and I decided to leave and went outside to see the WTC buildings collaspe. People covered in dirt came running out of the area planes were overhead I did'nt know if we were going to be bombed. People were crying and running..it was a diaster..it was a diaster...people were still in those buidings...we all cried everyone there cried I walked uptown. Why did'nt anyone protect us? these were innocent people...I live in fear. New York will never be the same. By the way, I watched many firefighters and police go into that area before the collaspe godbless them. \n candygirl206a \n whatever your politics, religion, or belief: there's plenty of hate already spread out there. let's spread compassion, tolerance, patience, and love in our communities, and hope it spreads like wildfire around the world. \n love you all as fellow human beings and wonderful souls \n * a sappy but genuine message from a tree huggin, woodstock attendin', reformed, well educated, and grown-up ex-hippie ** \n datdoo \n The big question now is which is more important: Freedom or security. Since this attack has just shown us that it is nearly impossable to have both. \n Yes, this event does raise those sorts of questions. \n The real answer is that we cannot purse absolutist perfection of either. \n But I'll tell you. A reasonable amount of public security -- not a perfect amount -- is the most important freedom that there is. \n Of course if that is the only freedom you have under a repressive police state, you are not very free. Not very free at all. The United States is very far from that. \n We should declare those groups or sects that have themselves declared terrorist Jihad against America, or acted and planned in such a manner without any formal declaration, to in fact be our war enemies. And then go to targeted, commando type war against the key members of those groups. Proactively. Without trials. \n That is how serious this is. \n Or are we going to wait until the suitcase nuke is exploded by a member of one of these groups before we take those sorts of measures. \n As well, wire taping of all those we have probable cause to believe SUPPORT terrorism against Americans. To find the actual actors. Without any necessity of probable cause that these persons actually are participating in terrorist acts themselves. \n dougjnn \n If George Bush has a trademark, it is \"bipartisan\". His father was known for building coalitions instead of acting alone as a rogue nation or individual (as the attackers did yesterday). It is certainly comforting to have a man with these qualities in the Whitehouse right now. I'm already sorry for critical remarks I made earlier about our president. \n mr_polynomial \n Peace to everyone. \n The recent attack in New York is the worst crime against humanity. As news start pouring in, I am becoming aware of near and dear ones who have died or are still missing. While we try to collectively cope with the losses that have fallen upon on shoulders, I like to bring another observation to everyone's attention. \n This crime has not spared people from any religion/creed/cast/color of the skin. I am sure there have been all kinds of casualties, i.e. white, black, brown and yellow. I am even certain that some people from Islam religion have also died. \n I am a Sikh and generally Sikhs wear turban and support long beards. In past 2 days I have come across news where Sikhs have been targeted by people (ignorant) in US, for they appear similar to some people from middle-east. \n http://www.sikhs.org/topics3.htm \n Please understand that Sikhs are not Muslims and do not follow Islam religion. We are fairly new religion, which originated in Northern Part of India. There is a big mis-conception about people who wear turbans and support long beards. Actually, a lot of people in Asia do wear turbans and keep beards, but for various reasons. Not all Muslims wear turbans, while all the Sikhs have to wear turban. Wearning of turban is religions issue amongst Sikhs, while the reasons amongst Muslims might vary for as simple reason as wearing a protective piece of cloth to protect against sun-rays to perhaps class distinction (clergy men wearning it mainly). \n In the state of Rajasthan in India, even Hindus wear turban to protect against strong sun rays. Rajasthan is desert area. \n There have been incidents of: \n Stone throwing Arrest of a individual wearing a turban and supporting long bear in Providence, RI area. \n If we have to punish someone then let's punish the real culprits and not our own people. Arab Americans are Americans at the end of the day. \n I hope this cruel incident does not turn a brother against a brother. \n sbedi \n Like everyone, I observed in amazement what happened yesterday. What I didn't observe anywhere with similar amazement, neither in the written press nor on television was any mention whatsoever of the U.N. It is precisely said forum which at this time should be leading the world and making it quite clear once and for all that the U.S.A. is one of the countries of said community and that it not only has the right to be defended (wrongly invoking clause V of the NATO Treaty), but also the obligation as a said U.N.member of perpetrating its philosophy of world unity. From this very day the following rules should be applied if we really wish to have the right to a UNITED Nations' Assembly: 1) That said Assembly be the only one empowered to act upon this situation. (This sadly reminds us all of the part the U.S. has played as the world's policeman and the tragic consequences yesterday) 2) Immediate application of all resolutions passed by the U.N. Assembly, without exception; which means not only those applicable to the well-known Iraqi situation but also those conveniently forgotten when applied to Israel for instance. Equal law for all must be the only valid example. 3) Cancel the right that some members have to veto decisions, thus making the Assembly a real democratic forum. 4) Make all member states pay their dues up-to-date; (as a genuine gesture of solidarity towards all - the paradox being that the U.S. is well behind in this sense). Bless all your fellow citizens unjustly caught in this terrible hatred and let us all send energy to those not only suffering the consequences but those in such need of inner peace that they be driven to such blind madness. \n Michael Martin Morgan \n I've spent much of the past 24 hours watching television coverage of the horrific events playing out in New York City and at the Pentagon, crying on and off, trying to grasp the enormity of events. How many people had I just seen die? \n I've heard stories of heroism that still bring tears to my eyes. Everyone who rushed to the aid of another human being in yesterday's tragedies is a hero. Some will be remembered, but the deeds of others will remain forever unknown. \n I've since turned the set off, no longer certain what information I am waiting to hear. The inundation of reports and the endless video loops of explosions and fires have settled into psychologists speaking of how to help your children cope, war-cries, the pretty young newscasters, and editorials. \n America is reacting, America is speaking. In some cases, she is screaming insanities, and reflecting naivete. \"America does not kill women and children!\" \"We should just nuke all those Middle Eastern countries!\" Such insanities are what have brought us to this pass, and there is no place for such naivete in the world into which we were finally thrown yesterday. \"America the blessed, the wonderful, the torchbearer of democracy, has been attacked.\" Democracy has not been attacked. In the clearest possible act, with undeniable symbolism, American capitalism and militarism have been attacked. This point must not be lost. The distinction between the American ideal of democracy and the policies enacted by our nation's corporate, political, and military institutions must not be blurred. \n An unpardonable attack has claimed the lives and futures of too many thousands for forgiveness, and justice must be pursued. But in the search for remedies, on the surest path to ensure that such catastrophes do not occur again, we must remember that these are the very institutions that Americans themselves often profess to distrust and even fear. This is not a time for blind calls to arms and flag waving. This is a time for mourning and consideration. This is a time to remember that events such as this does not occur in a vacuum, that America does not exist in isolation. The policies our leaders have pursued and the choices our corporations have made cannot escape a share of the blame for creating this new world order. And along with the rights we have been granted, we cannot escape the responsibility for controlling the entities America has created. \n abezella \n A fundamental change in the way the military operates is necessary to prevent this from happening again. The military was useless in this situation and continues to be no more than a symbol. We need to step back and rethink things like missle shields and aircraft carriers. What we need to concentrate on is information gathering. Clearly no one is going to wake up one morning and decide to launch a ballistic missle at us. There's going to be an organization, a plan. And at this time in the world nothing happens in total secrecy. Our efforts need to be applied toward prevention - to infiltrate these organizations and defeat them before attacks occur. Plotting to take innocent lives needs to be prosecuted just as if those lives were actually lost. \n It is unbelievable. We are indeed at war. The skies above New York City were patrolled by fighter jets. Thousands of American citizens have perished on our home soil. The children at recess still scream and yell outside my window, just like they did on Monday. My world goes on. But it is different world than I awoke to yesterday. \n cdcowan \n Subject: The FAA must be held Accountable \n Today and for the past few days, we have all been questioning the events of Tuesday. How could this happen in the United States of America? I have been particularly outraged when I think of the thousands of innocent people who have been taken from us. I can't bear to think of their families. \n As an Air Traffic Controller, certified by both the FAA and ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) and a pilot who have been around aviation all his life, I must place the blame for this tragedy squarely on the shoulders of the FAA. I know, at this time, it seems unpatriotic to question our institutions and our government. But in the name of the innocent victims and their families, I must say this. \n The rules are very clear. A plane from Boston to LA should never be anywhere near NYC. When a plane loses communications with ATC, it must be assumed that the flight will proceed as cleared or according to the flight plan. If the transponder is turned off, a primary target can still be seen and tracked. Only transponder specific information is lost. \n So one flight with very experienced pilots makes a 90 degrees turn and heads for some destination. In no place in the book is this a standard procedure. So ATC does nothing. The flight continues on this course with no communications. About 20 minutes later, another flight, from the same origin and to the same destination, does the same thing and heads in a similar direction. ATC sees this as they must. These are commercial flights flying under IFR and must be under the control of ATC at all times. \n ATC tracks the first flight into one of the most densely populated airspace in the country. ATC does nothing. ATC still tracks the other plane but does nothing. The first plane plunges into a building and disappears off the radar screen. ATC does nothing and has 20 minutes or so to react to the second flight but instead watches and waits as the second plane disappears from the screen and into another building. \n The FAA has the ability to get the military involved and to have military jets scrambled in event of an emergency. What would they have lost if they had scrambled and nothing happened? \n At least two Air Traffic Control Centers were involved, Boston being the first to see this activity. Yet with all the senior level people in these two centers, no one, I repeat, no one handled this as they should have. \n The FAA has failed miserably to protect innocent Americans on their own soil. The FAA should be made to answer and those involved severely punished. The Administrative group should all be severely punished. When one assumes the leadership role in an operation like the FAA, he accepts that the interest of the nation and the public are of utmost priority and concern. The FAA has betrayed the public trust. \n tsanichara \n Presently I am at school in Boston, but my home is in NY. I not only feel the mortality and despair of the nation, but suffer the loss of my home. The breathtaking view of the WTC that I have always cherished will forever more be a memory. \n The night after the attack I put an away message on AIM, and it seemed to get an emotional response. \n Call for Hope- Tragedy 911 \n People say \"You never sleep.\" And sometimes it is true. I don't need much sleep, so I don't get much. But tonight I am afraid to sleep. I am afraid that when I wake up in the morning, Everything that happened today will still be real and not the nightmare that vanishes with dawn. But, if I don't go to sleep, I am stuck in the nightmare. \n What a sad way to fall asleep... With tears on the pillow; Wishing I could wake up safe in loving arms In a world without war and fear. But wishes don't always come true... \n trose1082 \n I find it highly offensive that the NY Times editorial page, 2 days after a national tragedy, has the audacity to insert partisan feelings in questioning the leadership of President Bush and his national security team. I find it highly offensive that the Whitehouse has been playing politics with this whole situation. When will Bush get off of his script and address the American people in his own words based on his own feelings and emotions? The script should be turned off. It makes me sick to see him reading and mangling scripted that he clearly hasn't seen before they were put in front of him instead of talking to us like we need. We as a country need to be communicated to clearly from our leader, like BC post OKC or RR post the Lebanon barracks bombing or anyone of the hostage takings that occurred during his term. This is a time for bold words for history that will guide us. He hasn't delivered. Instead we have gotten 4 different TV statements each saying the same thing and neither memorable or encouraging for the American public. And what is the deal with this BS about AF1 being a target. It was in South FL. Why can't they just say that they were being over protective and concerned and screwed up by not bringing him back to DC? Instead they make up a story that is starting to have the same feel as that WH vandalism BS. Why are people talking on background in Bill Safire's column? This is a national crisis not a budget dispute, if there ever was a time to stop the now ubiquitous statements from \"senior White House official on background\" this is it. They need to cut the crap! This is the time that we most need full and honest information and communication from our leadership. They have not lived up yet and I for one am saddened and disappointed by everything. \n cartbran \n You as a people have suffered a great tragedy. I wish to offer true and heartfelt feelings of care and support, and hope that the healing will be timely. I was in the emergency department of the Hospital where I work at 23:15 local time when the first images of the events were first broadcast. I cannot stress enough my feeling for the idividuals and their loved ones. It is terrible. Being an honourable man, I have felt these feelings for the civilians of other countries but these feelings are accentuated now by the number of casualties. I hope before rage overtakes individuals that time is taken to reflect on the feelings your country shares and consider the feelings of those in other countries, where the conflict is relentless, with a continuous need for weaponry. This weaponry is supplied by many countries of which the USA is a major player. I remember the image of the naked, little Vietname girl running and screaming after being napalmed. Over time, many Vietnamese were killed in their own country. Indeed, I can't think of another single episode of such a killing as has occurred to you, other than Hiroshima. I am sorry I feel that I need to have said painful truths, but I am currently watching your president doing a poor job of convincing your nation that you are again at war. 01:02 Fri 14.9 The thing that strikes me as tragic is that a small handful of men could cause so much carnage armed with rudimentary equipment. The relative costs in consideration of the American arms industry and the consequent political leverage this exercises make it a black farce. It is time to reflect on the history of your country to understand why this has happened, and on the impact of the first real foreign attack on your home soil, rather than the reverse. you need a new president. The folks in NY are being brilliant. my best wishes. \n xerxes8 \n Honor our Heroes. Let the firefighters, the police, the nurses, the construction workers and all the others who are out there right now risking their lives trying to save others know we support and honor them. One way to do this is to contact their unions. Let us honor the hundreds of families that have lost loved ones who gave their lives trying to save others and let us make sure those families are provided for, they gave the ultimate sacrifice. These are the true heroes of the WTC and Pentagon atrocities and I am and we all should be very proud of them. Let us also honor our teachers, who are helping our children through these trying times, the FEMA volunteers, many of whom are just now getting ready to go to the scene, the flight attendants and pilots of the aircraft we fly, some of whom lost their lives on Tuesday, the military members who patrol our skies and borders and died doing their jobs in the Pentagon. All of these are some 'the little people' who make this country work day to day. They don't make don't control large companies, have stars on their shoulders or millions in their bank accounts. They just go to work, day after day, do their jobs and love their families. Today, as everyday, they are the true heroes. \n coriverrat \n ... and another thing. Can't the networks keep those ridiculous \"Attack on America\" logos off of the television screens? Can't we keep ourselves from being ridiculously callous and superficial for just 1 minute? Please. \n blpiltin \n This tragedy should not be underestimated but one thing's for certain - We should not hold the Arab community in general responsible for this horrific event. I am a Caucasian-American with as much disdain for the perpetrators as anyone else. Seeing the destruction of our American symbols of freedom and commerce has been unbearable to me and my heart goes out to all the victims and their families. I, like everyone else, am heartbroken as well as livid that these people were capable of this kind of impact on our nation. However, the only people who are responsible are the fringe groups of militants who targeted Americans, NOT Arab-Americans living here, Muslim or otherwise. Please remember the difference. The Muslim faith does not teach this kind of violence. The culprits are the erratic power mongers who twist the words of their religion to gather followers - a problem that can be found within all faiths. Arab-Americans are no more responsible than anyone else in America for this devastating event. They are just as angry and have lost family members of their own. Do not place your anger upon the innocent. Focus it where it will be constructive - on militants who actually support such activities. Discrimination is a dangerous activity. Have we not learned our lesson from African-American and Japanese-American injustices? \n sarahen \n Sorry for my bad english - it \u0301s fiftieen years ago, that I spoke my last words in school. But today I have the will to tell all americans, that I \u0301m deeply shocked about the terror in your country. We germans think of you today and are so sad about what happend to you. I hope, you won \u0301t answer with violence, but you \u0301ll proove, that you are civilised and real christians, which know something, the terrorists and their friends never heard about - a word, that I only know in german: \"Na\u0308chstenliebe\" ! We all have to stop and provide such violence, but please don \u0301t answer with war against the suffering children and depressed women in Afghanistan. Perhaps you and we in western europe should think about the reason for this terrible und unbelievable hate. You and I are living in a rich world, which is partly based on the poorness of the southern countries. We should - more than ever - think about our responsibilitiy for the development of those countrys, for their chance to take part of the globalised new economy. If the contrast between the rich western countrys and the rest of the world will raise on, it will always exist terrorists all over the world - with more and more brutal weapons. Let \u0301s hope and change... \n chrisklev \n At times this forum seems like hell, as fear, anger, and all the torments of the damned swirl about us. Let us remember our common humanity. Let us remember how fleeting and how precious life is. This is hard for many to do, especially young men, who have a hard-wired desire to be defenders of the band. Those responsible for the attack on this country cannot expect to avoid the consequences for their actions. If possible, we must prevent them from ever being able to repeat such attacks. But I believe those who wish to use this forum to call for mass murder through nuclear war may some day be glad these dark ideas were not displayed for public view. If they could look very closely at the photographs of the dead and injured at Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- especially the agonized faces of the burned children -- they would see what they have been calling for in their personal and private despair. \n chasstevenson \n Its a terrible tragedy, but I truly look at it as an opportunity to make it a much safer world. I really believe that these terrorists made a mistake by attacking in such a monumental and horrendous way. Because of the enormity of what they did, I think both world opinion and the American people will be steeled to take whatever action is necessary to wipe-out the threat of terrorism. Unlike prior struggles, I think that, in the minds of the populous, the balance between our own security and the desire to minimize collateral damage has swung widely in favor of taking whatever action is necessary to ensure that known terrorists are destroyed and, importantly, those that are left, will find no quarter from nations too concerned over the repercussions that providing safe harbor would bring. You know that I have never been a hawk, and frankly, I have been somewhat critical of Israel in the past, but I think we have two choices. Either do very little in the way of retaliation and put clamps on personal freedoms in this country in the name of increased security (which I think would truly be antithetical to the foundations of this nation), or massive action aimed at eradicating both the supply of terror and the ability of future terrorists to find safe and comfortable areas to train and plan. I realize it is early and we need to guard against the impulse to overreact, but my reasoning is not one of revenge. I've watched over the years as Israel has attempted to deter terrorist acts by retaliating in a greater (but still measured) manner than that by which Israel was attacked. Unfortunately, such retaliation has not only failed to deter, but has increased the supply of individuals willing to avenge their martyrs. I do not mean to say that the political struggle of the Palestinians is without merit (frankly I am not educated well enough on the topic to decide), however, the world needs to establish that political objectives will not be won by killing civilians. Righteous causes must be fought, not through \"intifada,\" but through political and world pressure. To continue using Israel and the Palestinians as an example, the Arab world holds substantial political and economic leverage. Instead of condoning terrorism, organizations seeking to further the Palestinian goals should be lobbying for the exercise of such leverage. In fact, without the threat of terrorism, Israel's most valid reason for resisting the turnover of land to the Palestinians, SECURITY, would no longer exist. Unfortunately, terrorism will exist as long as there are places like Syria, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan that are willing to allow individuals to live and plan terrorist attacks from within their borders. I think (and hope) that the magnitude of this attack will allow for a world coalition willing to take the actions necessary to make the risks to such countries far too great to allow any refuge to future terrorists. \n rengman \n Know that there are people all over the world, who desperately feel for all america at this awful time. i know america and americans as a great nation. please accept my sorrow for the innocent victims in these atrocities,and my hope beyond hope that your splendid emergency services bring out many more survivors. wish i could offer more than these words. terry mcgrory liverpool england. \n t.mcgrory \n From Oklahoma---What is ours is yours NY!!!!! Our deepest sympathy for all your losses and know that we are with you in thoughts and prayers! \n kab007 \n The president has now made a numnber of public statements. Can you remember anything memorable or inspiring about any of them? He said during the campaign, \"They have not led, we will.\" Well it has been over 8 months now and we are currently in the middle of one of the biggest crises of modern history and I ask you were the leadership is. I do not care about where he was or wasn't. What I do care about is the president addressing the American public in a manner that that lifts the spirits of the American people and can give me the strength and courage to continue. I live in DC. I was in an office building very close to the Pentagon when it was attacked. I am frightened and scared and angry like everyone else. I do not know where or what to do with or about any of this. The president needs to step up to the plate and deliver a national speech from his desk at the oval office, like so many before him, notably Reagan, and communicate to us as a person to a person. He needs to turn off the teleprompter and put down the script and stop the politicking that has been going on and speak to us so that we can breathe a collective sign of relief and forgiveness. He needs to engender all of his own strength and courage, if necessary, and rise to the occassion and show us that we too can rise out of this. We need hope and we need the president to deliver that hope. Perhaps we really need right now a president from hope. I don't know. \n cartbran \n To even suggests that President Bush made the wrong decision in not heading toward Washington, D.C. immediately is yellow journalism at its worst. Days from now, when the smoke has cleared and perhaps a few heads, maybe then criticism would be warranted. However, so soon after a national tragedy, and without being privy to top secret information, any newspaper that criticizes or even reports the criticism of the President by others is irresponsible. God bless America and a responsible press. \n tizzidale \n I can't even believe that someone would be that much of a jerk to blame this on Clinton and the NY Times. Oh, you know what. I can believe it. Because it's the same kind of mentality that brought about this tragedy in the first place--hatred and ignorance. There is no way to calmly discuss the Clinton administration's foreign policy and military record in this forum. However, many thoughtful people (including George Kennan) questioned the wisdom of various of Clinton's policies. These questions may well be relevant to the situation we face today. \n chasstevenson \n I would like to commend the manner in which the mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani, has handled this grave situation. I would urge the state of New York not to let this courageous man and leader get away from public life. If they do, we would love to have him in New Jersey. Thank you and God Bless all Americans as we struggle to overcome this situaton we now face. Ray Fonseca Roselle, New Jersey \n reineriosr \n Please put the word on,not all arabs are moslems there are thousands of christian arabs world wide . NOt all the arabs are moslems.................please remember this. \n petrus4 \n My friends, I am not a politician, or a military leader, or anywhere close to being a man capable of influencing my country\u2019s policy. I am an ordinary citizen of Canada, saddened and appalled by the events of Tuesday, September 11. Today, two days after the monumental tragedy that struck your nation, I am moved to reach out to those of you in shock and in pain across our storied undefended border. As Canadians, we are in the best position in the international community to see firsthand the might of America, the strength of its industry, of its military and of its population. We condone and support the role you have taken for yourselves as protectors of the free world, a protectorate in which we enjoy countless benefits. Because of you, our worries are relatively few. We know that we need not fear conventional aggression, because we are protected by the umbrella of your military strength. We know that we need not fear economic disaster, as our economy is irrevocably tied to the strength of yours. Collectively, we have also been grossly ungrateful for all that the United States has done to further our interests and for the friendship that we share. The single largest unifying factor in Canadian nationalism, in fact, is that we are different from Americans. The most successful television commercial in Canadian history is a 30-second rant telling us how we are different and somehow better than our southern neighbors. One of the things you will hear from many Canadians when discussing the United States is that while we know much about you through mass media and our school curricula, many Americans know very little about us. Know this, though: You are at once our neighbor, our closest ally, our largest trading partner and, in truth, our extended family. Our differences our trivial, our similarities powerful and perpetually binding. Our people unanimously stand beside you in this time of need, grief and rage. Our politicians have promised whatever humanitarian aid within our power to help the victims of this tragedy. I truly believe that I speak for all Canadians when I say I wish we could do more. May God Bless America. Scott Moffatt Ottawa, Ontario, Canada \n moffamadness \n When all is said and done (if that time ever arrives), I think the main culprits in this horror are the people at the FAA. For close to an hour (!), 4(!) planes were missing from the airspace around the east coast air corridor. If anyone noticed this they are not now talking about it. In the hour from when the planes disappeared to the crashes, how many military jets could have scrambled to intercept the 4? Obviously there's no answer to that, but the question is, WHO IS THE FAA AND WHY DO THEY CLAIM THEY ARE ACTING IN MY INTERESTS? Living as I do under the flight path of all outgoing jets from LGA I have long pondered this question. The FAA seems interested in only one thing, namely to look out for the airlines and not make them do ANYTHING that would inconvenience them. After all, who do you think these people will work for after retiring from the FAA? No requests for new slots from the airlines goes unheeded, in spite of obvious safety and environmental concerns. But any requests from the flying public, or those of us on the ground, is ignored as completely as possible. The FAA holds public meetings, for instance, to discuss plans for new flight paths, but then never publishes the results and goes ahead with whatever plans it has already decided on. The flying public long complained about delays and the like, but nothing was done, and more and more flights were added to already overcrowded airports like LGA. (How many flights can really take off at 12 noon? at 3PM? How many more would the FAA have added if it were not for the economic slowdown?) This is a type of corruption that is particularly egregious in this case. If the employees of the FAA want to work for the airlines, let them quit now and do so; if the want to work for the people of the US, then let them finally start understanding that we in the planes and on the ground have more rights to their services than the airlines do. If they can't protect us from the airlines, let them all quit now and let us find some people who CAN. (If, for instance, the air traffic control system is so woefully inadequate that 4 planes can disappear from their radar, then its clear the FAA has not been sucessful in protecting the public.) In the present tragedy I believe it is incumbent on us to demand answers to questions about past, present, and future FAA actions and how they actually impact our lives. Its no longer enough for these people to do whatever they want under the justifications of safety and security. Its time for the FAA to really respond to us and take into consideration what the public needs and wants. \n steve48b \n i'm a 18 years old girl from germany. i'm sitting in front of the pc,but i even don't know what to write. i saw the second crash live on tv and thought that has to be a film. when i realized it's true i started crying. every time i see someting about it on tv i start crying again. today at 10 o'clock in the morning there was silence everywhere in germany. i was sitting in school at that time and started to cry...i'm still crying! i can't believe it's true...! know it doesn't help, but i want you to know that the whole country is thinking of you and praying for all the dead persons and their families, the fire and policemen, everyone who's helping!!! god bless them all! PEACE! sandra \n sandra-germany \n People at this very moment are dying agonizing deaths. Our people. American People. And yet, there are still so many anti-Israeli, anti-American posts here... 'we deserved it,' 'it's because we oppress people,' 'it's because of the Jews and our support of them,' MY GOD! Where is your humanity? Can you not stop blaming, blaming, blaming and hating for a few days? These terrorists destroyed your city, and justify, and philosphize, and intellectualize, and trivialize it all. Like some suspended brains without bodies, looking down on all of us mortals actually feeling, and suffering, and passing your cool, level judgement. Many of you must look in the mirror. There are many shades of grey, yes, but at a time like this we must all be red, white, and blue. And for you hatemongering Jew haters that spew your filth despite the fact that we are a democracy, and EVERY administration has suported Israel(free country/democracy), regardless of party: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote: 'You declare, my friend, that you do not hate the Jews, you are merely 'anti-Zionist'. And I say, let the truth ring forth from the high mountain tops. Let it echo through the valleys of God's green earth: When people criticize Zionism they mean Jews... Zionism is nothing less than the dream and ideal of the Jewish people returning to live in their own land... And what is anti-Zionism? It is the denial to the Jew of the fundamental right that we justly claim for the people of Africa and freely accord to all other nations of the globe. It is discrimination against Jews because they are Jews. In short it is anti-Semitism.' I hope you one day find it in yourself to be brave enough to face your weakness and fear and insecurity. Stick with America, stick with Israel -- be a patriot, for God's sake. \n jesnyt0 \n To speculate or propose that the Mossad or the CIA or someone or something similar was behind the recent attacks on New York and Washington is totally absurd and unproductive, and shows a complete lack of understanding about recent events in the Middle East. I've heard similar yarns from individuals here in Canada, and I can assure you that they're totally out to lunch! That you Americans can't fathom who your enemies really are is part and parcel of your moral dilemma. It's time to get a grip and to understand that you are hated by your enemies for your overall ignorance and smug complicity. If you want to stop terrorism in its tracks, then you will have to dig a lot deeper than postulating the absurd. \n fhearghail \n Tuesday night in Australia,(Morning for you) my partner rang me & told me to turn my television on. What I saw shook me to the core. I can't begin to express the horror/shock/pain I felt. I've never been to the US but somehow I've always felt that the US represented the free world, & therefore my world. Since then I've sat glued to my television every moment I can, mourning with the family's who've lost loved ones, praying with those still searching, rejoicing with each rescue of a victim & wishing for justice for those who organised this terrible thing. It's frightening to have this happen to America, the country that represents strength, freedom & democracy. Seeing New York & Washington violated in such a way, made me realise how unsafe we all are against such attacks. However the words of your President promising to hunt them down reassure me that they will be dealt with. Watching each and every one of you pull together, helping each other is an inspiration. In this time of tradgedy it would be understandable if you took time to feel sorry for yourselves, but no, you go out to see what you can do to help someone else. Even on a square box your spirits show the strength & determination Americans are renowned for. The whole of Australia feels your pain, and admires your spirits. I will forever miss the view of the TWC on newscasts, but I'm eager to see what you ingenius, amazing Americans put in thier place to show you can't be beaten. Trudy in Australia. \n trude_rules \n Please people. Enough of the Israel vs. Palestine garbage. The fact is none of the states in the middle east practices the ideals that make this country great. Most are ruled by theocracies, including Israel. The rest are just run of the mill bully tyrants. We have a few relatively good friends in the region who help us maintain a military presence. The military presence is there to protect our interest in having access to purchase oil from the region. And unless you are running your computer by a pedal powered generator, you are part of the reason we are there. We have tenuous alliances with some of the Arab states, due in part to their interest in keeping control of their sheikdoms. We help them in this. We also help Israel because of a complicated relationship due in part to a significant Jewish population in the US, collective Western guilt over treatment of the Jews over the last several centuries, and treaty obligations. They also have been our best friend in the region. Which is not to say they have always been a good friend. The Palestinians are part victim of history, and part tool of the Arab states in the region, most of whom want the destruction of Israel. We have picked sides in an ugly fight that has no hope of being won by either side. Israel is a state founded on religious identification which is anathema to the traditions of our country. But we have few good options. You can be simplistic and think that giving some land to the Palestinians will end the fight, but you will be simply wrong. The only answer is to negotiate with our few Arab friends in the region to intervene on our behalf. Then negotiations must begin to give dispersed land within the Arab countries and financial settlements to each Palestinian who claims to have been pushed out of his homeland. It's not nice, but no other solution has a chance to work. \n michael543 \n There is no question that the awesome power of the United States will be brought to bear on those responsible for the terrorist acts in NY, Washington and Pittsburgh. Our nation is wounded, but strong and capable of rebuilding from this terrible disaster. The United States is society founded on laws, empowered by a Constitution that holds liberty and freedom sacred. The strength of our society is based on these laws that proscribe our ideals, common social and political goals and framework for economic success that has lead us to a position of international leadership. In this time of crisis, we must rely upon these laws to root out the evil of September 11, 2001. Congress through the will of the people has the power proscribed by law to find and bring to justice those responsible. There is no room in our society of laws for personal retribution, vigilantism, or threatening attacks on law-abiding Arab-Americans. Those actions degrade not only our laws, but also our faith in government and its power to act in every American's common interest of swiftly and prudently bringing those responsible to justice and punishing them for all the world to see. If we believe in the United States, in a civilized society, in the concepts of liberty and freedom, and our Constitution, we must stand firmly while our government prosecutes their investigation and brings the full force of the United States to bear on any and every responsible party. \n luke_hollis \n If the media in New York are being critical of Bush, it's because they, like many of us in NY, felt a real vacuum Tuesday in the delay of response and the quality of the eventual response from him. At first, he barely acknowledged that this horrible attack took place in New York. So he's been berated enough to decide to come here tomorrow. Well, who cares now. Our moral support came from our mayor. Bush looks like a fly in comparison. \n fran124b \n I doubt I'm the only New Yorker on this forum; I do want to thank all for the well wishes. It was comforting to see people in NYC come so close together. The comeraderie, the support, was inspiring and touching. I'll never forget getting over the bridge to Brooklyn and finding NYC Tech staff out in the street handing out cups of water to people, or the 'rough necks' helping women on the Manhattan bridge, or the men flagging down a passing vehicle to help an elderly woman... \n mquin4 \n Among the possible responses to the horrible terrorist attacks on America, I wonder if President Bush has considered inviting Osama Bin Laden for negotiations at Camp David in order to peacefully resolve their disputes without recourse to bloodshed. If not, then I would be very surprised. Hasn't America cajoled Indians to talk to Pakistani generals despite complete knowledge of the latter's involvement in terrorism in Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir?? Hasn't America arm-twisted Israelis into talking to Palestinian terrorists, who were doing their best to attack Israeli targets?? If America has suddenly realised the folly of it's ways and decided that terrorism needs to be countered with swift, punitive measures, then would it extend the same courtesy to other nations who are equally, if not more vulnerable to terrorist violence?? Would America now consider joining their fight against nations which openly harbour terrorists?? Or would America once again content itself into attacking personalities and delude itself into believing that terrorist groups which target other countries should be of no particular concern to it. \n rajender_razdan \n I think we all are making mistake in calling a religion fanatic act to a terrorist act. This change of terminology is going on for ages. The largest number of wars and human death account to this fanatic phylosophy. The time has come, we have learned enough lessons, now start calling all of us as \" Human\" and not Muslim, christian, buddhist or hindu. World leaders must sit down and think in this direction, to stop mass murders once for all. The only logical way is to forgate \" God \". We don't need HIM now, we had enough of Him. I am not athist, but I don't believe in God of mass murderers. \n naneria \n crossmaster - \"I have a question for the group... What defines terrorism to you? For example, would cracking down on terrorism mean the FBI should make a better effor to root out domestic terrorists like the Olympic bomber (Eric Rudolph?), who is purportedly still living in North Carolina?\" \n I think \"terrorism\" is an abstract idea and a political catch phrase. \n The idea is so abstract that it is virtually meaningless. It is often defined as violent actions undertaken by one's enemies. The targetting of undefended villages in Yugoslavia (such as Varvarin), dams, power plants, and water supplies in Iraq and Yugoslavia, Clinton's missile attack on the Sudan, etc., have all of the hallmarks of terrorism except they were done by our side and are therefore not \"terrorism\". \n As a catch phrase, it allows people to skip over sequential and evaluative reasoning and jump ahead to describe what they have already decided they want to do. \n And yes, \"a war on terrorism\" would suggest that a nuclear device whould be set off in Eric Rudolf's cave or an Army division sent to capture him. \n I will surely catch the dickens from people for this post by people who do not read it carefully. The attack on innocent American civilians was an enormous evil (which sickens me now as I think of it). Those responsible must be prevented from repeating such acts. However, to declare war on an abstraction like \"terrorism\" (or a reification like \"drugs\" for that matter) helps us not at all and, knowing our professional politicians, will probably waste a lot of our money. \n chasstevenson \n For myself, I apologize for framing this tragic situation in terms of the US/Israeli/Palestinian situation. It just has seemed to me that this is the flashpoint that is behind the attack. Like most people, I abhor what happened, and am hoping that whatever actions the US takes will be measured, and effective, and not leaving us more vulnerable and more reviled in the world. I'm just some guy from Denver who admittedly has little frame of reference to the oppression felt by all the subjugated people of the world. I can't imagine their pain, and I can't hope to end it. Few people attack and destroy for fun. They are responding to a crucible of circumstances beyond their control. But circumstances of pain and terror surround millions in this world, but only a few take it upon themselves to murder and destroy. I don't understand those people, and I have little desire to empathize with them. It may be that they are beyond redemption. \n kgmaximus \n I live in Manhattan, the upper west side.I was getting ready for work and I heard it happen on the TV, as I went over to the TV I seen the second plane hit the second Tower. That's when I knew for sure it wasn't any type of accident! I'm sorry to say that I feel our goverment plays a big part in letting something this serious happen! If they wouldn't let anybody and everybody in this country, this might not have happened. And the worst part is they came here and lived here for over a year with their families, and we taught them how to fly the planes that were used as weapons against America! From a very sad New Yorker \n perfectone4ever \n I have been watching in horror, anger and disbelief at what has been unfolding in the Nation's capital, in the fields of Pittsburg and in New York City. As a resident of Oklahoma City, the emotion and sentiment that is being felt here is overwhelming in the most horrendous terrorist incident to occur in the wake of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Office building. New York and Washington..we want you to know that we support you and stand behind you in any way that we can. It would appear that at this point, military action is inevitable and that the United States will most likely, in concert with other nations, methodically and systematically hunt down and eliminate many terrorist groups. We as a nation should play a role against terrorism and make patriotism an act that takes place EVERY DAY, not only when a national disaster occurs. I wish that I could be at ground zero offering assistance more directly to our heroes of the fire, medical and police departments as well as all of the other heroes who may go unmentioned, but I want them to know my thoughts and prayers are with them all. \n eaneau \n This is the most important event of my life. The world will be re-founded by this event, lets hope that our leaders allow this event to reshape our society, that our children should inhabit a better world. On many war memorials it states 'Lest We Forget. Let our children not forget the terror we allowed to infect then strike down, our hope and freedom. \n All my family hold out hope for missing Americans.. \n Nik Palmer (Nottingham. UK) \n nikpalmer \n I am pleased to write in the nyt forums...thank you. On a darker note.... i can't stop thinking about the short term and long term effects that will undoubtly come from the American situation. My dad wishes that Reagan was the president right now, so that he would react impulsively (like in the Pan Am bombing..) -- but then he took this event as an \"opportunity\" to tell me to re-evaluate my religious views and start praying because he suggests that this is the beginning of the end, as prophesized. What do you think? I am an avid disliker of G. Bush... regarding his Kyoto protocal business, and the nuclear defense system. I was unimpressed by his speech to the nation... Do you think that this attack [of evil] was stictly the Palestines, or a coalition. At first when i heard the news it was at work (i work in the Victoria Int'l airport) and the person didn't like americans, so i thought it was a joke to have a better day or something. THen my second reaction was oooh that george bush.. a conspiracy to strengthen his side for the defense w. nuclear weaponry etc... now i am totally at a loss. there is so many things to speculate, so many ways that this could pan out.... Anyways, i wrote an email to much music, becuase they were asking people to call/fax/email in thier thoughts: \n Indeed, this is as disgusting and unsuspected an act of terrorism as it is ruthless, and I feel for all who are involved, or will be, with this inevitable conflict of war. \n This is a terrible loss, but no more terrible than similar if not the same losses suffered in other countries on our planet. The thing is, that these kind of terrorist attacks are not consistent blows to our economy, and country - as they are and have been in other countries around the globe, where it holds their economy stagnate, unable to grow and prosper. I am confident that America and Americans will come out of this fine, and perhaps stronger. \n I think the concept of holding lives at a higher value because you are the subject, or you idealize yourself as more prosperous, or a bigger part of the global network... is improper. Because you are written in history books in a positive light, it indicates that the value of your existance as greater than that of those viewed in a shady light - and more attention and sorrow should be delivered to your door? \n The fact that this now occures literally in our backyards makes us sick, and upset, and confused. This is, naturally, a subjective reaction we are having; it means that we have compassion, and that we can feel for our losses, we are... humanitarians in this aspect. But we must be careful not to prove that we have this compassion only for our own Nation, North America. It appears selfish; and no doubt this is what terrorized countries such as Palestine are thinking... as they watch us in our time of tragedy. \n I try to feel as much or as little as I have or have not felt for the innocent victims of WWII, or Kosovo, or Palestine. It is important to acknowledge when such lives, and such architecture are destroyed... and important to recognize this as a message, perhaps an indication of change or a wake up, that needs to occur to perpetuate the harmony that American citizens have lived in up till now. I fear for what is to come, and I feel for what has been lost to this 'cause' which has left us all, myself included, shaken, confused and afraid. \n I hope that you find the time to respond... it's important to me to talk to all those who i think can offer something different, if not more educated about this... I am sure that you are having discussions every day about this, and what it might mean. I am envious that i am not there to be a part of the discussions. Take care of you and yours... \n -Rebekah Sidney, BC CANADA \n diktatorbexx \n annemarie71 \"Did our grandparents celebrate the victory of Allied Forces over the Germans? And are they our fellow Dutchmen who party wildly after Holland has won a soccer match from Germany? And do they party by mocking and beating up Germans? Yes!\" \n Stranger things have happened. If your enemy is hurt, you celebrate. Don't be too much put off by the scenes you saw in your own city. Look at the 'how' and 'why'! What is it exactly that they are celebrating? Why are these people so happy? \n remcogoris \n In my neighborhood, Oak Lawn, Illinois, last night over 500 people( teenagers mainly) made demonstrations at the local Mosque. Dressed in what they felt most represented America ( cowboy hats , tee shirts, American and Confederate flags.....)These children know nothing of patriotism, or what it means to be an American. They know not of love, loyalty, duty or charity. To them this was just a way to raise some hell. I wonder if they ever thought of organizing a blood drive at their school, or soliciting donations of clothing , face masks or money to send to New York. What happened in this country on 9/11 was the most horrible thing that my generation could ever imagine. My father fought in WW2, was himself at Pearl Harbour right after the bombing, and in total gave 23 years of his life to the Navy, I never in my lifetime thought that I would see the kind of horrors that he saw while in the service. These young adults that were protesting at the Mosque, would they ever give 23 years of their life to defend the country that they supposedly love? There are serious problems that this country has to face now, decisions need to be made and actions need to be taken, what we do not need now are uncontrollable children and adults making our problems worse by committing hate crimes. People please devote your time now to helping our nation not hindering it. \n kolbacki \n A \"War on Terrorism\" is of course a noble and just objective...however, it also implies the same mindset that supports the \"War on Drugs\"...treat the symptom and not the disease. Let us recall that during the USSR-Afghani war in the early-mid 80's, bin Laden was a CIA \"asset\", as indeed are current elements of the Taliban, created and armed by joint US-Pakistani military efforts at that time..now, our declared \"enemies\". Sure, take out bin Laden and the bulk of his so-called cells...then what? Will that be \"victory over terrorism?\" Hardly, as long as the root causes of anti-Americanism exist, which chiefly concern Palestinian claims in the Middle East going unheeded, in the eyes of these supporters. Until and unless the US is prepared to once again actively bring its good offices to bear in resolving a 50+year conflict, new groups will emerge which again will attempt to inflict hideous and calamitous damages against American targets, both at home and abroad. \n barrisj \n Stop it. The attack on the U.S. was an attack on US all. Now comes the bickering--you're on their side--no, I'm not--yes, you are. Get a grip. \n jfeir should be able to express his/her thoughts without having to suffer personal attack. The air attack using our own domestic airlines was as personal attack as they come on US all. \n And, here you have the temerity to argue about who supports the terrorist by virtue of the fact that the poster was in actuality trying for some levity--in a jaded sort of way. \n Stop this madness. The mad men are still out there somewhere--may be even still in our midst plotting new malevolent mayhem and destruction. \n To fight amongst ourselves is to become discouraged. To become discouraged means to become weakened. \n Right now is the time when we must be strong for ourselves and for each other. Otherwise, the assault on America continues--but with us attacking each other. \n The bodies of those who died at the WTC and the Pentagon have yet to be identified. I'm only certain that once identified there will be Anglo-Americans, Jewish Americans, Arab Americans, African Americans, Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, Latino Americans, and so on. \n We are a diverse people from varying backgrounds and cultures. Still we all are influenced by being also of the American culture--one that recognizes the multi-racial, -ethnic, -cultural backgrounds that make us so unique in the world. \n We all are US. \n sfcreader \n the world has changed. \n people must take personal individual responsibility for their own freedom, while still working as part of the greater community. there are many places that are still vulnerable. it wouldn't be tough for someone to roll a coordinated set of tanker trucks out to the middle of the Golden Gate bridge and do the same thing. there are hundreds of other opportunities as well. tactically, we need to -- as individuals -- take responsibility. \n the air aspect of this is a significant one. and we can't, finanically, afford to have armed marshalls on every flight. even if we did, it is likely that 6 trained terrorists could overpower one marshall, even if he was armed. those hijackers may not be \"armed\" with anything other than information, so airport security checkpoints are useless. instead of knives and box cutters, the bastards from tuesday could have easily walked on *unarmed*, walked up to first class, and grabbed steak knives and achieved the same effect. \n Requirements of a step toward individual freedom on this particular threat: - coverage on every flight - ability to thwart multiple hijackers on a single flight \n Suggestion: major airlines work together with appropriate training authorities to form a \"Volunteer Air Safety Corps.\" the people who fly the most (\"premier,\" \"1K,\" \"admiral's club\" - type fliers) are, typically on planes, by definition, many days out of the year. also, although a stereotype, many of these people are \"type-a\" who would likely be willing and able to work together to thwart a concerted attack. it is rumored that a gentleman of this type (a COO from the bay area) worked with others to storm the cabin on the Pennsylvania flight. although the flight was lost, it is possible -- likely -- that their actions saved hundreds, if not thousands, of lives. i, for one, would be willing to myself pay for this type of training, and would be the first to sign up. i have a feeling that others would as well. \n help spread the meme. \n peace, \n Interested parties should send mail to: volunteerairsafety@hotmail.com \n airsafety \n Americans are going to lash out at any person they see that looks Middle Eastern. This has happened before. Our Government put thousands of Asians in internment camps after Pearl Harbor even though 99% of them had no desire to be connected to Japan, and many who were not even Japanese! Who's to say that this won't happen to Palestinian Americans now? We must make sure that it doesn't. Lastly, I want to sum up this letter. This is a horrible act that is unprecedented in this country, and this is a turning point in all of our lives. What we do now is an example for future generations in their struggles to live decent lives. If we strike out at the first enemy that we perceive, as we have a history of doing, just to placate many Americans who are now after blood, we will have done a great wrong. If we do find the actual enemy and lash out at them, we will have solved nothing. More will be dead, probably many more than those who were to blame, and we will have stooped to our attackers level. It is true that terrorism is going to be a major hurdle from now on, but upping security and waging a war are not the answers. We must find a more permanent solution, within our Governments treatment of other countries and their policies. The President says that this is an act of war. Why does it have to be? There are so many other answers. \n Sincerely, \n Patrick Liddy Senior, University of Southern Maine. \n spinalapt \n While I, an Australian, feel horror and disbelief at yesterdays events, and excrutiating sympathy with those who seek their loved ones in vain, I am alarmed at the tone of some posts on this forum. \n \"-let us carry on as normal,let us make America even financially greater, more powerful etc. etc\" \n This is the tone that set off the events in the first place - the tone of reactionary fanaticism. \n In time of great crisis, always act as if something DID happen. There are lessons here. I think the people who just want to hug their families, mourn the dead, give thanks for being alive have got it right. \n America has the power to carry out vast military reprisals anywhere. It is America's very power that prompted this attack. \n Being so powerful carries equally great responsibility. The world must change because of this, but change must come from within, not applied in an allopathic military attack in retaliation that could see even more innocent peoples of the world suffer death and destruction. \n If Bush has any sense he will stick to his quietly determined investigatory path, and not inflame the nation with talk of horrific reprisals. \n adelerose \n We have just had a 3 minute silence here in Scotland and it has compelled me to write to let you all know that our thoughts are with you in regard to this terrible devastation throughout the US. \n Also I want to tell you a brief story which not only has touched me personally but which shows the strength, resilience, courage, and thoughtfulness of New Yorkers and the American people as a whole at this extremely challenging time. \n Today was to be my wedding day, I was going to be married at the top of the Empire State Building and then go on for dinner at \"Windows on the World\", the restaurant at the top of the World Trade Center. Our flights were cancelled and our plans ruined, but obviously this is nothing; absolutely nothing, compared to the lives that have been needlessly destroyed, the innocent families torn apart, and the hopes lost due to this terrible act. \n We had someone helping us co-ordinate our wedding plans in NYC and soon after the attacks she contacted us to say how sorry she was our marriage was unable to go ahead! This not only amazed me, but deeply touched me that she was actually concerned about our plans which seemed to me so insignificant compared to the horror that was unfolding in her home city. Added to this we had two bagpipe players that were going to give us a Scottish feel to our proceedings at the top of the ESB. Again the telephone rang in my home on Tuesday night (goodness knows how they got a line out?) and they also let me know how sad they were that our wedding could not take place - this despite the fact that one of their close friends is a fire-fighter who was still missing in the destruction. \n I think this shows us that if these people have the strength, not only to carry on, but to think of others at this time, then we must all have the strength within us to carry on and ultimately never allow terrorism to win any victory over humanity. \n I've requested my fiance\u0301e's bridal bouquet to be placed with the other tributes and candles within the city, but I can assure you that the two of us will travel to NYC this year and have our marriage blessed atop the Empire State. If we were to do otherwise I feel it would be somehow giving these \"people\" and their cowardly acts a small victory. \n Once again our deepest thoughts are with you, and ALL of us in Scotland hope and pray your families and friends are safe and secure. \n God Bless. \n Kerr \n kerr_girvan \n 200,000 Iraqis died during or immediately following the Gulf War. At least a million Iraqis, half of them children, have died as a result of the embargoes since then. \n Osama bin Laden's terrorist training camps were built with American money and backing. \n The commander of the U.S. ship that shot down an Iranian airliner carrying 290 innocent civilians was given a Legion of Merit award for \"outstanding service.\" \n U.S. government has supported terror tactics and totalitarian violence throughout the third world, has consisting moved to destroy any popular movements that would threaten the stability of abusive U.S. economic programs in those countries. \n This week's attack was not an attak on freedom. It was part of a struggle to survive. Was it right? No. Did those people deserve to die? No. But let's not lie to ourselves. Let's be big enough to admit why this is happening. Crying for the lives lost in NY and DC? You should be. It was a tragedy. But, then, try to remember to cry now and then for the countless millions of people we slaughter out of CNN's sight; try to cry for the people we exploit and destroy all across the world. \n jimtzu \n On one hand, I'm shocked by the number of \"blame the U.S.\" and \"it's Israel's fault\" messages posted here over the past few days. On the other hand, I suppose it's comforting that those messages have been posted over and over again by the same four or five knuckleheads whose opinions aren't shared by the vast majority of Americans who are looking for an appropriate way to respond to these attacks. \n I consider myself fairly liberal - never voted Republican in my life - but I'm sure not going to use this time to hang my head and fret over why certain groups hate the U.S. It doesn't matter, not now anyway - there's no excuse for this slaughter. \n originalray \n Dear American friends \n Firstly I want to offer my deepest condolences to those of you that have lost your loved ones in the tragic events that have taken place in your country, and that we witnessed on our TVs while it were happening. Everyone here in Norway is with you in thoughts and payers. \n The Norwegian people have very strong ties, both though friendship and kinship, to you Americans. We chare your ideals of political and religious freedom for all peoples, and through our common history the USA have been our most important ally in safeguarding our political and economical freedom. We therefor regard these malicious attacks on you to be attacks on ourselves as well. We are united with you and will support you and your leaders in whatever way we can in hunting down and bringing those responsible to justice. \n As your friend I would thus like to chare a prayer with you: \n Lord Save us through this difficult period of our lives. Don't let us nourish hatred in our harts, but guide us in making also Arabs and Muslims our friends. We know also they worship you and are your children. Make our politicians acknowledge the words of Jesus Christ - Matthew 5:21-32 and 38-48. \n God blesses us all. \n Magne A. Eek, Oslo, Norway - magne.eek@start.no \n magneeek \n Unspeakable horror has been visited upon innocent civilians in the U.S. I was in a logging camp when the news was announced. At first, I could not believe what I was seeing. Was this an accident? Obviously not, as events progressed, and the south tower was hit. Many of us here in Canada are shocked and saddened. Our hearts go out to all affected. However, the question \"Why?\" was not discussed; it is obvious that these acts are a function of a rage that has been brewing for a long time against the 'powers that be' in America. When Baghdad was bombed I thought it an outrage. The 'surgical strikes' in Kosovo, the materiel provided to terrorize Palestinians, the arrogant stance taken as regards the Kyoto agreement, the abandonment of the Durban anti-rascism conference... the list goes on, a litany of terror and wanton disregard for the welfare of our planet...what the hell did you expect? Which country used nuclear weapons against civilians? 180,000 innocent people flashed out of existence in an eyeblink! Think about it. 42,000 people die on your highways every year, 3.2 million injured. At the same time wrecking the planet's atmosphere. You refuse to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, refuse to assemble against rascism, refuse to end the reign of terror on almost every nation and ecosystem wworldwide. While I do not condone violence as a means to an end, the karma (or lack of it!) the U.S. has gathered must be the reason for these events. Your policy makers have made much of the world your enemies. Perhaps it is time to change, rather than blindly call for revenge and more bloodshed. More killing will not end the cycle of violence. More compassion and understanding will. \n hollymogan \n \u2022 NO ORCHESTRATED SADNESS, PLEASE \n A \u201cNational Day of Mourning\u201d is utterly inappropriate and transparently manipulative. The private feelings people may have in response to recent events are quite sufficient and will, by contrast, be both genuine and proportionate. There has already been enough damage done to the authenticity, humanity, and dignity of Americans by their propagandists and showmen. We do not need more of these hucksters\u2019 hypocritical efforts. \n \u2014 Patrick Gunkel \n pgunkel1 \n The Cockpit Doors Should Be Locked ! I can't get over the thought of the ability to prevent the horror by an easy mechanical solution and simple procedure: 1. The cockpit is to be locked at all times. 2. A double door system is to be installed at the entrance to the cockpit, so that if the pilot needs to go, he doesn't need to compromise item (1) above.

What we saw on our tv screen on Tuesday afternoon here was beyond comprehension, and to echo the sentiments expressed by Tony Blair it truly does feel that we are all together in this. I hope it is of some little comfort to know how appreciated America is in this country, your help and heroism in WW2 has not been forgotten and we only hope that we can in some way now try to repay you for this via support and assistance. On a personal level, this has shaken me so much, although I don't live in America, have never been to America, your country is engrained deeply in Britian and it feels that the foundations of British society have been shaken too. I realise that given the circumstances it may not have been given much coverage in the USA but there was today a service of remembrance in St Pauls, it was so moving and again, I hope it is of some comfort to kknow our thoughts and prayers are with you all. God bless. \n lisaoliver \n Well it's still morning here, and mornings these days are very very tough, they really are. So much to absorb... that almost as quickly as you try you are overwhelmed. I don't know if I can ever go to lower Manhattan again without breaking down. I seesaw between hate and despair... R$% is more defiant. The only consolation we have is our friends, family and the tremendous outpouring of support from around the world... it strikes me as totally amazing. It really helps, thank you, thank you, thank you. \n In todays New York Times was an article about rebuilding... the article ends by saying \"it would be also be nice to have one, maybe even two, new tall towers on the former site to once again anchor the NYC skyline, even larger than the ones they replace\". \n After I read this, I faintly smile and try to imagine what they will be like. \n romjac \n I am extremely concerned about the safety of Arab-Americans and muslims living within the United States during the current crisis. Actually I should expand that to include Sikhs and others who might be mistaken for being Middle Eastern. We have a great many ignorant yahoos in our country who seem to be prepared to engage in physical attacks against people and property belonging to groups they perceive to be different and threatening. I for one will gladly show my solidarity with the local muslim community in my city, if, as now appears sadly to be certain, these incidents escalate in the coming days as the enormity of September 11th sinks in, if need be, I will place myself physically between haters and muslims if this situation gets out of hand. We cannot let this country descend into the sort of barbarism we are trying to defeat!!! Who will join me? \n shuar1 \n The United States of America is a violent country. On the moment they arrived they started killing the native Americans. After that, they have been fighting against the Spanish, the English, and themselves and who reads the history books will see that they have never stopped. There is no decade in which they had not an armed conflict. Of course is the other party to blame for that. Neither it is a free country. Perhaps it is for middle- and higher classes, but the lower classes (a lot larger than for instance in The Netherlands) does not think this way. Two bad - paid jobs or social security of the lowest level is like just not drowning or slavery, it is certainly no freedom. That there are three times as many people in prison compared with the Netherlands can - of course again - not have anything to do with the system. A country were the Law stands higher than moral or ethics, where the most important job is only available for someone who carries lots of money, ideas don't matter anymore. A country that does not allow that their genetic manipulated junk is refused, responsible for 43 % of all the CO2 and is not willing to do anything about it, and there is a lot more. Nevertheless the USA thinks she can tell the world how things are and must be, but every lunatic has the right to think he is God. So far so good. But the USA uses military and economic power for things too easily and too often, and not everyone does like that. So instead of declaring war number-so-many, the USA - population only 5 % of the whole world - could try to pull out her far too large pants on the worlds stage. It would make Osama bin Laden unemployed, and automatically they won't have to fear any terrorist attacks anymore. It is just an idea. \n olfjdudink \n Pgunkel1: \n \"A \u201cNational Day of Mourning\u201d is utterly inappropriate and transparently manipulative....\" \n I'm sorry, as a Mahattanite who feels personally devastated by the attack, that for me, such a day of mourning will surely help all of us to grieve. \n I can't express enough my gratitude for all the heartfelt messages of support from other parts of the country as well as from Europe, Asia etc... it is truly a resounding message that in spite of the sometimes fiercly expressed political/ religeous/theological differrences with the US government, we never, ever were alone and are a cherished member of teh worls family. \n Thank you thank you thank you! \n romjac \n As fate would have it, I was leaving New York on a jet flight that took off 45 minutes before the unthinkable happened. By the time we landed in Detroit, chaos had broken out. When I grasped the fact that American security had broken down so tragically, I couldn't respond at first. My wife and son were also in the air on separate flights, one to Los Angeles, one to San Diego. My body went absolutely rigid with fear. All I could think about was their safety, and it took several hours before I found out that their flights had been diverted and both were safe. Strangely, when the good news came, my body still felt that it had been hit by a truck. Of its own accord it seemed to feel a far greater trauma that reached out to the thousands who would not survive and the tens of thousands who would survive only to live through months and years of hell. And I asked myself, Why didn't I feel this way last week? Why didn't my body go stiff during the bombing of Iraq or Bosnia? Around the world my horror and worry are experienced every day. Mothers weep over horrendous loss, civilians are bombed mercilessly, refugees are ripped from any sense of home or homeland. Why did I not feel their anguish enough to call a halt to it? As we hear the calls for tightened American security and a fierce military response to terrorism, it is obvious that none of us has any answers. However, we feel compelled to ask some questions. Everything has a cause, so we have to ask, What was the root cause of this evil? We must find out not superficially but at the deepest level. There is no doubt that such evil is alive all around the world and is even celebrated. Does this evil grow from the suffering and anguish felt by people we don't know and therefore ignore? Have they lived in this condition for a long time? One assumes that whoever did this attack feels implacable hatred for America. Why were we selected to be the focus of suffering around the world? All this hatred and anguish seems to have religion at its basis. Isn't something terribly wrong when jihads and wars develop in the name of God? Isn't God invoked with hatred in Ireland, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Israel, Palestine, and even among the intolerant sects of America? Can any military response make the slightest difference in the underlying cause? Is there not a deep wound at the heart of humanity? If there is a deep wound, doesn't it affect everyone? When generations of suffering respond with bombs, suicidal attacks, and biological warfare, who first developed these weapons? Who sells them? Who gave birth to the satanic technologies now being turned against us? If all of us are wounded, will revenge work? Will punishment in any form toward anyone solve the wound or aggravate it? Will an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and limb for a limb, leave us all blind, toothless and crippled? Tribal warfare has been going on for two thousand years and has now been magnified globally. Can tribal warfare be brought to an end? Is patriotism and nationalism even relevant anymore, or is this another form of tribalism? What are you and I as persons going to do about what is happening? Can we afford to let the deeper wound fester any longer? Everyone is calling this an attack on America, but is it not a rift in our collective soul? Isn't this an attack on civilization from without that is also from within? When we have secured our safety once more and cared for the wounded, after the period of shock and mourning is over, it will be time for soul searching. I only hope that these questions are confronted with the deepest spiritual intent. None of us will feel safe again behind the shield of military might and stockpiled arsenals. There can be no safety until the root cause is faced. In this moment of shock I don't think anyone of us has the answers. It is imperative that we pray and offer solace and help to each other. But if you and I are having a single thought of violence or hatred against anyone in the world at this moment, we are contributing to the wounding of the world. \n Love, Deepak Chopra \n liberace3 \n Registering with this New York Times Message Board was the only way I could think of to communicate with some of the citizens of New York from a small town in the north of England. \n I merely wanted to say to all who read this that you are not alone. The people of Great Britain are so shocked and horrified by Tuesday\u2019s unspeakable evil, and are with you in our thoughts and prayers. We feel inadequate and impotent, but will stand by America in its hour of need, of that have no fear. No one to whom I have spoken here feels other than these sentiments, and once again I say you are not alone. Forgive me for trespassing on your grief. I pray God you have as individuals, as a city, and a nation, to move out of this valley of death with courage and wisdom and the great dignity you have shown to date. God bless you all. \n Anthony Hartill and Family - Yorkshire, England \n holly2512 \n How can anyone talk of \"...spreading the American Values of reason, individual rights, freedom and capitalism...\" when Americans themselves are opening cabs and yelling death threats at cab drivers,who they presume are Middle Eastern? \n meapale74 \n \"Very good news is coming out regarding world wide cooperation in the war against Radical Terrorism. We may be using Russian bases to launch our attacks upon Bin Laden, one of them inside Afghanistan.\" In other words, we're finally admitting after more than 20 years of denial that the Russians may have been correct in their impulse and desire in 1979 to invade Afghanistan themselves in order to try and prevent a religious-led fanatical beachhead on their own territory. You seem once again to want to mindlessly follow yet another assumed infallibility on the part of our government leaders' wisdom in the decisions they are making on our behalf. Are you also willing to step forward and declare a personal boycott against the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City next year in the aftermath of our Afghanistan invasion? Inconsistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. Cooperation on the part of the Russian government will give them a backdoor into NATO, something they have been seeking for 10 years now. \n sthomas1957 \n The war against terrorism, as was the war against drugs and the war against crime, mere distractions and unfortunately political ploy. We will leave these far behind us. Perhaps we have lost sight, perhaps we have been found lacking. The goal of America as the leader of the free world is to deliver the hope, promise and realization of democracy to those disenfranchised. This is our greatest weapon and our only true shield. Who would hide in the cellar and have their freedoms slowly striped from them in the name of a war against terrorism, when they could be out gaining freedom. This has always been the true meaning of our flag and the sole foundation of America's greatness. America and her allies can no longer lay idle, growing fat on our freedoms, while there exist those who have yet to be delivered theirs. Mr. President, America and all of humanity deserve more than a safe hiding place and you and your office must lead the way. Let freedom reign. \n oslotim \n Germany calling. We were a nation with fundametalist views, fuelled by a 'benign' leader who managed to twist the positive traights of nationhood and uniqueness to a religion in it's own right. Our young turned against others (Note Muslim against Chinese business in Indonesia) in violence and the underclass were steered towards war. The fundamentalist Muslim growth seems to have frightning parrallels to the growth of the Third Reich. It abuses the idea of religion and sulies all. The recent terror attacks are an act of war against the concept of peace. I ask those of knowledge to please not let us yet again turn back to the errors of our past. Fat chance...but nice thought. \n phoenix41 \n The terrorists are about as Muslim as David Korsh was christian. They say they are Muslim/christian, their are many who would agree that they are Muslim/christian with a lot of conviction, but they all violate central tennants of the religions out of ego and convinience. \n yog_sothoth \n I am sickened by the Christian fundementalist response from Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson these 2 sick twisted individuals actualy blame the people hurt by this saying that \"god\" allowed this to happen because we are not following Jerry and Pat's idea of religion. It is this kind of bizzare religious dogma which brought the attackers to the point where they felt rightious in causing this tragedy. My heart goes out to all of those killed and hurt by this action and I have forgivness in my heart for those who caused this tragedy, I have disdain and anger for people like Falwell and Robertson and only hope any followers they have finally see what dangerous and misguided people they are. They certainly do not have a Christian bone in there bodies. May Peace prevail. \n jaygogan \n As an American citizen who works in downtown Washington and was forced to evacuate during the recent crisis, I am aghast at the horror which some human beings are willing and able to inflict upon others. Since these awful attacks, there has been much talk of showing the spirit of America and coming together as a nation. Yet in these same few days there have been reports of some of the most un-American and cowardly acts I can conceive of. Namely, the desecration and vandalism of Mosques and Muslim and Arab owned stores around the nation, and the harassment of Muslim and Arab American citizens of this great nation. As a school child I was taught that one of America\u2019s lowest moments was the interment of Japanese Americans during World War Two. Today\u2019s attacks on the civil rights and dignity of Arab Americans have shown the same ugly face that so many hoped we had left behind. \n I am also an Israeli citizen and served my tour of duty in the military there, including one year spent in then occupied Southern Lebanon. I have seen the face of terror and lost friends to its cold hand. If America and Americans want to truly stand up to terror and those that would demean and destroy our country, then we must not let them drag us down into the realm of bigotry and injustice. As someone who has held a rifle in his hand in the time of war, I too seek justice and crave retribution, but I will not stand silently by and watch righteous fury applied in an unjust manner. \n These attacks against the Arab and Muslim American community should be condemned with the same furor that we apply to the bombings of African American churches in the South, attacks against the Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, and all other hateful acts of violence and prejudice. We Americans need to stand together in this time of National crisis, not as Christians, Jews, or Muslims, but as one great nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. \n Hadar Susskind "}, {"text": "Selections From the U.S. Attacked Forum\n2001-09-13T05:00:00.000Z\n On Tuesday, September 11, the NYTimes.com's Readers' Opinions area opened a forum for readers from around the world to share their thoughts on the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Here is a selection of comments, excerpted from the forum's first three days. They range from outpourings of sympathy and grief to eyewitness accounts, to analyses of what to do next. \n They - we - weren't soldiers. We're just tourists and service and office workers... now many are gone in a war that they never thought about. Unspeakable... pray for those we knew and those we didn't know... those tourists and service and office workers that are us. \n mikejacobs \n I \u0301m writing these words from Spain, and I think that today, all the Europeans and all the citizens of the world (or the civilized people), are Americans. I \u0301m sure that we feel this awful terrorist attack, as an agression to our common way of life, and I \u0301m sure that together, we will win. I hope that the guilty/ies pay a terrorific price for this action. God bless America. \n franciscomunoz2 \n In all tragedies, even the greatest ones, we must seek comfort in the goodness that inevitably arises. When I heard that there were people waiting in line for 4 or 5 hours to give blood, saw footage of people helping each other remain safe, heard about the police officers and firefighters who gave up their lives trying to protect people, and even when reading messages on these forums, where people who are normally at each others throats put aside their differences to say \"I'm glad you are okay\", it was things like that that made me realize that people still have plenty of goodness in theri hearts. At times like this, we need to stand together, putting aside all political, religious, and ethnic differences and help each other get through this very difficult time. \n I have received good news that my friends and family members are okay. I have heard other people say they received similar good news. I hope many more people get that same good news. \n Normally, I can't stand Giuliani, and I have criticized him many times over the past 8 years. But yesterday, he came across as the most rational person I saw on TV or heard on the radio all day. He knows that we are strong enough to get through this, and we will. He encourages people to remember that we need to focus on the individuals who were responsible for this mess, not the people who may share their ethnicity. \n On that note, Wshort, you are correct. I fear there will be some backlash against totally innocent people. I work next door to a 7-11, and many of the people who work there are Palestinians. They are friendly, decent, hard-working people who I fear may be targetted by some yahoo who thinks he will be making a point. I hope things like that don't happen, anywhere! \n A few minutes ago, I went outside for the first time this morning. I could smell a faint hint of smoke in the air, but otherwise, it was a beautiful, sunny day with glorious blue skies. It just doesn't seem right. \n It's time for me to head off to work. I want to wish all of you a very safe day, and remember...we are going to get through this. \n urbanshock1 \n Being a citizen of the United Kingdom, I would like to express mine and my family's sincerest condolences to all the victims and their families of this atrocity. My thoughts go out to you and your proud country. \n simon0071 \n If anything even remotely good comes out of this appalling tragedy, it has to be that America learns she must relinquish her role as the bullying policewoman of the planet. It is superpower, superdominant behavior that leads to tragedies like these. \n gemister2000 \n I am from Poland. It is hard to believe... It is terrible tragedy that has hit USA and indeed the rest of the world. It is attack for our freedom. World never been the same... I and my friends from Poland would like to extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to the victims, employees, families and friends. \n yoosti \n I thought I was taking a Path train to the WTC but I got off in a war zone... \n heyerjm \n We have to understand...when you trade freedom for safety, you get neither....Americans need to decide whether they want to wait 2 hours for a flight, be searched every time they are on a plane...have no carry on baggage.....and pay for sky marshalls..are we will to pay more for airline travel? Do we want to wait, be searched all the time? We have to decide, but dont let anyone do it for us...especially the punks who did this stunt.... \n bszemere \n I want to give my condolences to the American people over this tragedy that caused so many innocent lives. With horror and inmense sorrow I have watched the towering inferno in that wonderful building I was last year enjoying that wonderful city of New York and the view over the city and the Statue of Liberty. I hope that the people responsible for this will be found and brought to justice and I sincerely hope that my government, I am Dutch, will give the US government every help they possibly can, even if this has to be military. My country owes the US to stand by her side after the US stood by the side of Europe in our darkest period, World War II and the economic crisis afterwards. Again my condolences to a nation in mourning, to people who have lost spouses, children, mothers and fathers, to people who have lost colleagues and my prayers are with those few people who were lucky enough to escape but are now fighting for their lives in the hospitals of New York. \n amgeel \n I'm from Russia. We were shocked when two years ago several houses were exploded and many people died.. And now it repeats and it's much more horrible than it was! I can't understand what makes people doing this to others, and I cannot express my feelings.. What horror, oh my God!! \n Dear Americans! Hold on! Try to live further. We all are with you and we sympathize you. \n irina_mew \n Hi, this is Silvie from Germany. Me and my family would like to assure you (and the American people) that we are very shocked about what happened not only to NY and Washington but also to the whole civilized world. People here are very sad about this, take flowers to the American embassy, go to church, say prayers for the victims and their families and so on. We mourn with you! We hope very much that the democratic countries will manage one day to stop terrorism. And if we want to do so we can only do it TOGETHER!!! \n So let \u0301s try to elect the people who can help us do this best! \n We pray for you, \n Silvie and family (9 persons), Nettetal (North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany) \n silvie2 \n I propose we each endeavor to: \n \u00a7 Recognize the fact that all Americans are our fellow citizens and are part of the national family. \n \u00a7 Uphold the ideals of justice, confidence, and grace as much as it is within our power as individuals. \n \u00a7 Resolve, in our commitment to battle terrorism, not to be prejudicially fearful or hostile to the other citizens of the world, but to regard them as siblings in the family of man, and as such, to treat them with the justice and dignity deserved of every person upon the earth. \n Finally, let us show that though we are proud to be American, we remain citizens of the world, grateful for our role as the leading republic in the struggle for democratic principles. Let us show the world that we remain steadfast in our commitment to uphold the democratic principles of our founding. \n I am certain that there is nothing this nation cannot do when all of its people are united. \n hudson1486 \n As a last year`s exchange student from Germany staying in Toledo/Ohio, I would like to express my condolescences about the terrible actions against America and the democratic system of the free world that took place yesterday. I surely can tell you that not only me but the whole German and all of the other European nations stand behind you. \n I really had such a great time when I stayed in America and got to know so many nice and friendly people. It is such a tragedy to see how many of these open-hearted American people have died now. \n I cannot remember having ever seen something as cruel and sad. I still cannot believe what I saw, I never had expected reality being so extreme and cruel. \n Yesterday evening I went to the American embassy in Frankfurt and there were lots of hundreds of people laying down flowers and mourning. It was so sad. I hope noone of you has personal losses to claim. \n Today, there will be a \"march of mourning\" through the city of Frankfurt where hundreds of thousands of people will be expected. \n I am sure your nation will recover from these acts but it will take a long time and the world will never be like what it was before. \n Andreas Schuster \n aschuster77 \n FROM ARGENTINA,my heart is with you,I pray for you my soul bleeds for you and your great people. MY DAUGHTER was just made an AMERICAN CITIZEN and she is expecting her baby October 18.So there will be one more proud little American citizen soon. \n martinbeck3 \n We just want to tell the people of New York, particularly those who have lost loved ones or have suffered through yesterday's traumatic experiences, that our thoughts and sympathies are with you from Bristol, England. This is an unbelievably horrible thing. \n vivamus \n I'm not a New Yorker, but I almost feel like one. In the few days I spent in New York, I felt like home. Now, that the unbelivable happened, I'm still stuned. I hope Y'all have the power and strength to become once again the city I love. (I still can't imagine the skyline without the Twins...) I offer my fullest condolances to all of you. Andras, from Budapest, Hungary \n akaakiraly \n Hello New Yorkers , I'm a student from India, heard about the massive attacks on WTC and Pentagon.We, the Indians are always with you. We are just a call away.God will punish the attackers. We are from such a place where love and peace are our best friends.But in spite of this we are having inhuman activities from the terrorists in the north-west border line.So we can feel your grief. I am feeling guilty in my inability to do anything to the victims in Ny and Pentagon.You are not alone in your sympathies.We , the rest of the world , were, are ,will be with you. Good bye America. God Bless you. Have a nice day.Love you. \n Diptendu ( On behalf of the Indian students who love USA). God bless you. \n binayak17 \n Yes, we will exact the heaviest of prices. Yes, thousands upon thousands will die. To be sure, the full might of our country will effect the twin goals of retribution and deterence. Suffice it to say, the geopolitical landscape will not look the same. \n I can only hope that, as a country, we respond to this horror, this tragedy, will cool intellect and not rascist rage. I greatly fear an anti-arab backlash much like the anti Japanese backlash which occurred after Pearl. Now we know just how wrong it was to lump every japanese together; I hope we can learn from that lesson. There are millions upon millions of Arabs and Arab-Americans who condemn this act, and all acts like it. \n We are Americans, not bigots. We will fight. But it must be the good fight, and in so doing, we must never forget what made, and makes us, strong. \n mhamaway \n It was a harrowing day from many families yesterday. I was turned back as I tried to commute into work yesterday. As I got home, my neighbor's wife came out crying. Her husband worked on 49th flr of 2WTC and she had just watched it collapse. \n He finally was able to call around 2:30 PM and the sigh of relief was palpable. \n Our condolences to all the families still waiting...Good Luck! \n mayank17 \n The west windows of my workplace in downtown Brooklyn look directly at downtown Manhattan. From a sense of accomplishment at having cast our early-morning votes in a free, democratic election we went to horror and shock as we literally watched this terror unfold before our eyes. Almost equally distressing this morning was seeing footage of young children's being encouraged to laugh and rejoice at such a horrible act, the bitter fruit of hatred and ignorance. We must not only offer love to the innocent and brave victims, but do everything we can to stop the corruption of young minds the world over--in this country no less than elsewhere, no matter what the ostensible \"cause\". Peace, please. \n sazsa \n It's chilling to hear our Secretary of State and other top government officials echoing a reprise of the very same thing this government itself condemned only twenty years earlier: invading Afghanistan. Must we become monsters ourselves in order to combat wickedness and evil around the rest of the world? \n sthomas1957 \n A CALL FOR HELP In the wake of yesterday's terrible tragedy there is a group of often forgotten victims: the PETS and ANIMALS of those who can never return home to care for them. Many dogs, cats, birds, horses, etc. may be stranded without food, water or other care in apartments, homes, or barns of the single people who lost their lives yesterday. If you have a friend, neighbor, or family member who was among those taken suddenly and senselessly yesterday, please honor their memory and most certainly their wishes by seeing that the animals dependent upon their care continue to have their needs met. Many animals shelters are already filled beyond capacity. Please consider adopting a now homeless animal and allowing the spirit and love of those lost to live on through the animals they loved and cherished. \n bluzstar77 \n We need to recognize that people like Osama bin Laden can not operate without the cooperation and assistance of the international financial community. This was a well coordinated and financed attack. 3-5 hijackers per plane, some had New Jersey driver's licenses. Someone internationally is making money off of financing bin Laden's estimated fortune of $ 300-400 million. It is time to go after the financiers of terror, especially the Swiss. They have been making money for years off of the misery of others, all the while pretending that they are just financial managers. If you cut out the money, the terrorists could not do this kind of stuff. And it is time for the international community to quit pretending that money is anonymous. It is time to go after the Swiss and shut down the banking practices that make attacks like this possible. \n keithalanj \n Words are inadequate to express the horror I feel at these cowardly attacks. My sincere sympathy to the bereaved and to the injured. So many times have I experienced such cowardly terrorist attacks here in N.Ireland over 30 years. If I may appeal to the American people,and others, not to support Terrorism/IRA, politically or financially,and think that every $ is a bullet into a human being, your brother or sister. May God be with you all, in this time of need. \n strangford \n First and most importantly, sincere condolences to all who have lost loved ones in yesterday's unprecedented tragedy. Yet, in light of the turn of events, a most unfortunate misconception is befalling many of my friends and myself. The many men and some women who wear turbans in the New York Metro area and beyond, are SIKHS. We are not Moslems. As I live in an area with a large Orthodox Jewish population, a feeling of hatred and contempt is not difficult to discern as I walk down the street. Sikhs are not Moslems. Sikhs are not Hindus. Sikhs are Sikhs and twice daily we pray for the welfare of all peoples. We too, are not strangers to religious and political persecution. Please do not judge people by their outer appearance. Please do not judge any people - leave that to God. \n hkkaur \n As an Australian who has visited and loves NYC, all I can do is offer my heart-felt condolences to all involved in this horrific tragedy. I do know, however that you will survive, because you are New Yorkers! \n egrantsk \n Memo to the people of NY: People in Houston are lining up for hours to donate blood in the event you need it. It's the first thing we can do to help, and I have a feeling y'all will need it. Mayor Lee Brown first asked for Houstonians to go out and do it. When I left at 1:00, Tommy Thompson was asking all Americans to donate. I got to one of the many donations centers at about 1:30; it was wall to wall people, and about ten outside filling out forms. When I left at 5:00, bandage on my left elbow, there were 50 people outside with two news trucks. The Blood Center said they would stay open until the donors stopped coming in. Food was being donated left and right for the donors and employees. I'd imagine it was a long night last night for them. \n Help is coming. . .I hope you can hold on. All our thoughts and prayers are with you through this difficult time. \n And to the rest of you: we are not Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans, Polish-Americans, African-Americans, whatever. We're Americans, and we've ALL been attacked. Thank you. \n amyred3 \n I was in school, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, when the news hit---just ten to twenty minutes after the first plane crashed, I believe. The first time I heard, I thought it was just some kid's idea of a joke, until our teacher started telling us that school was still open and we were all to remain in class. And then, kids began excusing themselves to go talk to their parents, my friends came up to me and started panicking, and in my next class, the teacher didn't even try to give a lesson---instead, he pulled out a hand-cranked radio and we started listening to the news, interrupted by loudspeaker announcements calling people up to the auditorium to speak to their parents. It felt like I was in those stories of World War II, like hiding in a bomb shelter not knowing what was going to happen next. \n Afterwards, we heard that public transportation was shut down, we weren't allowed out of the building to get lunch, all the bridges were closed, and many of us who lived in the outer boroughs had no way of getting home. People who lived in upper Manhattan opened their homes to those who could not get home. Many had to leave school early. We were told to sign out at the lobby of the school, so that they could keep track of us and where we went. At last the subways opened, and my parents came to a friend's house where I was staying and brought me home. Others however had to walk over the bridge and wait for cars to pick them up or stayed overnight in Manhattan. \n It was one of the most bewildering and most bizarre experiences I ever had. One of my friends attended another school, one that was near the World Trade Center, and we had heard rumours about the school being on fire. We wanted to know whether she was all right, but we simply couldn't remember the number of her new cell phone. The noise, the confusion, the vague anxiety about something though we weren't sure what... \n There were other stories: a girl had ran back to her apartment on the thirty-fourth floor and took pictures of the New York skyline, with huge gaping hole where the Twin Towers used to be, an older student was crying in the hallway because a person she knew worked on one of the very top floors of the World Trade Center, the smoke that could be seen down Madison Avenue even up to Ninety-Fourth street... \n Of course, we all immediately speculated on who it was. There is a large Jewish population at our school and the PLO was mentioned more than once. Some people were shouting angrily that the Palestinians were cheering in the streets. Even if you didn't suspect the PLO, everyone certainly agreed that it was the work of Arab terrorists. Osama bin Laden was another name, and apparently our personal suspicions were shared by the government itself. We are considered \"gifted\" students, so we immediately began a wild host of know-it-all speculations about the U.S. response, the impact on American politics, the reason why we were attacked now. But the questions of \"Who did this?\" paled in comparison to questions of \"Is my mother okay?\" or \"Are we going to be alive tomorrow?\" \n For one day, the usual energetic and mundane bustle of the schoolday disappeared, to be replaced by a sense of crisis. But even that soon gave way to concerns about getting home, about finishing our homework for tomorrow. I never understood the meaning of resilience until I saw people in hysterics for one moment suddenly calm down and start eating their lunch the next. \n I have no dramatic observations or detached expressions of condolence or even political commentary to make. I didn't even see the pictures of the towers collapsing until the end of the day, despite the fact that I was in Manhattan when it happened. Living in the same city, it still feels like something that just happened somewhere else. But yesterday, for me, is still unforgettable, because it's the day that a war began and I was affected. \n glasperlenspiel1 \n What can be said about the events of yesterday...words can never describe it. People here in Ireland are as stunned and silenced as those in the US. People all over Europe still react as if it all has taken place in a surreal movie. Hard to believe it has happened yet it says so in every newspaper on on TV. The fact that the main tragedy took place in New York touches not only the lives of those who were born in America but also those who live there. New York was never an American city in the same way as Boston or Dallas. No where on earth is there a more multi-cultural and multi-ethnic melting pot. By attacking New York, the US will not share its grief alone. The pain will be spread through Ireland, the UK, Spain, Eygpt, Somalia, China, the list could easily take in every nation of the world. Every nation is affected. Every people affected. What has changed by the act of barbarisim no one will truly know. All I know is that two weeks ago both myself and my friends stood beside those streets and today stare at the TV wondering if this is all for real. \n But I would caution to watch for the lies ( see some previous messages ), the half truths, the recriminations. No nation could plan this, no people who have suffered could allow such an act to happen. Only the insane who hide behind some mask of convienence could plan such an act as only the insane could carry it out. \n My deepest condolances New York. \n flahertyg \n I was sitting on a NYC subway train at Chambers Street when the conductor announced a delay due to \"police activity\" at the Cortland Street Station (World Trade). It sounded like a fairly common event - a sick passenger, or a minor arrest; something that might cause a few minute delay. I now know that it was the first of the planes had hit. \n The train continued on to the Wall Street stop and I got out at William and Wall St., a few blocks east of the Trade Center. Upon exiting the station at about 9:04/9:05 the air was filled with papers, almost like a ticker-tape parade, except that it was accompanied by a thick plume of black smoke and the cloud of papers were business sized sheets . When a piece of something fairly heavy fell right next to me I realized that seeking cover would be a good idea, and even though I knew it already it was something horrible, this shocked me out of the \"wow it looks like a movie\" mode into a state of subdued shock. \n After staring up for as long as my stomach could bear it, with what may have been a million others I got caught up in a migration of people north, away from the buildings. There was a sense of something very different - a great migration of people in shock. The crowd was orderly and helpful (made me proud to be a New Yorker - we moved here 5 years ago and I have often felt I was an outsider, almost proud to be from \"up north\". Now I am from New York. \n On the way out on the far east side of Manhattan Island several buildings and businesses opened their doors to the \"migrants\". I needed a toilet and was escorted into the Tenement Museum on the Lower East side where they offered water, sandwiches and use of their facilities. \n I walked uptown, 7 or 8 miles with my back to the scene most of the time not really wanting to look and quite honestly already in the beginning of a grief process first for the people in and around the buildings, for my City and certainly for the Country and the world. \n It's hard to imagine who could consider that the world will be a better place for this. I'll confess a certain complacency (and denial) as to how my Country has conducted its foreign affairs. We may have made enemies that I did not consider my enemy. That was then. I sense the sleeping giant is awake as many of us, myself included, know we have an enemy. I know I am angry. I doubt that any of the creatures who are responsible for this care and fear may be a human trait that they have left behind. I am confident of one thing. They have changed my world and I am determined that I (and many other Americans) will do whatever we can to change theirs. \n richardsf \n New Yorkers, you should all be very proud of your brave firefighters, police officers and other rescue team members, as well as the doctors, nurses and hospital staffers who have done and continue to do such a wonderful job helping the injured in your great city. \n And Mayor Giuliani, whatever else you might think of him, conducted himself with strength, calm and compassion. \n Really, you should all be very proud of yourselves for the way NY reacted to this despicable attack. New York is still the greatest city in the world. \n For my part, here in Cincinnati, I'll be giving blood today. I hope it helps. \n originalray \n I came in from a jog and turned on the tv to see tower 1 burning. I ran to the roof of my building in the west village. As I arrived I saw the second plane hit. People on the roof panicked and ran about. We all watched as bodies fell from the buildings. My cell phone rang- it was my mother in tears checking on me and also to tell me my brother was on a flight that morning from La Guardia and my neice had just started a new job at the WTC. I panicked. It was not until an hour and a half that my neice called and that she was fine. My brother was on a Chicago bound flight and promptly rented a car and drove back to New York. Now I am at my office and we are calling patients who we know worked at the WTC. There are too many answering services picking up. \n franch2 \n It is amazing to read through these messages and see more than half of them as being sensible. I appluade the rational of thought here and laugh until I cry at the pasties that keep jumping like gibbons about war declarations. \n I will no longer run with three of my friends, but they would have loved to see some of this posts. \n enough74 \n We should not play blaming games on tragedies of such scale. We should go after the perpetrators with iron fists. However, we should think deeply after we get them. What's the underlying reasons for this attack? Why would people take their own lives to do this? What can we do to prevent people from even attempting such acts? \n The CIA and the FBI spend enough money each year already. Our defense budget is more than the rest of the world combined. Obviously enhancement in those agencies is not going to solve the problem. If we double the CIA's capacity, we may get more terrorist attempts foiled. But some still will succeed. We have to make the idea to terrorism disappear. \n Most of the attack attempts against us are from the Arab world. The obvious question is the effectiveness of our Middle East policy. \n orientalexpress \n I'm from Saudi and I feel sorry for this tragedy. Unfortunaly I listend to Sen. Orrin Hatch saying every Plaestinian rejoice the tragedy should be punished!! I feel sorry for what hapenned, but everybody should understand the feelings of those doing this. Innocent civlians, including kids & women in the occupied areas in Palestine are being killed everyday by American F16s, American Apaches, American guns and misslies!!!!! Everyday. Everyday, with full American blessing. So, don't blame those people if they go crazy, they think there isn't a fair just world around them. America is a wonderful country, they just need to act more honestly and deal more responsbiley in the middle east. God bless the killed lives anywhere in the world. I belief Israel should be hold responsible for what happenned in NY. God bless America. \n romamanus \n We are neighbors and like all neighbors we have had our disagreements in the past but in times of distress we offer you our full support and assistance. \n We are so sorry for what has happened. How can we help? How can we be there for you? Our blood donor clinics have been swamped with people giving blood and our rescue units are on stand by. Can we provide clothing or donate money for the rescue effort? Please let us know what we can do. \n We send our love and sympathy to the families and friends who have lost loved ones. \n The world changed forever on September 11, 2001. The world will never foreget. \n From your friends in Canada. \n T.M. Wilson Edmonton, Alberta \n 56word \n Let me just say that this attack is innumerable times worst than the attack carried out by Japan on Pearl Harbor seen how the Japanese targeted military bases and not defenseless civilians. \n On days like these I am glad a large chunk of my taxes go to a defense budget, and I really hope some of it goes into so called \"black-budgets ops\" as conspiracy theorists will have us believe. \n Let us NOT let the perpetrators of this crime think that they have in ANY WAY made us isolationists or afraid. If anything, it has made us more resolute to defend our way of life. And the changes in our congress that will be seen in the upcoming weeks should only be to RETALIATE until crows and maggots eat the scorched flesh of the last coward affiliated to these maniacs. \n As I went to work out of the city and became aware of what was happening my first concern was of my wife who is attending school close to the twin towers. \n Fortunately we were all running late today in getting ready for the day so I knew it was unlikely she, or her train were close to the area at the time it happened. But as I saw the catastrophe it only made me more resolute to contribute in any way to the expunging of these ignorant, zealous idiots. \n It is amazing how this city has pulled together. Everyone helping each other out. \n Let whoever did this know THIS: there are still another 200-something million Americans who live and work for the BEST economy in the world! A nation that through wise use of its intellectual and material resources has become the envy of the world! 1/2 or more of those Americans pay a high percentage of their earnings in taxes, which mostly go into defense. A defense, which we all hope will act to let all those who contributed to this directly or indirectly know how erroneous a step it was. They may have hurt a few tens of thousands personally. They may have set the nation on a real recession, because the logistical and budgetary nightmare coming up to rebuilt the nation will be THAT, a nightmare. But all of it, to the last scratch, will only serve to make us more resolved to scorch those responsible off the face of the Earth. \n And we will recuperate, and we will look back at a different skyline of NYC. Nevertheless, it will be prosperous all the same, and what is best, we will know that those responsible for today's actions will not be around to see it thanks to us being determined in defending our way of life. \n The only thing they have done is really waken up the bigotry, ignorance and hatred of some Americans who will now make living in this nation difficult for those who are seen as ethnically-related to those who committed this crime. And the toll and shock of what's happened is so great that very few conscientious Americans will stop it. And for those I am sorry. \n ogodei \n You don't see Americans dancing in the street when innocent people are killed in Palestine. We don't hand out candy. We don't cheer when bombs go off, tanks plow under their buildings, or children are killed in a crossfire. \n Honestly, the U.S. is the only thing holding the Israelis back from completely annilating the Palistinians. \n But it's nice to know who our real friends are, and it will be counted. \n entheogen \n I am a New Yorker living in Germany and I was watching TV and was horrified at the site of the Twin Towers just crumbling down like that. I can't stop crying and mourning for those people. I have family that was right in the middle of it and one said that he saw the people jumping out of the windows. I just can't believe what happend. Ny will never be the same NEVER. Nor will the US. A new chapter in history was just written, and sadly enough it was of tradgedy. My prayers are with the family members of those in the Aircraft and in the towers, and slo in the pentegon. Words cannot express what we are all feeling. God Bless everyone! September 11th will never be forgotten by me it is my birthdate. I celebrate life as others mourn the lives of others. \n latinacipriaso \n My husband worked on the 36th floor of 2 World Trace. If he had not called me immediately after he got out of the office after the first crash, I would have experienced a horrible waiting period!!! I thank God for His protecting hands upon my husband. By the way, I was outraged about the phote on today's (9/12/01) New York Times page A7, the photo of a man falling headdown from the tower. I find it very distastful and insensitive to the families of the victims!!! What if the family of this man recognized him on the photo? I just pray none of his family recognize him. My prayer goes to this man's family, and the families of other vicitims. May God comfor their heart. \n buccigm \n As a muslim, I condemn this terrorist attack, and I'm really surprised that some say that it is Arabs and Muslims who are behind these acts, because in the Quran \"Our Holy Book\", it is forbidden to kill innocent people, and those who are killed yesterday were all innocent, and all Arabs and Muslims are agianst these acts, cause it will serve nobody. Some would say that Arab hatred against the U.S. has reached its maximum these days, but this hatred is actually against the U.S. policies in the Middle East and not against innocent people in the U.S. or anywhere in the world. No one would beleive that a true muslim is happy when hearing about the attacks, because in our religion it is FORBIDDEN to kill innocent people. And if few persons went to streets to celebrate when hearing about the attacks they thought again and again and discovered that all the victims are innocent people who have nothing to do with politics, they are normal people going to their work as any other day. But we have to remember in this day, the children and innocent people who are killed everyday in this world in Palestine, Iraq, and now in the United States of America. May God bless all those who are killed in the U.S., Palestine, and Iraq. And may God help us building a better future all around the world. I offer my condolences and my deepest sorrow to all those who are killed in New York and their families and may God help them. And all the best of luck for those who are injured. \n mlattouf \n I have lived in New York for only a year - but have come to love it like most New Yorkers do. This morning, as I walked down a deserted 5th Avenue, and looked up at the dust cloud where there used to be those monoliths, all I could think of was \"What have they done to my city?\" It felt exactly as if someone I loved had been mugged and beaten up, and I guess many of us in this city feel the same way. \n I am Indian, and this is not the first time something like this is happening to me. We have suffered for years at the hands of Islamic fundamentalists, sponsored by Pakistan and the Taliban. People in India have come to accept terror as a way of life, 20 bombs simultaneously going off in Bombay and killing thousands was just another incident. Heavy security has been accepted as a part of life. A hundred deaths does not raise eyebrows any more. Maybe just a little prayer, hoping that we are not victims of the next such incident. A peace-loving people who have never truly known peace. \n Let this not happen here. The constant struggle for peace is a tiring thing, and even though New Yorkers and Americans will never again take peace for granted, let them at least not have the spectre of terror constantly hanging over their heads. Retaliate with all you can, wipe these madmen out of existence. And one billion people in India will be cheering you, and uttering prayers of thanks. \n legolas1 \n Isn't it intersesting that footage of a few palestinians (most of them children) celebrating was shown to millions and all of a sudden the conclusion is reached that 'the palestinians' rejoice in the death of americans? Is it any wonder that 'they' hate americans because of the same ignorant stereotyping that most of the people on here seem to be exibiting. My heart and prayers go out to the families of those killed and hurt and missing, and I feel a profound anger and feeling of helplessness, but it makes me want to see the people RESPONSIBLE for this unspeakable act punished appropriately, it does not make me write off a people in hate. \n colches \n I am from India and our whole nation condems this dastardly acts of crime commited by people who claim that it's a 'Jehad'. \n People in the States now must be feeling the same pangs of anger that we Indians feel when ever terrorists strike and kill our people in the name of obtaining freedom for a non-existent country. \n I appeal to all the people of the States, that not only strict action be taken against those who actually carried out the crime but against also those countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq etc. who harbour such sadist criminals in the name of religion. \n Once again my condolances to all those who have lost their near and dear ones. We stand by you in this hour of grief. \n bappa \n Now the media has picked up on the term \"At War\". If this editorial incompetence continues we will find ourselves securely in the arms of neo-facism. We are not at war. It was a terrorist attack using our own civilian systems of transportation. We are not and never have been invaded, nor have we faced militarily led attack. Let's stay focused here. I refuese to belive that this requires military intervention. \n stephennnn \n Dang it all to heck, but while Mr Bush may personally be a Christian ... America is not a \"Christian nation\"!!! \n Please stop claiming that it is such. \n kwicklund \n I visited NYC in 67, when the WTC was under construction. The city was a little too much for me and when I left, I had no intention of returning. But after watching yesterday's tragedy unfold on national TV, I have reconsidered my point of view. The people of NYC have got to be the greatest people in the world! Their cooperation and help in searching for survivors, their strength, and their pride were inspirational to the rest of the world! We on the west coast stand with you. We hurt with you. God bless you, the citizens of New York. I now look forward to the day in which I will return to your Great City!!! Bob Weber, Fresno, California \n rwebman \n Interesting that Phil Gramm wants to renounce the ban on the assasination of world leaders. Does he have someone in particular in mind? What mindless chatter. I was glad to hear Colin Powell dismiss such crazy notions. At the moment, Powell seems to be the only reasonable federal official speaking on the crisis. Maybe we should ask for a gag order on Congress. \n gintaras_2k \n I have read some of the postings and I see we'er off and running. I would first like to express my condolences to those who lost love ones in this tragedy. There is no excuse for what was done. Unfortunately all we're getting from our appointed president is platitudes and bs. The race card, as in Arabs, has been played by the right wing. It's been picked up by the media and they're running with it. This democratic society(as we have seen by the last election) may find it difficult to deal with this one. Justice(hopefully not like what was handed out by the five stooges of the Supreme Court in the last election) should be swift. \n Given what we know we can't move too quickly. We know that the airline industry is concerned with our safety. Some of their entry level pilots, at least for American Airlines, make as little as $13,000 a year and qualify for welfare. We can safely say we have welfare receipients piloting our planes. That is known as multinational corporate caring for safety program perhaps developed by the IMF or WTO. \n Now let's say that the Arab terrorist are responsible. Of course these are different than those in the Okalahoma bombing. You do remember those Arab terrorists? Now let's say it's that Osuma guy. Now let's say he was trained by the CIA. Now we know they wouldn't have trained him in flying state of the art airliners just to terrorize the Russians for invading Afghanistan. Now let's say that we're not technically responsible for the terror he commited because we only trained him and sent him on his way. Where do we start on that one? \n Hold it! Don't go away! Now let's say that we allowed our tax dollars to be used to recruit and train terrorists in Chile and Salvador, just to get our monies worth out of the School of the America's, not to mention Gaza and the Far East. Along with this let's say we generated between 10 to 100,000 orphans some who may have organized to express their appreciation for the forign aid we sent to them and their love ones. WHO COULD THESE EVIL PEOPLE BE who did this to us and where will we start to make them pay? \n paread \n It is my fervant hope that we will deal with this tragedy not only with retaliation(because violence begets more violence), but with things positive and constructive, so that the dead and injured would not be in vain. So that the perpetuators, and those that think to follow after them will understand that they cannot win. So that the perpetuators, and those who seek to follow after them, will finally understand that humanity and justice can, and will, be above religion, nation and ideology. So that the perpetuators, and those who seek to follow after them, will finally understand that the world will never tolerate this kind of action---and will do whatever it takes to end it. So that all of this will serve as a source of inspiration, action and understanding, that this world, and the peace that we all seek, will not perish. \n osec23 \n \u201cI am afraid that as a Christian Nation, with a Christian President we are about to be put to the test.\u201d \n I am filled with sorrow but not hatred. \n I think we have to retaliate, with reflection on our foreign policy flaws or not. It is a matter of credibility for the future. But we must retaliate responsibly with proof and with restraint against killing the innocent to get even. \n Practically speaking, I think we can vastly reduce the chance of similar occurrence: a civilian plane being used as a missile. Pilots are to be locked into the cockpit during all flights; no exceptions. And we can reinforce the door and walls to the cockpit. \n We MUST gradually but surely reflect on our foreign policy misdirection, however. \n These terrorists were fanatical and rabid, but they were NOT cowardly. In fact, they were quite brave, quite courageous for what they believe in. Is this not quite obvious? \n This bigoted cry of \u201cwe as a Christian nation\u201d and \u201cChristian President\u201d is the vivid symbol of our blind-spot. \n While I would condom the public use of nondescript words like \u201cprayers\u201d, I fervently object to Bush\u2019s citation of scriptures from the Bible during last nights speech intended for ALL Americans. This grotesque insensitivity to non-Christians or the non-religious in this country is quite symptomatic of and causative to our foreign policy bias toward Israel, a Judio-Christian state. \n The religious display in Congress is just as insensitive, just as bigoted, and just as symptomatic of and causative to our problem and blind-spot\u2014and now grief. \n Can we keep religion OUT of the public and (hence) remove religious biases toward those who are religiously more similar and against those who are more dissimilar with the private religious conviction of most Americans? \n jeffchurch1 \n A Young Girls Words \n It makes me sad that I'm now in fear of walk in to a public building or any place like that. I can't get out of my mind that my city has lots of places that could effect the USA if they were lost. So who's to say they won't come here. The night of the crashes I couldn't sleep, just thinking about the people that died and the ones that are dieing. The thought of it brings me to tears. I never thought that anything like this could ever happen, but it did and it was only a few hours from my home. What is this world coming to? I could never understand why groups of people hate each other so much and are willing to kill each other. So what we have different skin color, have different beliefs, different ways of life, and we live and different parts of the world. None of that should matter, the only thing that should is that we are ALL people. We all feel, care, love, hurt, bleed, live, die. We all have families and people that we love. Is it really worth losing those people over differences? Why can't we look past what makes us individuals and look at what makes us the human race. If we don't learn to live together, are going to end up killing are selves off. The way it's looking now this world won't have much longer of a life. Right after the attacks happened the people of the United States stared pointing fingers and saying \"lets get even, lets make them suffer.\" Do we really what to go down to the leave of the people who did this? Why don't go above them and bring justice NOT war. The people that are behind this horrendous attack need to pay for what they did but they need to pay in a civil way. If we start a war, more innocent people will die. Do really need any more killing, loss, hurting, and sorrow? I know that my words won't be heard by many, but if I touch at least one person, I will then know I don't stand alone. Just by knowing that I will feel a little safer in this unsafe world. Rest in peace \n Erika Dennis 9/12/01 age 16 \n ejc11901 \n I'm amazed (but not suprised) by the overwhelming and constant pro retaliation messages being advocated throughout the media by supposedly professional journalists. Why aren't we spending most of our time committing to acts and behaviors of compassion, pulling in the victims and their families? One visitor to this board even expressed utter surprise at an apparent 20% dissension from that view. \n I only wonder how many of the other 80% consider themselves christians and how a retaliatory view makes you different from those who executed this egregious and inhumane act? \n rplummer \n jeffchurch1: the president's words were meant to comfort and to stregnthen the resolve of the nation. I don't believe he intended to be insesitive to non-christians. \n mayank17 \n A message for the President.... ___________________________________ Dear Mr. President, \n We, the billion odd Indians, do share the grief of all those who have been tragically affected by this barbaric act of terrorism. It will take some real long time before we will be able to get back to our normal lives; but in the meantime, you have to take note of one simple fact that this was certainly an avoidable tragedy. Allow me to explain.... \n From an isolated & prima facie perspective, a barbaric act of terrorism like this is seen as a localized tragedy in context of humanitarian & monetary losses. But, an honest introspection will reveal an altogether different story. These attacks are always against the whole humanity, and not against a particular societal group. Period. \n The primary motivation behind these fanatical acts is one-fold : enjoying a sense of psychopathic control over local governments, and thereby, terrifying the people whom these governments are supposed to protect. Therefore, terrorism can be effectively dealt with only if global initiatives are taken to crush these fanatics, in a continuous and synergistic manner. In capacity of globally accepted superpower, USA is the country best suited for undertaking such initiatives because of its military, economic and political resources. In some isolated cases where American people or properties were affected, retaliatory actions were undertaken. But, these reactions always looked like more of a personal vendetta, rather than a well resolved act of the most advanced democratic country on earth. \n In nutshell, Mr. President, the root cause of these never ending barbaric acts is that global leaders like you have never looked beyond the shores of your own countries. That is why Osama Bin Laden is on your target list, but Pakistan is not. Time and again, so many US senators have explicitly condemned Pakistan's terrorist acts against India, but US leadership didn't declared it a 'terrorist state' as Pakistan was not a direct threat against US. That is why British government goes all out against IRA, but known conspirators of Mumbai bomb blasts (1993) are not being extradited. This story goes on and on... \n Mr. President, we (the human race) will have to do away with an attitude prevailing amongst almost all of us : If somebody just stumbles across my newly manicured lawn, I'll raise the hell; but, if someone else's house is even bulldozed, I'll secure my vested interests even before raising a voice. I hope that USA will be able to hunt down and punish the culprits responsible for this massacre, as you've promised. But, more than that, I hope to see some long term & meaningful measures being taken by countries like US or UK to put an end to the global terrorism, even if doesn't concerns immediate interest your own countries. \n It will only then be possible to anticipate, avoid and neutralize these terrorist attacks before they become a reality in any part of the world. That is the reason why I started this letter by saying that \"this was certainly an avoidable tragedy....\". Whatever has already happened can't be undone, but maybe we can protect our future. \n May the sole of all those who died rest in peace, and a healthy recovery is blessed upon the injured ones. \n Warm regards, Rakesh Misra Chairman, MD & CEO MisraSoft Pvt. Ltd. INDIA \n msoft025 \n \"Why aren't we spending most of our time committing to acts and behaviors of compassion, pulling in the victims and their families?\" \n You act as if having and expressing compassion for the victims and expressing hatred for the perpetrators are mutually exclusive. Just because someone is standing in a four-hour-long line to donate blood, or donating money or needed items to aid the rescue effort or even being on the scene, helping to find survivors of these attacks doesn't mean that their hearts aren't full of desire to attack and retaliate. A lot of what you're seeing now is posturing and blowing off steam. Let it happen. \n kgmaximus \n \"I don't believe he intended to be insesitive to non-christians.\" \n But his speech was insensitive to non-Christians or the non-religious. \n Do you believe it is appropriate for the President of the USA to cite scriptures from the Bible in a speech intended for ALL American, and especially in a trying time like last night? \n I am 100% certain that it was NOT. \n Why can't one comfort without being religious? What is so compulsive about religious comments? \n This is the fundamental source of our bias in American life and policy in the ME. \n jeffchurch1 \n I watched yesterday's events unfold from my office window in terror. My wife works - or used to work - in the trade center. Thankfully her office was low and most got out. My heart sank with the trade center along with any hope that things would ever be the same again. \n Lets not kid ourselves - did another group target the same building? No. they finished what they started in 1993. \n I heard one woman say \"there must be a better way to get your [i.e. the terrorists'] message accross.\" \n Unfortunately the medium is the message. Death to America is the chant often heard; people celebrated in the streets of Palistine. \n These terrorists have no apparent political goal other than to damage America. If Isreal were turned over to Islam (lets not kid ourselves about the fight being limited to \"rogue\" states) today would the attacks end? Theirs is an attack on the American way of life and Western thinking generally. \n No amount of concession will stop the violence. They are apparently willing to die for their cause so why not cut to the chase and start killing them before they kill off the greatest mode of social change known to our planet - a free democratic populace. \n Who are \"they\"? Lets start with those who are known terrorists, their supporters and affiliates, their income sources and trade partners and suppliers. And most of all those who celebrated yesterday's attack. \n If we are not prepared to condemn Isreali actions such as the recent assinations then we should either join in the eradication of our enemies or resign ourselves to life as their target. I'd just as soon get off the fence and get on with it - let the best God win. \n quisseparabit \n I'm for retaliation if it is just. I am not for levelling whole cities. If we lose what we are to respond in kind, then we never had the decency we claim to have. \n I think our President and the Senate and House will behave as they should no matter how difficult that is. Now is the time to show the world what justice really means. It is not blindly flailing at any target to mete out vengeance, but the prosecution of the guilty. \n The world is watching very intently for leadership right now. We can be neither bloodlusty nor fearful of taking necessary action. \n michael543 \n I am as concerned as the whole world. The fact is that as part of a beautiful Brazilian youth I feel devastated just to imagine a war could start in minutes. I am young, and want to live a wonderful life and want to keep in touch with all the people I have met all around the world during my traveling. They are my friends. They live in America, Europe and Oceania. Young people from all the world, whom I suppose must be chocked as I am right now. I am sure all of us have this need of freedom and peace. I don \u0301t want to loose friends, I don \u0301t want to see a war starting!!! The macabriest thing is that yesterday we didn \u0301t know if we had been watching a start of dark times, I couldn \u0301t assure my friends living in NY were alive and the worst feeling, I couldn \u0301t be sure that a day after I would ever talk to friends all around the world. The most frustrating and terrible feelings came up on my young mind. There is no need for another catastrophe! My generation has been growing up with ideals of democracy, freedom and respect for all human races and ethnic groups, so it came as impossible to believe there are still people in this world that aren \u0301t able to accept individuals differences and cultural, economical and political diverse status. The attack wasn \u0301t held only against American citizens, Americans symbols or to democracy in itself, it was millions times worst: it was a straight attack against people \u0301s liberty, and that \u0301s why the world youth fears. We have the great mission to change the world, and combat with poorness and hunger. But we still must have the chance to do it! \n brtata \n -Hi, I know its very sad moment right now. But here is what, I think, we can do to put a halt to this menace of plane-hijacking. \n Simply, seal of the space occupied by the pilots ,and, rest of the passengers and crew members. This will stop anyone from entering pilot's cockpit and hence hijacking of the plane. Let the pilot's do the job of flying and, in case, they are warned that some terrorists have taken passengers hostage, just land the plane to nearest airport and let the authorities take care of these guys, in other words, storm the plane. \n kalia2 \n Strange times are upon us - an american living in Geneva. It seems so surreal to learn of the news from here in Geneva. New York isn't exactly next door to my home state anyway but I have a cousin and friends there and, well, my shock goes beyond words. We are in some strange times. I feel very removed from everything - the public reaction, the collective ire of the United States. I simply cannot understand the anger that people must feel to celebrate such a gross demonstration of violence. Everyone here has been disgusted by the celebrations shown on television of the street demonstrations in Palestine. \n I dread the possibility of a series of escalating reactions and counter-reactions that ends in war, or worse a never ending quip pro quo. My unlce dispensed some wisdom to my brother and I once that I have never forgotten; \"Never get in a fight with someone less to lose than you do\", and we all have so much to lose. There is so much at stake and in the end I fear it would only deepen the divide between nations, isolating everyone, and breeding racism and distrust. And yet part of me holds the notion that these explosions of tension and expressions of violence are indicative of something so deep rooted, only a major, defined conflagration will bring everything to the surface so that real healing can begin. Although, that has the peculiar taste of vengence mascarading as logic, like vinegar and sugar. \n Only 3 days ago, I sat on my balcony speaking with my friends about the bomb in the rural south that burned down a predominately black church, killing three little girls. That act of violence, as we had discussed it, galvanized support for the civil rights movement in the United States. People that were 'on the fence' so to speak, developed opinions and sought to distinguish themselves from the gross and cowardly acts of hate-mongers. I can only hope for a similar galvanization of support against terrorism, both by individuals (Bin Laden, McVeigh) and state sponsored terrorism (Israel, Palestine, Afghanistan, and the United States). Although generating that type of reaction seems too much to ask right now, too positive, too \"happy ending just around the corner\". I do not seek to cheapen the loss of life by saying that we will all gain something positive. I only hope that decency and respect will somehow prevail. Hatred in any form will breed more hatred. Terror will not gain anything but recicprocal cycles of hatred, as will a swift and extremist reaction by the United States. \n My tangible world of daily preoccupations which felt so real up until now feels so trivial. I almost feel guilty about continuing on with my life as if it has not been affected. Compared with many people, I have not been affected - I lost no family, etc. But mentally I feel a grave loss and a dread for what this is to mean for the future. I think the world is walking on eggshells waiting for the next shoe to drop. The reactions from my friends here in Geneva (Swiss, Brazilian, Chinese, Egyptian, German, etc.)have been of sympathy, support, and dismay at the nature and scope of such an act. I think the world is holding its breath until it is sure the moment will pass. In general, I am a spriritual but not a religious person, but I pray to my God for the good of us all. \n imforrest \n Yesterday was the worst day of many people's lives, a day never to be forgotten. It was also the day my new son, Emilio Santiago Muul, turned 14 weeks old. The shocking headline's will remain in his baby book until he is old enough to understand gratitude and compassion. I thanked God he was too young to have any idea what was happening around him. I thanked God he was still able to laugh when daddy kissed him on his tummy before he took his bath. I thanked God for him, my family and my loved ones. I thanked God for my freedom. \n After watching President Bush's conference last night, we turned the TV off and went to the beach. The sun was slowly setting and a soft light was reflecting off the waters of Puget Sound. There were no TV's, no radios, no news. We took our sons socks off and rolled his pant legs up and put his feet in the sand for the first time in his life. He curled his toes and opened his eyes wide and smiled at the new sensation. We took him to the waters edge as the tide was coming in and he again, opened his eyes wide and jumped as each wave licked the shore below us. I felt such peace and such sorrow as I thanked God again. I hope my son will always be able to feel the sand, hear the water and see the sun. \n As I write this, tears are running down my face. My thoughts and prayers go to all the people who have lost family or loved ones. I am so sorry. \n mari70 \n I went to school in brooklyn till a month ago and i took the NJT to get to new york.Most of my fellow passengers used to get off at penn.station ,newark to catch the path train to the world trade centre.I have no idea what their fate is today.The most exciting part of my day was looking at the manhattan skyline from the train just before entering the city.The twin towers of the world trade centre standing tall,black and mighty over the morning new york fog.As i watched the towers fall it reminded me of two lovers saying their last goodbye.It seemed that the second tower collapsed not just because it's steel melted due to the immense heat but it was heart broken to see it's partner on the ground and just did not want to stand there alone.They fell in a cloud of dust changing the life of new york and its people forever.The terrorists did not just strike america but the whole world where people want to be free and choose to be all they can be.But i have faith in the new yorkers for i have seen in them an energy found nowhere in the world.I am sure the city will put the unprecedented tragedy behind them and will return to its former vibrant self.I am equally confident that the towers will rise again from their ashes and form a part of the magnificent manhattan skyline ;the symbol of the free world.They might not be called the world trade center towers again but if they should be renamed they should be called the towers of PHOENIX. The cowards who were responsible will die and be damned forever but the spirit of the city will live for an eternity. \n gauthamnaidu \n Yes, please understand that those Palestinians live in a remote world. We in USA are used to a television, and now computer, in every house, with information flowing constantly from countless sources. Our Internet access is a liberty that brings us perspectives from around the world. \n The dancing Palestinians are only acting on what they have been told since birth - that we are evil. They do not know us. They do not have free access to internet, television, libraries....do not blame them for their repression. Their government keeps them truly ignorant of who we are. \n datdoo \n Frankmar: Did you listen to his speech? \n GWB cited a scripture from the Bible. He did not only make reference to God. \n I too believe in God, but many people in the USA do not. \n In fact, I think a public official on official capacity should not make reference to God in front of an audience of diverse or unknown religious composition. \n We need to be conscientiously religion-neutral now than ever before, in order to remove bias in our daily lives as Americans and to achieve a more balanced foreign policy positions. \n The inclusion of God can be many times more painful, and conspicuous, than deletion. I urge you to consider. \n jeffchurch1 \n Agree heartily about leaving ALL gods out of it. Whatever you call your god - Jesus, Blessed Mary, Buddha, Mohammed, Krishna - we must remain religion neutral. Religion is a matter of personal choice and should be kept to one's individual level. This is a matter of worldwide humanity uniting against terrorism. \n datdoo \n I am not a bush fan but at this point I see no purpose served by Bush bashing and the nation needs to rally behind the president not the individual. We can debate his ability or lack of ability to convey sympathy another time. \n r.m.kelley \n I used to travel regularly to New York on the QE2cruise liner. Like millions of others, I fell in love with your vibrant city. I have so many happy memories of it. I am so sorry for what has happened to your people. All the United Kingdom is truly united at this time. We are united by grief for your losses, and will undoubtedly stand by the United States in this time of crisis. God bless America. With deepest sympathy, Anthony Drummond. \n ad60uk \n I am part Asian and I have been assaulted during the Gulf war by people who thought that I am Arab. \n I am well aware of these hate attacks and I condemn them. However, I do not see any reason we cannot discuss the loyalty to the US of Arab Americans. I also know that to an Albanian Muslim, Gulf war of Osama ben Laden may not mean anything. \n There are Christians among Arab Americans (George Mithcell, Spencer Abraham) and you cannot paint them all with the same brush. That is why I would like to have a detailed discussion. I have pointed out that even Muslim British scholars admit that the a majority of British Muslim (mostly from pakistan/Bangladesh) put their country of origin ahead of UK. This was discussed in detail in an article in The Friday Times whose archives are not available at the moment. What is the situation here? \n One cannot say that all British Asians put their country of origin ahead of UK. Most British Indians do not do that. Similarly many muslims would strongly support the US at the hour of crisis. Why can we not discuss this? \n Web magazines (such as www.pakistanlink.com) show that a majority of comments/opinion/articles published by Muslim tend to be pro-jihadi. Is this a correct estimate? Why can we not discuss this? I may be making a mistake in my calculations and I would very gladly like to corrected. \n mbenner1 \n May I please use this media to send my most heartfelt sympathy to ALL Americans. The terrible events which have taken place are just too much to comprehend, even from the distance of the UK. I can't imagine what it must be like in New York, Washington or indeed anywhere in the US. In the UK today the British people have been extremely subdued, sharing your tremendous grief. I think the idea suggested by deronhusak earlier is an excellent way to remember the innocent victims of this atrocity. My prayers are with you. \n caroline5848 \n i'm from israel, and as a jewish man i'm telling you that i THINK most palestinians are shocked themselves. \n of course those of them who set policy and are now their leaders were the pioneers of the hijacking art. \n everyone in israel (the jews of course) is shocked and is sorry for your people. \n to those who think that american pro-israeli policy is the cause, than i guess it's the equivalent of blaming the raped women for being raped. \n melech1 \n Both Israelis and Palestinians share the blame for the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Anyone who sees things in black and white reveals their bias. It's a shame that trying to discuss the issue in a rational manner typically results in the anti-semite label being thrown about. Demonizing Arabs as barbaric savages is fine and dandy, but suggest for a moment that implicit U.S. support for Zionism crosses the line between separation of church and state and makes America a target of terrorist attacks and all hell breaks lose. \n sinverguenza28 \n Hi everyone... \n I'm from the United Kingdom. I would like to take this opportunity to send my sympathy to all those involved in yesterdays terrible tragidy. I watched in terrible shock as I watched as the World Trade Centre Towers collapse, sobbing uncontrolably. It's hard to find words to describe the way I feel, sick in the stomach, is one. I CANNOT imagine what people are going through or how they feel. All I know is how I feel and it's bad. I have friends in NY and I've only heard from one......All I can do, like many, is waite..... \n Michelle \n newton1967 \n I was downtown in New York city when the World Trade Center was attacked and later collasped. I will never forget looking up at the huge holes 20 stories high burning, with debris and people falling from the buildings. My cellphone did not work, pay phones did not work. I went to my office the electronic keys did not work..a man came onto our hall claiming washington dc was bombed..My co-workers and I decided to leave and went outside to see the WTC buildings collaspe. People covered in dirt came running out of the area planes were overhead I did'nt know if we were going to be bombed. People were crying and running..it was a diaster..it was a diaster...people were still in those buidings...we all cried everyone there cried I walked uptown. Why did'nt anyone protect us? these were innocent people...I live in fear. New York will never be the same. By the way, I watched many firefighters and police go into that area before the collaspe godbless them. \n candygirl206a \n whatever your politics, religion, or belief: there's plenty of hate already spread out there. let's spread compassion, tolerance, patience, and love in our communities, and hope it spreads like wildfire around the world. \n love you all as fellow human beings and wonderful souls \n * a sappy but genuine message from a tree huggin, woodstock attendin', reformed, well educated, and grown-up ex-hippie ** \n datdoo \n The big question now is which is more important: Freedom or security. Since this attack has just shown us that it is nearly impossable to have both. \n Yes, this event does raise those sorts of questions. \n The real answer is that we cannot purse absolutist perfection of either. \n But I'll tell you. A reasonable amount of public security -- not a perfect amount -- is the most important freedom that there is. \n Of course if that is the only freedom you have under a repressive police state, you are not very free. Not very free at all. The United States is very far from that. \n We should declare those groups or sects that have themselves declared terrorist Jihad against America, or acted and planned in such a manner without any formal declaration, to in fact be our war enemies. And then go to targeted, commando type war against the key members of those groups. Proactively. Without trials. \n That is how serious this is. \n Or are we going to wait until the suitcase nuke is exploded by a member of one of these groups before we take those sorts of measures. \n As well, wire taping of all those we have probable cause to believe SUPPORT terrorism against Americans. To find the actual actors. Without any necessity of probable cause that these persons actually are participating in terrorist acts themselves. \n dougjnn \n If George Bush has a trademark, it is \"bipartisan\". His father was known for building coalitions instead of acting alone as a rogue nation or individual (as the attackers did yesterday). It is certainly comforting to have a man with these qualities in the Whitehouse right now. I'm already sorry for critical remarks I made earlier about our president. \n mr_polynomial \n Peace to everyone. \n The recent attack in New York is the worst crime against humanity. As news start pouring in, I am becoming aware of near and dear ones who have died or are still missing. While we try to collectively cope with the losses that have fallen upon on shoulders, I like to bring another observation to everyone's attention. \n This crime has not spared people from any religion/creed/cast/color of the skin. I am sure there have been all kinds of casualties, i.e. white, black, brown and yellow. I am even certain that some people from Islam religion have also died. \n I am a Sikh and generally Sikhs wear turban and support long beards. In past 2 days I have come across news where Sikhs have been targeted by people (ignorant) in US, for they appear similar to some people from middle-east. \n http://www.sikhs.org/topics3.htm \n Please understand that Sikhs are not Muslims and do not follow Islam religion. We are fairly new religion, which originated in Northern Part of India. There is a big mis-conception about people who wear turbans and support long beards. Actually, a lot of people in Asia do wear turbans and keep beards, but for various reasons. Not all Muslims wear turbans, while all the Sikhs have to wear turban. Wearning of turban is religions issue amongst Sikhs, while the reasons amongst Muslims might vary for as simple reason as wearing a protective piece of cloth to protect against sun-rays to perhaps class distinction (clergy men wearning it mainly). \n In the state of Rajasthan in India, even Hindus wear turban to protect against strong sun rays. Rajasthan is desert area. \n There have been incidents of: \n Stone throwing Arrest of a individual wearing a turban and supporting long bear in Providence, RI area. \n If we have to punish someone then let's punish the real culprits and not our own people. Arab Americans are Americans at the end of the day. \n I hope this cruel incident does not turn a brother against a brother. \n sbedi \n Like everyone, I observed in amazement what happened yesterday. What I didn't observe anywhere with similar amazement, neither in the written press nor on television was any mention whatsoever of the U.N. It is precisely said forum which at this time should be leading the world and making it quite clear once and for all that the U.S.A. is one of the countries of said community and that it not only has the right to be defended (wrongly invoking clause V of the NATO Treaty), but also the obligation as a said U.N.member of perpetrating its philosophy of world unity. From this very day the following rules should be applied if we really wish to have the right to a UNITED Nations' Assembly: 1) That said Assembly be the only one empowered to act upon this situation. (This sadly reminds us all of the part the U.S. has played as the world's policeman and the tragic consequences yesterday) 2) Immediate application of all resolutions passed by the U.N. Assembly, without exception; which means not only those applicable to the well-known Iraqi situation but also those conveniently forgotten when applied to Israel for instance. Equal law for all must be the only valid example. 3) Cancel the right that some members have to veto decisions, thus making the Assembly a real democratic forum. 4) Make all member states pay their dues up-to-date; (as a genuine gesture of solidarity towards all - the paradox being that the U.S. is well behind in this sense). Bless all your fellow citizens unjustly caught in this terrible hatred and let us all send energy to those not only suffering the consequences but those in such need of inner peace that they be driven to such blind madness. \n Michael Martin Morgan \n I've spent much of the past 24 hours watching television coverage of the horrific events playing out in New York City and at the Pentagon, crying on and off, trying to grasp the enormity of events. How many people had I just seen die? \n I've heard stories of heroism that still bring tears to my eyes. Everyone who rushed to the aid of another human being in yesterday's tragedies is a hero. Some will be remembered, but the deeds of others will remain forever unknown. \n I've since turned the set off, no longer certain what information I am waiting to hear. The inundation of reports and the endless video loops of explosions and fires have settled into psychologists speaking of how to help your children cope, war-cries, the pretty young newscasters, and editorials. \n America is reacting, America is speaking. In some cases, she is screaming insanities, and reflecting naivete. \"America does not kill women and children!\" \"We should just nuke all those Middle Eastern countries!\" Such insanities are what have brought us to this pass, and there is no place for such naivete in the world into which we were finally thrown yesterday. \"America the blessed, the wonderful, the torchbearer of democracy, has been attacked.\" Democracy has not been attacked. In the clearest possible act, with undeniable symbolism, American capitalism and militarism have been attacked. This point must not be lost. The distinction between the American ideal of democracy and the policies enacted by our nation's corporate, political, and military institutions must not be blurred. \n An unpardonable attack has claimed the lives and futures of too many thousands for forgiveness, and justice must be pursued. But in the search for remedies, on the surest path to ensure that such catastrophes do not occur again, we must remember that these are the very institutions that Americans themselves often profess to distrust and even fear. This is not a time for blind calls to arms and flag waving. This is a time for mourning and consideration. This is a time to remember that events such as this does not occur in a vacuum, that America does not exist in isolation. The policies our leaders have pursued and the choices our corporations have made cannot escape a share of the blame for creating this new world order. And along with the rights we have been granted, we cannot escape the responsibility for controlling the entities America has created. \n abezella \n A fundamental change in the way the military operates is necessary to prevent this from happening again. The military was useless in this situation and continues to be no more than a symbol. We need to step back and rethink things like missle shields and aircraft carriers. What we need to concentrate on is information gathering. Clearly no one is going to wake up one morning and decide to launch a ballistic missle at us. There's going to be an organization, a plan. And at this time in the world nothing happens in total secrecy. Our efforts need to be applied toward prevention - to infiltrate these organizations and defeat them before attacks occur. Plotting to take innocent lives needs to be prosecuted just as if those lives were actually lost. \n It is unbelievable. We are indeed at war. The skies above New York City were patrolled by fighter jets. Thousands of American citizens have perished on our home soil. The children at recess still scream and yell outside my window, just like they did on Monday. My world goes on. But it is different world than I awoke to yesterday. \n cdcowan \n Subject: The FAA must be held Accountable \n Today and for the past few days, we have all been questioning the events of Tuesday. How could this happen in the United States of America? I have been particularly outraged when I think of the thousands of innocent people who have been taken from us. I can't bear to think of their families. \n As an Air Traffic Controller, certified by both the FAA and ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) and a pilot who have been around aviation all his life, I must place the blame for this tragedy squarely on the shoulders of the FAA. I know, at this time, it seems unpatriotic to question our institutions and our government. But in the name of the innocent victims and their families, I must say this. \n The rules are very clear. A plane from Boston to LA should never be anywhere near NYC. When a plane loses communications with ATC, it must be assumed that the flight will proceed as cleared or according to the flight plan. If the transponder is turned off, a primary target can still be seen and tracked. Only transponder specific information is lost. \n So one flight with very experienced pilots makes a 90 degrees turn and heads for some destination. In no place in the book is this a standard procedure. So ATC does nothing. The flight continues on this course with no communications. About 20 minutes later, another flight, from the same origin and to the same destination, does the same thing and heads in a similar direction. ATC sees this as they must. These are commercial flights flying under IFR and must be under the control of ATC at all times. \n ATC tracks the first flight into one of the most densely populated airspace in the country. ATC does nothing. ATC still tracks the other plane but does nothing. The first plane plunges into a building and disappears off the radar screen. ATC does nothing and has 20 minutes or so to react to the second flight but instead watches and waits as the second plane disappears from the screen and into another building. \n The FAA has the ability to get the military involved and to have military jets scrambled in event of an emergency. What would they have lost if they had scrambled and nothing happened? \n At least two Air Traffic Control Centers were involved, Boston being the first to see this activity. Yet with all the senior level people in these two centers, no one, I repeat, no one handled this as they should have. \n The FAA has failed miserably to protect innocent Americans on their own soil. The FAA should be made to answer and those involved severely punished. The Administrative group should all be severely punished. When one assumes the leadership role in an operation like the FAA, he accepts that the interest of the nation and the public are of utmost priority and concern. The FAA has betrayed the public trust. \n tsanichara \n Presently I am at school in Boston, but my home is in NY. I not only feel the mortality and despair of the nation, but suffer the loss of my home. The breathtaking view of the WTC that I have always cherished will forever more be a memory. \n The night after the attack I put an away message on AIM, and it seemed to get an emotional response. \n Call for Hope- Tragedy 911 \n People say \"You never sleep.\" And sometimes it is true. I don't need much sleep, so I don't get much. But tonight I am afraid to sleep. I am afraid that when I wake up in the morning, Everything that happened today will still be real and not the nightmare that vanishes with dawn. But, if I don't go to sleep, I am stuck in the nightmare. \n What a sad way to fall asleep... With tears on the pillow; Wishing I could wake up safe in loving arms In a world without war and fear. But wishes don't always come true... \n trose1082 \n I find it highly offensive that the NY Times editorial page, 2 days after a national tragedy, has the audacity to insert partisan feelings in questioning the leadership of President Bush and his national security team. I find it highly offensive that the Whitehouse has been playing politics with this whole situation. When will Bush get off of his script and address the American people in his own words based on his own feelings and emotions? The script should be turned off. It makes me sick to see him reading and mangling scripted that he clearly hasn't seen before they were put in front of him instead of talking to us like we need. We as a country need to be communicated to clearly from our leader, like BC post OKC or RR post the Lebanon barracks bombing or anyone of the hostage takings that occurred during his term. This is a time for bold words for history that will guide us. He hasn't delivered. Instead we have gotten 4 different TV statements each saying the same thing and neither memorable or encouraging for the American public. And what is the deal with this BS about AF1 being a target. It was in South FL. Why can't they just say that they were being over protective and concerned and screwed up by not bringing him back to DC? Instead they make up a story that is starting to have the same feel as that WH vandalism BS. Why are people talking on background in Bill Safire's column? This is a national crisis not a budget dispute, if there ever was a time to stop the now ubiquitous statements from \"senior White House official on background\" this is it. They need to cut the crap! This is the time that we most need full and honest information and communication from our leadership. They have not lived up yet and I for one am saddened and disappointed by everything. \n cartbran \n You as a people have suffered a great tragedy. I wish to offer true and heartfelt feelings of care and support, and hope that the healing will be timely. I was in the emergency department of the Hospital where I work at 23:15 local time when the first images of the events were first broadcast. I cannot stress enough my feeling for the idividuals and their loved ones. It is terrible. Being an honourable man, I have felt these feelings for the civilians of other countries but these feelings are accentuated now by the number of casualties. I hope before rage overtakes individuals that time is taken to reflect on the feelings your country shares and consider the feelings of those in other countries, where the conflict is relentless, with a continuous need for weaponry. This weaponry is supplied by many countries of which the USA is a major player. I remember the image of the naked, little Vietname girl running and screaming after being napalmed. Over time, many Vietnamese were killed in their own country. Indeed, I can't think of another single episode of such a killing as has occurred to you, other than Hiroshima. I am sorry I feel that I need to have said painful truths, but I am currently watching your president doing a poor job of convincing your nation that you are again at war. 01:02 Fri 14.9 The thing that strikes me as tragic is that a small handful of men could cause so much carnage armed with rudimentary equipment. The relative costs in consideration of the American arms industry and the consequent political leverage this exercises make it a black farce. It is time to reflect on the history of your country to understand why this has happened, and on the impact of the first real foreign attack on your home soil, rather than the reverse. you need a new president. The folks in NY are being brilliant. my best wishes. \n xerxes8 \n Honor our Heroes. Let the firefighters, the police, the nurses, the construction workers and all the others who are out there right now risking their lives trying to save others know we support and honor them. One way to do this is to contact their unions. Let us honor the hundreds of families that have lost loved ones who gave their lives trying to save others and let us make sure those families are provided for, they gave the ultimate sacrifice. These are the true heroes of the WTC and Pentagon atrocities and I am and we all should be very proud of them. Let us also honor our teachers, who are helping our children through these trying times, the FEMA volunteers, many of whom are just now getting ready to go to the scene, the flight attendants and pilots of the aircraft we fly, some of whom lost their lives on Tuesday, the military members who patrol our skies and borders and died doing their jobs in the Pentagon. All of these are some 'the little people' who make this country work day to day. They don't make don't control large companies, have stars on their shoulders or millions in their bank accounts. They just go to work, day after day, do their jobs and love their families. Today, as everyday, they are the true heroes. \n coriverrat \n ... and another thing. Can't the networks keep those ridiculous \"Attack on America\" logos off of the television screens? Can't we keep ourselves from being ridiculously callous and superficial for just 1 minute? Please. \n blpiltin \n This tragedy should not be underestimated but one thing's for certain - We should not hold the Arab community in general responsible for this horrific event. I am a Caucasian-American with as much disdain for the perpetrators as anyone else. Seeing the destruction of our American symbols of freedom and commerce has been unbearable to me and my heart goes out to all the victims and their families. I, like everyone else, am heartbroken as well as livid that these people were capable of this kind of impact on our nation. However, the only people who are responsible are the fringe groups of militants who targeted Americans, NOT Arab-Americans living here, Muslim or otherwise. Please remember the difference. The Muslim faith does not teach this kind of violence. The culprits are the erratic power mongers who twist the words of their religion to gather followers - a problem that can be found within all faiths. Arab-Americans are no more responsible than anyone else in America for this devastating event. They are just as angry and have lost family members of their own. Do not place your anger upon the innocent. Focus it where it will be constructive - on militants who actually support such activities. Discrimination is a dangerous activity. Have we not learned our lesson from African-American and Japanese-American injustices? \n sarahen \n Sorry for my bad english - it \u0301s fiftieen years ago, that I spoke my last words in school. But today I have the will to tell all americans, that I \u0301m deeply shocked about the terror in your country. We germans think of you today and are so sad about what happend to you. I hope, you won \u0301t answer with violence, but you \u0301ll proove, that you are civilised and real christians, which know something, the terrorists and their friends never heard about - a word, that I only know in german: \"Na\u0308chstenliebe\" ! We all have to stop and provide such violence, but please don \u0301t answer with war against the suffering children and depressed women in Afghanistan. Perhaps you and we in western europe should think about the reason for this terrible und unbelievable hate. You and I are living in a rich world, which is partly based on the poorness of the southern countries. We should - more than ever - think about our responsibilitiy for the development of those countrys, for their chance to take part of the globalised new economy. If the contrast between the rich western countrys and the rest of the world will raise on, it will always exist terrorists all over the world - with more and more brutal weapons. Let \u0301s hope and change... \n chrisklev \n At times this forum seems like hell, as fear, anger, and all the torments of the damned swirl about us. Let us remember our common humanity. Let us remember how fleeting and how precious life is. This is hard for many to do, especially young men, who have a hard-wired desire to be defenders of the band. Those responsible for the attack on this country cannot expect to avoid the consequences for their actions. If possible, we must prevent them from ever being able to repeat such attacks. But I believe those who wish to use this forum to call for mass murder through nuclear war may some day be glad these dark ideas were not displayed for public view. If they could look very closely at the photographs of the dead and injured at Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- especially the agonized faces of the burned children -- they would see what they have been calling for in their personal and private despair. \n chasstevenson \n Its a terrible tragedy, but I truly look at it as an opportunity to make it a much safer world. I really believe that these terrorists made a mistake by attacking in such a monumental and horrendous way. Because of the enormity of what they did, I think both world opinion and the American people will be steeled to take whatever action is necessary to wipe-out the threat of terrorism. Unlike prior struggles, I think that, in the minds of the populous, the balance between our own security and the desire to minimize collateral damage has swung widely in favor of taking whatever action is necessary to ensure that known terrorists are destroyed and, importantly, those that are left, will find no quarter from nations too concerned over the repercussions that providing safe harbor would bring. You know that I have never been a hawk, and frankly, I have been somewhat critical of Israel in the past, but I think we have two choices. Either do very little in the way of retaliation and put clamps on personal freedoms in this country in the name of increased security (which I think would truly be antithetical to the foundations of this nation), or massive action aimed at eradicating both the supply of terror and the ability of future terrorists to find safe and comfortable areas to train and plan. I realize it is early and we need to guard against the impulse to overreact, but my reasoning is not one of revenge. I've watched over the years as Israel has attempted to deter terrorist acts by retaliating in a greater (but still measured) manner than that by which Israel was attacked. Unfortunately, such retaliation has not only failed to deter, but has increased the supply of individuals willing to avenge their martyrs. I do not mean to say that the political struggle of the Palestinians is without merit (frankly I am not educated well enough on the topic to decide), however, the world needs to establish that political objectives will not be won by killing civilians. Righteous causes must be fought, not through \"intifada,\" but through political and world pressure. To continue using Israel and the Palestinians as an example, the Arab world holds substantial political and economic leverage. Instead of condoning terrorism, organizations seeking to further the Palestinian goals should be lobbying for the exercise of such leverage. In fact, without the threat of terrorism, Israel's most valid reason for resisting the turnover of land to the Palestinians, SECURITY, would no longer exist. Unfortunately, terrorism will exist as long as there are places like Syria, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan that are willing to allow individuals to live and plan terrorist attacks from within their borders. I think (and hope) that the magnitude of this attack will allow for a world coalition willing to take the actions necessary to make the risks to such countries far too great to allow any refuge to future terrorists. \n rengman \n Know that there are people all over the world, who desperately feel for all america at this awful time. i know america and americans as a great nation. please accept my sorrow for the innocent victims in these atrocities,and my hope beyond hope that your splendid emergency services bring out many more survivors. wish i could offer more than these words. terry mcgrory liverpool england. \n t.mcgrory \n From Oklahoma---What is ours is yours NY!!!!! Our deepest sympathy for all your losses and know that we are with you in thoughts and prayers! \n kab007 \n The president has now made a numnber of public statements. Can you remember anything memorable or inspiring about any of them? He said during the campaign, \"They have not led, we will.\" Well it has been over 8 months now and we are currently in the middle of one of the biggest crises of modern history and I ask you were the leadership is. I do not care about where he was or wasn't. What I do care about is the president addressing the American public in a manner that that lifts the spirits of the American people and can give me the strength and courage to continue. I live in DC. I was in an office building very close to the Pentagon when it was attacked. I am frightened and scared and angry like everyone else. I do not know where or what to do with or about any of this. The president needs to step up to the plate and deliver a national speech from his desk at the oval office, like so many before him, notably Reagan, and communicate to us as a person to a person. He needs to turn off the teleprompter and put down the script and stop the politicking that has been going on and speak to us so that we can breathe a collective sign of relief and forgiveness. He needs to engender all of his own strength and courage, if necessary, and rise to the occassion and show us that we too can rise out of this. We need hope and we need the president to deliver that hope. Perhaps we really need right now a president from hope. I don't know. \n cartbran \n To even suggests that President Bush made the wrong decision in not heading toward Washington, D.C. immediately is yellow journalism at its worst. Days from now, when the smoke has cleared and perhaps a few heads, maybe then criticism would be warranted. However, so soon after a national tragedy, and without being privy to top secret information, any newspaper that criticizes or even reports the criticism of the President by others is irresponsible. God bless America and a responsible press. \n tizzidale \n I can't even believe that someone would be that much of a jerk to blame this on Clinton and the NY Times. Oh, you know what. I can believe it. Because it's the same kind of mentality that brought about this tragedy in the first place--hatred and ignorance. There is no way to calmly discuss the Clinton administration's foreign policy and military record in this forum. However, many thoughtful people (including George Kennan) questioned the wisdom of various of Clinton's policies. These questions may well be relevant to the situation we face today. \n chasstevenson \n I would like to commend the manner in which the mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani, has handled this grave situation. I would urge the state of New York not to let this courageous man and leader get away from public life. If they do, we would love to have him in New Jersey. Thank you and God Bless all Americans as we struggle to overcome this situaton we now face. Ray Fonseca Roselle, New Jersey \n reineriosr \n Please put the word on,not all arabs are moslems there are thousands of christian arabs world wide . NOt all the arabs are moslems.................please remember this. \n petrus4 \n My friends, I am not a politician, or a military leader, or anywhere close to being a man capable of influencing my country\u2019s policy. I am an ordinary citizen of Canada, saddened and appalled by the events of Tuesday, September 11. Today, two days after the monumental tragedy that struck your nation, I am moved to reach out to those of you in shock and in pain across our storied undefended border. As Canadians, we are in the best position in the international community to see firsthand the might of America, the strength of its industry, of its military and of its population. We condone and support the role you have taken for yourselves as protectors of the free world, a protectorate in which we enjoy countless benefits. Because of you, our worries are relatively few. We know that we need not fear conventional aggression, because we are protected by the umbrella of your military strength. We know that we need not fear economic disaster, as our economy is irrevocably tied to the strength of yours. Collectively, we have also been grossly ungrateful for all that the United States has done to further our interests and for the friendship that we share. The single largest unifying factor in Canadian nationalism, in fact, is that we are different from Americans. The most successful television commercial in Canadian history is a 30-second rant telling us how we are different and somehow better than our southern neighbors. One of the things you will hear from many Canadians when discussing the United States is that while we know much about you through mass media and our school curricula, many Americans know very little about us. Know this, though: You are at once our neighbor, our closest ally, our largest trading partner and, in truth, our extended family. Our differences our trivial, our similarities powerful and perpetually binding. Our people unanimously stand beside you in this time of need, grief and rage. Our politicians have promised whatever humanitarian aid within our power to help the victims of this tragedy. I truly believe that I speak for all Canadians when I say I wish we could do more. May God Bless America. Scott Moffatt Ottawa, Ontario, Canada \n moffamadness \n When all is said and done (if that time ever arrives), I think the main culprits in this horror are the people at the FAA. For close to an hour (!), 4(!) planes were missing from the airspace around the east coast air corridor. If anyone noticed this they are not now talking about it. In the hour from when the planes disappeared to the crashes, how many military jets could have scrambled to intercept the 4? Obviously there's no answer to that, but the question is, WHO IS THE FAA AND WHY DO THEY CLAIM THEY ARE ACTING IN MY INTERESTS? Living as I do under the flight path of all outgoing jets from LGA I have long pondered this question. The FAA seems interested in only one thing, namely to look out for the airlines and not make them do ANYTHING that would inconvenience them. After all, who do you think these people will work for after retiring from the FAA? No requests for new slots from the airlines goes unheeded, in spite of obvious safety and environmental concerns. But any requests from the flying public, or those of us on the ground, is ignored as completely as possible. The FAA holds public meetings, for instance, to discuss plans for new flight paths, but then never publishes the results and goes ahead with whatever plans it has already decided on. The flying public long complained about delays and the like, but nothing was done, and more and more flights were added to already overcrowded airports like LGA. (How many flights can really take off at 12 noon? at 3PM? How many more would the FAA have added if it were not for the economic slowdown?) This is a type of corruption that is particularly egregious in this case. If the employees of the FAA want to work for the airlines, let them quit now and do so; if the want to work for the people of the US, then let them finally start understanding that we in the planes and on the ground have more rights to their services than the airlines do. If they can't protect us from the airlines, let them all quit now and let us find some people who CAN. (If, for instance, the air traffic control system is so woefully inadequate that 4 planes can disappear from their radar, then its clear the FAA has not been sucessful in protecting the public.) In the present tragedy I believe it is incumbent on us to demand answers to questions about past, present, and future FAA actions and how they actually impact our lives. Its no longer enough for these people to do whatever they want under the justifications of safety and security. Its time for the FAA to really respond to us and take into consideration what the public needs and wants. \n steve48b \n i'm a 18 years old girl from germany. i'm sitting in front of the pc,but i even don't know what to write. i saw the second crash live on tv and thought that has to be a film. when i realized it's true i started crying. every time i see someting about it on tv i start crying again. today at 10 o'clock in the morning there was silence everywhere in germany. i was sitting in school at that time and started to cry...i'm still crying! i can't believe it's true...! know it doesn't help, but i want you to know that the whole country is thinking of you and praying for all the dead persons and their families, the fire and policemen, everyone who's helping!!! god bless them all! PEACE! sandra \n sandra-germany \n People at this very moment are dying agonizing deaths. Our people. American People. And yet, there are still so many anti-Israeli, anti-American posts here... 'we deserved it,' 'it's because we oppress people,' 'it's because of the Jews and our support of them,' MY GOD! Where is your humanity? Can you not stop blaming, blaming, blaming and hating for a few days? These terrorists destroyed your city, and justify, and philosphize, and intellectualize, and trivialize it all. Like some suspended brains without bodies, looking down on all of us mortals actually feeling, and suffering, and passing your cool, level judgement. Many of you must look in the mirror. There are many shades of grey, yes, but at a time like this we must all be red, white, and blue. And for you hatemongering Jew haters that spew your filth despite the fact that we are a democracy, and EVERY administration has suported Israel(free country/democracy), regardless of party: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote: 'You declare, my friend, that you do not hate the Jews, you are merely 'anti-Zionist'. And I say, let the truth ring forth from the high mountain tops. Let it echo through the valleys of God's green earth: When people criticize Zionism they mean Jews... Zionism is nothing less than the dream and ideal of the Jewish people returning to live in their own land... And what is anti-Zionism? It is the denial to the Jew of the fundamental right that we justly claim for the people of Africa and freely accord to all other nations of the globe. It is discrimination against Jews because they are Jews. In short it is anti-Semitism.' I hope you one day find it in yourself to be brave enough to face your weakness and fear and insecurity. Stick with America, stick with Israel -- be a patriot, for God's sake. \n jesnyt0 \n To speculate or propose that the Mossad or the CIA or someone or something similar was behind the recent attacks on New York and Washington is totally absurd and unproductive, and shows a complete lack of understanding about recent events in the Middle East. I've heard similar yarns from individuals here in Canada, and I can assure you that they're totally out to lunch! That you Americans can't fathom who your enemies really are is part and parcel of your moral dilemma. It's time to get a grip and to understand that you are hated by your enemies for your overall ignorance and smug complicity. If you want to stop terrorism in its tracks, then you will have to dig a lot deeper than postulating the absurd. \n fhearghail \n Tuesday night in Australia,(Morning for you) my partner rang me & told me to turn my television on. What I saw shook me to the core. I can't begin to express the horror/shock/pain I felt. I've never been to the US but somehow I've always felt that the US represented the free world, & therefore my world. Since then I've sat glued to my television every moment I can, mourning with the family's who've lost loved ones, praying with those still searching, rejoicing with each rescue of a victim & wishing for justice for those who organised this terrible thing. It's frightening to have this happen to America, the country that represents strength, freedom & democracy. Seeing New York & Washington violated in such a way, made me realise how unsafe we all are against such attacks. However the words of your President promising to hunt them down reassure me that they will be dealt with. Watching each and every one of you pull together, helping each other is an inspiration. In this time of tradgedy it would be understandable if you took time to feel sorry for yourselves, but no, you go out to see what you can do to help someone else. Even on a square box your spirits show the strength & determination Americans are renowned for. The whole of Australia feels your pain, and admires your spirits. I will forever miss the view of the TWC on newscasts, but I'm eager to see what you ingenius, amazing Americans put in thier place to show you can't be beaten. Trudy in Australia. \n trude_rules \n Please people. Enough of the Israel vs. Palestine garbage. The fact is none of the states in the middle east practices the ideals that make this country great. Most are ruled by theocracies, including Israel. The rest are just run of the mill bully tyrants. We have a few relatively good friends in the region who help us maintain a military presence. The military presence is there to protect our interest in having access to purchase oil from the region. And unless you are running your computer by a pedal powered generator, you are part of the reason we are there. We have tenuous alliances with some of the Arab states, due in part to their interest in keeping control of their sheikdoms. We help them in this. We also help Israel because of a complicated relationship due in part to a significant Jewish population in the US, collective Western guilt over treatment of the Jews over the last several centuries, and treaty obligations. They also have been our best friend in the region. Which is not to say they have always been a good friend. The Palestinians are part victim of history, and part tool of the Arab states in the region, most of whom want the destruction of Israel. We have picked sides in an ugly fight that has no hope of being won by either side. Israel is a state founded on religious identification which is anathema to the traditions of our country. But we have few good options. You can be simplistic and think that giving some land to the Palestinians will end the fight, but you will be simply wrong. The only answer is to negotiate with our few Arab friends in the region to intervene on our behalf. Then negotiations must begin to give dispersed land within the Arab countries and financial settlements to each Palestinian who claims to have been pushed out of his homeland. It's not nice, but no other solution has a chance to work. \n michael543 \n There is no question that the awesome power of the United States will be brought to bear on those responsible for the terrorist acts in NY, Washington and Pittsburgh. Our nation is wounded, but strong and capable of rebuilding from this terrible disaster. The United States is society founded on laws, empowered by a Constitution that holds liberty and freedom sacred. The strength of our society is based on these laws that proscribe our ideals, common social and political goals and framework for economic success that has lead us to a position of international leadership. In this time of crisis, we must rely upon these laws to root out the evil of September 11, 2001. Congress through the will of the people has the power proscribed by law to find and bring to justice those responsible. There is no room in our society of laws for personal retribution, vigilantism, or threatening attacks on law-abiding Arab-Americans. Those actions degrade not only our laws, but also our faith in government and its power to act in every American's common interest of swiftly and prudently bringing those responsible to justice and punishing them for all the world to see. If we believe in the United States, in a civilized society, in the concepts of liberty and freedom, and our Constitution, we must stand firmly while our government prosecutes their investigation and brings the full force of the United States to bear on any and every responsible party. \n luke_hollis \n If the media in New York are being critical of Bush, it's because they, like many of us in NY, felt a real vacuum Tuesday in the delay of response and the quality of the eventual response from him. At first, he barely acknowledged that this horrible attack took place in New York. So he's been berated enough to decide to come here tomorrow. Well, who cares now. Our moral support came from our mayor. Bush looks like a fly in comparison. \n fran124b \n I doubt I'm the only New Yorker on this forum; I do want to thank all for the well wishes. It was comforting to see people in NYC come so close together. The comeraderie, the support, was inspiring and touching. I'll never forget getting over the bridge to Brooklyn and finding NYC Tech staff out in the street handing out cups of water to people, or the 'rough necks' helping women on the Manhattan bridge, or the men flagging down a passing vehicle to help an elderly woman... \n mquin4 \n Among the possible responses to the horrible terrorist attacks on America, I wonder if President Bush has considered inviting Osama Bin Laden for negotiations at Camp David in order to peacefully resolve their disputes without recourse to bloodshed. If not, then I would be very surprised. Hasn't America cajoled Indians to talk to Pakistani generals despite complete knowledge of the latter's involvement in terrorism in Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir?? Hasn't America arm-twisted Israelis into talking to Palestinian terrorists, who were doing their best to attack Israeli targets?? If America has suddenly realised the folly of it's ways and decided that terrorism needs to be countered with swift, punitive measures, then would it extend the same courtesy to other nations who are equally, if not more vulnerable to terrorist violence?? Would America now consider joining their fight against nations which openly harbour terrorists?? Or would America once again content itself into attacking personalities and delude itself into believing that terrorist groups which target other countries should be of no particular concern to it. \n rajender_razdan \n I think we all are making mistake in calling a religion fanatic act to a terrorist act. This change of terminology is going on for ages. The largest number of wars and human death account to this fanatic phylosophy. The time has come, we have learned enough lessons, now start calling all of us as \" Human\" and not Muslim, christian, buddhist or hindu. World leaders must sit down and think in this direction, to stop mass murders once for all. The only logical way is to forgate \" God \". We don't need HIM now, we had enough of Him. I am not athist, but I don't believe in God of mass murderers. \n naneria \n crossmaster - \"I have a question for the group... What defines terrorism to you? For example, would cracking down on terrorism mean the FBI should make a better effor to root out domestic terrorists like the Olympic bomber (Eric Rudolph?), who is purportedly still living in North Carolina?\" \n I think \"terrorism\" is an abstract idea and a political catch phrase. \n The idea is so abstract that it is virtually meaningless. It is often defined as violent actions undertaken by one's enemies. The targetting of undefended villages in Yugoslavia (such as Varvarin), dams, power plants, and water supplies in Iraq and Yugoslavia, Clinton's missile attack on the Sudan, etc., have all of the hallmarks of terrorism except they were done by our side and are therefore not \"terrorism\". \n As a catch phrase, it allows people to skip over sequential and evaluative reasoning and jump ahead to describe what they have already decided they want to do. \n And yes, \"a war on terrorism\" would suggest that a nuclear device whould be set off in Eric Rudolf's cave or an Army division sent to capture him. \n I will surely catch the dickens from people for this post by people who do not read it carefully. The attack on innocent American civilians was an enormous evil (which sickens me now as I think of it). Those responsible must be prevented from repeating such acts. However, to declare war on an abstraction like \"terrorism\" (or a reification like \"drugs\" for that matter) helps us not at all and, knowing our professional politicians, will probably waste a lot of our money. \n chasstevenson \n For myself, I apologize for framing this tragic situation in terms of the US/Israeli/Palestinian situation. It just has seemed to me that this is the flashpoint that is behind the attack. Like most people, I abhor what happened, and am hoping that whatever actions the US takes will be measured, and effective, and not leaving us more vulnerable and more reviled in the world. I'm just some guy from Denver who admittedly has little frame of reference to the oppression felt by all the subjugated people of the world. I can't imagine their pain, and I can't hope to end it. Few people attack and destroy for fun. They are responding to a crucible of circumstances beyond their control. But circumstances of pain and terror surround millions in this world, but only a few take it upon themselves to murder and destroy. I don't understand those people, and I have little desire to empathize with them. It may be that they are beyond redemption. \n kgmaximus \n I live in Manhattan, the upper west side.I was getting ready for work and I heard it happen on the TV, as I went over to the TV I seen the second plane hit the second Tower. That's when I knew for sure it wasn't any type of accident! I'm sorry to say that I feel our goverment plays a big part in letting something this serious happen! If they wouldn't let anybody and everybody in this country, this might not have happened. And the worst part is they came here and lived here for over a year with their families, and we taught them how to fly the planes that were used as weapons against America! From a very sad New Yorker \n perfectone4ever \n I have been watching in horror, anger and disbelief at what has been unfolding in the Nation's capital, in the fields of Pittsburg and in New York City. As a resident of Oklahoma City, the emotion and sentiment that is being felt here is overwhelming in the most horrendous terrorist incident to occur in the wake of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Office building. New York and Washington..we want you to know that we support you and stand behind you in any way that we can. It would appear that at this point, military action is inevitable and that the United States will most likely, in concert with other nations, methodically and systematically hunt down and eliminate many terrorist groups. We as a nation should play a role against terrorism and make patriotism an act that takes place EVERY DAY, not only when a national disaster occurs. I wish that I could be at ground zero offering assistance more directly to our heroes of the fire, medical and police departments as well as all of the other heroes who may go unmentioned, but I want them to know my thoughts and prayers are with them all. \n eaneau \n This is the most important event of my life. The world will be re-founded by this event, lets hope that our leaders allow this event to reshape our society, that our children should inhabit a better world. On many war memorials it states 'Lest We Forget. Let our children not forget the terror we allowed to infect then strike down, our hope and freedom. \n All my family hold out hope for missing Americans.. \n Nik Palmer (Nottingham. UK) \n nikpalmer \n I am pleased to write in the nyt forums...thank you. On a darker note.... i can't stop thinking about the short term and long term effects that will undoubtly come from the American situation. My dad wishes that Reagan was the president right now, so that he would react impulsively (like in the Pan Am bombing..) -- but then he took this event as an \"opportunity\" to tell me to re-evaluate my religious views and start praying because he suggests that this is the beginning of the end, as prophesized. What do you think? I am an avid disliker of G. Bush... regarding his Kyoto protocal business, and the nuclear defense system. I was unimpressed by his speech to the nation... Do you think that this attack [of evil] was stictly the Palestines, or a coalition. At first when i heard the news it was at work (i work in the Victoria Int'l airport) and the person didn't like americans, so i thought it was a joke to have a better day or something. THen my second reaction was oooh that george bush.. a conspiracy to strengthen his side for the defense w. nuclear weaponry etc... now i am totally at a loss. there is so many things to speculate, so many ways that this could pan out.... Anyways, i wrote an email to much music, becuase they were asking people to call/fax/email in thier thoughts: \n Indeed, this is as disgusting and unsuspected an act of terrorism as it is ruthless, and I feel for all who are involved, or will be, with this inevitable conflict of war. \n This is a terrible loss, but no more terrible than similar if not the same losses suffered in other countries on our planet. The thing is, that these kind of terrorist attacks are not consistent blows to our economy, and country - as they are and have been in other countries around the globe, where it holds their economy stagnate, unable to grow and prosper. I am confident that America and Americans will come out of this fine, and perhaps stronger. \n I think the concept of holding lives at a higher value because you are the subject, or you idealize yourself as more prosperous, or a bigger part of the global network... is improper. Because you are written in history books in a positive light, it indicates that the value of your existance as greater than that of those viewed in a shady light - and more attention and sorrow should be delivered to your door? \n The fact that this now occures literally in our backyards makes us sick, and upset, and confused. This is, naturally, a subjective reaction we are having; it means that we have compassion, and that we can feel for our losses, we are... humanitarians in this aspect. But we must be careful not to prove that we have this compassion only for our own Nation, North America. It appears selfish; and no doubt this is what terrorized countries such as Palestine are thinking... as they watch us in our time of tragedy. \n I try to feel as much or as little as I have or have not felt for the innocent victims of WWII, or Kosovo, or Palestine. It is important to acknowledge when such lives, and such architecture are destroyed... and important to recognize this as a message, perhaps an indication of change or a wake up, that needs to occur to perpetuate the harmony that American citizens have lived in up till now. I fear for what is to come, and I feel for what has been lost to this 'cause' which has left us all, myself included, shaken, confused and afraid. \n I hope that you find the time to respond... it's important to me to talk to all those who i think can offer something different, if not more educated about this... I am sure that you are having discussions every day about this, and what it might mean. I am envious that i am not there to be a part of the discussions. Take care of you and yours... \n -Rebekah Sidney, BC CANADA \n diktatorbexx \n annemarie71 \"Did our grandparents celebrate the victory of Allied Forces over the Germans? And are they our fellow Dutchmen who party wildly after Holland has won a soccer match from Germany? And do they party by mocking and beating up Germans? Yes!\" \n Stranger things have happened. If your enemy is hurt, you celebrate. Don't be too much put off by the scenes you saw in your own city. Look at the 'how' and 'why'! What is it exactly that they are celebrating? Why are these people so happy? \n remcogoris \n In my neighborhood, Oak Lawn, Illinois, last night over 500 people( teenagers mainly) made demonstrations at the local Mosque. Dressed in what they felt most represented America ( cowboy hats , tee shirts, American and Confederate flags.....)These children know nothing of patriotism, or what it means to be an American. They know not of love, loyalty, duty or charity. To them this was just a way to raise some hell. I wonder if they ever thought of organizing a blood drive at their school, or soliciting donations of clothing , face masks or money to send to New York. What happened in this country on 9/11 was the most horrible thing that my generation could ever imagine. My father fought in WW2, was himself at Pearl Harbour right after the bombing, and in total gave 23 years of his life to the Navy, I never in my lifetime thought that I would see the kind of horrors that he saw while in the service. These young adults that were protesting at the Mosque, would they ever give 23 years of their life to defend the country that they supposedly love? There are serious problems that this country has to face now, decisions need to be made and actions need to be taken, what we do not need now are uncontrollable children and adults making our problems worse by committing hate crimes. People please devote your time now to helping our nation not hindering it. \n kolbacki \n A \"War on Terrorism\" is of course a noble and just objective...however, it also implies the same mindset that supports the \"War on Drugs\"...treat the symptom and not the disease. Let us recall that during the USSR-Afghani war in the early-mid 80's, bin Laden was a CIA \"asset\", as indeed are current elements of the Taliban, created and armed by joint US-Pakistani military efforts at that time..now, our declared \"enemies\". Sure, take out bin Laden and the bulk of his so-called cells...then what? Will that be \"victory over terrorism?\" Hardly, as long as the root causes of anti-Americanism exist, which chiefly concern Palestinian claims in the Middle East going unheeded, in the eyes of these supporters. Until and unless the US is prepared to once again actively bring its good offices to bear in resolving a 50+year conflict, new groups will emerge which again will attempt to inflict hideous and calamitous damages against American targets, both at home and abroad. \n barrisj \n Stop it. The attack on the U.S. was an attack on US all. Now comes the bickering--you're on their side--no, I'm not--yes, you are. Get a grip. \n jfeir should be able to express his/her thoughts without having to suffer personal attack. The air attack using our own domestic airlines was as personal attack as they come on US all. \n And, here you have the temerity to argue about who supports the terrorist by virtue of the fact that the poster was in actuality trying for some levity--in a jaded sort of way. \n Stop this madness. The mad men are still out there somewhere--may be even still in our midst plotting new malevolent mayhem and destruction. \n To fight amongst ourselves is to become discouraged. To become discouraged means to become weakened. \n Right now is the time when we must be strong for ourselves and for each other. Otherwise, the assault on America continues--but with us attacking each other. \n The bodies of those who died at the WTC and the Pentagon have yet to be identified. I'm only certain that once identified there will be Anglo-Americans, Jewish Americans, Arab Americans, African Americans, Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, Latino Americans, and so on. \n We are a diverse people from varying backgrounds and cultures. Still we all are influenced by being also of the American culture--one that recognizes the multi-racial, -ethnic, -cultural backgrounds that make us so unique in the world. \n We all are US. \n sfcreader \n the world has changed. \n people must take personal individual responsibility for their own freedom, while still working as part of the greater community. there are many places that are still vulnerable. it wouldn't be tough for someone to roll a coordinated set of tanker trucks out to the middle of the Golden Gate bridge and do the same thing. there are hundreds of other opportunities as well. tactically, we need to -- as individuals -- take responsibility. \n the air aspect of this is a significant one. and we can't, finanically, afford to have armed marshalls on every flight. even if we did, it is likely that 6 trained terrorists could overpower one marshall, even if he was armed. those hijackers may not be \"armed\" with anything other than information, so airport security checkpoints are useless. instead of knives and box cutters, the bastards from tuesday could have easily walked on *unarmed*, walked up to first class, and grabbed steak knives and achieved the same effect. \n Requirements of a step toward individual freedom on this particular threat: - coverage on every flight - ability to thwart multiple hijackers on a single flight \n Suggestion: major airlines work together with appropriate training authorities to form a \"Volunteer Air Safety Corps.\" the people who fly the most (\"premier,\" \"1K,\" \"admiral's club\" - type fliers) are, typically on planes, by definition, many days out of the year. also, although a stereotype, many of these people are \"type-a\" who would likely be willing and able to work together to thwart a concerted attack. it is rumored that a gentleman of this type (a COO from the bay area) worked with others to storm the cabin on the Pennsylvania flight. although the flight was lost, it is possible -- likely -- that their actions saved hundreds, if not thousands, of lives. i, for one, would be willing to myself pay for this type of training, and would be the first to sign up. i have a feeling that others would as well. \n help spread the meme. \n peace, \n Interested parties should send mail to: volunteerairsafety@hotmail.com \n airsafety \n Americans are going to lash out at any person they see that looks Middle Eastern. This has happened before. Our Government put thousands of Asians in internment camps after Pearl Harbor even though 99% of them had no desire to be connected to Japan, and many who were not even Japanese! Who's to say that this won't happen to Palestinian Americans now? We must make sure that it doesn't. Lastly, I want to sum up this letter. This is a horrible act that is unprecedented in this country, and this is a turning point in all of our lives. What we do now is an example for future generations in their struggles to live decent lives. If we strike out at the first enemy that we perceive, as we have a history of doing, just to placate many Americans who are now after blood, we will have done a great wrong. If we do find the actual enemy and lash out at them, we will have solved nothing. More will be dead, probably many more than those who were to blame, and we will have stooped to our attackers level. It is true that terrorism is going to be a major hurdle from now on, but upping security and waging a war are not the answers. We must find a more permanent solution, within our Governments treatment of other countries and their policies. The President says that this is an act of war. Why does it have to be? There are so many other answers. \n Sincerely, \n Patrick Liddy Senior, University of Southern Maine. \n spinalapt \n While I, an Australian, feel horror and disbelief at yesterdays events, and excrutiating sympathy with those who seek their loved ones in vain, I am alarmed at the tone of some posts on this forum. \n \"-let us carry on as normal,let us make America even financially greater, more powerful etc. etc\" \n This is the tone that set off the events in the first place - the tone of reactionary fanaticism. \n In time of great crisis, always act as if something DID happen. There are lessons here. I think the people who just want to hug their families, mourn the dead, give thanks for being alive have got it right. \n America has the power to carry out vast military reprisals anywhere. It is America's very power that prompted this attack. \n Being so powerful carries equally great responsibility. The world must change because of this, but change must come from within, not applied in an allopathic military attack in retaliation that could see even more innocent peoples of the world suffer death and destruction. \n If Bush has any sense he will stick to his quietly determined investigatory path, and not inflame the nation with talk of horrific reprisals. \n adelerose \n We have just had a 3 minute silence here in Scotland and it has compelled me to write to let you all know that our thoughts are with you in regard to this terrible devastation throughout the US. \n Also I want to tell you a brief story which not only has touched me personally but which shows the strength, resilience, courage, and thoughtfulness of New Yorkers and the American people as a whole at this extremely challenging time. \n Today was to be my wedding day, I was going to be married at the top of the Empire State Building and then go on for dinner at \"Windows on the World\", the restaurant at the top of the World Trade Center. Our flights were cancelled and our plans ruined, but obviously this is nothing; absolutely nothing, compared to the lives that have been needlessly destroyed, the innocent families torn apart, and the hopes lost due to this terrible act. \n We had someone helping us co-ordinate our wedding plans in NYC and soon after the attacks she contacted us to say how sorry she was our marriage was unable to go ahead! This not only amazed me, but deeply touched me that she was actually concerned about our plans which seemed to me so insignificant compared to the horror that was unfolding in her home city. Added to this we had two bagpipe players that were going to give us a Scottish feel to our proceedings at the top of the ESB. Again the telephone rang in my home on Tuesday night (goodness knows how they got a line out?) and they also let me know how sad they were that our wedding could not take place - this despite the fact that one of their close friends is a fire-fighter who was still missing in the destruction. \n I think this shows us that if these people have the strength, not only to carry on, but to think of others at this time, then we must all have the strength within us to carry on and ultimately never allow terrorism to win any victory over humanity. \n I've requested my fiance\u0301e's bridal bouquet to be placed with the other tributes and candles within the city, but I can assure you that the two of us will travel to NYC this year and have our marriage blessed atop the Empire State. If we were to do otherwise I feel it would be somehow giving these \"people\" and their cowardly acts a small victory. \n Once again our deepest thoughts are with you, and ALL of us in Scotland hope and pray your families and friends are safe and secure. \n God Bless. \n Kerr \n kerr_girvan \n 200,000 Iraqis died during or immediately following the Gulf War. At least a million Iraqis, half of them children, have died as a result of the embargoes since then. \n Osama bin Laden's terrorist training camps were built with American money and backing. \n The commander of the U.S. ship that shot down an Iranian airliner carrying 290 innocent civilians was given a Legion of Merit award for \"outstanding service.\" \n U.S. government has supported terror tactics and totalitarian violence throughout the third world, has consisting moved to destroy any popular movements that would threaten the stability of abusive U.S. economic programs in those countries. \n This week's attack was not an attak on freedom. It was part of a struggle to survive. Was it right? No. Did those people deserve to die? No. But let's not lie to ourselves. Let's be big enough to admit why this is happening. Crying for the lives lost in NY and DC? You should be. It was a tragedy. But, then, try to remember to cry now and then for the countless millions of people we slaughter out of CNN's sight; try to cry for the people we exploit and destroy all across the world. \n jimtzu \n On one hand, I'm shocked by the number of \"blame the U.S.\" and \"it's Israel's fault\" messages posted here over the past few days. On the other hand, I suppose it's comforting that those messages have been posted over and over again by the same four or five knuckleheads whose opinions aren't shared by the vast majority of Americans who are looking for an appropriate way to respond to these attacks. \n I consider myself fairly liberal - never voted Republican in my life - but I'm sure not going to use this time to hang my head and fret over why certain groups hate the U.S. It doesn't matter, not now anyway - there's no excuse for this slaughter. \n originalray \n Dear American friends \n Firstly I want to offer my deepest condolences to those of you that have lost your loved ones in the tragic events that have taken place in your country, and that we witnessed on our TVs while it were happening. Everyone here in Norway is with you in thoughts and payers. \n The Norwegian people have very strong ties, both though friendship and kinship, to you Americans. We chare your ideals of political and religious freedom for all peoples, and through our common history the USA have been our most important ally in safeguarding our political and economical freedom. We therefor regard these malicious attacks on you to be attacks on ourselves as well. We are united with you and will support you and your leaders in whatever way we can in hunting down and bringing those responsible to justice. \n As your friend I would thus like to chare a prayer with you: \n Lord Save us through this difficult period of our lives. Don't let us nourish hatred in our harts, but guide us in making also Arabs and Muslims our friends. We know also they worship you and are your children. Make our politicians acknowledge the words of Jesus Christ - Matthew 5:21-32 and 38-48. \n God blesses us all. \n Magne A. Eek, Oslo, Norway - magne.eek@start.no \n magneeek \n Unspeakable horror has been visited upon innocent civilians in the U.S. I was in a logging camp when the news was announced. At first, I could not believe what I was seeing. Was this an accident? Obviously not, as events progressed, and the south tower was hit. Many of us here in Canada are shocked and saddened. Our hearts go out to all affected. However, the question \"Why?\" was not discussed; it is obvious that these acts are a function of a rage that has been brewing for a long time against the 'powers that be' in America. When Baghdad was bombed I thought it an outrage. The 'surgical strikes' in Kosovo, the materiel provided to terrorize Palestinians, the arrogant stance taken as regards the Kyoto agreement, the abandonment of the Durban anti-rascism conference... the list goes on, a litany of terror and wanton disregard for the welfare of our planet...what the hell did you expect? Which country used nuclear weapons against civilians? 180,000 innocent people flashed out of existence in an eyeblink! Think about it. 42,000 people die on your highways every year, 3.2 million injured. At the same time wrecking the planet's atmosphere. You refuse to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, refuse to assemble against rascism, refuse to end the reign of terror on almost every nation and ecosystem wworldwide. While I do not condone violence as a means to an end, the karma (or lack of it!) the U.S. has gathered must be the reason for these events. Your policy makers have made much of the world your enemies. Perhaps it is time to change, rather than blindly call for revenge and more bloodshed. More killing will not end the cycle of violence. More compassion and understanding will. \n hollymogan \n \u2022 NO ORCHESTRATED SADNESS, PLEASE \n A \u201cNational Day of Mourning\u201d is utterly inappropriate and transparently manipulative.

What we saw on our tv screen on Tuesday afternoon here was beyond comprehension, and to echo the sentiments expressed by Tony Blair it truly does feel that we are all together in this. I hope it is of some little comfort to know how appreciated America is in this country, your help and heroism in WW2 has not been forgotten and we only hope that we can in some way now try to repay you for this via support and assistance. On a personal level, this has shaken me so much, although I don't live in America, have never been to America, your country is engrained deeply in Britian and it feels that the foundations of British society have been shaken too. I realise that given the circumstances it may not have been given much coverage in the USA but there was today a service of remembrance in St Pauls, it was so moving and again, I hope it is of some comfort to kknow our thoughts and prayers are with you all. God bless. \n lisaoliver \n Well it's still morning here, and mornings these days are very very tough, they really are. So much to absorb... that almost as quickly as you try you are overwhelmed. I don't know if I can ever go to lower Manhattan again without breaking down. I seesaw between hate and despair... R$% is more defiant. The only consolation we have is our friends, family and the tremendous outpouring of support from around the world... it strikes me as totally amazing. It really helps, thank you, thank you, thank you. \n In todays New York Times was an article about rebuilding... the article ends by saying \"it would be also be nice to have one, maybe even two, new tall towers on the former site to once again anchor the NYC skyline, even larger than the ones they replace\". \n After I read this, I faintly smile and try to imagine what they will be like. \n romjac \n I am extremely concerned about the safety of Arab-Americans and muslims living within the United States during the current crisis. Actually I should expand that to include Sikhs and others who might be mistaken for being Middle Eastern. We have a great many ignorant yahoos in our country who seem to be prepared to engage in physical attacks against people and property belonging to groups they perceive to be different and threatening. I for one will gladly show my solidarity with the local muslim community in my city, if, as now appears sadly to be certain, these incidents escalate in the coming days as the enormity of September 11th sinks in, if need be, I will place myself physically between haters and muslims if this situation gets out of hand. We cannot let this country descend into the sort of barbarism we are trying to defeat!!! Who will join me? \n shuar1 \n The United States of America is a violent country. On the moment they arrived they started killing the native Americans. After that, they have been fighting against the Spanish, the English, and themselves and who reads the history books will see that they have never stopped. There is no decade in which they had not an armed conflict. Of course is the other party to blame for that. Neither it is a free country. Perhaps it is for middle- and higher classes, but the lower classes (a lot larger than for instance in The Netherlands) does not think this way. Two bad - paid jobs or social security of the lowest level is like just not drowning or slavery, it is certainly no freedom. That there are three times as many people in prison compared with the Netherlands can - of course again - not have anything to do with the system. A country were the Law stands higher than moral or ethics, where the most important job is only available for someone who carries lots of money, ideas don't matter anymore. A country that does not allow that their genetic manipulated junk is refused, responsible for 43 % of all the CO2 and is not willing to do anything about it, and there is a lot more. Nevertheless the USA thinks she can tell the world how things are and must be, but every lunatic has the right to think he is God. So far so good. But the USA uses military and economic power for things too easily and too often, and not everyone does like that. So instead of declaring war number-so-many, the USA - population only 5 % of the whole world - could try to pull out her far too large pants on the worlds stage. It would make Osama bin Laden unemployed, and automatically they won't have to fear any terrorist attacks anymore. It is just an idea. \n olfjdudink \n Pgunkel1: \n \"A \u201cNational Day of Mourning\u201d is utterly inappropriate and transparently manipulative....\" \n I'm sorry, as a Mahattanite who feels personally devastated by the attack, that for me, such a day of mourning will surely help all of us to grieve. \n I can't express enough my gratitude for all the heartfelt messages of support from other parts of the country as well as from Europe, Asia etc... it is truly a resounding message that in spite of the sometimes fiercly expressed political/ religeous/theological differrences with the US government, we never, ever were alone and are a cherished member of teh worls family. \n Thank you thank you thank you! \n romjac \n As fate would have it, I was leaving New York on a jet flight that took off 45 minutes before the unthinkable happened. By the time we landed in Detroit, chaos had broken out. When I grasped the fact that American security had broken down so tragically, I couldn't respond at first. My wife and son were also in the air on separate flights, one to Los Angeles, one to San Diego. My body went absolutely rigid with fear. All I could think about was their safety, and it took several hours before I found out that their flights had been diverted and both were safe. Strangely, when the good news came, my body still felt that it had been hit by a truck. Of its own accord it seemed to feel a far greater trauma that reached out to the thousands who would not survive and the tens of thousands who would survive only to live through months and years of hell. And I asked myself, Why didn't I feel this way last week? Why didn't my body go stiff during the bombing of Iraq or Bosnia? Around the world my horror and worry are experienced every day. Mothers weep over horrendous loss, civilians are bombed mercilessly, refugees are ripped from any sense of home or homeland. Why did I not feel their anguish enough to call a halt to it? As we hear the calls for tightened American security and a fierce military response to terrorism, it is obvious that none of us has any answers. However, we feel compelled to ask some questions. Everything has a cause, so we have to ask, What was the root cause of this evil? We must find out not superficially but at the deepest level. There is no doubt that such evil is alive all around the world and is even celebrated. Does this evil grow from the suffering and anguish felt by people we don't know and therefore ignore? Have they lived in this condition for a long time? One assumes that whoever did this attack feels implacable hatred for America. Why were we selected to be the focus of suffering around the world? All this hatred and anguish seems to have religion at its basis. Isn't something terribly wrong when jihads and wars develop in the name of God? Isn't God invoked with hatred in Ireland, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Israel, Palestine, and even among the intolerant sects of America? Can any military response make the slightest difference in the underlying cause? Is there not a deep wound at the heart of humanity? If there is a deep wound, doesn't it affect everyone? When generations of suffering respond with bombs, suicidal attacks, and biological warfare, who first developed these weapons? Who sells them? Who gave birth to the satanic technologies now being turned against us? If all of us are wounded, will revenge work? Will punishment in any form toward anyone solve the wound or aggravate it? Will an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and limb for a limb, leave us all blind, toothless and crippled? Tribal warfare has been going on for two thousand years and has now been magnified globally. Can tribal warfare be brought to an end? Is patriotism and nationalism even relevant anymore, or is this another form of tribalism? What are you and I as persons going to do about what is happening? Can we afford to let the deeper wound fester any longer? Everyone is calling this an attack on America, but is it not a rift in our collective soul? Isn't this an attack on civilization from without that is also from within? When we have secured our safety once more and cared for the wounded, after the period of shock and mourning is over, it will be time for soul searching. I only hope that these questions are confronted with the deepest spiritual intent. None of us will feel safe again behind the shield of military might and stockpiled arsenals. There can be no safety until the root cause is faced. In this moment of shock I don't think anyone of us has the answers. It is imperative that we pray and offer solace and help to each other. But if you and I are having a single thought of violence or hatred against anyone in the world at this moment, we are contributing to the wounding of the world. \n Love, Deepak Chopra \n liberace3 \n Registering with this New York Times Message Board was the only way I could think of to communicate with some of the citizens of New York from a small town in the north of England. \n I merely wanted to say to all who read this that you are not alone.

You seem once again to want to mindlessly follow yet another assumed infallibility on the part of our government leaders' wisdom in the decisions they are making on our behalf. Are you also willing to step forward and declare a personal boycott against the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City next year in the aftermath of our Afghanistan invasion?

Who would hide in the cellar and have their freedoms slowly striped from them in the name of a war against terrorism, when they could be out gaining freedom. This has always been the true meaning of our flag and the sole foundation of America's greatness.

Since these awful attacks, there has been much talk of showing the spirit of America and coming together as a nation. Yet in these same few days there have been reports of some of the most un-American and cowardly acts I can conceive of. Namely, the desecration and vandalism of Mosques and Muslim and Arab owned stores around the nation, and the harassment of Muslim and Arab American citizens of this great nation. As a school child I was taught that one of America\u2019s lowest moments was the interment of Japanese Americans during World War Two. Today\u2019s attacks on the civil rights and dignity of Arab Americans have shown the same ugly face that so many hoped we had left behind. \n I am also an Israeli citizen and served my tour of duty in the military there, including one year spent in then occupied Southern Lebanon. I have seen the face of terror and lost friends to its cold hand. If America and Americans want to truly stand up to terror and those that would demean and destroy our country, then we must not let them drag us down into the realm of bigotry and injustice. As someone who has held a rifle in his hand in the time of war, I too seek justice and crave retribution, but I will not stand silently by and watch righteous fury applied in an unjust manner. \n These attacks against the Arab and Muslim American community should be condemned with the same furor that we apply to the bombings of African American churches in the South, attacks against the Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, and all other hateful acts of violence and prejudice. We Americans need to stand together in this time of National crisis, not as Christians, Jews, or Muslims, but as one great nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. \n adar Susskind "}, {"text": "HOLY WARRIORS -- First of three articles: A Network of Terror; One Man and a Global Web of Violence\n2001-01-14T05:00:00.000Z\nMr. bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire, would use his camps in Afghanistan to take holy warriors from around the world -- who had always pursued local goals -- and shape them into an international network that would fight to bring all Muslims under a militant version of Islamic law.\nSome of his comrades in arms warned him that the goal was unattainable.\n''I talked to Osama one day and asked him what was he doing,'' recalled Abdullah Anas, an Algerian who was fighting in Afghanistan at the time and provided a rare personal narrative of the formation of Mr. bin Laden's organization. '' 'Imagine after five years a guy from Malaysia goes back to his country. How can he remember you are his leader? He will get married, have children, engage in work in his country. How can you establish one camp for jihad in the world?' ''\nBut he and other doubters watched as Mr. bin Laden, who is now America's most wanted terror suspect, set about doing just that. Mr. Anas's account and those of other witnesses, along with intelligence from United States, the Middle East and Europe, draw a vivid and newly detailed portrait of the birth of a modern jihad movement. What began as a holy war against the Soviet Union took on a new dimension, Mr. Anas said, when Mr. bin Laden broke away and established a new corps of militant Muslims whose ambitions reached far beyond the borders of Afghanistan.\nFrom his Afghan camps, Mr. bin Laden created a kind of clearinghouse for Islamic terrorism, which American officials say not only conducts its own operations but trains and underwrites local militants, connecting home-grown plots to a global crusade.\nHis strategy is aptly captured by one of his many code names: The Contractor. The group he founded 13 years ago, Al Qaeda, Arabic for The Base, is led by masterful opportunists who tailor their roles to the moment, sometimes teaching the fine points of explosives, sometimes sending in their own operatives, sometimes simply supplying inspiration.\nThe group has become a beacon for Muslim Malaysians, Algerians, Filipinos, Palestinians, Egyptians, even Americans who have come to view the United States as their enemy, an imperial power propping up corrupt and godless governments. Mr. bin Laden has tried to bridge divisions in a movement long plagued by doctrinal, ethnic and geographic differences. ''Local politics drives what they're doing, but it's much more visionary,'' said Robert Blitzer, a former F.B.I. counterterrorism official. ''This is worldwide. This is, 'We want to be somewhere in a hundred years.' ''\nAccording to a recent Central Intelligence Agency analysis, Al Qaeda operates about a dozen Afghan camps that have trained as many as 5,000 militants, who in turn have created cells in 50 countries. Intelligence officials say the group is experimenting with chemical weapons, including nerve gas, at one of its camps.\nMr. bin Laden and his supporters use centuries-old interpretations of the Koran to justify violence in the name of God against fellow Muslims or bystanders -- a vision on the farthest extremes of one of the world's largest religions. But their operations are thoroughly modern -- encrypted e-mail, bomb-making recipes stored on CD-ROM's, cell phones and satellite communications.\nThe group plans attacks months or years in advance, investigators say. A former United States Army sergeant, Ali A. Mohamed -- who worked for Mr. bin Laden and is now a government witness -- has told prosecutors that Al Qaeda trains ''sleeper'' agents, or ''submarines,'' to live undetected among local populations.\nMr. bin Laden has not achieved his more ambitious goals. He has not brought more Muslims under the rule of Islamic law, toppled any of the Arab governments he took aim at, or driven the United States out of the Middle East. His violence has repulsed many believers and prompted severe crackdowns in Arab states that already have limited political freedoms.\nNonetheless, he and his small inner circle have preoccupied American officials, paralyzing embassies, thwarting military exercises and making Americans abroad feel anxious and vulnerable. Earlier this month, the United States closed its Rome embassy for nearly two days after intelligence officials warned of a possible attack.\nAmerican officials have charged Mr. bin Laden with masterminding the 1998 bombings of two embassies in Africa that killed more than 200 people, and suspect him of involvement in the October bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen, which killed 17 sailors. Four men went on trial this month in lower Manhattan in the African bombings.\nAmerican authorities are also examining Al Qaeda's role in three plots timed to millennium celebrations in 1999 -- attacks directed at another American ship, a so-far unknown target in the United States, and tourist sites and a hotel in Jordan.\nMr. bin Laden's group has recently attempted operations against Israel -- a significant departure, American and Middle Eastern officials say. They acknowledge that he has ensured his organization's survival, in the event of his capture or death, by designating a successor: his longtime aide, Abdulaziz abu Sitta, an Egyptian known as Muhammad Atef or Abu Hoffs al-Masri. Last week, according to Al Jazeera, an Arab satellite channel, his son married Mr. Masri's daughter in Kandahar, Afghanistan.\n''His arrest, which we dearly hope for, is only one step along the road of the many things we need to do to eliminate the network of organizations,'' said Richard A. Clarke, the top White House counterterrorism official.\nThe Cause\nAfghan War Draws Young Arab Fighters\nAl Qaeda grew out of the jihad inspired by Muslim scholars to combat the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. They issued religious rulings, known as fatwas, which exhorted Muslims everywhere to defend the Islamic land of Afghanistan from infidels. Over the next few years, several thousand young Arab men joined the Afghan resistance.\nOne of the first to answer the call was a young Algerian named Boujema Bounouar, who went by the nom de guerre Abdullah Anas. In recent interviews in London, where he now lives, Mr. Anas recounted how Mr. bin Laden went to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets and was drawn to a group of Egyptians who wanted to start a global jihad.\nMr. Anas, who is now a leader of an Algerian Islamic political party, is not a dispassionate observer. He acknowledges that he opposed Mr. bin Laden, whose program of terrorism, he says, has tarred the reputations of thousands of Arabs who fought honorably for the Afghan cause. But his firsthand account, which conforms with Western intelligence analysis, provides one of few portraits of Mr. bin Laden's evolution as a militant leader.\nThe two men were defined by many of the same forces. Mr. Anas said his journey from teacher of the Koran to holy warrior began in 1984, when he was 25 and living with his family in Western Algeria. Visiting the local library, he read in a news weekly about a religious ruling that waging war against the Soviets was every Muslim's duty.\n''After a few days, everyone heard about this fatwa and started talking,'' he recalled. '' 'Where is this Afghanistan? Which people are they? How can we go there? How much is the ticket?' ''\nThat year, Mr. Anas was among the million Muslims who participated in the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. ''You feel very holy,'' he said. ''People from all over the world. From Zimbabwe to New Delhi. Everyone is wearing just two pieces of white cotton. Everybody. You can't describe who is the minister, who is the president. No jewelry. No good suit.''\nIn Mecca, he said, prayer leaders spoke emotionally about the jihad in Afghanistan.\nHe was standing in the marble expanse of the Great Mosque with 50,000 others when, he said, a friend pointed out a radical Palestinian scholar who was organizing the Arab support for the Afghans. His name was Abdullah Azzam, and his writings, which would help spur the revival of the jihad movement in the 20th century, were just becoming widely known.\nMr. Anas introduced himself and asked whether the magazine article he had seen in the library was correct. Had the religious leaders agreed that fighting in Afghanistan was a duty of all Muslims?\n''He said, 'Yes, it's true.' ''\n'' 'O.K.,' I said. 'If I want to go to Afghanistan, what do I do now?' ''\nMr. Azzam gave him a business card with a telephone number in Islamabad, Pakistan, where he was a university professor. A week later, Mr. Anas was on a flight from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan.\nHe had no idea where he was going, or what he would do. He dialed the only phone number he knew in Pakistan, reaching Mr. Azzam, who offered him a place to stay in his own house, a bustling salon frequented by students and scholars.\nIt was there that he first caught sight of Mr. Azzam's youngest daughter, whom he would marry five years later. And Mr. Azzam introduced him to a Saudi visitor identified in the traditional Arabic way, as Abu Abdullah, the father of his eldest son, Abdullah. The visitor was Osama bin Laden.\nThe two men exchanged pleasantries. Mr. bin Laden's name was well known. He was said to be the youngest of 24 brothers in a family that ran one of the largest construction companies in the Arab world.\nMr. bin Laden seemed no different from the other Arab volunteers who were starting to arrive in Pakistan, Mr. Anas recalled. The conversation turned to how the volunteers could help the Afghans win their jihad, and teach them more about Islam.\nThe Soviet forces had a considerable advantage in the Afghan conflict. Their helicopter gunships controlled the air, and their troops held the main roads. But the rebels had powerful friends. The United States and Saudi Arabia were spending millions funneling arms to the Afghans through Pakistan's intelligence service.\nMr. Anas began by teaching the Koran to the Afghan rebels, who did not speak Arabic and learned the verses by rote. He also led prayers at a ''guest house'' set up in Pakistan for Arab volunteers. At the time, he said, there were no more than a few dozen Arabs in the country, working with the rebels. None spoke the Afghan languages.\nAfter a few months, Mr. Anas said, he trekked into Afghanistan to join a combat unit, one of three Arabs traveling with a caravan of 600 Afghan soldiers. He learned Farsi and took on the role of mediator, traveling among the feuding rebel camps. He spent most of each year inside Afghanistan.\nMr. Anas became a top aide to Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud, whose troops controlled northern Afghanistan and are now fighting the Taliban rulers -- who support Mr. bin Laden.\nLike many Muslims who joined the rebels, Mr. Anas expected to die in the Afghan jihad and earn the special status designated in the Koran for martyrs, which includes forgiveness of sins and the enjoyment in Paradise of beautiful virgins. ''It's not the main idea to be a shahid,'' or martyr, he said. ''But it's part of my plan.''\nIn the mid-1980's, American and Middle Eastern intelligence officials say, Mr. bin Laden moved to Peshawar, a Pakistani city near the border with Afghanistan. The city was a staging ground for the war against the Soviets; American, French and Pakistani intelligence officers intrigued and competed there to manipulate the Afghan cause to their countries' advantage.\nMr. bin Laden's fortune of several hundred million dollars gained him immediate popularity.\n''He was one of the guys who came to jihad in Afghanistan,'' Mr. Anas said. ''But unlike the others, what he had was a lot of money. He's not very sophisticated politically or organizationally. But he's an activist with great imagination. He ate very little. He slept very little. Very generous. He'd give you his clothes. He'd give you his money.''\nMr. Anas, who returned annually to Pakistan from the Afghan battlefields to visit with Mr. Azzam, said Mr. bin Laden at first slept in the guest house in Peshawar on a cushion on the floor. He recalled that Mr. Azzam liked to say: ''You see, this man has everything in his country. You see he lives with all the poor people in this room.''\nAt about this time, in 1984, Mr. Azzam set up the organization that would play a pivotal role in the global jihad over the next decade. It was called the Makhtab al Khadimat, the Office of Services, and its goal was to recruit and train Muslim volunteers for the Afghan fronts. Mr. Azzam raised money for the organization in countries overseas including the United States and gave impassioned speeches promoting the Afghan cause. Mr. bin Laden embraced the idea from its inception and became Mr. Azzam's partner, providing financial support and handling military affairs.\nMr. bin Laden worked best with small groups, Mr. Anas said. ''When you sit with Osama, you don't want to leave the meeting,'' he said. ''You wish to continue talking to him because he is very calm, very fluent.''\nA main goal of the Office of Services, Mr. Anas said, was to prevent the increasing number of outside volunteers from taking sides in the rebels' factional struggles. ''We are in Afghanistan to help the jihad and all the Afghan people,'' Mr. Azzam told him.\nBut there was increasing frustration from many of the disaffected young Muslims over Mr. Azzam's insistence that the Office of Services support only the Afghan cause -- when many were agitated about the plight of their own homelands. Some approached Mr. bin Laden.\n''They told him: 'You shouldn't be staying with Abdullah Azzam. He doesn't do anything about the regimes -- Saudi, Egyptian, Algerian. He's just talking about Afghanistan,' '' Mr. Anas said.\n''These people are always saying to Osama: 'You should establish something. Have a clear idea to use these people after Afghanistan for other wars.' ''\nAmong those most ardently courting Mr. bin Laden was a group of Egyptian radicals called the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which helped assassinate President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981.\nThe Egyptian group advocated the overthrow of governments by terrorism and violence, and one of its key figures, Ayman al-Zawahiri, had taken shelter in Afghanistan. Mr. Anas said -- and Western intelligence agencies agree -- that Dr. Zawahiri was a commanding early influence on Mr. bin Laden. Today he is part of Al Qaeda's leadership, according to intelligence officials.\nBut Mr. Azzam quarreled bitterly with the Egyptians.\nMr. Anas said he once witnessed a heated argument between Mr. Azzam and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a radical religious scholar, who argued that the flouting of Islamic law had turned Presidents Mohammed Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt into infidels who could therefore be killed. Sheik Abdel Rahman later moved to Brooklyn, where he was associated with an Office of Services branch. In 1995 he was convicted of plotting to blow up New York landmarks.\nIn 1986, according to Mr. Anas and Middle Eastern intelligence officials, Mr. bin Laden began to chart a separate course. He established his own training camp for Persian Gulf Arabs, a group of about 50 who lived in tents set apart from the other Afghan fighters. He called the camp Al Masadah -- The Lion's Den.\nWithin little more than a year the movement divided, as Mr. bin Laden and the Egyptians founded Al Qaeda -- the ''base'' for what they hoped would be a global crusade.\nMr. Anas said Mr. Azzam confided to him that Egyptian ideologues had wooed Mr. bin Laden away, gaining access to his money. ''He told me one time: 'I'm very upset about Osama. This heaven-sent man, like an angel. I am worried about his future if he stays with these people.' ''\nThe differences between Mr. Azzam and Mr. bin Laden were largely tactical, Mr. Anas said, noting that the two men remained friends.\nA committed enemy of Israel, Mr. Azzam believed the Arab warriors should focus on creating an Islamic state in Afghanistan, a process that could take decades. Mr. bin Laden, according to Mr. Anas, came to believe that such a war could be fought in many countries simultaneously.\n''The arguments were very secret,'' Mr. Anas said. ''Only three to four people knew about them at the time.'' Mr. Azzam saw little difference between the United States and the Soviet Union, contending in his articles and speeches that both were hostile to Islam. But Mr. Azzam opposed terrorism against the West, Mr. Anas said.\nBy the late 1980's, Peshawar had become a magnet for disaffected young Muslims who shared Mr. bin Laden's views. ''Ten people would open a guest house and start issuing fatwas,'' Mr. Anas recalled. '' 'We are going to make revolution in Jordan, in Egypt, in Syria.' And they haven't got any contact with the real jihad in Afghanistan.''\nThe tide of the Afghan war was turning. Stinger missiles, provided through the American covert program, had forced Soviet aircraft to fly far above the battlefields. Afghanistan had become Moscow's Vietnam. By February 1989, the Soviets had withdrawn.\nA C.I.A. official said that the agency, aware of the changing nature of the jihad, had taken some steps he would not specify to counter the threat. But Milt Bearden, the former C.I.A. station chief in Islamabad, who coordinated the agency's anti-Soviet effort in Afghanistan, disagreed.\n''The Soviet Union, armed to the teeth, was falling apart,'' he said. ''A shooting war then erupted in the Persian Gulf. Afghanistan was off the front burner.''\nWhen the war ended, he said, ''we got the hell out of there.''\nThe Afghan rebels' war continued, first against the Soviet-backed government and then within their own ranks. On Nov. 24, 1989, Mr. Azzam and two sons were killed by a car bomb in Peshawar as they drove to Friday Prayers. The murders were never solved.\nMr. Anas said he tried to take over leadership of the Office of Services. According to the C.I.A., the group split; the extremist faction took control, siding with Mr. bin Laden.\n''They loved the ideas of Osama and the person of Abdullah Azzam,'' Mr. Anas said wistfully. ''They don't love me.''\nThe Base\nFrom Many Lands, Under One Banner\nFired by their triumph over the Soviets, the Arabs who had fought in Afghanistan returned home, eager to apply the principles of jihad to their native lands.\nThe Koran sets strict limits on when and how holy war is to be undertaken. But Gilles Kepel, a leading French scholar of contemporary Islam, said the Afghan veterans were guided by their own radical interpretation of sacred Muslim texts. ''Intoxicated by the Muslim victory in Afghanistan,'' he said, ''they believed that it could be replicated elsewhere -- that the whole world was ripe for jihad, which is contrary to Islamic tradition.''\nThey called themselves the Arab Afghans.\nIn Jordan some founded a group, Jaish Muhammad, that officials say took aim at King Hussein, whose family claims descent from the Prophet Muhammad.\nIn Algeria, the Arab Afghans were among the founders of the Armed Islamic Group, the most radical to emerge after the military government canceled the 1991 elections. Known by its French initials, G.I.A, it began by blowing up military targets and escalated to wholesale massacres of Algerians who did not believe in the jihad.\nAccording to Mr. Anas, one of its founding members was an Algerian who had initially fought with him in Afghanistan but joined Al Qaeda in the late 1980's. Mr. Anas says he has been told that Mr. bin Laden provided some of the seed money for the G.I.A.\nThe early 1990's proved difficult for Mr. bin Laden. He was enraged by King Fahd's decision to let American troops wage the Persian Gulf war from Saudi Arabia, site of the two holiest shrines in Islam. He began to focus his wrath on the United States and the Saudi government. After the conflict ended, he moved to Afghanistan.\nBut his stay was brief. Within months he fled, telling associates that Saudi Arabia had hired the Pakistani intelligence service to kill him. There is no confirmation that such a plot existed. Nonetheless, in 1991, Mr. bin Laden moved to Sudan, where a militantly Islamic government had taken power.\nOver the next five years, Mr. bin Laden built a group that combined legitimate business with support for world holy war.\nHe also set out to accomplish his overriding goal of gathering the leading Islamic extremist groups under one banner. According to Middle Eastern officials, Mr. bin Laden and his envoys met with radicals from Pakistan and Egypt to propose an international Islamic front, led by Afghan veterans, that would fight Americans and Jews.\nAl Qaeda began training its own operatives. Ali Mohamed, the government witness, who has said he arranged Mr. bin Laden's move to Sudan, told investigators that he taught group members about weapons, explosives, kidnapping, urban fighting, counterintelligence and other tactics at camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. He said he showed some of the trainees how to set up cells ''that could be used in operations.''\nThe dispatch of American troops to Somalia in late 1992 and 1993 as part of a United Nations mission was another affront to Mr. bin Laden. The Bush administration presented it as a relief operation.\nAmerican officials say a defector from Al Qaeda told them it viewed the deployment as a dangerous expansion of American influence in the region and a step toward undermining the Islamic government of Sudan.\nAl Qaeda privately issued fatwas that directed members to attack American soldiers in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the Horn of Africa, according to American prosecutors. They said he also sent his military chief, an Egyptian who had been with him at the formation of Al Qaeda, to find the vulnerabilities of United Nations forces in Africa.\nAl Qaeda created a cell in Kenya as a ''gateway'' to its operations in Somalia, the prosecutors assert. Members of the group blended into Kenyan society, opening legitimate businesses that sold fish and dealt in diamonds, and operating an Islamic charity.\nFederal prosecutors say at least five group members crossed the border to Somalia, where they trained some of the fighters involved in an Oct. 3, 1993, battle with United States special forces that left 18 Americans and several hundred Somalis dead.\nThe battle, one of the most widely publicized setbacks for American forces in recent memory, cast a shadow over every subsequent Clinton administration debate on the possible uses of ground troops. American intelligence did not learn of Al Qaeda's role in the ambush until several years later.\nProsecutors say the group also considered attacking Americans in Kenya to retaliate for the Somalia mission. Mr. Mohamed testified that Mr. bin Laden sent him to Nairobi in late 1993 to look over possible American, French, British and Israeli targets for a bomb attack, including the American Embassy. He said he took photos, drew diagrams and wrote a report, which he delivered to his boss in Khartoum. ''Bin Laden looked at the picture of the American Embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber,'' he said.\nAmerican prosecutors say Al Qaeda had more grandiose plans: a leading member, an Iraqi who Mr. Anas said had first gravitated to Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan, tried to buy enriched uranium in Europe.\nThe Iraqi, Mahdouh Mahmud Salim, forged links between Mr. bin Laden's group and others supported by Iran. Mr. Salim met with an Iranian religious official in Khartoum, and soon afterward, the prosecutors say, Al Qaeda members got training from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite group in Lebanon skilled in making car bombs. American officials said this alliance was notable because it marked the first time radicals from the minority Shiite branch of Islam collaborated with extremists from the dominant Sunni branch.\nMr. bin Laden's business ventures in Sudan -- including a tannery, a transportation company and a construction concern -- raised money and served as cover for the travels of Mr. Salim and others, according to American officials. They said that his companies cornered Sudan's exports of gum, sunflower and sesame products -- and that he invested $50 million of his family money in a new Islamic bank in Khartoum.\nThe Network\nAs in Afghanistan, So in the World\nThe new jihad movement was fueled by the civil war that consumed Afghanistan in the early 1990's. The training camps that had once schooled soldiers to battle the Soviet enemy now attracted militants more interested in fomenting holy war back home -- in America, Europe or the Middle East -- than in the struggle for control of Afghanistan.\nThe Office of Services, the Pakistan-based group founded in the 1980's by Mr. Azzam to recruit soldiers for the anti-Soviet cause, arranged the travels of some of these new jihadists, according to European and American officials.\nMany of those associated with the office, Mr. Anas said, shared Mr. bin Laden's vision of a global movement. American officials suspect they were acting under his instructions, though this remains a subject of debate among intelligence analysts.\nAmerican investigators stumbled across the first signs of the new global phenomenon in 1993, when they began to examine the bombing at the World Trade Center.\nThey discovered that the four men who carried out the attack, which killed 6 and wounded more than 1,000, had ties to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, whom they charged with leading a worldwide ''jihad organization'' that had begun plotting to kill Americans as early as 1989.\nMr. Abdel Rahman was later convicted of conspiring to blow up New York landmarks, including the United Nations. But in the years since, American intelligence officials have come to believe that he and the World Trade Center bombers had ties to Al Qaeda.\nThe evidence is suggestive, but not conclusive. Several of those convicted in the World Trade Center case were associated with the Brooklyn refugee center that was a branch of the Office of Services, the Pakistan-based organization that Mr. bin Laden helped finance and lead. The Brooklyn center was headed for a time by Mustafa Shalabi, an Egyptian murdered in 1991 in a case that remains unsolved. Federal prosecutors recently disclosed that it was Mr. Shalabi whom Mr. bin Laden called in 1991 when he needed help moving to Sudan, according to Mr. Mohamed, the federal witness.\nOne of the men convicted of bombing the World Trade Center, Ahmad M. Ajaj, spent four months in Pakistan in 1992, returning to the United States with a bomb manual later seized by the United States government. An English translation of the document, entered into evidence in the World Trade Center trial, said that the manual was dated 1982, that it had been published in Amman, Jordan, and that it carried a heading on the front and succeeding pages: The Basic Rule.\nThose appear to be errors. Two separate translations of the document, one done at the request of The New York Times, show that the heading said Al Qaeda -- which translates as The Base, the name of Mr. bin Laden's group. In addition, the document lists a publication date of 1989, a year after Mr. bin Laden founded his organization. And the place of publication is Afghanistan, not Jordan.\nSteven Emerson, a terrorism expert who first pointed out the errors, said they deprived investigators of a subtle early clue to the existence of Mr. bin Laden's group.\nWhile the trade center trial ended in 1994, federal prosecutors did not open their grand jury investigation of Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda until 1996.\n''Had the government correctly translated the material,'' Mr. Emerson said, ''it might have understood that the men who blew up the World Trade Center and Mr. bin Laden's group were linked.''\nAsked about the mistranslation, an official in the United States Attorney's office, who declined to be identified, said only that Mr. Ajaj had been carrying ''voluminous material printed by various organizations.'' He added that their titles referred to international conspiracy, commando operations and engineering of explosives.\nThe jihad movement also took root in Europe. In August 1994, three young French Muslims of North African descent, wearing hoods and brandishing machine pistols, opened fire on tourists in a hotel lobby in Marrakesh, Morocco, killing two Spaniards and wounding a third. The French police investigating the attack learned that it had been planned by two Moroccan veterans of the Afghan war, who had recruited commandos for the attack in Paris and Orleans and sent more than a dozen of them to Afghanistan for training.\nThe indoctrination of the young Muslims began with religion, according to French court papers and testimony. An Orleans mathematics professor and interpreter of the Koran, Mohamed Zinedine, gathered around him a group of men from the slums of Orleans who wanted to learn how to pray. Later, French court papers say, he instructed them in the concept of waging jihad against corrupt governments, saying it was a higher stage of Islamic observance.\nOne young Moroccan testified that Mr. Zinedine -- who is now a fugitive -- showed him a videotape of Muslim victims of ''torture in Bosnia, of babies with their throats cut, of pregnant women disemboweled, and fingernails torn off.'' The young man added, ''He told me there was a way of helping them and that I must help them.'' Prayers for people like the Muslims in Bosnia, he quoted Mr. Zinedine as saying, were not enough. He must become an ''armed humanitarian.''\nEuropean investigators tracing the Afghan network in France, Belgium and Germany found records of phone calls between local extremists and the Office of Services in Pakistan. In March 1995, Belgian investigators came across another clue: A CD-ROM in the car of another Algerian, who had been trained in Afghanistan in 1992 and was part of the G.I.A. cell in Brussels. The CD was initially ignored, Belgian officials say.\nMonths later, the Belgians began translating its contents and discovered several different versions of a manual for terrorism that had begun circulating among Islamic militants in the early 1990's. The voluminous manual covered diverse subjects, from ''psychological war in Islam'' to ''the organizational structure of Israeli intelligence'' to ''recruiting according to the American method.''\nThe manual also offered detailed recipes for making bombs, including instructions on when to shake the chemicals and how to use a wristwatch as a detonator. In addition there were instructions on how to kill with toxins, gases and drugs. The preface included a dedication to the new hero of the holy war: Osama bin Laden. Versions of the manual circulated widely and were seized by the police all over Europe.\nReuel Gerecht, a former C.I.A. official, said he was told that the agency did not obtain its own copy of the manual before the end of 1999. ''The truth is,'' he said, ''they missed for years the largest terrorist guide ever written.'' The omission, he asserted, reflects the agency's reluctance to scrutinize the fallout from its support of the anti-Soviet jihad.\nA C.I.A. official said that the agency had had ''access to versions'' of the manual since the late 1980's. ''It's not the Holy Grail that Gerecht reports it to be,'' he said, adding that the terrorist-related parts were fairly recent additions.\nBy the mid-1990's, American officials had begun to focus on Mr. bin Laden and his entourage in Sudan. They saw him as the embodiment of a dangerous new development: a stateless sponsor of terrorism who was using his personal fortune -- which one Middle Eastern official estimated at $270 million -- to bankroll extremist causes.\nAmerican officials pressed Sudan to eject Mr. bin Laden, and in 1996 they succeeded, forcing him into exile. It was a diplomatic triumph, but one that many American officials would come to rue. Mr. bin Laden made his way back to Afghanistan, where a new group of young Islamic militants, the Taliban, was taking control.\nAmerican and Middle Eastern officials said some of the cash that the Taliban used to buy off local warlords came from Mr. bin Laden. Soon the new, hard-line rulers of Afghanistan allowed him to use their country to pursue his goal of creating ''one jihad camp for the world,'' as Mr. Anas put it.\nThe Edict\nA Sacred Muslim Duty To Kill All Foes\nTwo years after he arrived in Afghanistan, in February 1998, Mr. bin Laden publicly announced his intentions. At a camp in Khost, in eastern Afghanistan, he and several other leaders of militant groups declared that they had founded the International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, an umbrella entity that included Al Qaeda and groups from Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh, among others.\nThe front issued the following fatwa: ''To kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military, is an individual duty of every Muslim who is able, in any country where this is possible.''\nOn Aug. 7, 1998, eight years to the day after the first American troops set foot in Saudi Arabia, Mr. bin Laden delivered on the threat, American prosecutors say. Bombs exploded hours apart at the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\nThe plot, as described by federal prosecutors, was truly international. Prosecutors assert that the attacks were carried out by Muslims from Tanzania, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, most of whom were trained in Afghanistan. The Kenyan plotters, they say, spoke directly with Mr. bin Laden by satellite telephone as they developed their plans.\nThe attacks were costly for Al Qaeda. Less than two weeks after the embassy bombings, the United States conducted air strikes against Mr. bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan. Over the next two years, police and intelligence agencies around the world, many prodded by the United States, arrested more than 100 militants in some 20 countries.\nAlmost every month, authorities detain or question people with ties to Al Qaeda. Late last year, in what American officials described as one of the more alarming cases, the Kuwaiti police arrested a local man, an Afghan veteran, who said he was associated with Mr. bin Laden's group and planning to bomb American and Kuwaiti targets. American officials say he ultimately led the police to a weapons cache of almost 300 pounds of explosives and more than 1,400 detonators.\nAnd in addition to the two-day closure of the American Embassy in Rome, officials say, recent warnings of a possible Al Qaeda attack prompted the United States to divert an entire carrier battle group scheduled to dock in Naples.\nAmerican officials acknowledge that Al Qaeda and Mr. bin Laden have proven resourceful, resilient adversaries. Much of his personal wealth has now been spent, or is in bank accounts that are now frozen. But officials say he is raising money through a network of charities and businesses. His group reconstitutes its networks in many countries as quickly as they are disrupted.\nAnd failure can breed success. In late 1999, American officials say, a group of Yemenis botched an attempt to blow up an American ship, The Sullivans, as it passed through Yemen. Their boat, loaded with explosives, sank a few feet off shore.\nThis year, American officials say, a Saudi operative of Mr. bin Laden's who helped organize that attack worked with some of the same people on the bombing of the Cole in Yemen.\nInternal crackdowns on Muslim militants, like the Algerian government's largely successful attempts to stamp out the G.I.A. in the mid- 1990's, have in several instances fueled the international jihad.\nAmerican officials said the most radical Algerians were now collaborating with Mr. bin Laden. In 1999, Algerians were for the first time implicated in plots against the United States, when Ahmed Ressam was arrested crossing the border from Canada with a carload of explosives. Mr. Ressam goes on trial later this year in Los Angeles.\nAmerican and Middle Eastern officials say Al Qaeda has now expanded its jihad to include Israel, which until recently had regarded Mr. bin Laden as an American problem. The officials say Al Qaeda has financed and trained an anti-Israel group, Asbat al Ansar, that operates from a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon.\nLast June, Israel charged in a sealed indictment that a Hamas member who was plotting to attack targets within Israel, including settlers and the army, had been trained in one of Mr. bin Laden's Afghan camps. ''Al Qaeda wants in on the action -- the new intifada against Israel,'' said one American official.\nOlivier Roy, a French scholar who follows Islamic activities, says Al Qaeda's biggest asset is the thousands of jihadists around the world who no longer see their struggle in strictly local or even national terms, which makes them impervious to normal political or military pressure.\nMr. bin Laden's actions, he said, are ''not the continuation of politics by other means.''\n''Osama bin Laden doesn't want to negotiate.''\nHoly Warriors\nTODAY -- The making of an Islamic terror network.\nMONDAY -- A look inside a plot that could have crippled Jordan's capital.\nTUESDAY -- What motivates the jihad's young recruits."}, {"text": "One Man and a Global Web of Violence\n2001-01-14T05:00:00.000Z\n The following article is based on reporting by Craig Pyes, Judith Miller and Stephen Engelberg and was written by Mr. Engelberg. \n In 1987, several years after he began training Arab volunteers to oust Soviet forces from Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden had a vision. The time had come, he told friends, to start a global jihad, or Islamic holy war, against the corrupt secular governments of the Muslim Middle East and the Western powers that supported them. \n Mr. bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire, would use his camps in Afghanistan to take holy warriors from around the world \u2014 who had always pursued local goals \u2014 and shape them into an international network that would fight to bring all Muslims under a militant version of Islamic law. \n Some of his comrades in arms warned him that the goal was unattainable. \n \"I talked to Osama one day and asked him what was he doing,\" recalled Abdullah Anas, an Algerian who was fighting in Afghanistan at the time and provided a rare personal narrative of the formation of Mr. bin Laden's organization. \" `Imagine after five years a guy from Malaysia goes back to his country. How can he remember you are his leader? He will get married, have children, engage in work in his country. How can you establish one camp for jihad in the world?' \" \n But he and other doubters watched as Mr. bin Laden, who is now America's most wanted terror suspect, set about doing just that. Mr. Anas's account and those of other witnesses, along with intelligence from United States, the Middle East and Europe, draw a vivid and newly detailed portrait of the birth of a modern jihad movement. What began as a holy war against the Soviet Union took on a new dimension, Mr. Anas said, when Mr. bin Laden broke away and established a new corps of militant Muslims whose ambitions reached far beyond the borders of Afghanistan. \n From his Afghan camps, Mr. bin Laden created a kind of clearinghouse for Islamic terrorism, which American officials say not only conducts its own operations but trains and underwrites local militants, connecting home-grown plots to a global crusade. \n His strategy is aptly captured by one of his many code names: The Contractor. The group he founded 13 years ago, Al Qaeda, Arabic for The Base, is led by masterful opportunists who tailor their roles to the moment, sometimes teaching the fine points of explosives, sometimes sending in their own operatives, sometimes simply supplying inspiration. \n The group has become a beacon for Muslim Malaysians, Algerians, Filipinos, Palestinians, Egyptians, even Americans who have come to view the United States as their enemy, an imperial power propping up corrupt and godless governments. Mr. bin Laden has tried to bridge divisions in a movement long plagued by doctrinal, ethnic and geographic differences. \"Local politics drives what they're doing, but it's much more visionary,\" said Robert Blitzer, a former F.B.I. counterterrorism official. \"This is worldwide. This is, `We want to be somewhere in a hundred years.' \" \n According to a recent Central Intelligence Agency analysis, Al Qaeda operates about a dozen Afghan camps that have trained as many as 5,000 militants, who in turn have created cells in 50 countries. Intelligence officials say the group is experimenting with chemical weapons, including nerve gas, at one of its camps. \n Mr. bin Laden and his supporters use centuries-old interpretations of the Koran to justify violence in the name of God against fellow Muslims or bystanders \u2014 a vision on the farthest extremes of one of the world's largest religions. But their operations are thoroughly modern \u2014 encrypted e-mail, bomb-making recipes stored on CD-ROM's, cell phones and satellite communications. \n The group plans attacks months or years in advance, investigators say. A former United States Army sergeant, Ali A. Mohamed \u2014 who worked for Mr. bin Laden and is now a government witness \u2014 has told prosecutors that Al Qaeda trains \"sleeper\" agents, or \"submarines,\" to live undetected among local populations. \n Mr. bin Laden has not achieved his more ambitious goals. He has not brought more Muslims under the rule of Islamic law, toppled any of the Arab governments he took aim at, or driven the United States out of the Middle East. His violence has repulsed many believers and prompted severe crackdowns in Arab states that already have limited political freedoms. \n Nonetheless, he and his small inner circle have preoccupied American officials, paralyzing embassies, thwarting military exercises and making Americans abroad feel anxious and vulnerable. Earlier this month, the United States closed its Rome embassy for nearly two days after intelligence officials warned of a possible attack. \n American officials have charged Mr. bin Laden with masterminding the 1998 bombings of two embassies in Africa that killed more than 200 people, and suspect him of involvement in the October bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen, which killed 17 sailors. Four men went on trial this month in lower Manhattan in the African bombings. \n American authorities are also examining Al Qaeda's role in three plots timed to millennium celebrations in 1999 \u2014 attacks directed at another American ship, a so-far unknown target in the United States, and tourist sites and a hotel in Jordan. \n Mr. bin Laden's group has recently attempted operations against Israel \u2014 a significant departure, American and Middle Eastern officials say. They acknowledge that he has ensured his organization's survival, in the event of his capture or death, by designating a successor: his longtime aide, Abdulaziz abu Sitta, an Egyptian known as Muhammad Atef or Abu Hoffs al-Masri. Last week, according to Al Jazeera, an Arab satellite channel, his son married Mr. Masri's daughter in Kandahar, Afghanistan. \n \"His arrest, which we dearly hope for, is only one step along the road of the many things we need to do to eliminate the network of organizations,\" said Richard A. Clarke, the top White House counterterrorism official. \n The Cause: \n Afghan War Draws Young Arab Fighters \n Al Qaeda grew out of the jihad inspired by Muslim scholars to combat the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. They issued religious rulings, known as fatwas, which exhorted Muslims everywhere to defend the Islamic land of Afghanistan from infidels. Over the next few years, several thousand young Arab men joined the Afghan resistance. \n One of the first to answer the call was a young Algerian named Boujema Bounouar, who went by the nom de guerre Abdullah Anas. In recent interviews in London, where he now lives, Mr. Anas recounted how Mr. bin Laden went to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets and was drawn to a group of Egyptians who wanted to start a global jihad. \n Mr. Anas, who is now a leader of an Algerian Islamic political party, is not a dispassionate observer. He acknowledges that he opposed Mr. bin Laden, whose program of terrorism, he says, has tarred the reputations of thousands of Arabs who fought honorably for the Afghan cause. But his firsthand account, which conforms with Western intelligence analysis, provides one of few portraits of Mr. bin Laden's evolution as a militant leader. \n The two men were defined by many of the same forces. Mr. Anas said his journey from teacher of the Koran to holy warrior began in 1984, when he was 25 and living with his family in Western Algeria. Visiting the local library, he read in a news weekly about a religious ruling that waging war against the Soviets was every Muslim's duty. \n \"After a few days, everyone heard about this fatwa and started talking,\" he recalled. \" `Where is this Afghanistan? Which people are they? How can we go there? How much is the ticket?' \" \n That year, Mr. Anas was among the million Muslims who participated in the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. \"You feel very holy,\" he said. \"People from all over the world. From Zimbabwe to New Delhi. Everyone is wearing just two pieces of white cotton. Everybody. You can't describe who is the minister, who is the president. No jewelry. No good suit.\" \n In Mecca, he said, prayer leaders spoke emotionally about the jihad in Afghanistan. \n He was standing in the marble expanse of the Great Mosque with 50,000 others when, he said, a friend pointed out a radical Palestinian scholar who was organizing the Arab support for the Afghans. His name was Abdullah Azzam, and his writings, which would help spur the revival of the jihad movement in the 20th century, were just becoming widely known. \n Mr. Anas introduced himself and asked whether the magazine article he had seen in the library was correct. Had the religious leaders agreed that fighting in Afghanistan was a duty of all Muslims? \n \"He said, `Yes, it's true.' \" \n \" `O.K.,' I said. `If I want to go to Afghanistan, what do I do now?' \" \n Mr. Azzam gave him a business card with a telephone number in Islamabad, Pakistan, where he was a university professor. A week later, Mr. Anas was on a flight from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan. \n He had no idea where he was going, or what he would do. He dialed the only phone number he knew in Pakistan, reaching Mr. Azzam, who offered him a place to stay in his own house, a bustling salon frequented by students and scholars. \n It was there that he first caught sight of Mr. Azzam's youngest daughter, whom he would marry five years later. And Mr. Azzam introduced him to a Saudi visitor identified in the traditional Arabic way, as Abu Abdullah, the father of his eldest son, Abdullah. The visitor was Osama bin Laden. \n The two men exchanged pleasantries. Mr. bin Laden's name was well known. He was said to be the youngest of 24 brothers in a family that ran one of the largest construction companies in the Arab world. \n Mr. bin Laden seemed no different from the other Arab volunteers who were starting to arrive in Pakistan, Mr. Anas recalled. The conversation turned to how the volunteers could help the Afghans win their jihad, and teach them more about Islam. \n The Soviet forces had a considerable advantage in the Afghan conflict. Their helicopter gunships controlled the air, and their troops held the main roads. But the rebels had powerful friends. The United States and Saudi Arabia were spending millions funneling arms to the Afghans through Pakistan's intelligence service. \n Mr. Anas began by teaching the Koran to the Afghan rebels, who did not speak Arabic and learned the verses by rote. He also led prayers at a \"guest house\" set up in Pakistan for Arab volunteers. At the time, he said, there were no more than a few dozen Arabs in the country, working with the rebels. None spoke the Afghan languages. \n After a few months, Mr. Anas said, he trekked into Afghanistan to join a combat unit, one of three Arabs traveling with a caravan of 600 Afghan soldiers. He learned Farsi and took on the role of mediator, traveling among the feuding rebel camps. He spent most of each year inside Afghanistan. \n Mr. Anas became a top aide to Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud, whose troops controlled northern Afghanistan and are now fighting the Taliban rulers \u2014 who support Mr. bin Laden. \n Like many Muslims who joined the rebels, Mr. Anas expected to die in the Afghan jihad and earn the special status designated in the Koran for martyrs, which includes forgiveness of sins and the enjoyment in Paradise of beautiful virgins. \"It's not the main idea to be a shahid,\" or martyr, he said. \"But it's part of my plan.\" \n In the mid-1980's, American and Middle Eastern intelligence officials say, Mr. bin Laden moved to Peshawar, a Pakistani city near the border with Afghanistan. The city was a staging ground for the war against the Soviets; American, French and Pakistani intelligence officers intrigued and competed there to manipulate the Afghan cause to their countries' advantage. \n Mr. bin Laden's fortune of several hundred million dollars gained him immediate popularity. \n \"He was one of the guys who came to jihad in Afghanistan,\" Mr. Anas said. \"But unlike the others, what he had was a lot of money. He's not very sophisticated politically or organizationally. But he's an activist with great imagination. He ate very little. He slept very little. Very generous. He'd give you his clothes. He'd give you his money.\" \n Mr. Anas, who returned annually to Pakistan from the Afghan battlefields to visit with Mr. Azzam, said Mr. bin Laden at first slept in the guest house in Peshawar on a cushion on the floor. He recalled that Mr. Azzam liked to say: \"You see, this man has everything in his country. You see he lives with all the poor people in this room.\" \n At about this time, in 1984, Mr. Azzam set up the organization that would play a pivotal role in the global jihad over the next decade. It was called the Makhtab al Khadimat, the Office of Services, and its goal was to recruit and train Muslim volunteers for the Afghan fronts. Mr. Azzam raised money for the organization in countries overseas including the United States and gave impassioned speeches promoting the Afghan cause. Mr. bin Laden embraced the idea from its inception and became Mr. Azzam's partner, providing financial support and handling military affairs. \n Mr. bin Laden worked best with small groups, Mr. Anas said. \"When you sit with Osama, you don't want to leave the meeting,\" he said. \"You wish to continue talking to him because he is very calm, very fluent.\" \n A main goal of the Office of Services, Mr. Anas said, was to prevent the increasing number of outside volunteers from taking sides in the rebels' factional struggles. \"We are in Afghanistan to help the jihad and all the Afghan people,\" Mr. Azzam told him. \n But there was increasing frustration from many of the disaffected young Muslims over Mr. Azzam's insistence that the Office of Services support only the Afghan cause \u2014 when many were agitated about the plight of their own homelands. Some approached Mr. bin Laden. \n \"They told him: `You shouldn't be staying with Abdullah Azzam. He doesn't do anything about the regimes \u2014 Saudi, Egyptian, Algerian. He's just talking about Afghanistan,' \" Mr. Anas said. \n \"These people are always saying to Osama: `You should establish something. Have a clear idea to use these people after Afghanistan for other wars.' \" \n Among those most ardently courting Mr. bin Laden was a group of Egyptian radicals called the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which helped assassinate President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981. \n The Egyptian group advocated the overthrow of governments by terrorism and violence, and one of its key figures, Ayman al- Zawahiri, had taken shelter in Afghanistan. Mr. Anas said \u2014 and Western intelligence agencies agree \u2014 that Dr. Zawahiri was a commanding early influence on Mr. bin Laden. Today he is part of Al Qaeda's leadership, according to intelligence officials. \n But Mr. Azzam quarreled bitterly with the Egyptians. \n Mr. Anas said he once witnessed a heated argument between Mr. Azzam and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a radical religious scholar, who argued that the flouting of Islamic law had turned Presidents Mohammed Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt into infidels who could therefore be killed. Sheik Abdel Rahman later moved to Brooklyn, where he was associated with an Office of Services branch. In 1995 he was convicted of plotting to blow up New York landmarks. \n In 1986, according to Mr. Anas and Middle Eastern intelligence officials, Mr. bin Laden began to chart a separate course. He established his own training camp for Persian Gulf Arabs, a group of about 50 who lived in tents set apart from the other Afghan fighters. He called the camp Al Masadah \u2014 The Lion's Den. \n Within little more than a year the movement divided, as Mr. bin Laden and the Egyptians founded Al Qaeda \u2014 the \"base\" for what they hoped would be a global crusade. \n Mr. Anas said Mr. Azzam confided to him that Egyptian ideologues had wooed Mr. bin Laden away, gaining access to his money. \"He told me one time: `I'm very upset about Osama. This heaven-sent man, like an angel. I am worried about his future if he stays with these people.' \" \n The differences between Mr. Azzam and Mr. bin Laden were largely tactical, Mr. Anas said, noting that the two men remained friends. \n A committed enemy of Israel, Mr. Azzam believed the Arab warriors should focus on creating an Islamic state in Afghanistan, a process that could take decades. Mr. bin Laden, according to Mr. Anas, came to believe that such a war could be fought in many countries simultaneously. \n \"The arguments were very secret,\" Mr. Anas said. \"Only three to four people knew about them at the time.\" Mr. Azzam saw little difference between the United States and the Soviet Union, contending in his articles and speeches that both were hostile to Islam. But Mr. Azzam opposed terrorism against the West, Mr. Anas said. \n By the late 1980's, Peshawar had become a magnet for disaffected young Muslims who shared Mr. bin Laden's views. \"Ten people would open a guest house and start issuing fatwas,\" Mr. Anas recalled. \" `We are going to make revolution in Jordan, in Egypt, in Syria.' And they haven't got any contact with the real jihad in Afghanistan.\" \n The tide of the Afghan war was turning. Stinger missiles, provided through the American covert program, had forced Soviet aircraft to fly far above the battlefields. Afghanistan had become Moscow's Vietnam. By February 1989, the Soviets had withdrawn. \n A C.I.A. official said that the agency, aware of the changing nature of the jihad, had taken some steps he would not specify to counter the threat. But Milt Bearden, the former C.I.A. station chief in Islamabad, who coordinated the agency's anti-Soviet effort in Afghanistan, disagreed. \n \"The Soviet Union, armed to the teeth, was falling apart,\" he said. \"A shooting war then erupted in the Persian Gulf. Afghanistan was off the front burner.\" \n When the war ended, he said, \"we got the hell out of there.\" \n The Afghan rebels' war continued, first against the Soviet-backed government and then within their own ranks. On Nov. 24, 1989, Mr. Azzam and two sons were killed by a car bomb in Peshawar as they drove to Friday Prayers. The murders were never solved. \n Mr. Anas said he tried to take over leadership of the Office of Services. According to the C.I.A., the group split; the extremist faction took control, siding with Mr. bin Laden. \n \"They loved the ideas of Osama and the person of Abdullah Azzam,\" Mr. Anas said wistfully. \"They don't love me.\" \n The Base: \n From Many Lands, Under One Banner \n Fired by their triumph over the Soviets, the Arabs who had fought in Afghanistan returned home, eager to apply the principles of jihad to their native lands. \n The Koran sets strict limits on when and how holy war is to be undertaken. But Gilles Kepel, a leading French scholar of contemporary Islam, said the Afghan veterans were guided by their own radical interpretation of sacred Muslim texts. \"Intoxicated by the Muslim victory in Afghanistan,\" he said, \"they believed that it could be replicated elsewhere \u2014 that the whole world was ripe for jihad, which is contrary to Islamic tradition.\" \n They called themselves the Arab Afghans. \n In Jordan some founded a group, Jaish Muhammad, that officials say took aim at King Hussein, whose family claims descent from the Prophet Muhammad. \n In Algeria, the Arab Afghans were among the founders of the Armed Islamic Group, the most radical to emerge after the military government canceled the 1991 elections. Known by its French initials, G.I.A, it began by blowing up military targets and escalated to wholesale massacres of Algerians who did not believe in the jihad. \n According to Mr. Anas, one of its founding members was an Algerian who had initially fought with him in Afghanistan but joined Al Qaeda in the late 1980's. Mr. Anas says he has been told that Mr. bin Laden provided some of the seed money for the G.I.A. \n The early 1990's proved difficult for Mr. bin Laden. He was enraged by King Fahd's decision to let American troops wage the Persian Gulf war from Saudi Arabia, site of the two holiest shrines in Islam. He began to focus his wrath on the United States and the Saudi government. After the conflict ended, he moved to Afghanistan. \n But his stay was brief. Within months he fled, telling associates that Saudi Arabia had hired the Pakistani intelligence service to kill him. There is no confirmation that such a plot existed. Nonetheless, in 1991, Mr. bin Laden moved to Sudan, where a militantly Islamic government had taken power. \n Over the next five years, Mr. bin Laden built a group that combined legitimate business with support for world holy war. \n He also set out to accomplish his overriding goal of gathering the leading Islamic extremist groups under one banner. According to Middle Eastern officials, Mr. bin Laden and his envoys met with radicals from Pakistan and Egypt to propose an international Islamic front, led by Afghan veterans, that would fight Americans and Jews. \n Al Qaeda began training its own operatives. Ali Mohamed, the government witness, who has said he arranged Mr. bin Laden's move to Sudan, told investigators that he taught group members about weapons, explosives, kidnapping, urban fighting, counterintelligence and other tactics at camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. He said he showed some of the trainees how to set up cells \"that could be used in operations.\" \n The dispatch of American troops to Somalia in late 1992 and 1993 as part of a United Nations mission was another affront to Mr. bin Laden. The Bush administration presented it as a relief operation. \n American officials say a defector from Al Qaeda told them it viewed the deployment as a dangerous expansion of American influence in the region and a step toward undermining the Islamic government of Sudan. \n Al Qaeda privately issued fatwas that directed members to attack American soldiers in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the Horn of Africa, according to American prosecutors. They said he also sent his military chief, an Egyptian who had been with him at the formation of Al Qaeda, to find the vulnerabilities of United Nations forces in Africa. \n Al Qaeda created a cell in Kenya as a \"gateway\" to its operations in Somalia, the prosecutors assert. Members of the group blended into Kenyan society, opening legitimate businesses that sold fish and dealt in diamonds, and operating an Islamic charity. \n Federal prosecutors say at least five group members crossed the border to Somalia, where they trained some of the fighters involved in an Oct. 3, 1993, battle with United States special forces that left 18 Americans and several hundred Somalis dead. \n The battle, one of the most widely publicized setbacks for American forces in recent memory, cast a shadow over every subsequent Clinton administration debate on the possible uses of ground troops. American intelligence did not learn of Al Qaeda's role in the ambush until several years later. \n Prosecutors say the group also considered attacking Americans in Kenya to retaliate for the Somalia mission. Mr. Mohamed testified that Mr. bin Laden sent him to Nairobi in late 1993 to look over possible American, French, British and Israeli targets for a bomb attack, including the American Embassy. He said he took photos, drew diagrams and wrote a report, which he delivered to his boss in Khartoum. \"Bin Laden looked at the picture of the American Embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber,\" he said. \n American prosecutors say Al Qaeda had more grandiose plans: a leading member, an Iraqi who Mr. Anas said had first gravitated to Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan, tried to buy enriched uranium in Europe. \n The Iraqi, Mahdouh Mahmud Salim, forged links between Mr. bin Laden's group and others supported by Iran. Mr. Salim met with an Iranian religious official in Khartoum, and soon afterward, the prosecutors say, Al Qaeda members got training from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite group in Lebanon skilled in making car bombs. American officials said this alliance was notable because it marked the first time radicals from the minority Shiite branch of Islam collaborated with extremists from the dominant Sunni branch. \n Mr. bin Laden's business ventures in Sudan \u2014 including a tannery, a transportation company and a construction concern \u2014 raised money and served as cover for the travels of Mr. Salim and others, according to American officials. They said that his companies cornered Sudan's exports of gum, sunflower and sesame products \u2014 and that he invested $50 million of his family money in a new Islamic bank in Khartoum. \n The Network: \n As in Afghanistan, So in the World \n The new jihad movement was fueled by the civil war that consumed Afghanistan in the early 1990's. The training camps that had once schooled soldiers to battle the Soviet enemy now attracted militants more interested in fomenting holy war back home \u2014 in America, Europe or the Middle East \u2014 than in the struggle for control of Afghanistan. \n The Office of Services, the Pakistan-based group founded in the 1980's by Mr. Azzam to recruit soldiers for the anti-Soviet cause, arranged the travels of some of these new jihadists, according to European and American officials. \n Many of those associated with the office, Mr. Anas said, shared Mr. bin Laden's vision of a global movement. American officials suspect they were acting under his instructions, though this remains a subject of debate among intelligence analysts. \n American investigators stumbled across the first signs of the new global phenomenon in 1993, when they began to examine the bombing at the World Trade Center. \n They discovered that the four men who carried out the attack, which killed 6 and wounded more than 1,000, had ties to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, whom they charged with leading a worldwide \"jihad organization\" that had begun plotting to kill Americans as early as 1989. \n Mr. Abdel Rahman was later convicted of conspiring to blow up New York landmarks, including the United Nations. But in the years since, American intelligence officials have come to believe that he and the World Trade Center bombers had ties to Al Qaeda. \n The evidence is suggestive, but not conclusive. Several of those convicted in the World Trade Center case were associated with the Brooklyn refugee center that was a branch of the Office of Services, the Pakistan-based organization that Mr. bin Laden helped finance and lead. The Brooklyn center was headed for a time by Mustafa Shalabi, an Egyptian murdered in 1991 in a case that remains unsolved. Federal prosecutors recently disclosed that it was Mr. Shalabi whom Mr. bin Laden called in 1991 when he needed help moving to Sudan, according to Mr. Mohamed, the federal witness. \n One of the men convicted of bombing the World Trade Center, Ahmad M. Ajaj, spent four months in Pakistan in 1992, returning to the United States with a bomb manual later seized by the United States government. An English translation of the document, entered into evidence in the World Trade Center trial, said that the manual was dated 1982, that it had been published in Amman, Jordan, and that it carried a heading on the front and succeeding pages: The Basic Rule. \n Those appear to be errors. Two separate translations of the document, one done at the request of The New York Times, show that the heading said Al Qaeda \u2014 which translates as The Base, the name of Mr. bin Laden's group. In addition, the document lists a publication date of 1989, a year after Mr. bin Laden founded his organization. And the place of publication is Afghanistan, not Jordan. \n Steven Emerson, a terrorism expert who first pointed out the errors, said they deprived investigators of a subtle early clue to the existence of Mr. bin Laden's group. \n While the trade center trial ended in 1994, federal prosecutors did not open their grand jury investigation of Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda until 1996. \n \"Had the government correctly translated the material,\" Mr. Emerson said, \"it might have understood that the men who blew up the World Trade Center and Mr. bin Laden's group were linked.\" \n Asked about the mistranslation, an official in the United States Attorney's office, who declined to be identified, said only that Mr. Ajaj had been carrying \"voluminous material printed by various organizations.\" He added that their titles referred to international conspiracy, commando operations and engineering of explosives. \n The jihad movement also took root in Europe. In August 1994, three young French Muslims of North African descent, wearing hoods and brandishing machine pistols, opened fire on tourists in a hotel lobby in Marrakesh, Morocco, killing two Spaniards and wounding a third. The French police investigating the attack learned that it had been planned by two Moroccan veterans of the Afghan war, who had recruited commandos for the attack in Paris and Orle\u0301ans and sent more than a dozen of them to Afghanistan for training. \n The indoctrination of the young Muslims began with religion, according to French court papers and testimony. An Orle\u0301ans mathematics professor and interpreter of the Koran, Mohamed Zine\u0301dine, gathered around him a group of men from the slums of Orle\u0301ans who wanted to learn how to pray. Later, French court papers say, he instructed them in the concept of waging jihad against corrupt governments, saying it was a higher stage of Islamic observance. \n One young Moroccan testified that Mr. Zine\u0301dine \u2014 who is now a fugitive \u2014 showed him a videotape of Muslim victims of \"torture in Bosnia, of babies with their throats cut, of pregnant women disemboweled, and fingernails torn off.\" The young man added, \"He told me there was a way of helping them and that I must help them.\" Prayers for people like the Muslims in Bosnia, he quoted Mr. Zine\u0301dine as saying, were not enough. He must become an \"armed humanitarian.\" \n European investigators tracing the Afghan network in France, Belgium and Germany found records of phone calls between local extremists and the Office of Services in Pakistan. In March 1995, Belgian investigators came across another clue: A CD-ROM in the car of another Algerian, who had been trained in Afghanistan in 1992 and was part of the G.I.A. cell in Brussels. The CD was initially ignored, Belgian officials say. \n Months later, the Belgians began translating its contents and discovered several different versions of a manual for terrorism that had begun circulating among Islamic militants in the early 1990's. The voluminous manual covered diverse subjects, from \"psychological war in Islam\" to \"the organizational structure of Israeli intelligence\" to \"recruiting according to the American method.\" \n The manual also offered detailed recipes for making bombs, including instructions on when to shake the chemicals and how to use a wristwatch as a detonator. In addition there were instructions on how to kill with toxins, gases and drugs. The preface included a dedication to the new hero of the holy war: Osama bin Laden. Versions of the manual circulated widely and were seized by the police all over Europe. \n Reuel Gerecht, a former C.I.A. official, said he was told that the agency did not obtain its own copy of the manual before the end of 1999. \"The truth is,\" he said, \"they missed for years the largest terrorist guide ever written.\" The omission, he asserted, reflects the agency's reluctance to scrutinize the fallout from its support of the anti-Soviet jihad. \n A C.I.A. official said that the agency had had \"access to versions\" of the manual since the late 1980's. \"It's not the Holy Grail that Gerecht reports it to be,\" he said, adding that the terrorist-related parts were fairly recent additions. \n By the mid-1990's, American officials had begun to focus on Mr. bin Laden and his entourage in Sudan. They saw him as the embodiment of a dangerous new development: a stateless sponsor of terrorism who was using his personal fortune \u2014 which one Middle Eastern official estimated at $270 million \u2014 to bankroll extremist causes. \n American officials pressed Sudan to eject Mr. bin Laden, and in 1996 they succeeded, forcing him into exile. It was a diplomatic triumph, but one that many American officials would come to rue. Mr. bin Laden made his way back to Afghanistan, where a new group of young Islamic militants, the Taliban, was taking control. \n American and Middle Eastern officials said some of the cash that the Taliban used to buy off local warlords came from Mr. bin Laden. Soon the new, hard-line rulers of Afghanistan allowed him to use their country to pursue his goal of creating \"one jihad camp for the world,\" as Mr. Anas put it. \n The Edict: \n A Sacred Muslim Duty to Kill All Foes \n Two years after he arrived in Afghanistan, in February 1998, Mr. bin Laden publicly announced his intentions. At a camp in Khost, in eastern Afghanistan, he and several other leaders of militant groups declared that they had founded the International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, an umbrella entity that included Al Qaeda and groups from Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh, among others. \n The front issued the following fatwa: \"To kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military, is an individual duty of every Muslim who is able, in any country where this is possible.\" \n On Aug. 7, 1998, eight years to the day after the first American troops set foot in Saudi Arabia, Mr. bin Laden delivered on the threat, American prosecutors say. Bombs exploded hours apart at the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. \n The plot, as described by federal prosecutors, was truly international. Prosecutors assert that the attacks were carried out by Muslims from Tanzania, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, most of whom were trained in Afghanistan. The Kenyan plotters, they say, spoke directly with Mr. bin Laden by satellite telephone as they developed their plans. \n The attacks were costly for Al Qaeda. Less than two weeks after the embassy bombings, the United States conducted air strikes against Mr. bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan. Over the next two years, police and intelligence agencies around the world, many prodded by the United States, arrested more than 100 militants in some 20 countries. \n Almost every month, authorities detain or question people with ties to Al Qaeda. Late last year, in what American officials described as one of the more alarming cases, the Kuwaiti police arrested a local man, an Afghan veteran, who said he was associated with Mr. bin Laden's group and planning to bomb American and Kuwaiti targets. American officials say he ultimately led the police to a weapons cache of almost 300 pounds of explosives and more than 1,400 detonators. \n And in addition to the two-day closure of the American Embassy in Rome, officials say, recent warnings of a possible Al Qaeda attack prompted the United States to divert an entire carrier battle group scheduled to dock in Naples. \n American officials acknowledge that Al Qaeda and Mr. bin Laden have proven resourceful, resilient adversaries. Much of his personal wealth has now been spent, or is in bank accounts that are now frozen. But officials say he is raising money through a network of charities and businesses. His group reconstitutes its networks in many countries as quickly as they are disrupted. \n And failure can breed success. In late 1999, American officials say, a group of Yemenis botched an attempt to blow up an American ship, The Sullivans, as it passed through Yemen. Their boat, loaded with explosives, sank a few feet off shore. \n This year, American officials say, a Saudi operative of Mr. bin Laden's who helped organize that attack worked with some of the same people on the bombing of the Cole in Yemen. \n Internal crackdowns on Muslim militants, like the Algerian government's largely successful attempts to stamp out the G.I.A. in the mid- 1990's, have in several instances fueled the international jihad. \n American officials said the most radical Algerians were now collaborating with Mr. bin Laden. In 1999, Algerians were for the first time implicated in plots against the United States, when Ahmed Ressam was arrested crossing the border from Canada with a carload of explosives. Mr. Ressam goes on trial later this year in Los Angeles. \n American and Middle Eastern officials say Al Qaeda has now expanded its jihad to include Israel, which until recently had regarded Mr. bin Laden as an American problem. The officials say Al Qaeda has financed and trained an anti-Israel group, Asbat al Ansar, that operates from a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon. \n Last June, Israel charged in a sealed indictment that a Hamas member who was plotting to attack targets within Israel, including settlers and the army, had been trained in one of Mr. bin Laden's Afghan camps. \"Al Qaeda wants in on the action \u2014 the new intifada against Israel,\" said one American official. \n Olivier Roy, a French scholar who follows Islamic activities, says Al Qaeda's biggest asset is the thousands of jihadists around the world who no longer see their struggle in strictly local or even national terms, which makes them impervious to normal political or military pressure. \n Mr. bin Laden's actions, he said, are \"not the continuation of politics by other means.\" \n \"Osama bin Laden doesn't want to negotiate.\" "}, {"text": "One Man and a Global Web of Violence\n2001-01-13T05:00:00.000Z\n In 1987, several years after he began training Arab volunteers to oust Soviet forces from Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden had a vision. The time had come, he told friends, to start a global jihad, or Islamic holy war, against the corrupt secular governments of the Muslim Middle East and the Western powers that supported them. \n Mr. bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire, would use his camps in Afghanistan to take holy warriors from around the world \u2014 who had always pursued local goals \u2014 and shape them into an international network that would fight to bring all Muslims under a militant version of Islamic law. \n Some of his comrades in arms warned him that the goal was unattainable. \n \"I talked to Osama one day and asked him what was he doing,\" recalled Abdullah Anas, an Algerian who was fighting in Afghanistan at the time and provided a rare personal narrative of the formation of Mr. bin Laden's organization. \" `Imagine after five years a guy from Malaysia goes back to his country. How can he remember you are his leader? He will get married, have children, engage in work in his country. How can you establish one camp for jihad in the world?' \" \n But he and other doubters watched as Mr. bin Laden, who is now America's most wanted terror suspect, set about doing just that. Mr. Anas's account and those of other witnesses, along with intelligence from United States, the Middle East and Europe, draw a vivid and newly detailed portrait of the birth of a modern jihad movement. What began as a holy war against the Soviet Union took on a new dimension, Mr. Anas said, when Mr. bin Laden broke away and established a new corps of militant Muslims whose ambitions reached far beyond the borders of Afghanistan. \n From his Afghan camps, Mr. bin Laden created a kind of clearinghouse for Islamic terrorism, which American officials say not only conducts its own operations but trains and underwrites local militants, connecting home-grown plots to a global crusade. \n His strategy is aptly captured by one of his many code names: The Contractor. The group he founded 13 years ago, Al Qaeda, Arabic for The Base, is led by masterful opportunists who tailor their roles to the moment, sometimes teaching the fine points of explosives, sometimes sending in their own operatives, sometimes simply supplying inspiration. \n The group has become a beacon for Muslim Malaysians, Algerians, Filipinos, Palestinians, Egyptians, even Americans who have come to view the United States as their enemy, an imperial power propping up corrupt and godless governments. Mr. bin Laden has tried to bridge divisions in a movement long plagued by doctrinal, ethnic and geographic differences. \"Local politics drives what they're doing, but it's much more visionary,\" said Robert Blitzer, a former F.B.I. counterterrorism official. \"This is worldwide. This is, `We want to be somewhere in a hundred years.' \" \n According to a recent Central Intelligence Agency analysis, Al Qaeda operates about a dozen Afghan camps that have trained as many as 5,000 militants, who in turn have created cells in 50 countries. Intelligence officials say the group is experimenting with chemical weapons, including nerve gas, at one of its camps. \n Mr. bin Laden and his supporters use centuries-old interpretations of the Koran to justify violence in the name of God against fellow Muslims or bystanders \u2014 a vision on the farthest extremes of one of the world's largest religions. But their operations are thoroughly modern \u2014 encrypted e-mail, bomb-making recipes stored on CD-ROM's, cell phones and satellite communications. \n The group plans attacks months or years in advance, investigators say. A former United States Army sergeant, Ali Mohammed \u2014 who worked for Mr. bin Laden and is now a government witness \u2014 has told prosecutors that Al Qaeda trains \"sleeper\" agents, or \"submarines,\" to live undetected among local populations. \n Mr. bin Laden has not achieved his more ambitious goals. He has not brought more Muslims under the rule of Islamic law, toppled any of the Arab governments he took aim at, or driven the United States out of the Middle East. His violence has repulsed many believers and prompted severe crackdowns in Arab states that already have limited political freedoms. \n Nonetheless, he and his small inner circle have preoccupied American officials, paralyzing embassies, thwarting military exercises and making Americans abroad feel anxious and vulnerable. Earlier this month, the United States closed its Rome embassy for nearly two days after intelligence officials warned of a possible attack. \n American officials have charged Mr. bin Laden with masterminding the 1998 bombings of two embassies in Africa that killed more than 200 people, and suspect him of involvement in the October bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen, which killed 17 sailors. Four men went on trial this month in lower Manhattan in the African bombings. \n American authorities are also examining Al Qaeda's role in three plots timed to millennium celebrations in 1999 \u2014 attacks directed at another American ship, a so-far unknown target in the United States, and tourist sites and a hotel in Jordan. \n Mr. bin Laden's group has recently attempted operations against Israel \u2014 a significant departure, American and Middle Eastern officials say. They acknowledge that he has ensured his organization's survival, in the event of his capture or death, by designating a successor: his longtime aide, Abdulaziz abu Sitta, an Egyptian known as Muhammad Atef or Abu Hoffs al-Masri. Last week, according to Al Jazeera, an Arab satellite channel, his son married Mr. Masri's daughter in Kandahar, Afghanistan. \n \"His arrest, which we dearly hope for, is only one step along the road of the many things we need to do to eliminate the network of organizations,\" said Richard A. Clarke, the top White House counterterrorism official. \n The Cause: \n Afghan War Draws Young Arab Fighters \n Al Qaeda grew out of the jihad inspired by Muslim scholars to combat the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. They issued religious rulings, known as fatwas, which exhorted Muslims everywhere to defend the Islamic land of Afghanistan from infidels. Over the next few years, several thousand young Arab men joined the Afghan resistance. \n One of the first to answer the call was a young Algerian named Boujema Bounouar, who went by the nom de guerre Abdullah Anas. In recent interviews in London, where he now lives, Mr. Anas recounted how Mr. bin Laden went to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets and was drawn to a group of Egyptians who wanted to start a global jihad. \n Mr. Anas, who is now a leader of an Algerian Islamic political party, is not a dispassionate observer. He acknowledges that he opposed Mr. bin Laden, whose program of terrorism, he says, has tarred the reputations of thousands of Arabs who fought honorably for the Afghan cause. But his firsthand account, which conforms with Western intelligence analysis, provides one of few portraits of Mr. bin Laden's evolution as a militant leader. \n The two men were defined by many of the same forces. \n Mr. Anas said his journey from teacher of the Koran to mujahid, or holy warrior, began in 1984, when he was 25 and living with his family in Western Algeria. Visiting the local library, he read in a news weekly about a religious ruling that waging war against the Soviets was every Muslim's duty. \n \"After a few days, everyone heard about this fatwa and started talking,\" he recalled. \" `Where is this Afghanistan? Which people are they? How can we go there? How much is the ticket?' \" \n That year, Mr. Anas was among the million Muslims who participated in the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. \"You feel very holy,\" he said. \"People from all over the world. From Zimbabwe to New Delhi. Everyone is wearing just two pieces of white cotton. Everybody. You can't describe who is the minister, who is the president. No jewelry. No good suit.\" \n In Mecca, he said, prayer leaders spoke emotionally about the jihad in Afghanistan. \n He was standing in the marble expanse of the Great Mosque with 50,000 others when, he said, a friend pointed out a radical Palestinian scholar who was organizing the Arab support for the Afghans. His name was Abdullah Azzam, and his writings, which would help spur the revival of the jihad movement in the 20th century, were just becoming widely known. \n Mr. Anas introduced himself and asked whether the magazine article he had seen in the library was correct. Had the religious leaders agreed that fighting in Afghanistan was a duty of all Muslims? \n \"He said, `Yes, it's true.' \" \n \" `O.K.,' I said. `If I want to go to Afghanistan, what do I do now?' \" \n Mr. Azzam gave him a business card with a telephone number in Islamabad, Pakistan, where he was a university professor. A week later, Mr. Anas was on a flight from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan. \n He had no idea where he was going, or what he would do. He dialed the only phone number he knew in Pakistan, reaching Mr. Azzam, who offered him a place to stay in his own house, a bustling salon frequented by students and scholars. \n It was there that he first caught sight of Mr. Azzam's youngest daughter, whom he would marry five years later. And Mr. Azzam introduced him to a Saudi visitor identified in the traditional Arabic way, as Abu Abdullah, the father of his eldest son, Abdullah. The visitor was Osama bin Laden. \n The two men exchanged pleasantries. Mr. bin Laden's name was well known. He was said to be the youngest of 24 brothers in a family that ran one of the largest construction companies in the Arab world. \n Mr. bin Laden seemed no different from the other Arab volunteers who were starting to arrive in Pakistan, Mr. Anas recalled. The conversation turned to how the volunteers could help the Afghans win their jihad, and teach them more about Islam. \n The Soviet forces had a considerable advantage in the Afghan conflict. Their helicopter gunships controlled the air, and their troops held the main roads. But the rebels had powerful friends. The United States and Saudi Arabia were spending millions funneling arms to the Afghans through Pakistan's intelligence service. \n Mr. Anas began by teaching the Koran to the Afghan rebels, who did not speak Arabic and learned the verses by rote. He also led prayers at a \"guest house\" set up in Pakistan for Arab volunteers. At the time, he said, there were no more than a few dozen Arabs in the country, working with the rebels. None spoke the Afghan languages. \n After a few months, Mr. Anas said, he trekked into Afghanistan to join a combat unit, one of three Arabs traveling with a caravan of 600 Afghan soldiers. He learned Farsi and took on the role of mediator, traveling among the feuding rebel camps. He spent most of each year inside Afghanistan. \n Mr. Anas became a top aide to Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud, whose troops controlled northern Afghanistan and are now fighting the Taliban rulers \u2014 who support Mr. bin Laden. \n Like many Muslims who joined the rebels, Mr. Anas expected to die in the Afghan jihad and earn the special status designated in the Koran for martyrs, which includes forgiveness of sins and the enjoyment in Paradise of beautiful virgins. \"It's not the main idea to be a shahid,\" or martyr, he said. \"But it's part of my plan.\" \n In the mid-1980's, American and Middle Eastern intelligence officials say, Mr. bin Laden moved to Peshawar, a Pakistani city near the border with Afghanistan. The city was a staging ground for the war against the Soviets; American, French and Pakistani intelligence officers intrigued and competed there to manipulate the Afghan cause to their countries' advantage. \n Mr. bin Laden's fortune of several hundred million dollars gained him immediate popularity. \n \"He was one of the guys who came to jihad in Afghanistan,\" Mr. Anas said. \"But unlike the others, what he had was a lot of money. He's not very sophisticated politically or organizationally. But he's an activist with great imagination. He ate very little. He slept very little. Very generous. He'd give you his clothes. He'd give you his money.\" \n Mr. Anas, who returned annually to Pakistan from the Afghan battlefields to visit with Mr. Azzam, said Mr. bin Laden at first slept in the guest house in Peshawar on a cushion on the floor. He recalled that Mr. Azzam liked to say: \"You see, this man has everything in his country. You see he lives with all the poor people in this room.\" \n At about this time, in 1984, Mr. Azzam set up the organization that would play a pivotal role in the global jihad over the next decade. It was called the Makhtab al Khadimat, the Office of Services, and its goal was to recruit and train Muslim volunteers for the Afghan fronts. Mr. Azzam raised money for the organization in countries overseas including the United States and gave impassioned speeches promoting the Afghan cause. Mr. bin Laden embraced the idea from its inception and became Mr. Azzam's partner, providing financial support and handling military affairs. \n Mr. bin Laden worked best with small groups, Mr. Anas said. \"When you sit with Osama, you don't want to leave the meeting,\" he said. \"You wish to continue talking to him because he is very calm, very fluent.\" \n A main goal of the Office of Services, Mr. Anas said, was to prevent the increasing number of outside volunteers from taking sides in the rebels' factional struggles. \"We are in Afghanistan to help the jihad and all the Afghan people,\" Mr. Azzam told him. \n But there was increasing frustration from many of the disaffected young Muslims over Mr. Azzam's insistence that the Office of Services support only the Afghan cause \u2014 when many were agitated about the plight of their own homelands. Some approached Mr. bin Laden. \n \"They told him: `You shouldn't be staying with Abdullah Azzam. He doesn't do anything about the regimes \u2014 Saudi, Egyptian, Algerian. He's just talking about Afghanistan,' \" Mr. Anas said. \n \"These people are always saying to Osama: `You should establish something. Have a clear idea to use these people after Afghanistan for other wars.' \" \n Among those most ardently courting Mr. bin Laden was a group of Egyptian radicals called the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which helped assassinate President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981. \n The Egyptian group advocated the overthrow of governments by terrorism and violence, and one of its key figures, Ayman al- Zawahiri, had taken shelter in Afghanistan. Mr. Anas said \u2014 and Western intelligence agencies agree \u2014 that Dr. Zawahiri was a commanding early influence on Mr. bin Laden. Today he is part of Al Qaeda's leadership, according to intelligence officials. \n But Mr. Azzam quarreled bitterly with the Egyptians. \n Mr. Anas said he once witnessed a heated argument between Mr. Azzam and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a radical religious scholar, who argued that the flouting of Islamic law had turned Presidents Mohammed Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt into infidels who could therefore be killed. Sheik Abdel Rahman later moved to Brooklyn, where he was associated with an Office of Services branch. In 1995 he was convicted of plotting to blow up New York landmarks. \n In 1986, according to Mr. Anas and Middle Eastern intelligence officials, Mr. bin Laden began to chart a separate course. He established his own training camp for Persian Gulf Arabs, a group of about 50 who lived in tents set apart from the other Afghan fighters. He called the camp Al Masadah \u2014 The Lion's Den. \n Within little more than a year the movement divided, as Mr. bin Laden and the Egyptians founded Al Qaeda \u2014 the \"base\" for what they hoped would be a global crusade. \n Mr. Anas said Mr. Azzam confided to him that Egyptian ideologues had wooed Mr. bin Laden away, gaining access to his money. \"He told me one time: `I'm very upset about Osama. This heaven-sent man, like an angel. I am worried about his future if he stays with these people.' \" \n The differences between Mr. Azzam and Mr. bin Laden were largely tactical, Mr. Anas said, noting that the two men remained friends. \n A committed enemy of Israel, Mr. Azzam believed the Arab warriors should focus on creating an Islamic state in Afghanistan, a process that could take decades. Mr. bin Laden, according to Mr. Anas, came to believe that such a war could be fought in many countries simultaneously. \n \"The arguments were very secret,\" Mr. Anas said. \"Only three to four people knew about them at the time.\" Mr. Azzam saw little difference between the United States and the Soviet Union, contending in his articles and speeches that both were hostile to Islam. But Mr. Azzam opposed terrorism against the West, Mr. Anas said. \n By the late 1980's, Peshawar had become a magnet for disaffected young Muslims who shared Mr. bin Laden's views. \"Ten people would open a guest house and start issuing fatwas,\" Mr. Anas recalled. \" `We are going to make revolution in Jordan, in Egypt, in Syria.' And they haven't got any contact with the real jihad in Afghanistan.\" \n The tide of the Afghan war was turning. Stinger missiles, provided through the American covert program, had forced Soviet aircraft to fly far above the battlefields. Afghanistan had become Moscow's Vietnam. By February 1989, the Soviets had withdrawn. \n A C.I.A. official said that the agency, aware of the changing nature of the jihad, had taken some steps he would not specify to counter the threat. But Milt Bearden, the former C.I.A. station chief in Islamabad, who coordinated the agency's anti-Soviet effort in Afghanistan, disagreed. \n \"The Soviet Union, armed to the teeth, was falling apart,\" he said. \"A shooting war then erupted in the Persian Gulf. Afghanistan was off the front burner.\" \n When the war ended, he said, \"we got the hell out of there.\" \n The Afghan rebels' war continued, first against the Soviet-backed government and then within their own ranks. On Nov. 24, 1989, Mr. Azzam and two sons were killed by a car bomb in Peshawar as they drove to Friday Prayers. The murders were never solved. \n Mr. Anas said he tried to take over leadership of the Office of Services. According to the C.I.A., the group split; the extremist faction took control, siding with Mr. bin Laden. \n \"They loved the ideas of Osama and the person of Abdullah Azzam,\" Mr. Anas said wistfully. \"They don't love me.\" \n The Base: \n From Many Lands, Under One Banner \n Fired by their triumph over the Soviets, the Arabs who had fought in Afghanistan returned home, eager to apply the principles of jihad to their native lands. \n The Koran sets strict limits on when and how holy war is to be undertaken. But Gilles Kepel, a leading French scholar of contemporary Islam, said the Afghan veterans were guided by their own radical interpretation of sacred Muslim texts. \"Intoxicated by the Muslim victory in Afghanistan,\" he said, \"they believed that it could be replicated elsewhere \u2014 that the whole world was ripe for jihad, which is contrary to Islamic tradition.\" \n They called themselves the Arab Afghans. \n In Jordan some founded a group, Jaish Muhammad, that officials say took aim at King Hussein, whose family claims descent from the Prophet Muhammad. \n In Algeria, the Arab Afghans were among the founders of the Armed Islamic Group, the most radical to emerge after the military government canceled the 1991 elections. Known by its French initials, G.I.A, it began by blowing up military targets and escalated to wholesale massacres of Algerians who did not believe in the jihad. \n According to Mr. Anas, one of its founding members was an Algerian who had initially fought with him in Afghanistan but joined Al Qaeda in the late 1980's. Mr. Anas says he has been told that Mr. bin Laden provided some of the seed money for the G.I.A. \n The early 1990's proved difficult for Mr. bin Laden. He was enraged by King Fahd's decision to let American troops wage the Persian Gulf war from Saudi Arabia, site of the two holiest shrines in Islam. He began to focus his wrath on the United States and the Saudi government. After the conflict ended, he moved to Afghanistan. \n But his stay was brief. Within months he fled, telling associates that Saudi Arabia had hired the Pakistani intelligence service to kill him. There is no confirmation that such a plot existed. Nonetheless, in 1991, Mr. bin Laden moved to Sudan, where a militantly Islamic government had taken power. \n Over the next five years, Mr. bin Laden built a group that combined legitimate business with support for world holy war. \n He also set out to accomplish his overriding goal of gathering the leading Islamic extremist groups under one banner. According to Middle Eastern officials, Mr. bin Laden and his envoys met with radicals from Pakistan and Egypt to propose an international Islamic front, led by Afghan veterans, that would fight Americans and Jews. \n Al Qaeda began training its own operatives. Ali Mohammed, the government witness, who has said he arranged Mr. bin Laden's move to Sudan, told investigators that he taught group members about weapons, explosives, kidnapping, urban fighting, counterintelligence and other tactics at camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. He said he showed some of the trainees how to set up cells \"that could be used in operations.\" \n The dispatch of American troops to Somalia in late 1992 and 1993 as part of a United Nations mission was another affront to Mr. bin Laden. The Bush administration presented it as a relief operation. \n American officials say a defector from Al Qaeda told them it viewed the deployment as a dangerous expansion of American influence in the region and a step toward undermining the Islamic government of Sudan. \n Al Qaeda privately issued fatwas that directed members to attack American soldiers in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the Horn of Africa, according to American prosecutors. They said he also sent his military chief, an Egyptian who had been with him at the formation of Al Qaeda, to find the vulnerabilities of United Nations forces in Africa. \n Al Qaeda created a cell in Kenya as a \"gateway\" to its operations in Somalia, the prosecutors assert. Members of the group blended into Kenyan society, opening legitimate businesses that sold fish and dealt in diamonds, and operating an Islamic charity. \n Federal prosecutors say at least five group members crossed the border to Somalia, where they trained some of the fighters involved in an Oct. 3, 1993, battle with United States special forces that left 18 Americans and several hundred Somalis dead. \n The battle, one of the most widely publicized setbacks for American forces in recent memory, cast a shadow over every subsequent Clinton administration debate on the possible uses of ground troops. American intelligence did not learn of Al Qaeda's role in the ambush until several years later. \n Prosecutors say the group also considered attacking Americans in Kenya to retaliate for the Somalia mission. Mr. Mohammed testified that Mr. bin Laden sent him to Nairobi in late 1993 to look over possible American, French, British and Israeli targets for a bomb attack, including the American Embassy. He said he took photos, drew diagrams and wrote a report, which he delivered to his boss in Khartoum. \"Bin Laden looked at the picture of the American Embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber,\" he said. \n American prosecutors say Al Qaeda had more grandiose plans: a leading member, an Iraqi who Mr. Anas said had first gravitated to Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan, tried to buy enriched uranium in Europe. \n The Iraqi, Mahdouh Mahmud Salim, forged links between Mr. bin Laden's group and others supported by Iran. Mr. Salim met with an Iranian religious official in Khartoum, and soon afterward, the prosecutors say, Al Qaeda members got training from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite group in Lebanon skilled in making car bombs. American officials said this alliance was notable because it marked the first time radicals from the minority Shiite branch of Islam collaborated with extremists from the dominant Sunni branch. \n Mr. bin Laden's business ventures in Sudan \u2014 including a tannery, a transportation company and a construction concern \u2014 raised money and served as cover for the travels of Mr. Salim and others, according to American officials. They said that his companies cornered Sudan's exports of gum, sunflower and sesame products \u2014 and that he invested $50 million of his family money in a new Islamic bank in Khartoum. \n The Network: \n As in Afghanistan, So in the World \n The new jihad movement was fueled by the civil war that consumed Afghanistan in the early 1990's. The training camps that had once schooled soldiers to battle the Soviet enemy now attracted militants more interested in fomenting holy war back home \u2014 in America, Europe or the Middle East \u2014 than in the struggle for control of Afghanistan. \n The Office of Services, the Pakistan-based group founded in the 1980's by Mr. Azzam to recruit soldiers for the anti-Soviet cause, arranged the travels of some of these new jihadists, according to European and American officials. \n Many of those associated with the office, Mr. Anas said, shared Mr. bin Laden's vision of a global movement. American officials suspect they were acting under his instructions, though this remains a subject of debate among intelligence analysts. \n American investigators stumbled across the first signs of the new global phenomenon in 1993, when they began to examine the bombing at the World Trade Center. \n They discovered that the four men who carried out the attack, which killed 6 and wounded more than 1,000, had ties to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, whom they charged with leading a worldwide \"jihad organization\" that had begun plotting to kill Americans as early as 1989. \n Mr. Abdel Rahman was later convicted of conspiring to blow up New York landmarks, including the United Nations. But in the years since, American intelligence officials have come to believe that he and the World Trade Center bombers had ties to Al Qaeda. \n The evidence is suggestive, but not conclusive. Several of those convicted in the World Trade Center case were associated with the Brooklyn refugee center that was a branch of the Office of Services, the Pakistan-based organization that Mr. bin Laden helped finance and lead. The Brooklyn center was headed for a time by Mustafa Shalabi, an Egyptian murdered in 1991 in a case that remains unsolved. Federal prosecutors recently disclosed that it was Mr. Shalabi whom Mr. bin Laden called in 1991 when he needed help moving to Sudan, according to Mr. Mohammed, the federal witness. \n One of the men convicted of bombing the World Trade Center, Ahmad M. Ajaj, spent four months in Pakistan in 1992, returning to the United States with a bomb manual later seized by the United States government. An English translation of the document, entered into evidence in the World Trade Center trial, said that the manual was dated 1982, that it had been published in Amman, Jordan, and that it carried a heading on the front and succeeding pages: The Basic Rule. \n Those appear to be errors. Two separate translations of the document, one done at the request of The New York Times, show that the heading said Al Qaeda \u2014 which translates as The Base, the name of Mr. bin Laden's group. In addition, the document lists a publication date of 1989, a year after Mr. bin Laden founded his organization. And the place of publication is Afghanistan, not Jordan. \n Steven Emerson, a terrorism expert who first pointed out the errors, said they deprived investigators of a subtle early clue to the existence of Mr. bin Laden's group. \n While the trade center trial ended in 1994, federal prosecutors did not open their grand jury investigation of Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda until 1996. \n \"Had the government correctly translated the material,\" Mr. Emerson said, \"it might have understood that the men who blew up the World Trade Center and Mr. bin Laden's group were linked.\" \n Asked about the mistranslation, an official in the United States Attorney's office, who declined to be identified, said only that Mr. Ajaj had been carrying \"voluminous material printed by various organizations.\" He added that their titles referred to international conspiracy, commando operations and engineering of explosives. \n The jihad movement also took root in Europe. In August 1994, three young French Muslims of North African descent, wearing hoods and brandishing machine pistols, opened fire on tourists in a hotel lobby in Marrakesh, Morocco, killing two Spaniards and wounding a third. The French police investigating the attack learned that it had been planned by two Moroccan veterans of the Afghan war, who had recruited commandos for the attack in Paris and Orle\u0301ans and sent more than a dozen of them to Afghanistan for training. \n The indoctrination of the young Muslims began with religion, according to French court papers and testimony. An Orle\u0301ans mathematics professor and interpreter of the Koran, Mohamed Zine\u0301dine, gathered around him a group of men from the slums of Orle\u0301ans who wanted to learn how to pray. Later, French court papers say, he instructed them in the concept of waging jihad against corrupt governments, saying it was a higher stage of Islamic observance. \n One young Moroccan testified that Mr. Zine\u0301dine \u2014 who is now a fugitive \u2014 showed him a videotape of Muslim victims of \"torture in Bosnia, of babies with their throats cut, of pregnant women disemboweled, and fingernails torn off.\" The young man added, \"He told me there was a way of helping them and that I must help them.\" Prayers for people like the Muslims in Bosnia, he quoted Mr. Zine\u0301dine as saying, were not enough. He must become an \"armed humanitarian.\" \n European investigators tracing the Afghan network in France, Belgium and Germany found records of phone calls between local extremists and the Office of Services in Pakistan. In March 1995, Belgian investigators came across another clue: A CD-ROM in the car of another Algerian, who had been trained in Afghanistan in 1992 and was part of the G.I.A. cell in Brussels. The CD was initially ignored, Belgian officials say. \n Months later, the Belgians began translating its contents and discovered several different versions of a manual for terrorism that had begun circulating among Islamic militants in the early 1990's. The voluminous manual covered diverse subjects, from \"psychological war in Islam\" to \"the organizational structure of Israeli intelligence\" to \"recruiting according to the American method.\" \n The manual also offered detailed recipes for making bombs, including instructions on when to shake the chemicals and how to use a wristwatch as a detonator. In addition there were instructions on how to kill with toxins, gases and drugs. The preface included a dedication to the new hero of the holy war: Osama bin Laden. Versions of the manual circulated widely and were seized by the police all over Europe. \n Reuel Gerecht, a former C.I.A. official, said he was told that the agency did not obtain its own copy of the manual before the end of 1999. \"The truth is,\" he said, \"they missed for years the largest terrorist guide ever written.\" The omission, he asserted, reflects the agency's reluctance to scrutinize the fallout from its support of the anti-Soviet jihad. \n A C.I.A. official said that the agency had had \"access to versions\" of the manual since the late 1980's. \"It's not the Holy Grail that Gerecht reports it to be,\" he said, adding that the terrorist-related parts were fairly recent additions. \n By the mid-1990's, American officials had begun to focus on Mr. bin Laden and his entourage in Sudan. They saw him as the embodiment of a dangerous new development: a stateless sponsor of terrorism who was using his personal fortune \u2014 which one Middle Eastern official estimated at $270 million \u2014 to bankroll extremist causes. \n American officials pressed Sudan to eject Mr. bin Laden, and in 1996 they succeeded, forcing him into exile. It was a diplomatic triumph, but one that many American officials would come to rue. Mr. bin Laden made his way back to Afghanistan, where a new group of young Islamic militants, the Taliban, was taking control. \n American and Middle Eastern officials said some of the cash that the Taliban used to buy off local warlords came from Mr. bin Laden. Soon the new, hard-line rulers of Afghanistan allowed him to use their country to pursue his goal of creating \"one jihad camp for the world,\" as Mr. Anas put it. \n The Edict: \n A Sacred Muslim Duty to Kill All Foes \n Two years after he arrived in Afghanistan, in February 1998, Mr. bin Laden publicly announced his intentions. At a camp in Khost, in eastern Afghanistan, he and several other leaders of militant groups declared that they had founded the International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, an umbrella entity that included Al Qaeda and groups from Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh, among others. \n The front issued the following fatwa: \"To kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military, is an individual duty of every Muslim who is able, in any country where this is possible.\" \n On Aug. 7, 1998, eight years to the day after the first American troops set foot in Saudi Arabia, Mr. bin Laden delivered on the threat, American prosecutors say. Bombs exploded hours apart at the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. \n The plot, as described by federal prosecutors, was truly international. Prosecutors assert that the attacks were carried out by Muslims from Tanzania, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, most of whom were trained in Afghanistan. The Kenyan plotters, they say, spoke directly with Mr. bin Laden by satellite telephone as they developed their plans. \n The attacks were costly for Al Qaeda. Less than two weeks after the embassy bombings, the United States conducted air strikes against Mr. bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan. Over the next two years, police and intelligence agencies around the world, many prodded by the United States, arrested more than 100 militants in some 20 countries. \n Almost every month, authorities detain or question people with ties to Al Qaeda. Late last year, in what American officials described as one of the more alarming cases, the Kuwaiti police arrested a local man, an Afghan veteran, who said he was associated with Mr. bin Laden's group and planning to bomb American and Kuwaiti targets. American officials say he ultimately led the police to a weapons cache of almost 300 pounds of explosives and more than 1,400 detonators. \n And in addition to the two-day closure of the American Embassy in Rome, officials say, recent warnings of a possible Al Qaeda attack prompted the United States to divert an entire carrier battle group scheduled to dock in Naples. \n American officials acknowledge that Al Qaeda and Mr. bin Laden have proven resourceful, resilient adversaries. Much of his personal wealth has now been spent, or is in bank accounts that are now frozen. But officials say he is raising money through a network of charities and businesses. His group reconstitutes its networks in many countries as quickly as they are disrupted. \n And failure can breed success. In late 1999, American officials say, a group of Yemenis botched an attempt to blow up an American ship, The Sullivans, as it passed through Yemen. Their boat, loaded with explosives, sank a few feet off shore. \n This year, American officials say, a Saudi operative of Mr. bin Laden's who helped organize that attack worked with some of the same people on the bombing of the Cole in Yemen. \n Internal crackdowns on Muslim militants, like the Algerian government's largely successful attempts to stamp out the G.I.A. in the mid- 1990's, have in several instances fueled the international jihad. \n American officials said the most radical Algerians were now collaborating with Mr. bin Laden. In 1999, Algerians were for the first time implicated in plots against the United States, when Ahmed Ressam was arrested crossing the border from Canada with a carload of explosives. Mr. Ressam goes on trial later this year in Los Angeles. \n American and Middle Eastern officials say Al Qaeda has now expanded its jihad to include Israel, which until recently had regarded Mr. bin Laden as an American problem. The officials say Al Qaeda has financed and trained an anti-Israel group, Asbat al Ansar, that operates from a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon. \n Last June, Israel charged in a sealed indictment that a Hamas member who was plotting to attack targets within Israel, including settlers and the army, had been trained in one of Mr. bin Laden's Afghan camps. \"Al Qaeda wants in on the action \u2014 the new intifada against Israel,\" said one American official. \n Olivier Roy, a French scholar who follows Islamic activities, says Al Qaeda's biggest asset is the thousands of jihadists around the world who no longer see their struggle in strictly local or even national terms, which makes them impervious to normal political or military pressure. \n Mr. bin Laden's actions, he said, are \"not the continuation of politics by other means.\" \n \"Osama bin Laden doesn't want to negotiate.\" "}, {"text": "One Man and a Global Web of Violence\n2001-01-14T05:00:00.000Z\nIn 1987, several years after he began training Arab volunteers to oust Soviet forces from Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden had a vision. The time had come, he told friends, to start a global jihad, or Islamic holy war, against the corrupt secular governments of the Muslim Middle East and the Western powers that supported them.\nMr. bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire, would use his camps in Afghanistan to take holy warriors from around the world -- who had always pursued local goals -- and shape them into an international network that would fight to bring all Muslims under a militant version of Islamic law.\nSome of his comrades in arms warned him that the goal was unattainable.\n''I talked to Osama one day and asked him what was he doing,'' recalled Abdullah Anas, an Algerian who was fighting in Afghanistan at the time and provided a rare personal narrative of the formation of Mr. bin Laden's organization. '' 'Imagine after five years a guy from Malaysia goes back to his country. How can he remember you are his leader? He will get married, have children, engage in work in his country. How can you establish one camp for jihad in the world?' ''\nBut he and other doubters watched as Mr. bin Laden, who is now America's most wanted terror suspect, set about doing just that. Mr. Anas's account and those of other witnesses, along with intelligence from United States, the Middle East and Europe, draw a vivid and newly detailed portrait of the birth of a modern jihad movement. What began as a holy war against the Soviet Union took on a new dimension, Mr. Anas said, when Mr. bin Laden broke away and established a new corps of militant Muslims whose ambitions reached far beyond the borders of Afghanistan.\nFrom his Afghan camps, Mr. bin Laden created a kind of clearinghouse for Islamic terrorism, which American officials say not only conducts its own operations but trains and underwrites local militants, connecting home-grown plots to a global crusade.\nHis strategy is aptly captured by one of his many code names: The Contractor. The group he founded 13 years ago, Al Qaeda, Arabic for The Base, is led by masterful opportunists who tailor their roles to the moment, sometimes teaching the fine points of explosives, sometimes sending in their own operatives, sometimes simply supplying inspiration.\nThe group has become a beacon for Muslim Malaysians, Algerians, Filipinos, Palestinians, Egyptians, even Americans who have come to view the United States as their enemy, an imperial power propping up corrupt and godless governments. Mr. bin Laden has tried to bridge divisions in a movement long plagued by doctrinal, ethnic and geographic differences. ''Local politics drives what they're doing, but it's much more visionary,'' said Robert Blitzer, a former F.B.I. counterterrorism official. ''This is worldwide. This is, 'We want to be somewhere in a hundred years.' ''\nAccording to a recent Central Intelligence Agency analysis, Al Qaeda operates about a dozen Afghan camps that have trained as many as 5,000 militants, who in turn have created cells in 50 countries. Intelligence officials say the group is experimenting with chemical weapons, including nerve gas, at one of its camps.\nMr. bin Laden and his supporters use centuries-old interpretations of the Koran to justify violence in the name of God against fellow Muslims or bystanders -- a vision on the farthest extremes of one of the world's largest religions. But their operations are thoroughly modern -- encrypted e-mail, bomb-making recipes stored on CD-ROM's, cell phones and satellite communications.\nThe group plans attacks months or years in advance, investigators say. A former United States Army sergeant, Ali A. Mohamed -- who worked for Mr. bin Laden and is now a government witness -- has told prosecutors that Al Qaeda trains ''sleeper'' agents, or ''submarines,'' to live undetected among local populations.\nMr. bin Laden has not achieved his more ambitious goals. He has not brought more Muslims under the rule of Islamic law, toppled any of the Arab governments he took aim at, or driven the United States out of the Middle East. His violence has repulsed many believers and prompted severe crackdowns in Arab states that already have limited political freedoms.\nNonetheless, he and his small inner circle have preoccupied American officials, paralyzing embassies, thwarting military exercises and making Americans abroad feel anxious and vulnerable. Earlier this month, the United States closed its Rome embassy for nearly two days after intelligence officials warned of a possible attack.\nAmerican officials have charged Mr. bin Laden with masterminding the 1998 bombings of two embassies in Africa that killed more than 200 people, and suspect him of involvement in the October bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen, which killed 17 sailors. Four men went on trial this month in lower Manhattan in the African bombings.\nAmerican authorities are also examining Al Qaeda's role in three plots timed to millennium celebrations in 1999 -- attacks directed at another American ship, a so-far unknown target in the United States, and tourist sites and a hotel in Jordan.\nMr. bin Laden's group has recently attempted operations against Israel -- a significant departure, American and Middle Eastern officials say. They acknowledge that he has ensured his organization's survival, in the event of his capture or death, by designating a successor: his longtime aide, Abdulaziz abu Sitta, an Egyptian known as Muhammad Atef or Abu Hoffs al-Masri. Last week, according to Al Jazeera, an Arab satellite channel, his son married Mr. Masri's daughter in Kandahar, Afghanistan.\n''His arrest, which we dearly hope for, is only one step along the road of the many things we need to do to eliminate the network of organizations,'' said Richard A. Clarke, the top White House counterterrorism official.\nThe Cause\nAfghan War Draws Young Arab Fighters\nAl Qaeda grew out of the jihad inspired by Muslim scholars to combat the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. They issued religious rulings, known as fatwas, which exhorted Muslims everywhere to defend the Islamic land of Afghanistan from infidels. Over the next few years, several thousand young Arab men joined the Afghan resistance.\nOne of the first to answer the call was a young Algerian named Boujema Bounouar, who went by the nom de guerre Abdullah Anas. In recent interviews in London, where he now lives, Mr. Anas recounted how Mr. bin Laden went to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets and was drawn to a group of Egyptians who wanted to start a global jihad.\nMr. Anas, who is now a leader of an Algerian Islamic political party, is not a dispassionate observer. He acknowledges that he opposed Mr. bin Laden, whose program of terrorism, he says, has tarred the reputations of thousands of Arabs who fought honorably for the Afghan cause. But his firsthand account, which conforms with Western intelligence analysis, provides one of few portraits of Mr. bin Laden's evolution as a militant leader.\nThe two men were defined by many of the same forces. Mr. Anas said his journey from teacher of the Koran to holy warrior began in 1984, when he was 25 and living with his family in Western Algeria. Visiting the local library, he read in a news weekly about a religious ruling that waging war against the Soviets was every Muslim's duty.\n''After a few days, everyone heard about this fatwa and started talking,'' he recalled. '' 'Where is this Afghanistan? Which people are they? How can we go there? How much is the ticket?' ''\nThat year, Mr. Anas was among the million Muslims who participated in the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. ''You feel very holy,'' he said. ''People from all over the world. From Zimbabwe to New Delhi. Everyone is wearing just two pieces of white cotton. Everybody. You can't describe who is the minister, who is the president. No jewelry. No good suit.''\nIn Mecca, he said, prayer leaders spoke emotionally about the jihad in Afghanistan.\nHe was standing in the marble expanse of the Great Mosque with 50,000 others when, he said, a friend pointed out a radical Palestinian scholar who was organizing the Arab support for the Afghans. His name was Abdullah Azzam, and his writings, which would help spur the revival of the jihad movement in the 20th century, were just becoming widely known.\nMr. Anas introduced himself and asked whether the magazine article he had seen in the library was correct. Had the religious leaders agreed that fighting in Afghanistan was a duty of all Muslims?\n''He said, 'Yes, it's true.' ''\n'' 'O.K.,' I said. 'If I want to go to Afghanistan, what do I do now?' ''\nMr. Azzam gave him a business card with a telephone number in Islamabad, Pakistan, where he was a university professor. A week later, Mr. Anas was on a flight from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan.\nHe had no idea where he was going, or what he would do. He dialed the only phone number he knew in Pakistan, reaching Mr. Azzam, who offered him a place to stay in his own house, a bustling salon frequented by students and scholars.\nIt was there that he first caught sight of Mr. Azzam's youngest daughter, whom he would marry five years later. And Mr. Azzam introduced him to a Saudi visitor identified in the traditional Arabic way, as Abu Abdullah, the father of his eldest son, Abdullah. The visitor was Osama bin Laden.\nThe two men exchanged pleasantries. Mr. bin Laden's name was well known. He was said to be the youngest of 24 brothers in a family that ran one of the largest construction companies in the Arab world.\nMr. bin Laden seemed no different from the other Arab volunteers who were starting to arrive in Pakistan, Mr. Anas recalled. The conversation turned to how the volunteers could help the Afghans win their jihad, and teach them more about Islam.\nThe Soviet forces had a considerable advantage in the Afghan conflict. Their helicopter gunships controlled the air, and their troops held the main roads. But the rebels had powerful friends. The United States and Saudi Arabia were spending millions funneling arms to the Afghans through Pakistan's intelligence service.\nMr. Anas began by teaching the Koran to the Afghan rebels, who did not speak Arabic and learned the verses by rote. He also led prayers at a ''guest house'' set up in Pakistan for Arab volunteers. At the time, he said, there were no more than a few dozen Arabs in the country, working with the rebels. None spoke the Afghan languages.\nAfter a few months, Mr. Anas said, he trekked into Afghanistan to join a combat unit, one of three Arabs traveling with a caravan of 600 Afghan soldiers. He learned Farsi and took on the role of mediator, traveling among the feuding rebel camps. He spent most of each year inside Afghanistan.\nMr. Anas became a top aide to Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud, whose troops controlled northern Afghanistan and are now fighting the Taliban rulers -- who support Mr. bin Laden.\nLike many Muslims who joined the rebels, Mr. Anas expected to die in the Afghan jihad and earn the special status designated in the Koran for martyrs, which includes forgiveness of sins and the enjoyment in Paradise of beautiful virgins. ''It's not the main idea to be a shahid,'' or martyr, he said. ''But it's part of my plan.''\nIn the mid-1980's, American and Middle Eastern intelligence officials say, Mr. bin Laden moved to Peshawar, a Pakistani city near the border with Afghanistan. The city was a staging ground for the war against the Soviets; American, French and Pakistani intelligence officers intrigued and competed there to manipulate the Afghan cause to their countries' advantage.\nMr. bin Laden's fortune of several hundred million dollars gained him immediate popularity.\n''He was one of the guys who came to jihad in Afghanistan,'' Mr. Anas said. ''But unlike the others, what he had was a lot of money. He's not very sophisticated politically or organizationally. But he's an activist with great imagination. He ate very little. He slept very little. Very generous. He'd give you his clothes. He'd give you his money.''\nMr. Anas, who returned annually to Pakistan from the Afghan battlefields to visit with Mr. Azzam, said Mr. bin Laden at first slept in the guest house in Peshawar on a cushion on the floor. He recalled that Mr. Azzam liked to say: ''You see, this man has everything in his country. You see he lives with all the poor people in this room.''\nAt about this time, in 1984, Mr. Azzam set up the organization that would play a pivotal role in the global jihad over the next decade. It was called the Makhtab al Khadimat, the Office of Services, and its goal was to recruit and train Muslim volunteers for the Afghan fronts. Mr. Azzam raised money for the organization in countries overseas including the United States and gave impassioned speeches promoting the Afghan cause. Mr. bin Laden embraced the idea from its inception and became Mr. Azzam's partner, providing financial support and handling military affairs.\nMr. bin Laden worked best with small groups, Mr. Anas said. ''When you sit with Osama, you don't want to leave the meeting,'' he said. ''You wish to continue talking to him because he is very calm, very fluent.''\nA main goal of the Office of Services, Mr. Anas said, was to prevent the increasing number of outside volunteers from taking sides in the rebels' factional struggles. ''We are in Afghanistan to help the jihad and all the Afghan people,'' Mr. Azzam told him.\nBut there was increasing frustration from many of the disaffected young Muslims over Mr. Azzam's insistence that the Office of Services support only the Afghan cause -- when many were agitated about the plight of their own homelands. Some approached Mr. bin Laden.\n''They told him: 'You shouldn't be staying with Abdullah Azzam. He doesn't do anything about the regimes -- Saudi, Egyptian, Algerian. He's just talking about Afghanistan,' '' Mr. Anas said.\n''These people are always saying to Osama: 'You should establish something. Have a clear idea to use these people after Afghanistan for other wars.' ''\nAmong those most ardently courting Mr. bin Laden was a group of Egyptian radicals called the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which helped assassinate President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981.\nThe Egyptian group advocated the overthrow of governments by terrorism and violence, and one of its key figures, Ayman al-Zawahiri, had taken shelter in Afghanistan. Mr. Anas said -- and Western intelligence agencies agree -- that Dr. Zawahiri was a commanding early influence on Mr. bin Laden. Today he is part of Al Qaeda's leadership, according to intelligence officials.\nBut Mr. Azzam quarreled bitterly with the Egyptians.\nMr. Anas said he once witnessed a heated argument between Mr. Azzam and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a radical religious scholar, who argued that the flouting of Islamic law had turned Presidents Mohammed Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt into infidels who could therefore be killed. Sheik Abdel Rahman later moved to Brooklyn, where he was associated with an Office of Services branch. In 1995 he was convicted of plotting to blow up New York landmarks.\nIn 1986, according to Mr. Anas and Middle Eastern intelligence officials, Mr. bin Laden began to chart a separate course. He established his own training camp for Persian Gulf Arabs, a group of about 50 who lived in tents set apart from the other Afghan fighters. He called the camp Al Masadah -- The Lion's Den.\nWithin little more than a year the movement divided, as Mr. bin Laden and the Egyptians founded Al Qaeda -- the ''base'' for what they hoped would be a global crusade.\nMr. Anas said Mr. Azzam confided to him that Egyptian ideologues had wooed Mr. bin Laden away, gaining access to his money. ''He told me one time: 'I'm very upset about Osama. This heaven-sent man, like an angel. I am worried about his future if he stays with these people.' ''\nThe differences between Mr. Azzam and Mr. bin Laden were largely tactical, Mr. Anas said, noting that the two men remained friends.\nA committed enemy of Israel, Mr. Azzam believed the Arab warriors should focus on creating an Islamic state in Afghanistan, a process that could take decades. Mr. bin Laden, according to Mr. Anas, came to believe that such a war could be fought in many countries simultaneously.\n''The arguments were very secret,'' Mr. Anas said. ''Only three to four people knew about them at the time.'' Mr. Azzam saw little difference between the United States and the Soviet Union, contending in his articles and speeches that both were hostile to Islam. But Mr. Azzam opposed terrorism against the West, Mr. Anas said.\nBy the late 1980's, Peshawar had become a magnet for disaffected young Muslims who shared Mr. bin Laden's views. ''Ten people would open a guest house and start issuing fatwas,'' Mr. Anas recalled. '' 'We are going to make revolution in Jordan, in Egypt, in Syria.' And they haven't got any contact with the real jihad in Afghanistan.''\nThe tide of the Afghan war was turning. Stinger missiles, provided through the American covert program, had forced Soviet aircraft to fly far above the battlefields. Afghanistan had become Moscow's Vietnam. By February 1989, the Soviets had withdrawn.\nA C.I.A. official said that the agency, aware of the changing nature of the jihad, had taken some steps he would not specify to counter the threat. But Milt Bearden, the former C.I.A. station chief in Islamabad, who coordinated the agency's anti-Soviet effort in Afghanistan, disagreed.\n''The Soviet Union, armed to the teeth, was falling apart,'' he said. ''A shooting war then erupted in the Persian Gulf. Afghanistan was off the front burner.''\nWhen the war ended, he said, ''we got the hell out of there.''\nThe Afghan rebels' war continued, first against the Soviet-backed government and then within their own ranks. On Nov. 24, 1989, Mr. Azzam and two sons were killed by a car bomb in Peshawar as they drove to Friday Prayers. The murders were never solved.\nMr. Anas said he tried to take over leadership of the Office of Services. According to the C.I.A., the group split; the extremist faction took control, siding with Mr. bin Laden.\n''They loved the ideas of Osama and the person of Abdullah Azzam,'' Mr. Anas said wistfully. ''They don't love me.''\nThe Base\nFrom Many Lands, Under One Banner\nFired by their triumph over the Soviets, the Arabs who had fought in Afghanistan returned home, eager to apply the principles of jihad to their native lands.\nThe Koran sets strict limits on when and how holy war is to be undertaken. But Gilles Kepel, a leading French scholar of contemporary Islam, said the Afghan veterans were guided by their own radical interpretation of sacred Muslim texts. ''Intoxicated by the Muslim victory in Afghanistan,'' he said, ''they believed that it could be replicated elsewhere -- that the whole world was ripe for jihad, which is contrary to Islamic tradition.''\nThey called themselves the Arab Afghans.\nIn Jordan some founded a group, Jaish Muhammad, that officials say took aim at King Hussein, whose family claims descent from the Prophet Muhammad.\nIn Algeria, the Arab Afghans were among the founders of the Armed Islamic Group, the most radical to emerge after the military government canceled the 1991 elections. Known by its French initials, G.I.A, it began by blowing up military targets and escalated to wholesale massacres of Algerians who did not believe in the jihad.\nAccording to Mr. Anas, one of its founding members was an Algerian who had initially fought with him in Afghanistan but joined Al Qaeda in the late 1980's. Mr. Anas says he has been told that Mr. bin Laden provided some of the seed money for the G.I.A.\nThe early 1990's proved difficult for Mr. bin Laden. He was enraged by King Fahd's decision to let American troops wage the Persian Gulf war from Saudi Arabia, site of the two holiest shrines in Islam. He began to focus his wrath on the United States and the Saudi government. After the conflict ended, he moved to Afghanistan.\nBut his stay was brief. Within months he fled, telling associates that Saudi Arabia had hired the Pakistani intelligence service to kill him. There is no confirmation that such a plot existed. Nonetheless, in 1991, Mr. bin Laden moved to Sudan, where a militantly Islamic government had taken power.\nOver the next five years, Mr. bin Laden built a group that combined legitimate business with support for world holy war.\nHe also set out to accomplish his overriding goal of gathering the leading Islamic extremist groups under one banner. According to Middle Eastern officials, Mr. bin Laden and his envoys met with radicals from Pakistan and Egypt to propose an international Islamic front, led by Afghan veterans, that would fight Americans and Jews.\nAl Qaeda began training its own operatives. Ali Mohamed, the government witness, who has said he arranged Mr. bin Laden's move to Sudan, told investigators that he taught group members about weapons, explosives, kidnapping, urban fighting, counterintelligence and other tactics at camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. He said he showed some of the trainees how to set up cells ''that could be used in operations.''\nThe dispatch of American troops to Somalia in late 1992 and 1993 as part of a United Nations mission was another affront to Mr. bin Laden. The Bush administration presented it as a relief operation.\nAmerican officials say a defector from Al Qaeda told them it viewed the deployment as a dangerous expansion of American influence in the region and a step toward undermining the Islamic government of Sudan.\nAl Qaeda privately issued fatwas that directed members to attack American soldiers in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the Horn of Africa, according to American prosecutors. They said he also sent his military chief, an Egyptian who had been with him at the formation of Al Qaeda, to find the vulnerabilities of United Nations forces in Africa.\nAl Qaeda created a cell in Kenya as a ''gateway'' to its operations in Somalia, the prosecutors assert. Members of the group blended into Kenyan society, opening legitimate businesses that sold fish and dealt in diamonds, and operating an Islamic charity.\nFederal prosecutors say at least five group members crossed the border to Somalia, where they trained some of the fighters involved in an Oct. 3, 1993, battle with United States special forces that left 18 Americans and several hundred Somalis dead.\nThe battle, one of the most widely publicized setbacks for American forces in recent memory, cast a shadow over every subsequent Clinton administration debate on the possible uses of ground troops. American intelligence did not learn of Al Qaeda's role in the ambush until several years later.\nProsecutors say the group also considered attacking Americans in Kenya to retaliate for the Somalia mission. Mr. Mohamed testified that Mr. bin Laden sent him to Nairobi in late 1993 to look over possible American, French, British and Israeli targets for a bomb attack, including the American Embassy. He said he took photos, drew diagrams and wrote a report, which he delivered to his boss in Khartoum. ''Bin Laden looked at the picture of the American Embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber,'' he said.\nAmerican prosecutors say Al Qaeda had more grandiose plans: a leading member, an Iraqi who Mr. Anas said had first gravitated to Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan, tried to buy enriched uranium in Europe.\nThe Iraqi, Mahdouh Mahmud Salim, forged links between Mr. bin Laden's group and others supported by Iran. Mr. Salim met with an Iranian religious official in Khartoum, and soon afterward, the prosecutors say, Al Qaeda members got training from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite group in Lebanon skilled in making car bombs. American officials said this alliance was notable because it marked the first time radicals from the minority Shiite branch of Islam collaborated with extremists from the dominant Sunni branch.\nMr. bin Laden's business ventures in Sudan -- including a tannery, a transportation company and a construction concern -- raised money and served as cover for the travels of Mr. Salim and others, according to American officials. They said that his companies cornered Sudan's exports of gum, sunflower and sesame products -- and that he invested $50 million of his family money in a new Islamic bank in Khartoum.\nThe Network\nAs in Afghanistan, So in the World\nThe new jihad movement was fueled by the civil war that consumed Afghanistan in the early 1990's. The training camps that had once schooled soldiers to battle the Soviet enemy now attracted militants more interested in fomenting holy war back home -- in America, Europe or the Middle East -- than in the struggle for control of Afghanistan.\nThe Office of Services, the Pakistan-based group founded in the 1980's by Mr. Azzam to recruit soldiers for the anti-Soviet cause, arranged the travels of some of these new jihadists, according to European and American officials.\nMany of those associated with the office, Mr. Anas said, shared Mr. bin Laden's vision of a global movement. American officials suspect they were acting under his instructions, though this remains a subject of debate among intelligence analysts.\nAmerican investigators stumbled across the first signs of the new global phenomenon in 1993, when they began to examine the bombing at the World Trade Center.\nThey discovered that the four men who carried out the attack, which killed 6 and wounded more than 1,000, had ties to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, whom they charged with leading a worldwide ''jihad organization'' that had begun plotting to kill Americans as early as 1989.\nMr. Abdel Rahman was later convicted of conspiring to blow up New York landmarks, including the United Nations. But in the years since, American intelligence officials have come to believe that he and the World Trade Center bombers had ties to Al Qaeda.\nThe evidence is suggestive, but not conclusive. Several of those convicted in the World Trade Center case were associated with the Brooklyn refugee center that was a branch of the Office of Services, the Pakistan-based organization that Mr. bin Laden helped finance and lead. The Brooklyn center was headed for a time by Mustafa Shalabi, an Egyptian murdered in 1991 in a case that remains unsolved. Federal prosecutors recently disclosed that it was Mr. Shalabi whom Mr. bin Laden called in 1991 when he needed help moving to Sudan, according to Mr. Mohamed, the federal witness.\nOne of the men convicted of bombing the World Trade Center, Ahmad M. Ajaj, spent four months in Pakistan in 1992, returning to the United States with a bomb manual later seized by the United States government. An English translation of the document, entered into evidence in the World Trade Center trial, said that the manual was dated 1982, that it had been published in Amman, Jordan, and that it carried a heading on the front and succeeding pages: The Basic Rule.\nThose appear to be errors. Two separate translations of the document, one done at the request of The New York Times, show that the heading said Al Qaeda -- which translates as The Base, the name of Mr. bin Laden's group. In addition, the document lists a publication date of 1989, a year after Mr. bin Laden founded his organization. And the place of publication is Afghanistan, not Jordan.\nSteven Emerson, a terrorism expert who first pointed out the errors, said they deprived investigators of a subtle early clue to the existence of Mr. bin Laden's group.\nWhile the trade center trial ended in 1994, federal prosecutors did not open their grand jury investigation of Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda until 1996.\n''Had the government correctly translated the material,'' Mr. Emerson said, ''it might have understood that the men who blew up the World Trade Center and Mr. bin Laden's group were linked.''\nAsked about the mistranslation, an official in the United States Attorney's office, who declined to be identified, said only that Mr. Ajaj had been carrying ''voluminous material printed by various organizations.'' He added that their titles referred to international conspiracy, commando operations and engineering of explosives.\nThe jihad movement also took root in Europe. In August 1994, three young French Muslims of North African descent, wearing hoods and brandishing machine pistols, opened fire on tourists in a hotel lobby in Marrakesh, Morocco, killing two Spaniards and wounding a third. The French police investigating the attack learned that it had been planned by two Moroccan veterans of the Afghan war, who had recruited commandos for the attack in Paris and Orleans and sent more than a dozen of them to Afghanistan for training.\nThe indoctrination of the young Muslims began with religion, according to French court papers and testimony. An Orleans mathematics professor and interpreter of the Koran, Mohamed Zinedine, gathered around him a group of men from the slums of Orleans who wanted to learn how to pray. Later, French court papers say, he instructed them in the concept of waging jihad against corrupt governments, saying it was a higher stage of Islamic observance.\nOne young Moroccan testified that Mr. Zinedine -- who is now a fugitive -- showed him a videotape of Muslim victims of ''torture in Bosnia, of babies with their throats cut, of pregnant women disemboweled, and fingernails torn off.'' The young man added, ''He told me there was a way of helping them and that I must help them.'' Prayers for people like the Muslims in Bosnia, he quoted Mr. Zinedine as saying, were not enough. He must become an ''armed humanitarian.''\nEuropean investigators tracing the Afghan network in France, Belgium and Germany found records of phone calls between local extremists and the Office of Services in Pakistan. In March 1995, Belgian investigators came across another clue: A CD-ROM in the car of another Algerian, who had been trained in Afghanistan in 1992 and was part of the G.I.A. cell in Brussels. The CD was initially ignored, Belgian officials say.\nMonths later, the Belgians began translating its contents and discovered several different versions of a manual for terrorism that had begun circulating among Islamic militants in the early 1990's. The voluminous manual covered diverse subjects, from ''psychological war in Islam'' to ''the organizational structure of Israeli intelligence'' to ''recruiting according to the American method.''\nThe manual also offered detailed recipes for making bombs, including instructions on when to shake the chemicals and how to use a wristwatch as a detonator. In addition there were instructions on how to kill with toxins, gases and drugs. The preface included a dedication to the new hero of the holy war: Osama bin Laden. Versions of the manual circulated widely and were seized by the police all over Europe.\nReuel Gerecht, a former C.I.A. official, said he was told that the agency did not obtain its own copy of the manual before the end of 1999. ''The truth is,'' he said, ''they missed for years the largest terrorist guide ever written.'' The omission, he asserted, reflects the agency's reluctance to scrutinize the fallout from its support of the anti-Soviet jihad.\nA C.I.A. official said that the agency had had ''access to versions'' of the manual since the late 1980's. ''It's not the Holy Grail that Gerecht reports it to be,'' he said, adding that the terrorist-related parts were fairly recent additions.\nBy the mid-1990's, American officials had begun to focus on Mr. bin Laden and his entourage in Sudan. They saw him as the embodiment of a dangerous new development: a stateless sponsor of terrorism who was using his personal fortune -- which one Middle Eastern official estimated at $270 million -- to bankroll extremist causes.\nAmerican officials pressed Sudan to eject Mr. bin Laden, and in 1996 they succeeded, forcing him into exile. It was a diplomatic triumph, but one that many American officials would come to rue. Mr. bin Laden made his way back to Afghanistan, where a new group of young Islamic militants, the Taliban, was taking control.\nAmerican and Middle Eastern officials said some of the cash that the Taliban used to buy off local warlords came from Mr. bin Laden. Soon the new, hard-line rulers of Afghanistan allowed him to use their country to pursue his goal of creating ''one jihad camp for the world,'' as Mr. Anas put it.\nThe Edict\nA Sacred Muslim Duty To Kill All Foes\nTwo years after he arrived in Afghanistan, in February 1998, Mr. bin Laden publicly announced his intentions. At a camp in Khost, in eastern Afghanistan, he and several other leaders of militant groups declared that they had founded the International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, an umbrella entity that included Al Qaeda and groups from Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh, among others.\nThe front issued the following fatwa: ''To kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military, is an individual duty of every Muslim who is able, in any country where this is possible.''\nOn Aug. 7, 1998, eight years to the day after the first American troops set foot in Saudi Arabia, Mr. bin Laden delivered on the threat, American prosecutors say. Bombs exploded hours apart at the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\nThe plot, as described by federal prosecutors, was truly international. Prosecutors assert that the attacks were carried out by Muslims from Tanzania, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, most of whom were trained in Afghanistan. The Kenyan plotters, they say, spoke directly with Mr. bin Laden by satellite telephone as they developed their plans.\nThe attacks were costly for Al Qaeda. Less than two weeks after the embassy bombings, the United States conducted air strikes against Mr. bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan. Over the next two years, police and intelligence agencies around the world, many prodded by the United States, arrested more than 100 militants in some 20 countries.\nAlmost every month, authorities detain or question people with ties to Al Qaeda. Late last year, in what American officials described as one of the more alarming cases, the Kuwaiti police arrested a local man, an Afghan veteran, who said he was associated with Mr. bin Laden's group and planning to bomb American and Kuwaiti targets. American officials say he ultimately led the police to a weapons cache of almost 300 pounds of explosives and more than 1,400 detonators.\nAnd in addition to the two-day closure of the American Embassy in Rome, officials say, recent warnings of a possible Al Qaeda attack prompted the United States to divert an entire carrier battle group scheduled to dock in Naples.\nAmerican officials acknowledge that Al Qaeda and Mr. bin Laden have proven resourceful, resilient adversaries. Much of his personal wealth has now been spent, or is in bank accounts that are now frozen. But officials say he is raising money through a network of charities and businesses. His group reconstitutes its networks in many countries as quickly as they are disrupted.\nAnd failure can breed success. In late 1999, American officials say, a group of Yemenis botched an attempt to blow up an American ship, The Sullivans, as it passed through Yemen. Their boat, loaded with explosives, sank a few feet off shore.\nThis year, American officials say, a Saudi operative of Mr. bin Laden's who helped organize that attack worked with some of the same people on the bombing of the Cole in Yemen.\nInternal crackdowns on Muslim militants, like the Algerian government's largely successful attempts to stamp out the G.I.A. in the mid- 1990's, have in several instances fueled the international jihad.\nAmerican officials said the most radical Algerians were now collaborating with Mr. bin Laden. In 1999, Algerians were for the first time implicated in plots against the United States, when Ahmed Ressam was arrested crossing the border from Canada with a carload of explosives. Mr. Ressam goes on trial later this year in Los Angeles.\nAmerican and Middle Eastern officials say Al Qaeda has now expanded its jihad to include Israel, which until recently had regarded Mr. bin Laden as an American problem. The officials say Al Qaeda has financed and trained an anti-Israel group, Asbat al Ansar, that operates from a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon.\nLast June, Israel charged in a sealed indictment that a Hamas member who was plotting to attack targets within Israel, including settlers and the army, had been trained in one of Mr. bin Laden's Afghan camps. ''Al Qaeda wants in on the action -- the new intifada against Israel,'' said one American official.\nOlivier Roy, a French scholar who follows Islamic activities, says Al Qaeda's biggest asset is the thousands of jihadists around the world who no longer see their struggle in strictly local or even national terms, which makes them impervious to normal political or military pressure.\nMr. bin Laden's actions, he said, are ''not the continuation of politics by other means.''\n''Osama bin Laden doesn't want to negotiate.''\nHoly Warriors\nTODAY -- The making of an Islamic terror network.\nMONDAY -- A look inside a plot that could have crippled Jordan's capital.\nTUESDAY -- What motivates the jihad's young recruits."}, {"text": "Culinary Diversity\n2001-02-11T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nRe ''British City Defines Diversity and Tolerance'' (front page, Feb. 8):\nThe Asians who settled in Leicester over the last 30 years were themselves multicultural, coming from widely dispersed places including Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.\nFor many of us, their greatest gift is their amazing variety of food, now served in more than 100 ''Indian'' restaurants in Leicester, making it the curry capital of Europe.

Every time I am in New York I am amazed at how such a crazy place functions and how sublimely tolerant, yes, tolerant, New Yorkers are of each other. The richness of cultural activity and art and energy... there is no place like New York. The loss and anger I feel is the same as if I lived there. The sheer number of deaths involved in all of these incidents in the U.S. affects me deeply. I mourn the loss of life and the damage done to survivors, those who have lost loved ones and people, like me, who have not felt that loss directly but cannot separate ourselves from this devastation. \n T. Diamant \n Lethbridge, Alberta \n I live in a rural, farming community in Manitoba, Canada. I also work at the school. Staff and students, along with everyone you talked to in the community, are in shock as to what happened. Even this morning,, just for a second, you thought it was a bad dream until you turned on the TV and saw the coverage. We all wish we could do more to help - at the present time, we are donating blood. Please be assured that our thoughts and prayers are with you. \n C. Moffatt \n Carroll, MB, Canada \n I'm from Argentina, and I want to say that we are all deeply shocked by this tragedy. We know the rage and desperation you are feeling now, because we have also been victims of fundamentalist terrorism some years ago. Our jewish community, which is one of the largest in the world, has been hit twice with many mortal victims. \n However, americans must meditate about their own government's actions and its international policies. In the Gulf War, thousands of innocents were killed merciless but nobody cried this time. Saddam still keeps his job though... Osama ben Laden has been trained by the CIA as well as Saddam Hussein, the Taleban and the Mujaedins. Lets face it. Americans shouldn't support the \"big stick\" policies anymore. Many nations in the world (like the palestinians) are being treated as crap, so is no wonder that their reaction is not civilized as we, the westerners would expect. \n All the countries must fight against all forms of terrorism, but americans should also recognize that they are reaping what they sowed. America is the strongest militar and economic superpower in the world. It would be good if it was also the most moral and just one. God bless you, \n Luis M.

My heart goes out, not only to the victims and family, but to the entire nation. Whoever was the offender of these hanest crimes , should know, the Christen Bible quotes,\"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,\" ; I have pity for this coward, for his judgment day is drawing near. in this time of ciaos and pain, America, know our first goal is to find and save our lost friends and family, our second goal will be that decided on the American people, but most of all, the voice of president George Bush. America, please give blood in this desperate time, I have been frantic to fulfill this but, unsuccessful, considering my age.

Violence only leads to more violence; we should not be part of cycle of continuous bloodshed. \n Remember that our Arab-American brothers are not to blame for this, and we should not take out our frustrations on them.

I have attached a scanned copy of his journal. \n When I heard (the) badest thing in New York City I felt bad and very sorry. I felt very mad at the bad people. I really want to go to see how are the buildings. When I came home, I checked the news badly. The airplane was really flamed and when the fire was gone, New York looks like broken earth. \n And when the second building collapse it looks like a really big volcano! Thats why I feel sorry for the people in New York city. And I really really hope that the bad people learn their lesson never ever do bad things. And I really hope my brothers, cousins, sisters and best friends were not in that plane. And bad people don't do bad things ever ever again. \n Ryan Carolino (9 years old) \n Toronto, Ontario \n I am an ex-New Yorker living in Chicago and I must say that you are the BEST. I am so proud of the way New Yorkers rallied to help strangers and certainly the fire and ems departments. Many more would have died if not for them. Thank you New York - I am proud to have been a part of you. \n Ann Schaible \n Chicago, Illinois \n I can\"t believe in that... What kind of men do it? I think they don't believe in GOD... Why do they kill the people of New York, my dear New York, that I know only about magazine and televion? And the airplane pleople? What they do to the \"bad guys\"? Nothing at the moment, can explain what happened, and like Jonh Lennon: \"ALL WE ARE SAYING, JUST GIVE PEACE A CHANCE...\" I'm praying for GOD, blessed the people who had die, and your parents... I'm with you, I'm so sad. Brazil, a lot of love. \n Carla Henriques \n Brazil \n I brought my 17-year-old son from Michigan to New York City over Labor Day weekend to attend the U.S. Open. We had a wonderful visit, and it's just incredible to think that the beautiful skyline we enjoyed just over a week ago has been forever changed. \n Like most Americans, I feel emotions ranging from rage to deep, deep sadness for the people of New York. \n Please know that people all over the world are praying for those who survived this terrible tragedy. You are not alone in your grief; you are not alone in striving to help; you are not alone in your desire for justice. \n Richard Merchant \n Pittsburgh, PA \n As a resident of Toronto Canada, I weep along with you at the devastation and loss of life resulting from the terrorist attack on New York and Washington. As a husband and father, I can only imagine the heartbreak suffered by so many of your citizens at the sites of these terrible attacks. May God hold you all close at this time of grief. At the same time I marvel at the stories of heroism emerging from the rubble. I am especially struck by the passengers who, knowing they were probably about to die, decided to neutralize the hijackers, thereby saving perhaps countless other lives. Such is the definition of heroism. My prayer for you all, on behalf of the wider world community, is that you take this opportunity to forego the instinctual thirst for violent, military revenge. Think of the Lockerbie bombers, who were tracked down over several years, and now stand trial for their cowardly actions. Please, take this opportunity to rise above the thirst for violence. Yes, do everything in your power to track down those responsible for these atrocious crimes. And bring them to justice in the World Court. In such a manner will you take a monumental step for civilization, and honour your brothers and sisters who died so tragically at the hands of those assassins whose actions you do not want to emulate. My heart goes out to you all. May you find some peace and comfort in these very troubling times. \n Richard Hood \n Toronto, Canada \n I watched in disbelief the scenes of terror and unexpected violence that enveloped the United States last Tuesday. Before the horror of terrorism and the loss of innocent lives, I can only stop to think about what might have gone awry in human history. Our attempts to describe what has happened and how one should react are fraught with metaphors and euphemism. Fanaticism, vengeance, indignation, freedom, horror are words that cannot and will not explain away what has caused human beings to hate each other with so much intensity. As a Brazilian citizen I want to express my deep sympathy for the losses of so many lives in the United States. Even as I pray that we, members of the world community, may learn to work for a world where the madness of war will not pitch nation against nation, people against people, Christians against Muslims. In the aftermath of this terrible episode of the world history, I pray that the powerful will not be moved by bitter feelings of revenge. Instead, let's us, who so proudly call ourselves 'civilized,' pause for a moment to find ways to work together for a world where justice and peace will be achieved, where nation shall not take up sword against nation, where none will be afraid. Perhaps then, the world that now is good for some of us, will be better for all humanity. My prayers will be with all those who suffer, grieve and mourn in the United States. \n P. Gustavo Franc\u0327a. \n Brazil \n I am a native Texan, born and raised here, but I got my \"start\" in the Big Apple. That is where my parents worked, met and fell in love in 1953. As I watched in numb horror as you were attacked twice, I was so proud and moved to tears to see how all of you immediately responded. Your police and firefighters are Supermen, and your \"regular Joe\" hardhat- construction workers showed the toughness that makes New Yorkers so proud to be from New York. \n If any city in our country is TOUGH enough to take a major hit and keep on standing, your city is it. I cannot imagine another city in this great country that has the reputation for resiliency as you do. You are making us all proud. \n You are in our prayers, and deep in the heart of all Texans. \n Kathryn E. Kroll \n Fort Worth, Texas \n I am a 26 year old African American Youth Counselor in Indiana. For the first time in my life I felt like I belonged, and was a part of this country. It was a sad day that something so tragic as death made me feel like I was really an American. But instead of taking these feelings and turning them into something negative I will grow from this. Now that I do feel like an American, regardless of the circumstances, it is time that Americans of all racial and ethnic backgrounds unite and support our Presidents and Governments actions. This is not the time for \"Americans\" to begin to point the finger at the government but to a take united front to reclaim our freedom as a nation. It is not a great feeling to have your freedom threatened, now America as a whole can share this pain. I am confident that the Government will make every effort possible to assure these attackers that we are a powerful and civilized nation. \n My final thought to anyone who reads this email. The attackers on Tuesday did not see any particular political party, state, or color of skin. They targeted us as Americans. Furthermore, this should be a wake up call for all Americans that we must begin to unite from within in order to defend this country and our true freedom from outside. Hopefully, for all the small minded and color conscience people this should be your first wake up call to becoming color blind. \n LeKeesha R. Crowder \n Hammond, Indiana \n I am a Muslim living in New Jersey. I am shocked and appalled at this atrocity. This was an act of criminals and savages who have used religion as a justification for their crimes. As an educated and thinking person I have only hatred for these people who have killed innocent civillians, women and children in the name of their so called \"holy war\". I was born a Muslim, in a Muslim country (not an Arab country, but in Bangladesh) and carry a Muslim name given to me by my Muslim parents. However I believe all religions preach the same fundamental values which we need to understand to ensure a peacefull society and lifestyle. I am a human first and then a Muslim following the religion passed on to me by birth, but knowing the tenets of my religion does not preach hatred and war but kindness and enlightenment for mankind. These people were bigots and savages, who distort the religion and its message, and their are similar people in every religion. These people would have been savages whatever religion they followed. \n It is unthinkably sad for all of us that they would take their bigotry to this length and against this country. I think the US is one of the greatest nations today and not only the land of oppurtunity but the only land today where truly every race, religion and people get an equal oppurtunity to build their dreams. As immigrants my family and I praise America and Americans all the time as being perhaps the greatest nation on earth today becuase of its free thinking and oppurtunities for everyone. There is no other nation today where people can come from any back ground, race or color and be treated the same and succeed only on the basis of their merits. I know this first hand, having lived in 3 countries and having traveled to many more. \n I join the American people today in their anger and demand for justice against these Criminals. No punishment is enough for them. I am almost ashamed of my back ground but I know that it is not my fault and I cannot be blamed for it. The American people have shown immense control and understanding towards Muslims (much more again then would have been shown under the same circumstances in any other country or people) but unfortunately there has been a rising feeling of hatred and a show of this has been coming out against anybody of Eastern or Islamic decent. Although understandable, I would like to stress that these acts would symbolize the same bigotry and intolerance that caused all these actions in the first place. There is no forgiveness for what these people have done but know that there are innocent people who are humans first and then Muslims or Arabs etc. Almost all of us are here to make a better life for us and our children and to achieve the American dream and resent as much as anybody else that these people might jeapordize this dream. Every second I hope that this is just a nightmare and I will wake up and find that all this never happend. \n Wasiim Rahman \n NJ, USA \n How do you write an e-mail to an entire city? During the earliest days of World War II the Japanese leadership warily reckoned it may have awakened a sleeping giant. I don't credit that level of intelligence or perceptivity to these animalistic terrorists, but if they thought real hard they might realize they've not only picked on the wrong country, they've picked on the wrong city! New York City, not the buildings within, is our greatest icon--and the people of the city make it so. It's more than idle rhetoric or patriotic bravado...I know you all will show the world the very best America has to offer. We only wish we could help in some tangible way. You are in our prayers...may God bless you in this time. \n Greg \n Los Angeles, CA \n I, like so many others, live far from New York City, and don't know any of the victims of such a tragic, devastating action by men who were such cowards. I have been jobless for several months, and during my time at home, I watch a lot of TV. One thing you start to realize is how much of the entertainment we watch, the people, the places of our entertainment comes from the great city of New York. It is the heart and soul of these great United States. The New York City sky line is part of many back drops you see on news channels and talk shows. These cowards definitely hit us were it hurts. They may have knocked buildings down, but they have not knocked the great people of New York City down, nor the people of this great country! The help and support and determination of those rescue workers in NYC goes beyond words. They are heroes. All the volunteers hanging out, hoping that someone will call their name to give a hand are heroes. Those who feel impotent that bring a tray of cookies for the workers and volunteers are heroes. My heart goes out to everyone who is left standing to pick up the pieces, and to all of those who have lost a loved one. It is a terror beyond words that has brought me to tears many times over the last few days. We are with you in spirit, and we have great faith that the great peoples of New York City will brush off the dust of the World Trade Center, put the pieces back together and defy those who are too cowardly to claim responsibility for their actions. NEW YORK CITY and the Americans will prevail! \n C.G.Ladd \n Hillsdale, Michigan \n Hi, I am a member of russian community in Los Angeles, and on behalf of our community I am very sorry for everybody whos family was involved in this tragedy. We are the nation of many different faces, however this tragedy is a tragedy for all of us, despite all our differences. And at this time everybody who lives in this land is with you guys, citisens of NY. You are not alone and our hurts are with you. Also I have a quation to our government. Why don't they aknowledge the fact that they were not ready and promise us that they will be. I am not talking about federal government but also state and local. After the tragedy has happend, we didn't see any coordinations between any branches of government, it was a problem for Ms Mayor and everybody else was in shock. Government should never be in shock, they should be in charge. Why didn't we see national guard surrounding the building after and hour? Why didn\"t state government knew that plane over NY state was taken over? Why so many fierfighters had to die because someone was in panic and didn't share information? Why Ms. President didn't come to NY, We ARE TALKING ABOUT THOUSENDS of people dead. People of NY and government of NY needed support, and they didn\"t get. Yeah I understand a risk of security, need for president to be secure, but what about falkse to pay taxes. It wasn't atomic bomb and some one at least vice president should have been there. And waht we people of the United States should do. We should make sure government takes charge, and does everything possible for such tragedy to never happen again. And I am very happy that we showing to the world that we are strong. In that cituation it is essencial so the one who is responsible for such antihumanitarian crime will know that we are ready. Again I would like to say to NY and its falks, we are with you guys, hold on. \n Alex \n Los Angeles, CA "}]
