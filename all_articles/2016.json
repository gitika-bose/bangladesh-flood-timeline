[{"text": "Torrential Rains Strand Wayward Indian Elephant in Bangladesh\n2016-08-12T19:01:45.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Plenty of back-and-forth intermingling happens along the 2,500-mile zigzag border shared by India and Bangladesh. But the Bangladeshis are having trouble returning a four-and-a-half-ton Indian visitor to its home.\nA wayward wild elephant from northeast India was washed hundreds of miles down the Brahmaputra River into Bangladesh during torrential flooding earlier this summer, and is now marooned there, despite efforts by the Bangladeshis to repatriate it.\n\u201cFor the last 45 days, we are dealing with this elephant,\u201d Ashit Ranjan Paul, Bangladesh\u2019s conservator of forests and wildlife, said after a three-member team of Indian experts visited the animal, untamed but weak and dehydrated, in a swampy area of the northern Jamalpur district where it has been confined.\nThe experts left without any good ideas for how to quickly reunite the elephant with its herd in India.\nThe elephant\u2019s odyssey began in June, when it was caught in the raging Brahmaputra River and Indian villagers pelted it with stones when it tried to come ashore. The elephant retreated to the river and was carried far downstream, eventually crossing the frontier into the wetlands of Bangladesh.\nAs the elephant plodded through the marshes, so many Bangladeshis trailed in boats that police officers were deployed to keep them away, according to the Press Trust of India, a news agency.\nBangladeshi forest rangers subdued the elephant with a tranquilizer dart on Thursday. It collapsed into the water and had to be hauled onto dry land. Photographs from the scene show the elephant lying in a muddy flat, bound with ropes and chains.\nThe wildlife authorities have since given the elephant vitamins, bananas, banana stems, sugar cane and bamboo leaves, said Tapan Kumar Dey, chief executive of Bangladesh\u2019s Nature Conservation Society, who is helping the government deal with the situation.\n\u201cThe elephant is quite O.K. and enjoying the food now,\u201d Mr. Dey said. \u201cManaging the crowd is a bigger problem for us.\u201d\nMany news accounts have described the elephant as female, but Mr. Dey said it was male. He also said its caretakers had nicknamed the elephant Bangabahadur, after a brave Bengal hero.\nLoading the elephant onto a truck for a return trip to India is considered a formidable undertaking, Mr. Dey said, because the area where the elephant is confined is more than two miles from the nearest road.\nHe said foresters may try to get the elephant to walk to an area closer to the road by luring it with domesticated elephants."}, {"text": "After Slaughter, Bangladesh Reels at Revelations About Attackers\n2016-07-04T00:37:37.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladesh\u2019s capital city reeled in shock on Sunday as clues began to flood social media about the privileged backgrounds of the half-dozen attackers believed to have butchered 20 patrons of a restaurant during a bloody siege here late last week.\nThe six attackers were killed when the army stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery to end an 11-hour siege early Saturday.\nThe police declined to name the young men because nobody had shown up as of Sunday night to identify their bodies, but friends and relatives recognized photographs that were posted on a messaging app by the Islamic State, along with praise for the violence.\nThe men, all in their late teens or early 20s, were products of Bangladesh\u2019s elite, several having attended one of the country\u2019s top English-medium private schools as well as universities both in the country and abroad.\nAmong them was the son of a former city leader in the prime minister\u2019s own Awami League, the governing party.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re absolutely riveted by,\u201d said Kazi Anis Ahmed, a writer and publisher of the daily newspaper The Dhaka Tribune. \u201cThat these kids from very affluent families with no material want can still be turned to this kind of ideology, motivated not just to the point of killing but also want to be killed.\u201d\nThat children of the country\u2019s upper classes appear to have joined militant Islamists in an act of such brutality highlighted the radicalization among the largely moderate Muslim population here, a process that has accelerated in recent years.\nMore than 1,200 people outside of Iraq and Syria have been killed in attacks inspired or coordinated by the Islamic State.\nThe attackers intended to kill foreigners, whom they shot and then hacked with sharp weapons, blaming them for hampering the progress of Islam, one of the hostages later said.\nFor more than three years now, Islamist militants have murdered atheist bloggers, members of religious minorities and others. The Islamic State and a regional branch of Al Qaeda have claimed responsibility for the killings, although the Bangladeshi government continues to insist that local groups were responsible.\nThe involvement of the Islamic State appeared increasingly more likely during the latest attack, with the organization not only claiming responsibility but later posting the photographs of the men believed to have carried it out.\nSome of the rescued hostages remained in police custody on Sunday evening, including a Bangladeshi couple and their two school-aged children who witnessed the massacre, their relatives said.\nThe country was in the midst of a two-day mourning period declared by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, but in the homes of the young men who had been identified as the attackers on social media, families struggled with grief, shame and disbelief.\nOn Sunday, the police telephoned Meer Hayet Kabir, an executive with a foreign company in Dhaka, asking him to go to the military hospital morgue to identify a body that was possibly that of his 18-year-old son, Meer Saameh Mubasher.\nHe said he just could not bear to make the trip.\n\u201cHow will we arrange a funeral for him in these circumstances?\u201d he asked in an interview in his family\u2019s apartment in a wealthy neighborhood close to the diplomatic district. \u201cWho will come?\u201d\n\u201cI will have to apologize to the whole world on behalf of my son,\u201d he said.\nMr. Kabir had already been in close touch with the police since Mr. Mubasher disappeared on Feb 29.\ntranscript\nNA\nThe young man was a student at Scholastica School, one of the top private schools in Dhaka. He left home for a tutorial class, which he did not attend, and never returned.\nMr. Kabir said he had made the rounds of police and security officials in the capital since then, seeking help. He gave them a picture of his son, describing him as quiet and pious, someone who prayed five times a day and frequented the local mosque.\nMr. Kabir\u2019s close relatives believe Mr. Mubasher was radicalized either by people he met at a mosque or in school. \u201cI believe some Islamist group recruited my boy\u201d and brainwashed him, Mr. Kabir said.\nAt least two other young men who appear in the photographs posted by the Islamic State had also attended the Scholastica School, a senior government official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the investigation.\nThat official said that several of the men pictured had studied in Malaysia, at least one at Monash University, and that at least one other had studied at North South University, a private college in Dhaka where several others convicted in the hacking death of a blogger in 2013 were students.\nThe families of other attackers had also reported them missing, the official said.\nAmong them was a son of a former city Awami League official who disappeared at the end of December, said Biplob Kumar Das, deputy commissioner at the Dhaka Metropolitan Police.\nMr. Das said police officers searching for the young man, who was in his early 20s, had linked him with militant groups but had not been able to apprehend him. He confirmed that one of the photographs posted by the Islamic State resembled him.\nMr. Kabir said the family was unaware that Meer Saameh Mubasher was being radicalized, except, in retrospect, for one clue. The young man had liked to play the guitar, his father said, but about three months before his disappearance, he stopped.\nWhen Mr. Kabir asked why, his son replied, \u201cMusic is not good,\u201d reflecting an Islamist belief that music and dancing are bad influences.\nUntil now, he had hoped that Mr. Mubasher would reappear one day soon, like some others who disappear into Islamic groups for a time and then come back.\n\u201cHow can I believe my kin who has humanitarian qualities can be part of these brutal killings?\u201d he asked.\nGowher Rizvi, an adviser on foreign affairs to Ms. Hasina, said the police continued to believe that local groups were behind the militant attacks, and initial indications are that the restaurant siege was also orchestrated by homegrown militants.\nYet Mr. Rizvi said Bangladesh was also willing to consider whether international groups might be involved, although investigators had not seen evidence of external coordination in the Friday attack or the others of the past three years.\nMr. Kabir was steeling himself to make the dreaded trip to the morgue on Monday morning to confirm whether his son was among the dead attackers.\nHe had been staring at the pictures of the five young men in red-and-white-checked kaffiyehs, trying to convince himself that Mr. Mubasher was not among them.\nWhile he recognized the chubby cheeks, wide nose and big smile in the picture, Mr. Kabir said, there was also something unfamiliar about it.\n\u201cI can tell you my boy was really a good humanitarian soul,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch a soul cannot do something cruel like this.\u201d"}, {"text": "Stranded Indian Elephant Dies of Heart Attack, Ending a Wretched Journey\n2016-08-16T11:54:07.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 A wild Indian elephant that attracted worldwide attention after being swept hundreds of miles down a flood-swollen river into Bangladesh died on Tuesday of a heart attack, Bangladeshi officials said.\nThe animal\u2019s death was brought on by \u201ca long period of stress, heat and humidity,\u201d said Mustafizur Rahman, a veterinary surgeon who supervised the treatment of the elephant last week in northern Bangladesh.\nThe death brought an end to a sad journey.\nCaught in the rising waters of the Brahmaputra River in late June, the elephant, a fully grown male, tried repeatedly to climb ashore in India, but villagers drove him back into the water, in some cases pelting him with stones, said K. K. Sarma, a government veterinary surgeon from India who visited the animal.\n\u201cIt tried to come up, but it was not allowed to,\u201d he said.\nOfficials said the animal had traveled 900 miles.\nScrambling to land in a swampy district of Bangladesh on June 28, the elephant trudged through the marshes in search of food, becoming dehydrated. News crews arrived, and so many curiosity-seekers trailed him through the swamps that the police were deployed to control them, the Press Trust of India reported.\nOn Thursday, the elephant was tranquilized repeatedly with a dart gun and collapsed, unconscious, into a swamp. Villagers helped haul him onto dry land, and he was bound with ropes and chains. Images from the scene showed the nine-foot, four-ton animal lying in a muddy field, surrounded by onlookers.\nAs the elephant weakened, the site took on the festive feeling of a village fair: Mothers held up their children for a better view and vendors sold snacks.\nThe animal eventually broke free of the ropes and chains, and he began wandering nearby villages before veterinarians decided to tranquilize him again, said Tapan Kumar Dey, chief executive of Bangladesh\u2019s Nature Conservation Society.\n\u201cIt was not our plan to dart him, but the situation bound us,\u201d he said, adding that he believed that the elephant had contracted pneumonia during the 45 days he spent wandering the swamp.\n\u201cThe crowd wanted to have a closer look at him all the time,\u201d Mr. Dey said. \u201cThat was also a problem.\u201d\nMr. Sarma, the veterinarian dispatched from India, said he believed the elephant died of heatstroke after two unusually hot and humid days in Bangladesh. He said there was no choice but to chain the animal, lest he destroy the homes or crops of local residents.\n\u201cWhat to do? There was no alternative,\u201d Mr. Sarma said. \u201cYou need to save people and property.\u201d\nThe animal\u2019s death was not for lack of attention: Bangladeshi newspapers named the animal \u201cBangabahadur,\u201d which can be loosely translated as \u201cHero of Bengal,\u201d and Indian news media had been pressing for the animal to be repatriated.\n\u201cOur media created a havoc for us,\u201d said Mr. Sarma, whose team was sent by the Indian government to advise Bangladesh on how best to handle the elephant. \u201cIn Bangladesh, the media was asking us, \u2018Under what international act have you come to take the elephant to India?\u2019\u201d\nHis delegation spent three days on site with the elephant before returning to India after Bangladeshi authorities warned that there were security threats in the area.\nAfter he was tranquilized, the elephant was given more than three gallons of saline water intravenously, but he crashed to the ground a second time on Monday, Dr. Rahman said. He added that the elephant had dangerously high blood pressure and an imbalance of sodium and potassium in his body.\nForestry officials had hoped to use domestic elephants to guide the elephant to the nearest road, at which point he could have been loaded onto a truck and returned to the hill country of Assam in eastern India.\nAfter the elephant\u2019s death, some of his internal organs were removed and sent to a government laboratory for analysis."}, {"text": "Mapping Three Decades of Global Water Change\n2016-12-09T10:09:36.000Z\n"}, {"text": "A Dutch Architect Offshores the Future of Housing\n2016-11-28T16:07:57.000Z\nRIJSWIJK, The Netherlands \u2014 Early next year when a converted cargo container on a floating foundation of plastic bottles opens on the flood-prone shores of Korail Bosti, Bangladesh\u2019s largest slum, few of its users are likely to celebrate the 320-square-foot space as a revolution. Yet, according to Koen Olthuis, the lead architect on the project, it is part of the greatest transformation in urbanism since Elisha Otis built the safety brake that gave rise to the modern elevator, skyscrapers and ultimately urban density.\n\u201cIt will change the DNA of cities,\u201d Mr. Olthuis said of the technology at the heart of his designs in an interview in his studio, a converted supermarket in this suburb of The Hague that also serves as his business headquarters.\nIn an era when the needs of growing urban centers are changing rapidly and rising sea levels threaten waterside construction, Mr. Olthuis has been busy working on a solution: the floating building.\nMr. Olthuis founded Waterstudio \u2014 which he describes as the first modern architecture firm to exclusively build floating houses \u2014 in 2003. More than a decade on, he and his team consider themselves pioneers in a growing movement. The firm has completed more than 200 floating homes and offices, many of them in the Netherlands, where several floating neighborhoods have sprung up in the last decade.\nThe team\u2019s designs have gone global, with showcases ranging from exclusive floating islands in Dubai and the Maldives for the superrich, to more modest designer homes in Europe and the United States, to projects like the floating container, called City App, that will serve as an education center in the poorest neighborhoods in Asia.\nMr. Olthuis was a candidate  for Time Magazine\u2019s list of the 100 most influential people in 2007, and he has been described as a visionary in the media. The BBC dubbed him the \u201cFloating Dutchman\u201d when featuring his plan to build a floating block in Naaldwijk, the Netherlands.\n\u201cHe was really one of the first architects who saw that building on water could develop a whole new design language,\u201d said Tracy Metz, an American journalist based in the Netherlands and a co-author of \u201cSweet & Salt: Water and the Dutch\u201d (2012).\nAlthough live-aboard boats and then houseboats have existed for centuries, the modern floating house is a relatively recent invention, with new materials and methods allowing for full-height construction without the loss of stability or the risk of intruding moisture.\nThe buildings are constructed on a floating foundation (sometimes stabilized by fixed stilts), which makes them flood-proof, affordable and independent of expensive real estate, although obtaining building permits can be tricky.\nPerhaps most important for the slums of Dhaka, the units \u2014 which can house amenities like internet terminals, toilets and showers, large-scale water filtration, medical clinics, community kitchens and workshops \u2014 can be moved easily to where they are needed most.\n\u201cIf I were to build only floating islands for the wealthy, I would only make 150 happy people in the next 20 years,\u201d said Mr. Olthuis, 45, who is the grandson of both an architect and a shipbuilder. \u201cIf we use this technology also to upgrade slums, we can change the lives of millions.\u201d\nAs for most of Waterstudio\u2019s other clients, the top draws are the crisp, elegant and open designs, the water views, and \u2014 for those with pockets deep enough \u2014 the optional private beaches.\nThe first units of his high-end Oceana project in Dubai are to be delivered next summer. For the project, Mr. Olthuis and Dutch Docklands, the development firm he co-owns, are designing and building 33 islands of 11,000 square feet that support custom-built villas of up to 5,500 square feet each, at an estimated total project cost of $170 million.\nThe villas themselves resemble smaller houses he has designed in the Netherlands. With open spaces and barely-there transitions between the indoors and the outdoors, his designs are airy, light and modern. The undersides of the islands are equipped with anchor points for marine life that resemble holds on artificial climbing walls, leading to a collaboration with Ocean Futures Society, established by Jean-Michel Cousteau, the son of the explorer Jacques Cousteau.\nChristie\u2019s real estate, which is acting as a broker for the units, notes that they can be transported around the globe. Depending on the level of customization and enhancements, the islands will sell for an estimated $5 million.\nFor those on a tighter budget, Mr. Olthuis is set to help reconvert on-the-water living spaces in Weehawken, N.J., just south of the Lincoln Tunnel, on the Hudson River. The first phase of the project focuses on \u201clivable yachts,\u201d which are scheduled to go on the market late next year for slightly less than nearby condos, according to Steve Israel, the developer.\nIn Bangladesh, the City App aims to bring services to the most affected areas of a large and flood-prone slum. It is the first time Mr. Olthuis has brought his ideas to bear in development work and is almost entirely funded by a foundation he set up that receives funding from Dutch partners.\nThe floating structure that will pioneer the program was built this year in a yard in Helmond in the south of the Netherlands, nearly 5,000 miles from Dhaka, and features two rows of computers and benches. Four other models are now being built to bring other urgently needed services to Dhaka, although none of the units will consist of actual dwellings.\nWhile he is mostly known in design circles for his open glass constructions, Mr. Olthuis sees a broader mission. He is also an academic member of the flood resilience group at Unesco-IHE in Delft, a water research institute.\nIn his version of the future, cities will make better use of their water surfaces. In some cases, they will have no choice. Mr. Olthuis envisions public buildings like schools, stadiums and even parks being moved to different waterside neighborhoods according to need.\n\u201cIn 20 years,\u201d he said, \u201ccities are going to be different than today.\u201d"}, {"text": "Buddhist Monk Is Slaughtered at Temple in Bangladesh\n2016-05-14T14:11:15.000Z\nCOX\u2019S BAZAR, Bangladesh \u2014 A Buddhist monk was found hacked to death in his temple on Saturday in a remote region of southeastern Bangladesh. The killing appeared to bear some similarities to recent attacks claimed by Islamist extremists, but the police said it was too soon to determine whether it was another such murder.\nThe monk, Mong Shwe U Chak, 75, was found dead on the floor of the temple at 7 a.m. by his daughter-in-law, said Mizanur Rahman, the police superintendent in the Bandarban district, where the temple is.\nThe monk\u2019s neck had apparently been slashed with a machete, given the depth of one of the cuts, Mr. Rahman said. Three sets of footprints suggested that there had been at least three attackers, he said.\nMr. Rahman said the police were investigating the possibility that Islamist militants had killed the monk. Over the past two years, similar killings have taken place, targeting intellectuals, activists, secularist bloggers and members of religious minorities in Bangladesh. Many of the attacks were carried out by groups of men using machetes.\nSome of the killings have been claimed by the Islamic State or a branch of Al Qaeda, though the government has denied that foreign militants have a presence in the country.\nNo group was known to have claimed responsibility for the monk\u2019s killing on Saturday.\nMr. Rahman said the police were also investigating whether Mr. Mong Shwe U Chak had any personal rivalries with anyone in the community or within his family."}, {"text": "To U.S. in \u201970s, a Dissenting Diplomat. To Bangladesh, \u2018a True Friend.\u2019\n2016-06-27T13:34:29.000Z\nOn a recent visit to Bangladesh, around the anniversary of its hard-fought war of independence from Pakistan, I conducted an experiment.\nStopping a group of teenage boys at a museum devoted to the 1971 war, I asked them which American leaders had played an important role in that conflict. Henry A. Kissinger? They looked at me with blank faces. Edward M. Kennedy? Nothing. Richard M. Nixon? Crickets.\nI was running out of names when I tried one more: That of a midlevel Foreign Service officer stationed in Dhaka, the capital, during that war. It was the name of a man who was recalled to Washington hastily and whose career would falter on his way to an ambassadorial post. What about Archer K. Blood, I asked? And one of the teenagers gave me a big, delighted smile of recognition.\n\u201cArcher Blood,\u201d he said, \u201cwas a true friend of Bangladesh.\u201d\nThis exchange came to mind when news broke this month that 51 American diplomats had signed an internal memo sharply critical of the Obama administration\u2019s policy in Syria, and had filed it through the State Department\u2019s designated \u201cdissent channel.\u201d\nTo many, the fact that the State Department has a dissent channel was news in itself. What sort of bureaucracy would devote an elaborate formal pathway to carry the message that the boss is wrong?\nThis mechanism, introduced in 1971, allows diplomats to directly protest American policy to the secretary of state. No other government bureaucracy has anything like it. It has been used to call for action to stop ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, to register opposition to the invasion of Iraq, and, now, to urge a tougher policy toward Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria.\nAnd it was a mechanism that signally changed the life of Mr. Blood, whose dissent cable, the first ever sent, called on Washington to condemn its ally Pakistan\u2019s bloody assault on Dhaka.\nOn the spring day when I visited Bangladesh\u2019s Liberation War Museum, Mr. Blood was enjoying a sort of vogue. In 2013, newly declassified documents had become the basis for Gary J. Bass\u2019s prizewinning history, \u201cThe Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger and a Forgotten Genocide,\u201d which cast his dissent in heroic terms.\nThe United States government, in recent years, has been eager to embrace Mr. Blood. The story of his cable is part of the curriculum for incoming foreign service officers. Among the first acts of the current ambassador to Dhaka, Marcia S. Bernicat, was to present Bangladesh\u2019s government with an official copy of the so-called Blood telegram, calling it a \u201creminder of the value in voicing dissenting views against existing power and authority structures.\u201d\nIf Mr. Blood, who died in 2004, became a sort of poster child for dissent, it is partly because he proved to be correct, on both practical and moral grounds. In 1970, he had been appointed United States consul to what was then East Pakistan. But Pakistan\u2019s control was slipping: Bengali nationalism was surging through Dhaka. Pakistan was flying in more and more troops. Its officers were on edge.\nWhen Pakistan\u2019s military began its assault on March 25, 1971, Mr. Blood\u2019s staff was virtually paralyzed, but two officers managed to reach a wireless transmitter to report the carnage to the State Department. The reports infuriated Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger, who were then seeking Pakistan\u2019s assistance in opening up communications with China.\nMr. Blood\u2019s cables became increasingly angry.\n\u201cFull horror of Pak military atrocities will come to light sooner or later,\u201d he wrote, in a cable that was headed, \u201cSelective Genocide.\u201d\nOn April 6, frustrated by the lack of response from Washington, a young political officer wrote up a formal dissent cable, using a brand-new format that had been devised in response to internal turmoil over the Vietnam War. It was the first ever submitted to an American secretary of state.\nBut no one knew whether Mr. Blood would endorse it; as the ranking official in the mission, he had the most to lose. Mr. Kissinger\u2019s fury did focus on the consul, Mr. Bass recounts. He was swiftly transferred to Washington, to a position in human resources.\nThe cable had no discernible effect on Washington\u2019s policy, but it irreparably damaged Mr. Blood\u2019s career. By the time he received another foreign posting, he had \u201clost career time\u201d and never became an ambassador, said Howard B. Schaffer, one of 29 diplomats who signed the dissent cable in 1971.\n\u201cI found it remarkable that in the years I worked with him he never expressed any bitterness about the treatment meted out to him,\u201d said Mr. Schaffer, who was later appointed United States ambassador in Dhaka. \u201cThe only time I was aware that he did so was at his retirement ceremony.\u201d\nI grew up around American diplomats. My father was one of a wave of young men who joined the Foreign Service in the 1960s, under the influence of John F. Kennedy, and he served until his retirement, more than 30 years. I knew they could be sent into exile for vocally challenging American policy \u2014 this, in retrospect, accounts for the formative years I spent in Bulgaria. I also knew they did it routinely.\nSo Mr. Blood\u2019s story held personal interest, in part because he chose the perilous course of challenging a policy from inside the system. Would his act of protest have been more effective if someone had leaked the cable to The New York Times? Would it have been better for him to resign in protest, to make a racket, rather than sit back and watch his bureaucratic punishment unfold?\nIn fact, during the 40-year history of the dissent channel, the cables have had little or no direct impact on policy, say researchers who have reviewed them. Hannah R. Gurman, who has written extensively on the subject, says the mechanism has succeeded mainly at \u201cquelling internal dissent in a way that the public could actually support.\u201d\nBut this deflating view will not get you very far in Dhaka. Mr. Blood\u2019s cable means something to the people of Bangladesh. They see it as confirmation that someone, in the heart of the system, was arguing their case. I don\u2019t know, but I imagine many Syrians feel the same way.\nNot long after the United States presented Bangladesh with a copy of Mr. Blood\u2019s cable, I sat down for an interview with Gowher Rizvi, a distinguished adviser to the country\u2019s prime minister. The governing party was in the late stages of sidelining its opposition, and my questions were mostly spiky and unwelcome, but when I brought up the famous 1971 dissent, Mr. Rizvi lighted up.\n\u201cThis is my personal feeling: The U.S. is, at the end of the day, an open society, so they respect these things,\u201d he said. \u201cI sometimes feel like criticizing them for many things. We criticize America, I suspect, because we hold America to America\u2019s own standards.\u201d"}, {"text": "Boiler Explosion at Bangladesh Factory Kills at Least 23\n2016-09-10T15:28:50.000Z\nTONGI, Bangladesh \u2014 A boiler explosion in a cigarette packaging factory outside Dhaka enveloped the five-story building in flames early Saturday, killing at least 23 people, fire officials said.\nThe blaze was the latest in a series of industrial disasters over the last several years in Bangladesh. At least 50 people were injured in Saturday\u2019s fire, said Mozammel Hoque, a deputy director of the fire service.\nThe cause of the explosion was unclear, he added.\nThe blast occurred at 6 a.m. at the Tampaco Foils factory in an industrial park in Tongi. The factory makes, among many other things, foil for cigarette packs for British American Tobacco and snack-food packaging for Nestl\u00e9.\nBy Saturday evening, firefighters had not yet completely extinguished the blaze. They tried to rescue anyone still trapped inside.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely still people inside,\u201d Mr. Hoque said around noon on Saturday. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve only been finding dead bodies, no one who was still alive.\u201d\nBangladesh experienced one of the worst industrial accidents in history when the eight-story Rana Plaza complex, which housed several garment factories, collapsed in 2013, killing more than 1,100. Five months earlier, a garment factory fire killed 112 workers.\nIn the aftermath of the Rana Plaza collapse, broad structural and fire safety reforms were put into effect, and global apparel companies agreed to help Bangladesh with fire safety and building improvements. But building safety in other industries has attracted less scrutiny.\n\u201cExperience shows us that, unless there is international public pressure, corporations operating in Bangladesh do not take action to protect worker safety,\u201d said Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium. \u201cOutside the garment sector, there has not been much pressure, largely because corporations in the U.S. and Europe have not been linked to mass-fatality disasters.\u201d\nOutside Tampaco Foils, onlookers gathered \u2014 many of them looking for missing relatives who worked at the factory.\n\u201cWe thought it was a plane crash,\u201d said Sojib Babu, who lives in the neighborhood and heard the explosion. He held a picture of his brother, who had arrived for his shift 15 minutes before the explosion, on the last day of work before Eid al-Adha holidays.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already gone to the hospitals and looked at the bodies that have been found so far \u2014 none of them match. Looking at how the fire is still going, it\u2019s hard to believe he might be alive,\u201d Mr. Babu said, choking up.\nAs rescue efforts continued and strong winds stoked the smoke and flames, Mr. Hoque said firefighters were trying to prevent any further explosions, adding that the building could collapse.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having to be very careful, because there are a lot of chemical drums inside,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could catch fire anytime.\u201d"}, {"text": "A Burst of Energy in Bangladesh\n2016-04-27T09:19:11.000Z\nIn Dhaka, we are used to the phenomenon called load-shedding.

There has been no load-shedding. The Eid meat is safe in the freezer. People watched the entire cricket World Cup without a hitch. So what has changed?\nPower, of course. This government has done a heroic job of increasing the power output to match demand in a country where industrial and household consumption is running at breakneck speed.\nBangladesh is producing 8,300 megawatts of power this year \u2014 that\u2019s an increase of 800 megawatts from last year, and a stunning 4,800 megawatts more than was produced in 2009, the year after the current government was voted in. Our homes, at least in the capital city, enjoy uninterrupted power.\nAnd the government\u2019s ambitions are sky-high. In 2012, according to World Bank figures, roughly 40 percent of the population was still without electricity. The Energy Ministry claims that, over the next decade, all those households will be connected to the national grid, and by 2022, a series of new power plants will have nearly tripled the country\u2019s capacity.\nHow will we find the resources for such aspirations?\nBangladesh depends on natural gas for much of its energy needs. But with domestic reserves being rapidly depleted, and energy demand rising, other solutions must be found.\nWhen this government came to power, it proposed building at least 24 new coal-fired power plants throughout the country with a combination of private and public initiatives. However, by the start of this year, few of these plants had made much progress. Of the planned sites, only a handful are operating as intended; in more than a dozen cases, construction has either been delayed or has failed to begin at all.\nPolitical opposition to the projects is also growing. Last month, the prospect of coal-fired plants in Rampal and Banshkhali, in southern Bangladesh, led to mass protests. On April 4, four people protesting the Banshkhali plant were killed in clashes with the police. The activists, mainly local salt harvesters and shrimp farmers, were demonstrating against the plant\u2019s threat to their livelihoods and the takeover of their land.\nThe Banshkhali plant, a joint venture between Bangladeshi and Chinese companies, has begun construction without securing site permits or carrying out an environmental impact assessment. Yet when faced with public agitation, the authorities have sided with the plant\u2019s owners, accusing protesters of being \u201cstrange\u201d and ignorant, and citing the government\u2019s commitment to supplying the power-hungry nation as paramount.\nIn the meantime, the Rampal plant, which is within 10 miles of the ecologically sensitive Sundarbans mangrove forest and will use its narrow waterways to import coal from neighboring India, has been on environmentalists\u2019 radar since it broke ground several years ago. The original joint venture with the Norwegian government fell through because of environmental concerns; the plant now under construction is being financed in part by a state-run power company from India.\nAlthough the government has repeatedly assured the public that new technology means the coal plants will not harm the environment, a coal-laden ship recently capsized in the Sundarbans, the third such incident in two years \u2014 leading campaigners to question the wisdom of building a coal-fired power plant so close to one of the country\u2019s most precious natural habitats.\nLast week, Bangladesh was among the 175 countries that signed the Paris climate agreement, and while it continues to have one of the lowest per capita rates of emissions, building coal-fired power plants will send the wrong message to the rest of the world. With India and China both under fire for their profligate use of coal, Bangladesh has an opportunity to act as one of the region\u2019s more forward-thinking nations on energy planning.\nNuclear power has been proposed as an alternative source for Bangladesh\u2019s energy needs, but the Ruppur power plant, a joint venture with Russia, has attracted criticism since the agreement was signed in December. Undertaken with only the most cursory public consultation, the project will be hugely costly to start with, and is very likely to run over budget. There are also serious concerns as to whether Bangladesh can meet the stringent safety requirements for a nuclear plant.\nIn the meantime, a small solar-powered revolution is happening quietly in the background. Last year, the government announced that it would become the world\u2019s \u201cfirst solar nation.\u201d In partnership with the World Bank, it has fitted 15 million households with solar power, and plans to set up six million more by 2017. The program is extremely popular: High demand has made it the fastest-growing domestic solar-power project anywhere, with 40,000 to 50,000 new installations every month.\nSolar still accounts for only a fraction (about 200 megawatts) of the total power supply. But the impact on rural households is profound, with ripple effects from education to agriculture and health care. Solar panels installed on houses mean not only a zero-emissions solution for rural electrification, but also homesteads no longer relying on the national grid for their domestic needs. A solar-powered home will never suffer from load-shedding.\nSolar power, in its current form, cannot be the universal answer to Bangladesh\u2019s growing energy needs, but the program is an example of a renewable, environmentally sensitive project that has clear popular consent. There\u2019s a lesson in that for the government: Instead of riding roughshod over its citizens, refusing consultation and shooting down protesters, the authorities have to include the public in their planning decisions for the country\u2019s future energy needs."}, {"text": "Bangladesh Siege Recalled in Militant\u2019s Words, and From Beyond the Grave\n2016-10-05T11:23:11.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 An Islamic State publication offered a detailed account of the bloody July 1 siege of a restaurant in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, including the use of religious tests to distinguish Muslims from non-Muslims, who would then be killed.\nThe article, which appeared this week and also threatened further attacks in the country, bears the byline of Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury, a militant who was killed with two associates in a police raid in late August. Mr. Chowdhury, a Canadian citizen, had been identified by some analysts as the coordinator of the Islamic State\u2019s activities in South Asia but had never been named by the group.\nIt is unusual for the Islamic State to publish the real names of its fighters, said Amarnath Amarasingam, a fellow at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism. Mr. Amarasingam said the Islamic State has been eager to \u201ctake ownership\u201d of the Dhaka attack, which came at a time of military setbacks in its core territory in the Middle East.\nSince Mr. Chowdhury\u2019s death, there has been a lull in the small-scale attacks on foreigners, secular Bangladeshis and members of religious minorities that had occurred at regular intervals in recent years.\nThe July attack, on the Holey Artisan Bakery, in which 22 people were killed, was the most complex and large-scale operation to date by Islamic militants in Bangladesh\u2019s recent history. Among the dead were numerous foreigners working in Bangladesh\u2019s garment sector or for aid organizations.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Bangladesh officials were under pressure to acknowledge that transnational terrorist organizations like the Islamic State were trying to build a presence in the country.\nThe authorities in Dhaka are still investigating the attack, and said on Wednesday that they were analyzing the account in Rumiya, the Islamic State\u2019s newest media product.\n\u201cIt is a long piece, with a lot of information to go through, so I cannot speak clearly now on things like authenticity,\u201d said Sanwar Hossain, additional deputy commissioner of the counterterrorism unit in the Dhaka Metropolitan police. He said that the police also knew Mr. Chowdhury by the kuniya, or nom de guerre, cited in the magazine.\n\u201cWe have known for a while that this is how Tamim Chowdhury was referred to,\u201d he said.\nOn Sunday, police granted bail and released Tahmid Hasib Khan, a Bangladeshi man.\nA second hostage, Hasnat Karim, remains in police custody, though some of the charges against him have been dismissed in court.\nSharmina Parveen Karim, Mr. Karim\u2019s wife, said she hoped her husband would be released soon. \u201cWe are just waiting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything but wait.\u201d\nThe article published in Rumiyah said the Holey Artisan Bakery had been selected as a target because it was \u201ca sinister place where the Crusaders would gather to drink alcohol and commit vices throughout the night, feeling secure from the wrath of Allah that was awaiting them.\u201d\nIt said the attackers set out to kill only non-Muslims in the restaurant and sorted their prisoners by religion, asking \u201cvery basic religious questions whose answers any Muslim youth or elderly would know.\u201d\n\u201cThose who proved their Islam were treated with respect and mercy,\u201d the account says, while those who did not \u201cwere treated with harshness and severity.\u201d\nThe account partially tallied with the testimonies of survivors. A Bangladeshi cook who survived said gunmen told him not to worry, because the attackers were killing only foreigners.\nMs. Karim, who was dining at the restaurant with her husband and two children, said the attackers had targeted Japanese and Italian customers who were obvious foreigners at first, and later began to ask those who remained whether they were Bangladeshi Muslims.\n\u201cThey entered and started shooting straight away,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were screaming, \u2018Help, help,\u2019 and fell to the floor once they were shot. Once they were certain that people were injured, they started to chop their throats, hands.\u201d\nMs. Karim added that as dawn approached, the attackers debated whether to kill the remaining hostages and decided against it.\nThe article gives detailed biographies of the five attackers, noting that at least two had unsuccessfully tried to join Islamic State forces in Libya, Syria and other battlegrounds outside Bangladesh. It goes on to threaten further attacks on foreigners in Bangladesh, singling out \u201cexpats, tourists, diplomats, garment buyers, missionaries, sports teams and anyone else from the Crusader citizens to be found in Bengal.\u201d\nMasudur Rahman, a police spokesman, said that the police in Bangladesh had killed at least a dozen known militants since the restaurant siege.\n\u201cThe way we see it, looking at the number of people we\u2019ve arrested, and then adding that up with the number of people who have been killed in our raids, of course the militants\u2019 operation is weaker,\u201d he said."}, {"text": "Bangladeshi Troops Move to End Hostage Standoff\n2016-07-01T17:28:18.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladeshi Army troops moved in on Saturday to end an 11-hour standoff at a restaurant in Dhaka, the capital, after gunmen stormed into the building, detonated explosives and took at least 20 people hostage on Friday night.\nGunfire and explosions could be heard as the soldiers, backed by armored vehicles, swept in to the restaurant in the city\u2019s diplomatic district at 7:40 a.m. on Saturday. At least a dozen people were rescued, including several foreigners, the police said.\nTwo police officers were killed in the initial standoff with the attackers, and 30 people were wounded, mostly from shrapnel, officials said. A police inspector said that at least five militants had been killed in the rescue operation.\nDetails about other fatalities or injuries from the attack or the rescue operation were not immediately available.\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on Friday.\n\u201cIslamic State commandos attack a restaurant frequented by foreigners in the city of Dhaka in Bangladesh,\u201d reported Amaq, an information outlet linked to the Islamic State.\nOutside the restaurant, more than 200 people waited all night beyond the police cordon in the diplomatic enclave, dozens of them relatives and friends of the hostages. Some of them communicated by text message and social media with the hostages inside.\nSeveral kitchen employees who had locked themselves in a bathroom inside the restaurant, the Holey Artisan Bakery, posted a picture of themselves on Facebook, bare chested against the stifling heat.\nSoumir Roy, 28, one of the employees, messaged his brother, saying, \u201cWe are here so if possible break the wall of the bathroom and rescue us.\u201d\nBut after the gunfire and blasts from the rescue operations ceased, the messages from Mr. Roy stopped, and his brother and sister sat on the roadside weeping as they awaited news of whether he had survived. Ambulances could be seen leaving the scene.\nEight to 10 armed men entered the restaurant, where about 20 foreigners were dining, around 8:45 p.m., according to Sumon Reza, a kitchen worker who escaped and spoke to reporters.

The Islamic State is known to have claimed responsibility for 18 other attacks in the last year, most perpetrated against religious minorities, including Hindus, Buddhists and Christians.\nThe increase in violence has raised fears that the once-moderate country is in the grip of a wave of fanaticism that the government refuses to acknowledge. Despite months of attacks and subsequent claims of responsibility by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, the government \u2014 which recently concluded a crackdown on extremists in which 10,000 people were arrested \u2014 maintains that neither terrorist group has a presence in the country.\n\u201cThe continuous denial of the presence of local militant group connections with international terror groups has not been helpful,\u201d said Ali Riaz, a professor of political science at Illinois State University and an expert on South Asian politics. \u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing can\u2019t be small groups coming together. It is clearly a very coordinated attack. If this doesn\u2019t convince them to come out of denial, then I don\u2019t know what will.\u201d\nAs gunfire and explosions rang out across the upscale Gulshan neighborhood on Friday, witnesses posted images on Twitter of paramilitary officers surrounding the Holey Artisan Bakery, which is popular with expatriates, diplomats and middle-class families.\nSeveral foreigners worked at the restaurant, including an Italian who escaped and an Argentine, whose whereabouts is unknown, the local news media reported.\nMr. Reza, the kitchen worker, said he and another employee were able to escape by jumping from the building\u2019s second floor.\n\u201cThey blasted several crude bombs, causing wide-scale panic among everyone,\u201d Mr. Reza told a Bangladeshi newspaper, The Daily Star. \u201cI managed to flee during this confusion.\u201d\nThe total number of hostages, including restaurant employees, was not known.

Fazley Rahim Khan, a businessman, waited on the edge of the police line, barely able to see the restaurant. He said he believed that his son Tahmid Hasib Khan, 22, was being held hostage.\nMr. Khan said his son, a student in Canada, had just returned home on Friday for Ramadan. The family celebrated the iftar, the evening meal breaking the Ramadan fast, and then the son headed to the restaurant.\n\u201cI\u2019m just praying to get back my son,\u201d he said.\nAt least two Sri Lankans were among the hostages, Hari Kesha Wijesekara, a former president of the Sri Lanka-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce, and his wife, Shyama, according to the group\u2019s current president, T.D. Packir.\nAn Indian doctor, Sat Prakash, 43, who worked at a nearby clinic had been held hostage but escaped minutes before the army stormed the restaurant, said his friend Jahirul Islam Milton.\nFour diplomatic cars were parked outside the area all night. Foreign diplomats waiting to hear word of people inside refused to speak to reporters.\nThe State Department advised Americans in the area to \u201cshelter in place and monitor news.\u201d\n\u201cThe situation\u2019s ongoing, obviously \u2014 too early for us to say who\u2019s involved, motivation, any of that stuff,\u201d said John Kirby, the State Department spokesman.\nMr. Kirby said all Americans working for the United States Mission in Dhaka were safe, but officials were still trying to locate Bangladeshi employees."}, {"text": "Bangladesh Attack Is New Evidence That ISIS Has Shifted Its Focus Beyond the Mideast\n2016-07-02T06:20:58.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 The cook was crouching in a washroom, taking refuge from the gunmen who had invaded the Holey Artisan Bakery, when he understood that there was a logic behind the killing: The people in the restaurant were being sorted.\n\u201cBengali people, come out,\u201d one gunman shouted. When the cook, Sumir Barai, and eight other men opened the bathroom door, trembling, they saw two young men, clean shaven and dressed in jeans and T-shirts.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so tense,\u201d one of the men told them. \u201cWe will not kill Bengalis.

All appeared to be foreigners.\nThe gunmen, he said, seemed eager to see their actions amplified on social media: After killing the patrons, they asked the staff to turn on the restaurant\u2019s wireless network. Then they used customers\u2019 telephones to post images of the bodies on the internet.\nFriday night\u2019s assault on the Holey Artisan Bakery in the diplomatic district of Dhaka, in which at least 20 hostages and two police officers were killed, marks a scaling up of ambition and capacity for Bangladesh\u2019s Islamist militancy, which has until now carried out pinpoint assassinations, mostly of critics of Islam and members of religious minorities.\nAmong the dead from Friday\u2019s attack, the police said, were nine Italians, seven Japanese, two Bangladeshis, one American and one Indian.\nThe attack also suggests that Bangladesh\u2019s militant networks are internationalizing, a key concern as the United States seeks to contain the growth of the Islamic State.\nBangladesh\u2019s 160 million people are almost all Sunni Muslims, including a demographic bulge under the age of 25. This makes it valuable as a recruiting ground for the Islamic State, now under pressure in its core territory of Iraq and Syria. Western intelligence officials have been watching the organization pivot to missions elsewhere in the world, launching attacks on far-flung civilian targets that are difficult to deter with traditional military campaigns.\n\u201cWe need to take serious stock of the overall threat,\u201d said Shafqat Munir, a research fellow at the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. \u201cThere were all sorts of warnings and signs and everything.

Someone had just ordered an Italian pasta dish, and Mr. Rossini made his way to the kitchen, preparing for a much larger crowd that was expected at 9:30 p.m.\nBut at 8:45, a half-dozen young men entered, carrying heavy bags of weaponry, including grenades and long rifles. Mr. Rossini, the chef, fled to the roof. He heard screams, and shouts of \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d as the gunmen sought out patrons who were hiding.\n\u201cThere were a lot of foreigners,\u201d he told Canal 5 Noticias, an Argentine cable news station. \u201cThat\u2019s who they were particularly looking for.\u201d\nEven as they killed the foreigners, the attackers were unfailingly polite and solicitous with the restaurant staff and other Bangladeshis, Mr. Barai said.\nThey took the staff into their confidence, complaining that foreigners, with their skimpy clothes and taste for alcohol, were impeding the spread of Islam. \u201cTheir lifestyle is encouraging local people to do the same thing,\u201d a militant said.\nThey asked the staff to make coffee and tea and serve it to the remaining hostages. At 3:30 a.m., when Muslims eat a predawn meal before fasting, they asked the kitchen staff to prepare and serve dishes of fish and shrimp, he said.\nMr. Barai recalls being puzzled by the attackers, who spoke cosmopolitan Bengali, and even some English, when conversing with the foreigners.\n\u201cThey were all smart and handsome and educated,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at those guys, nobody could believe they could do this.\u201d In the predawn hours, the militants lectured their captives on religious practices, instructing the kitchen staff to say regular prayers and study the Quran.\nEarly in the morning, the gunmen released a group of women wearing hijabs and offered a young Bangladeshi man, Faraz Hossain, the opportunity to leave, too, said Hishaam Hossain, Mr. Hossain\u2019s nephew, who had heard an account from the hostages who were freed.\nMr. Hossain, a student at Emory University, was accompanied by two women wearing Western clothes, however, and when the gunmen asked the women where they were from, they said India and the United States.

Sea levels are also rising as ocean temperatures warm, leading to higher chances of inundation and coastal flooding. Oceans absorb large amounts of the world\u2019s excess heat.\nExtreme weather events are increasingly common, said Steve Rintoul, interim director of Australia\u2019s climate science center at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and an author of the report. And that trend will continue.\n\u201cAlthough a 1-degree-Celsius rise in air temperatures seems small, it is enough to shift base-line averages,\u201d Dr. Rintoul said, referring to an increase equal to 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.\nHe added, \u201cIt increases the odds those events will happen.\u201d\nThe biennial report, by scientists at Csiro and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, draws on data collected at Cape Grim, Tasmania, where greenhouse gases caught in the atmosphere are measured, and from a program called Argo that tracks temperatures and other conditions in the world\u2019s oceans.\nAustralia is viewed as a leading example of a developed country being hit hard by climate change, and the report hints at the complex effects the rest of the world may face as climate change alters weather patterns.\n\u201cThe whole globe is subject to change,\u201d said Karl Braganza, of the Bureau of Meteorology, another author of the report. \u201cIt is sobering to look at other countries, countries like Bangladesh, or African nations, where their ability to deal with drought is much more reduced than ours.\u201d\nUp to 75 percent of ocean warming occurred in the Southern Hemisphere, the report said. As oceans absorb carbon dioxide and water temperatures increase, they expand, contributing to a rise in sea levels. Warmer oceans have also prompted a shift in large-scale weather patterns, which in turn affects rainfall. Although precipitation across Australia varies year to year, Csiro said the recent drying out of southern Australia was the strongest recorded large-scale change in rainfall since national records began in 1900. Years with lower-than-average growing-season rain would be more frequent in some regions, the report said.\nRainfall in the southwest reached such lows that Perth, the capital of Western Australia, mostly relied on water from desalination plants, Dr. Rintoul said. Long-term averages have declined 19 percent since 1970, but that has accelerated to 25 percent since 1996. Perth, an isolated city on the far western coast, has a population of about two million.\nWater that flows through streams and rivers also declined sharply. In the food-growing Murray-Darling Basin, in southern New South Wales and Victoria, stream flows were 41 percent lower than average, and in some parts of Victoria, they declined more than 70 percent.\nThe report also said that since 1993, sea levels to the north, west and southeast of Australia surpassed the global average. Ocean warming contributed to about a third of that rise, of about 20 centimeters, or 7.8 inches, since the late 1800s. The remainder was attributed to melting sea ice and changes to water stored on land.\nThe scientists, who said carbon dioxide emissions were largely because of the burning of fossil fuels like coal, refrained from urging the government to increase its commitment to lowering pollution targets. Australia has yet to ratify the Paris accord on climate change.\nIn August 2015, Australia agreed to an emissions cut of between 26 and 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. But state authorities have pushed ahead with plans for an immense coal mine in Queensland, inland from the Great Barrier Reef.\nFor almost a decade, Australia has fought bitterly over efforts to curb polluters. Two years ago, the country repealed carbon laws requiring large companies to pay for greenhouse gas emissions, a measure intended to penalize hundreds of its biggest producers of carbon emissions. During his successful campaign for prime minister a year earlier, Tony Abbott, then the leader of the Liberal Party, said the tax pushed up electricity prices for consumers. That claim contributed to his party\u2019s win. The emission targets that he put in place, derided as too low by environmental groups, remain in effect under his successor, Malcolm Turnbull.\nDr. Rintoul said historical emissions meant temperatures in Australia would continue to rise. Temperatures in the spring hit highs for three consecutive years starting in 2013, he noted. And agreements reached in Paris would not limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, he said, adding that carbon emissions were at peak levels in 2015 and would rise.\n\u201cWe have to go further,\u201d he said."}, {"text": "Whispers of Louis Kahn\u2019s Vision at the Yale Center for British Art\n2016-04-28T18:14:36.000Z\nNEW HAVEN \u2014 After a decade of planning, eight years of renovation and a 16-month closure, the Yale Center for British Art \u2014 one of the half-dozen or so masterpieces designed by the Philadelphia architect Louis Kahn during the last 15 years of his life \u2014 reopens to the public on May 11.

The aging fabric that covered the exhibition walls has been exchanged for new white Belgian linen. Nearly invisible sprinkler lines have been applied to the crossbeams of the roof, and synthetic carpeting, added during an earlier remodel, has been replaced by undyed wool carpets in the color and texture specified by Kahn.\nThe master\u2019s voice also remains audible in other ways. In converting the Long Gallery on the fourth floor from a series of blocked-off units to a single gorgeous stretch of salon-style exhibition space, the renovating architects were following one of Kahn\u2019s original working drawings. And when it came time to remodel the \u201cpogos\u201d \u2014 those movable walls inside the galleries \u2014 the architects found a drawing from February 1974, just a month before Kahn died, where it was clear he intended the pogos to be lifted off the ground so they appeared to float.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not an idiot and you just look, the building tells you what to do with it,\u201d said Jock Reynolds, director of the Yale University Art Gallery, a 1953 Kahn building across the street that went through its own renovation process about a decade ago.\nGeorge Knight, the architect hired by the Yale Center to oversee its conservation project, put it slightly differently. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a whisper that you hear,\u201d Mr. Knight said. \u201cThere\u2019s a phenomenal understated quality to this building. It\u2019s always\u201d \u2014 he drops his voice \u2014 \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d\nMr. Knight was aided by a 200-page \u201croad guide\u201d drawn up by Peter Inskip and Stephen Gee, two British preservation architects who unearthed historical details and supplied broad policy recommendations. One of the essential principles was that there could be no cheating on Kahn\u2019s materials. \u201cWe could have stained all the wood to match the original, and it would have been indetectable,\u201d Mr. Knight said about the refurbished white oak. \u201cBut he really would not have done that. And so we have situations where old wood and new wood are right next to each other, and we just had to be kind of brave about it and recognize that in time they will become closer together.\u201d\nThis meshing of the original designer and his collaborators (among whom he would have counted materials as well as people) had been part of the process from 1969, when Kahn first met with his patron to understand the collection as Mellon himself saw it. Then he worked closely for years with Jules Prown, the first director of the Yale Center, who helped shape Kahn\u2019s design in ways that even the architect acknowledged were useful.\nBy the time Kahn was awarded the contract, he was famous within his profession. (These days, he is perhaps best known through his son Nathaniel Kahn\u2019s acclaimed 2003 film, \u201cMy Architect.\u201d) Despite his terrible business habits (he was to die half a million dollars in debt) and his modest, up-from-the-neighborhood manner, Kahn\u2019s small Philadelphia firm had become known as the place where architectural history was being made.\nHe had not yet won his lifetime Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects \u2014 that came in 1971 \u2014 but several of his designs, including the recently completed Salk Institute, had already garnered enormous praise, and the Museum of Modern Art had devoted a whole exhibition to his Richards Medical Research Laboratory, the first structure ever to be honored individually in this way. Kahn was hard at work on a number of other late masterpieces, including the Phillips Exeter Library in New Hampshire, the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad and the Bangladesh Parliament building in Dhaka.\nIn spite of these distractions, the Yale project remained a priority, especially given his long-term connection to the university, where he had begun his teaching career in 1947.\nBut in March 1974, Kahn, a vigorous 73-year-old, died of a heart attack in New York\u2019s Penn Station, leaving unfinished the Yale Center, along with the Bangladesh project and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park on Roosevelt Island in New York.\nThese three major projects managed to reach completion only through the strenuous help of his colleagues and friends.\nMarshall Meyers \u2014 a former Kahn employee whose firm, Pellecchia & Meyers, finished the Yale Center over the subsequent three years \u2014 compared the difficulty of the assignment to \u201crestoring a building that hadn\u2019t been built yet.\u201d He added, \u201cSometimes there was a document or drawing Lou had done that showed his intent. In other cases one could only rely on recent precedent.\u201d Describing their \u201cgentle collaboration,\u201d Mr. Meyers (who died in 2001) said in a 1983 interview that Kahn \u201cnever worked alone. He couldn\u2019t. He needed to talk to someone; he needed a dialogue.\u201d\nAs it emerged from its final design, the Yale Center looked unlike any previous Kahn building. From the street, it could almost be an expensive office complex, with its alternating panels of matte gray steel and shiny glass.\nYou enter the four-story structure from the corner, through a dark and somewhat forbidding external foyer, but once inside, you are rewarded with a beautifully proportioned atrium where light floods down from above. The materials that make up this interior have a smoother, sleeker look than anything in Kahn\u2019s other buildings. It\u2019s not just the dark-hued steel, a new addition to his palette; even the oak, travertine and concrete, though similar to what Kahn employed elsewhere, seem more elegantly finished. The galleries, as they rise floor upon floor, are perfectly tailored to their purposes: a light-filled space for special exhibits; a darkened level for drawings and prints; and, finally, a grandly coffered upper gallery, where glorious natural light pours in on glorious Turners. The whole place has the feel of an English gentleman\u2019s club that has been hijacked for artistic purposes.\nNowhere does this come through more clearly than in the long, high, second-floor Library Court. With its paneled walls, its muffled skylights, its comfortable leather sofas and its large Persian rug, the room invites one to sit and rest. On the walls hang Paul Mellon\u2019s largest and in some cases most treasured British paintings. (That Kahn envisioned this arrangement from the start is demonstrated in an early sketch of his that shows Stubbs\u2019s gigantic \u201cLion Attacking a Horse\u201d on exactly the wall where it ended up.) This room is the pinnacle of gentleman\u2019s-club perfection.\nAnd yet Kahn allowed a primeval intruder to venture into this sanctuary. At one end of the long court, visible from every point within and around it, stands a massive concrete cylinder that seems to have flown in from another universe entirely. This wide gray column, which houses a staircase leading up to the higher galleries, is like a piece of the ancient world plunked down in an upscale London interior. The curved windowless facade that it presents to the room, textured as only Kahn\u2019s concrete can be textured, is implacable, indomitable, unforgiving of the niceties of club behavior. It is the memorable thing about the room, and its gesture toward the harshly archaic gives it a strength that the merely beautiful lacks.\n\u201cWhen you look out into the great court,\u201d said Amy Meyers, the Yale Center\u2019s director since 2002 and the motivating force behind the conservation project, \u201cyou see this extraordinary free-standing object. And it draws your eye successively up, floor by floor, through those parts of the building that display works of art. And it stands in conversation with those works as a great modern work of art. And it reminds you that the building itself is a work of art in its own right.\u201d"}, {"text": "Your Friday Briefing: Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Golden State Warriors\n2016-06-03T09:51:04.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email?

Though the official minimum working age is 14, child labor has long been widespread in Bangladesh, and the government does not keep records of workplace deaths or injuries involving children. But cases like Sagar\u2019s capture the public\u2019s attention.\nMr. Barman, in his police complaint, said he and his son had arrived at work at 6 a.m. on Sunday, as usual. Around noon, Sagar went to the compressor to clean dust from his body. Soon after, a female worker told Mr. Barman that Sagar was lying on the floor.\nThe father said he had rushed over and found his son unable to speak. The boy\u2019s abdomen was swollen. Sagar was taken to a nearby hospital, then to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nIn the complaint, the father accused four identified and four other unknown people at the mill of being involved in the boy\u2019s death, including Mr. Huda.\nAccording to the police complaint, Mr. Barman said those men and several other linemen and supervisors used to speak abusively to him and his son, and beat them when there were small mistakes in their work. He said that his son was killed because he had protested about the abuse.\nThe complaint accused the factory\u2019s owners, Mozammel Haque Bhuiyan, Mazharul Islam Bhuiyan, Azharul Haque Bhuiyan and Zafar Hossain Bhuiyan, of using child laborers in their factory.\nThe factory owners and supervisors could not be reached for comment on Monday night.\nMr. Hossain said the police were still investigating how the air got into the boy\u2019s body, and whether \u201cair was pumped by someone else into his body through the rectum or air went into his body through his mouth when he was cleaning his body.\u201d\nHe said the mill was established in 1985 and produced yarn from cotton, which was sold at local markets to make fabric.\nAbout 3,000 workers are employed at the mill, an estimated 10 percent of them children. They were not recruited but were employed at the request of the adult employees who wanted \u201csome light work\u201d for their children to perform so that \u201cthey can earn some money for their family,\u201d Mr. Hossain said.\nThe management hired the children as a \u201chumanitarian\u201d gesture, according to Mr. Hossain.\nSagar had earned 3,100 taka, or about $40 a month.\nThe air compressors were mostly used to clean dust from machines and accessories in the factory, Mr. Hossain said. But he said the boy and some other workers also used the compressors to clean themselves of factory dust."}, {"text": "Trump\u2019s Election? Some Students Are Too Busy to Worry\n2016-11-24T00:22:37.000Z\nOn a blustery afternoon this past week, the Atrium, a gathering place at LaGuardia Community College, arguably the most ethnically diverse college in the most ethnically diverse quarter of the world \u2014 western Queens \u2014 seemed especially worn. There was little light streaming in from the windows that overlook a small interior courtyard, the only suggestion of greenery amid a drab array of buildings, and an offering of concession foods that did not put you in mind of Alice Waters\u2019s ministrations in the dining halls at Yale.\nI had come to gauge the reaction of students to the election of Donald J. Trump as president; around the country, many elite colleges were in a state of mourning and protest. At Brown, flags were destroyed. At Columbia, on the night of the election, students flooded College Walk to cry and scream. The university\u2019s president, Lee C. Bollinger, himself denounced President-elect Trump at an awards dinner several days later, saying that the falsehoods disseminated during the campaign \u201cwould make George Orwell seem na\u00efve and unimaginative.\u201d\nStudents at urban community colleges around the country, though \u2014 largely poor and many of them immigrants \u2014 were potentially those with the most to lose under a Trump administration. Were they equally unnerved? Or was the expression of outrage \u2014 with its petitions and meetings and hours spent lingering over coffee and vodka and plans to overcome \u2014 itself a luxury their lives could not accommodate?\nOn the morning after the election, Gail O. Mellow, LaGuardia\u2019s president, shellshocked and assuming her students needed comfort, went to the Atrium to hear them out. She found herself surprised by the range of response. \u201cMany of us have experienced this as a uniform negative, and they don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Mellow told me. Some students welcomed change, they said; others were unaffected; still others felt that the world was really no different from the way it had been 24 hours earlier \u2014 life, with its difficulties, would go on.\nLater the same day, Karen Dubinsky, one of Ms. Mellow\u2019s administrative colleagues, had been scheduled to lead a meeting of the President\u2019s Society, a group of the school\u2019s most diligent students. She assumed that the evening would be given over to their feelings about the election, but the subject hardly came up. Instead, the students wanted to talk about their coming job interviews, their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, how to shake hands with potential employers, how to find work as radiology technicians. None were afraid; none saw the current moment as the harbinger of end times. Of LaGuardia\u2019s approximately 50,000 students (representing more than 150 countries), more than two-thirds come from households that make less than $25,000 a year.\nHistory is sure to regard the recent election as so monumental not for what it exposed about the dangers of estimation (the polling predictions that failed), but for what it revealed about the perils of certainty. Members of the well-meaning liberal ruling order were sure they knew what the poor and working class thought and felt. Talking to some of LaGuardia\u2019s students, one is reminded of how much more easily the American narrative of self-reliance is adopted by people who have come here from somewhere else, compelled by their aspirations and not yet immunized against the mythologies.\nAnthony Salinovic was registering students to be peer advisers when I met him recently. He was about to graduate from LaGuardia after two years and move on to a four-year college \u2014 statistically speaking, a major feat \u2014 and he felt no instinct to personalize the election. \u201cIt can\u2019t affect me,\u201d Mr. Salinovic said. \u201cIt can\u2019t affect my success or failure. Trump isn\u2019t here in this school; he isn\u2019t in my classes.\u201d\nEsmeralda Burgos echoed the sentiment, saying that she would not let the election dictate her life and that no matter how \u201cmalicious\u201d Mr. Trump might be, she would not let the fact of his presidency \u201cchange how I carry myself.\u201d\nNot far away was Milon Haque, who has been in the country five years and came from Bangladesh. He said he found the notion of protesting, with the roads it closed off and the general flow of urban productivity it impeded, \u201cinsane.\u201d\nWithin the broad population of college students, another fault line the election seems to make clear is the difference in the way that unsettling news is processed among the coddled and the persevering. Dara Karac, 26, a student from Montenegro, transferred this year to Cornell from LaGuardia, to study engineering. She came back to visit before the Thanksgiving holiday. Ms. Karac was not a Trump supporter, but she was struck, she told me, by the paralysis that overtook the Cornell campus in the days following the election. Half of the students in her classes didn\u2019t show up, she said, and to those who did, professors spoke, for long chunks of time, of the political environment. Ms. Karac was also besieged by emails from administrators making sure students who were upset could get the help they needed, and she found it all a bit too much.\nWhen she arrived back at LaGuardia, the mood was just the opposite. There, she said, \u201cpeople are busy with their five jobs.\u201d And many come from countries \u2014 she counted herself among them \u2014 where it is the custom, rather than the anomaly, to have leaders you don\u2019t like.\n\u201cI left my country because I didn\u2019t have opportunities,\u201d she told me. \u201cI came here to get a degree.\u201d If America becomes a terrible place to live, she will leave. \u201cIf I become a good engineer,\u201d she said, \u201cevery country will want me.\u201d"}, {"text": "Aleppo, Istanbul, OPEC: Your Monday Briefing\n2016-12-12T05:00:23.000Z\nGood morning.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 President-elect Donald J.

Storefronts were empty, buildings abandoned. Crime was through the roof.\nA tiny, local nonprofit, Glass House Collective, then formed, enlisting neighbors and designers. Public workshops were held. Low-cost plans were devised for new sidewalks, bus shelters, streetlights and green spaces along the neighborhood\u2019s main drag, Glass Street. A vacant lot became a pop-up community center. Artisans moved in to train young residents to make furniture and other things. The steps were small, tactical, targeted. Crime fell.\n\u201cBy the People: Designing a Better America,\u201d opening on Friday at the Smithsonian\u2019s Cooper Hewitt, taps into a rich vein of entrepreneurial beneficence. It is about the intersection of poverty, prosperity, innovation and design, and it couldn\u2019t be timelier. If stories like the one from Chattanooga unavoidably turn out to be more complicated than any museum display can make clear, the spotlight is at least pointed in the right direction.\nAs the show\u2019s title implies, design is not just the task of designers. The exhibition celebrates a few outstanding architects, like David Baker and Michael Maltzan, who have conceived subsidized housing in California, and also Jeanne Gang, the Chicago star, who wants to improve relations between the community and law enforcement by reimagining police stations as neighborhood hubs, with gardens and gyms, meeting rooms and free Wi-Fi.\nMostly, though, the show is about ideas collectively developed or bubbling up from the bottom. What results can take numerous forms: a plan to shrink Detroit; a pedal-powered tractor; an ironic board game explaining the housing market; a jewelry business employing formerly homeless women to make items using chipped-off graffiti; an online tool for mapping commute times; labels on baby products with child-rearing tips.\nIn other words, \u201cBy the People\u201d is about just what it says, everyday citizens cooking up solutions to what ails their communities. That tractor evolved from crowd-sourced tinkering on an open platform called Farm Hack, a grass-roots website developed by family-farming Davids competing with industrial agriculture\u2019s Goliaths, sharing strategies about how to grow healthy food and build tools and machinery, economically. The system is imperfect, but then, so is democracy.\nCynthia E. Smith is the Cooper Hewitt\u2019s curator of socially responsible design. She spent years traveling the country, logging 50,000 miles, looking for examples of people \u201cdesigning a better America.\u201d In 2007, Ms. Smith presented \u201cDesign for the Other 90 Percent,\u201d a compilation of 34 inexpensive, lifesaving objects, including a filtered drinking straw to stem the spread of cholera; and the Q Drum, a kind of tire, holding up to 13 gallons of water, which could be rolled long distances even by children. Big things grown from small seeds.\nThat event led four years later to a show focused on cities. Ms. Smith highlighted floating schools in flood-prone Bangladesh; a kind of do-it-yourself irrigation system in Dakar, Senegal; a new management and community-development plan for slums in Bangkok; and the story of Diadema, an industrial city outside S\u00e3o Paulo, where informal settlement and homicide were the norms. Officials in Diadema enlisted residents to help formalize and design their neighborhoods. Deaths plummeted.\nMs. Smith said back then, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to build a house, much harder to build a community.\u201d Good design, she added, \u201cinvolves bringing not just a fresh eye to problems but, most of all, listening to the people who live in those communities.\u201d\nThat\u2019s simple to say and not always enough, but it remains a good operating principle and the abiding motif in \u201cBy the People,\u201d which offers its own mash-up of do-good projects, 60 in all. One could probably think, offhand, of 60 deserving alternatives for what\u2019s in the end a contestable, albeit noble, sampling. By their nature, these sorts of shows are tonics and provocations, suggestive rather than definitive, shy on eye candy, requiring comfortable shoes and lots of squinting at wall texts.\nIn return, there\u2019s a gee-whiz quotient \u2014 so many people, so many good, simple, can-do ideas. So much hope.\nI was struck by a project like Fresh Moves. Across the country, obesity and diabetes have become epidemic in food deserts, meaning low-income neighborhoods without easy access to fresh fruits and vegetables, where fast food is often the cheapest or only option. In Chicago, officials have doubled the number of city-run farmers\u2019 markets and supported efforts like Fresh Moves, which converts disused city buses into brightly decorated mobile farm stands, transporting local organic produce to where people most need it. The project was the brainchild of young architects then nurtured by Growing Power, an agricultural nonprofit in the city, in collaboration with Hammersley Architecture and a graffiti artist. The number of Chicagoans living in food deserts has now dropped 40 percent.\nIt was just reported this week that 2015 was the first year poverty declined and incomes rose across America since the economy collapsed in 2008. Even so, some 43 million Americans, including at least 14 million children, still live below the poverty line. Families are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. Not everyone can wait for the government to fix things.\nThat\u2019s what this show is ultimately about. And about the forces that can thwart even the best intentions. There was also news on Monday that two prominent members of the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership board resigned. The BeltLine project is included in the exhibition. It was dreamed up more than a dozen years ago by a former urban planning student at Georgia Tech, Ryan Gravel. The idea: Turn four of the city\u2019s abandoned rail beds into a green loop around downtown, producing parks and paths, art centers and housing; promoting bikes and walking over automobiles; linking rich and poor neighborhoods, black and white; generating billions of dollars in investments.\nThe rails-to-trails concept took off. Mr. Gravel became a hero. The city and private developers showered the project with money. Housing prices skyrocketed along the route. But so did fears of displacement in low-income areas. Only one-tenth of the promised 5,600 new units of subsidized housing have been built. The BeltLine recently announced plans to raise money for more affordable housing, but the board members who resigned didn\u2019t consider that enough.\nOne of them is Mr. Gravel.\nThe other, Nathaniel Smith, said that if the BeltLine \u201cis about community engagement and community voice and about equity, we have to live by those values.\u201d He added, \u201cWe can\u2019t say that and do something else.\u201d\nSo, as I said, some stories turn out to be more complicated. But nobody said progress was easy."}, {"text": "Hillary Clinton \u2018Super PAC\u2019 to Air First Attack Ads Aimed at Donald Trump\n2016-05-17T17:45:15.000Z\nThe general election effort to take down Donald J. Trump through television ads will begin on Wednesday, with the main \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Hillary Clinton airing its first two attack ads on broadcast television in four swing states. The effort kicks off a multimillion-dollar campaign that will flood screens in those states in the months to come.\nThe super PAC, Priorities USA Action, had initially planned to wait until after the June 7 primary contests to introduce TV ads attacking Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, but accelerated its effort against him. The group\u2019s $6 million investment includes two ads that offer scathing critiques of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about women that will run for the next three weeks in Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Nevada.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s most devoted donors have given roughly $80 million to Priorities USA Action to stop Mr. Trump, more than the group raised in the entire 2012 election to re-elect President Obama.\nThe ads are the beginning of the broader Democratic campaign against Mr. Trump, focused on convincing suburban and working-class women that he does not respect them.\nPriorities USA Action said it also planned to run ads that critiqued Mr. Trump\u2019s business record and portrayed him as out of touch with the working-class Americans he says he represents, an approach similar to the one it used to depict the Republican nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, as a cold corporate titan.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s allies said Mr. Trump\u2019s mocking of a New York Times reporter\u2019s disability also effectively turned off swing voters, potentially providing fodder for future ads that depict Mr. Trump as insensitive and unprepared for the presidency.\nMr. Trump\u2019s Republican rivals criticized Mr. Trump similarly on his comments about women and on his business record during the party\u2019s nominating contest, but the effort came too late to stop his momentum.\nOne of the super PAC\u2019s ads, called \u201cSpeak,\u201d shows voters lip-syncing some of Mr. Trump\u2019s caustic remarks about women as they wear shirts with Mr. Trump\u2019s visage screen-printed on them. The other, \u201cRespect,\u201d shows quick interviews with the candidate in which he outlines his positions on abortion and Planned Parenthood.\nThe super PAC had initially invested $130 million to reserve time for broadcast and digital ads that would start running the day after the California and New Jersey primaries in June. But it decided to add an additional buy to accelerate the time line, aiming to sow early doubts about Mr. Trump, particularly among female voters who will have a disproportionate effect on the fall election and with whom Mr. Trump has shown a particular weakness in polls.\nFemale voters favored Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump, 55 percent to 35 percent, in a New York Times/CBS News poll released in March, twice the gender gap of the 2012 presidential election, when President Obama defeated Mr. Romney.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, which cannot directly coordinate with the super PAC, has tried to raise money by showing Mr. Trump\u2019s comments assailing the former secretary of state for playing the \u201cwoman\u2019s card.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton, though, has tried to avoid directly provoking Mr. Trump, relying instead on outside groups like the super PAC to carry out direct attacks. The campaign\u2019s online videos against Mr. Trump have focused mostly on his policy positions and on criticism by his rivals in the Republican primaries.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the \u201cSpeak\u201d ad had misrepresented one of his statements. \u201cThe pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. \u2018You can tell them to go BLANK themselves\u2019 \u2014 was about China, NOT WOMEN!\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\nThat drew a rebuke from the super PAC.\n\u201cSorry Donald, but the ad isn\u2019t only about your overt sexism, it\u2019s about your divisiveness and character being unsuitable for the office of the presidency,\u201d Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the group, said in an email on Tuesday morning.\nIn an interview, Mr. Barasky said the group thought it had to advertise earlier after seeing the Republican \u201cstop Trump\u201d effort fall short. \u201cThe decision was made recently to go up now because we learned from Washington Republicans that you can\u2019t wait to go after Trump,\u201d Mr. Barasky said. \u201cWhat they did was too little, too late, and we weren\u2019t going to make the same mistake.\u201d\nThe new ads adhere to similar lines of attack taken by Our Principles PAC, the super PAC led by Republican operatives. It released an ad, \u201cQuotes,\u201d featuring female actors reciting Mr. Trump\u2019s quotations about women. The ad tested highly in effectiveness, but came out only days before the Republican primary in Florida, which Mr. Trump won.\n\u201cSpeak\u201d is slightly different in that the ad uses Mr. Trump\u2019s voice rather than those of actors, along with the voices of voters.\n\u201cOur research shows most people know very little about Donald Trump,\u201d Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Priorities PAC, said on MSNBC on Monday night, adding, \u201cWhen we tested a lot of the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 ads, we realized very quickly they really had no idea what Donald Trump had been saying on the stump and what his record had been in business or toward women, and so it\u2019s our job to make sure they see it.\u201d\nHe added that the group would also be focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s business record, an issue that numerous Republican groups and campaigns highlighted during the nominating contest. Mr. Cecil specifically mentioned Mr. Trump\u2019s record of \u201cmaking ties in China and hiring people in Bangladesh.\u201d"}, {"text": "Animosity in a Burmese Hub Deepens as Chinese Get Richer\n2016-11-28T01:16:09.000Z\nMANDALAY, Myanmar \u2014 From damp and drizzly London, the siren of British imperialism, Rudyard Kipling, wrote a poem that captured the palm trees, pagodas and temple bells of Burma during colonial rule.\nThe romance of that verse, \u201cMandalay,\u201d became a refrain for the exotic East, and of this city, in particular, once a royal capital with a stunning palace. Written in 1890, it has resonated ever since:\nOn the road to Mandalay,Where the flyin\u2019 fishes play,An\u2019 the dawn comes up like thunder outer China \u2019crost the Bay!\nKipling never visited Mandalay, having imagined it from a brief sojourn in a city called Moulmein, now Mawlamyine, several hundred miles to the south.\nBut perhaps if he arrived in Mandalay today, he would find its charms faded \u2014 buried under the demands of Chinese commerce, and the hustle of Chinese businessmen scooping up jade and timber for the market back home.\nResidents view them as interlopers who take advantage of Mandalay\u2019s location close to India and Bangladesh, Laos and Thailand, as well as a large swath of southern China. And some of the Chinese view the Burmese as beneath them, slow at business and making money.\nAt the open-air jade market, Chinese businessmen haggle with Burmese traders selling rough green slabs of the gemstone, freshly dug from mines in remote areas to the north. Deals have slowed. Prices are down in China, flattened by the slowing economy and a fierce anticorruption campaign.\nOn a recent morning, the mood was surly along the rows of wooden stalls where the Chinese inspect the jade for quality and color.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dirty and chaotic, and sometimes dangerous,\u201d said Zhu Xuefei, a jade buyer from Guangdong Province in China. Myanmar, the name now used for Burma, was too poor to install the closed circuit television cameras that are ubiquitous in China to help prevent robberies, he complained.\nChinese traders have been coming to Mandalay since before the mid-19th century, when the city was created on the banks of the Irrawaddy River as the royal redoubt. Records show a Chinese temple from 1773. Some sailed down the river; others rode south from Yunnan Province in mule caravans ferrying silver and silk. The Chinese had a light touch.\nNow the Chinese dominate the economy, their mansions lining the streets of an enclave called New Town, symbols of the wealth accrued in the underground drug, timber and mineral trades in the northern Shan and Wa States of Myanmar.\nThe city has become a sprawl of about one million people on a scorched, dusty plain. George Orwell, who lived here briefly in the 1920s, dismissed it as having just five features: pagodas, pariahs, pigs, priests and prostitutes. The old pagodas, many covered with gilded paint, still exist, though the most notable recent one has a pale jade exterior, a testament to the city\u2019s new money.\nThe timber buildings of Orwell\u2019s era either burned down or were demolished to make way for crude concrete buildings that now dominate the downtown area.\nIn the early hours, the sun lights up the red brick fortress walls of the palace, and the moat glistens with soft light. But soon the sun\u2019s hot glare drums down on everything, and by midday the streets mostly empty out.\nMuch of the activity moves to the teahouses. They are open sided, with ceiling fans moving listlessly in the heat. Waiters carry large metal teapots, their flip-flops making a swishing sound on the concrete floors as they fill customers\u2019 cups and plop down platters of curry.\nTo soothe raw feelings between Chinese and Burmese customers, some teahouses display a photograph of the recent meeting in Beijing between the leader of Myanmar, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping.\nThe barely disguised contempt of the Chinese toward the Burmese \u2014 \u201cWe only need to pay $2.50 a day for labor,\u201d said Mr. Zhu, the jade buyer \u2014 is returned with resentment that ebbs and flows according to the political and economic climate.\n\u201cThe new Chinese try to influence our culture by donating to temples and religious associations,\u201d said U Kyaw Zan Hla, 69, the former editor of a defunct leftist newspaper, The People. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the Burmese tradition of respect to elders, teachers and monks.\u201d\nWhen remnants of China\u2019s Nationalist Army fled to northern Burma after the Communist victory in 1949, they settled in Mandalay with their large families. By then, the royal palace \u2014 wooden pavilions with gabled roofs and richly painted pillars \u2014 had been burned to the ground by Japanese bombardment in 1942.\nA replica was built in 1989 by the junta, which handed the vast sward of green that surrounds the palace to the military for use as a headquarters. (The last king and queen of Burma fled to India in 1885, pushed out by the conquering British four years before Kipling composed his poem.)\nAfter World War II, Mandalay was a backwater \u2014 a place where the new Chinese settlers made themselves at home, took Burmese names and learned the language.\nThe children of the Nationalist Army veterans are now in their 60s. Some practice tai chi in the soft dawn hours on a walkway near the palace walls. U Shwe, an enthusiastic man dressed in shorts and sneakers, made his tai chi moves with a red Chinese fan fully opened in one hand and a silver sword in the other. Chinese music boomed from a portable tape deck.\nBut even here, a condescending attitude toward the Burmese is prevalent. \u201cWe hire a lot of them,\u201d said Mrs. Xu, 65, who owns a metal factory and gave only her last name. \u201cThe Burmese are very easygoing. They believe everything is predetermined, so they accept everything that happens in life.\u201d\nIn the 1980s, after the Chinese government stopped its support of the Communist Party of Burma, a new wave of entrepreneurs from China\u2019s then-fledgling market economy flooded over the border.\nThey found lucrative deals trading in drugs and gems in the restive northern provinces, and bought identity cards and citizenship papers from corrupt officials of the military government, said Mr. Kyaw Zan Hla, the former editor, as he sat in his library filled with old newspapers, magazines and first edition books, including a yellowed copy of Orwell\u2019s \u201cBurmese Days.\u201d\nIn 1984, when a fire swept through downtown Mandalay, burning the mostly wooden structures to the ground, the Chinese acted.\n\u201cThe Burmese people had no money, and the Chinese bought the land which only they could afford,\u201d he said. \u201cNaturally, there are tensions between the newcomers and the Burmese \u2014 the Burmese look at the Chinese with hatred because they are very haughty.\u201d\nThe Chinese know that many Burmese are offended by their flashier lifestyle. They are fearful of reprisals, or of a repetition of anti-Chinese riots here in the 1960s.\nWhen violence broke out between Buddhists and Muslims in Mandalay several years ago, Chinese residents took extra measures to protect themselves, said Zhang Xucheng, a businessman.\nThe Chinese are curbing excessive shows of wealth. \u201cIn the Chinese schools, they are telling the children not to be confrontational, not to live extravagantly,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cThere is no Blue Label whiskey, only Red Label and Black Label. We limit the number of cars for a wedding. There used to be 40 or 50. Now they have only 16 cars.\u201d"}, {"text": "Retailers Like H&M and Walmart Fall Short of Pledges to Overseas Workers\n2016-05-31T04:01:22.000Z\nAfter more than 1,100 deaths exposed dangerous labor conditions in Bangladesh in 2013, brands like H&M, Walmart and Gap were among the most powerful companies that pledged to improve the safety of some of the country\u2019s poorest workers.\nBut human rights groups say that three years later, those promises are still unfulfilled, and that safety, labor and other issues persist in Bangladesh and other countries where global retailers benefit from an inexpensive work force.\nA series of new reports by the Asia Floor Wage Alliance, a coalition of trade unions and other research and advocacy groups, has put a new spotlight on the conditions. In Bangladesh, the group says, tens of thousands of workers sew garments in buildings without proper fire exits. In Indonesia, India and elsewhere, pregnant women are vulnerable to reduced wages and discrimination. In Cambodia, workers who protested for an extra $20 a month were shot and killed.\nThe brands say that in recent years they have aggressively pushed stronger labor protections and vastly increased their monitoring of the factories that make their products. They have also made significant structural and fire repairs at many factories in Bangladesh.\nBut even the retail groups say that more improvement is needed, a message underscored in the new reports. Worker advocates say that progress on improving conditions at the factories has been too slow, and that some of the world\u2019s biggest companies continue to benefit from unfair and dangerous labor practices.\n\u201cThere have been substantial safety renovations in factories that have unquestionably made those factories substantially safer,\u201d Scott Nova, the executive director of the labor monitoring group Worker Rights Consortium, said of the work in Bangladesh. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s also true that there have been unacceptable delays.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the Wage Alliance released its latest report, which accuses Walmart of benefiting from forced labor and other abusive practices in a number of Asian countries. In Cambodia, for instance, workers at factories who make products sold at the company are required to work 10 to 14 hours a day in sweltering heat, without access to clean drinking water or breaks \u2014 conditions that have contributed to \u201cmass fainting episodes,\u201d the report said.\nWorkers who refuse or who try to speak up for themselves risk being fired, according to the report.\nIn a statement, Walmart said that its standards for suppliers \u201cspecifically address working hours, breaks, the cultivation of a safe and healthy work environment, and freedom of association.\u201d The retailer said that it does not own or operate facilities in Cambodia or Bangladesh, but that it expects suppliers to \u201cuphold these standards in the factories from which they manufacture products.\u201d\nThe Wage Alliance is releasing its studies to coincide with the International Labour Conference in Geneva that began Monday.\nThis month, the group released a report that detailed sexual harassment, low wages and other abuses at H&M\u2019s supplier factories. Anannya Bhattacharjee, the international coordinator for the Wage Alliance, also said that dangers persist at factories in Bangladesh, where the more than 1,100 workers died in the Rana Plaza collapse, one of the deadliest industrial disasters in history.\n\u201cAt this point, we do not see H&M working in a way that would prevent another Rana Plaza,\u201d Ms. Bhattacharjee said.\nIn a statement, H&M characterized the challenges outlined in the report as \u201cindustrywide.\u201d\n\u201cThe report raises important issues, and we are dedicated to contributing to positive long-term development for the people working in the textile industry within our sourcing markets,\u201d the company said. \u201cH&M has been working actively for many years to help strengthen the textile workers\u2018 conditions and will continue to do so.\u201d\nFactories in many developing countries are under enormous pressure to churn out billions of dollars worth of goods at costs low enough to beat out the competition for business from foreign companies.\nH&M, with $25 billion in sales last year, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the so-called fast-fashion craze, relying on factories in many countries to help quickly refresh its clothing offerings. Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States, has created an huge business out of inexpensive goods.\nBut the collapse at Rana Plaza renewed discussions about how the appetite for cheap products affects some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable workers. What costs must be cut, for example, in order to sell a T-shirt in the United States for $5?\nAfter Rana Plaza, two coalitions of retailers \u2014 one dominated by European brands, the other American \u2014 each made a five-year commitment to regular inspections, repairs and other corrective measures aimed at improving working conditions in Bangladesh.\nThe Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, led by the Swedish retailer H&M, was largely seen as stronger because it included a legally binding arbitration provision to resolve labor disputes. The other group, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which includes Gap and Walmart, has no such clause, but it can impose financial penalties and expel members who violate its terms.\nBoth groups say they have made progress. Of the 108,000 issues identified through inspections at the roughly 1,600 factories covered by the Accord, 60 percent have been reported or confirmed as corrected, according to a spokesman, Joris Oldenziel.\nThe Alliance group has repaired more than half of the issues at more than 600 active factories, according to its website. That has made its factories \u201cconsiderably safer,\u201d said James F. Moriarty, the country director for the Alliance.\nBut both of the retail coalitions admit that progress has been slow: Nearly 1,400 corrective action plans are behind schedule at factories covered by the Accord, according to its website. Political unrest and a lack of qualified engineers had contributed to delays, Mr. Moriarty said.\nOne widespread issue: fire safety. Fire doors, which can withstand high temperatures for a set period of time, are not common in Bangladesh and need to be imported, the Alliance group said. The doors isolate a fire and keep flame and smoke out of stairwells. The Rana Plaza collapse happened just a few months after the Tazreen Fashions fire, which killed 112 Bangladeshi workers.\nAs of 2015, nearly 79,000 workers continued to produce garments for H&M in Bangladesh in buildings without proper fire exits, according to the Wage Alliance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so grossly irresponsible to put thousands of workers into a building that doesn\u2019t have them,\u201d Mr. Nova said.\nA building\u2019s safety is just one of the issues that human rights and labor advocates say must be addressed in Bangladesh and elsewhere.\nThe Floor Wage Alliance\u2019s report on Gap, for instance, pointed to \u201csweatshop\u201d conditions at one of the retailer\u2019s suppliers: Workers in one factory were regularly forced into working more than 100 hours a week at poverty-level wages.\nIn a statement, Laura Wilkinson, a spokeswoman for Gap, said that the company worked with a \u201cwide-range of stakeholders,\u201d including workers, unions, governments and nongovernmental organizations, to improve conditions at the factories that make its clothes.\nShe pointed to the company\u2019s Code of Vendor Conduct, which requires workers to be paid either a legal minimum wage or a wage that meets local industry standards. The code also said that factories are \u201cencouraged\u201d to pay enough so that workers can cover their basic needs and have some discretionary income. Gap says it has about 70 local staff members who help enforce its standards in the countries that make its products.\nThe commitments from the Alliance and the Accord group are set to expire in 2018. Labor advocates are skeptical that companies like H&M can fulfill the promises they made in 2013.\n\u201cThey promised to get our lives better, but we don\u2019t get enough salary and working situation,\u201d said Nath Sou, 39, who works at a garment factory near Phnom Penh, Cambodia, which supplies clothes to H&M.\nMs. Nath said she gets $140 a month and must borrow money to pay her rent and support her family. Ms. Sou said that she could be fired for joining a labor union or protesting.\n\u201cWe do not see who or what company could make our lives better,\u201d she said."}, {"text": "China\u2019s Last Wild River Carries Conflicting Environmental Hopes\n2016-06-18T15:12:52.000Z\nQIUNATONG, China \u2014 Three great rivers rush through parallel canyons in the mountains of southwest China on their way to the coastal plains of Asia. At least 10 dams have been built on two of them, the Mekong and the Yangtze. The third remains wild: the remote, raging Nu, known as the Salween in Myanmar, where it empties into the Andaman Sea.\nNo dam stands in the path of its turquoise waters. It is the last free-flowing river in China.\nEnvironmentalists have waged a passionate defense of the Nu for more than a decade, battling state hydropower firms determined to build dams to harness the river, whose name in Chinese means \u201cangry.\u201d It is an epic struggle that has veered from victory to defeat and back again several times and has recently taken on new significance:\nWith global temperatures rising, can China afford to protect its rivers and forgo an alternative to the coal-fired plants responsible for much of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions?\nGreen advocates across the country have argued that dams on the Nu would force the relocation of tens of thousands of people, destroy spawning grounds for fish and threaten the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen downstream, especially across the border in Myanmar and Thailand.\nBut China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, has promised to begin scaling back its use of coal even as its power needs continue to rise. The government pledged that one-fifth of the nation\u2019s energy use will come from non-fossil sources by 2030, and it intends to reach that goal in large part by building more dams. Like the United States, China considers hydropower its biggest source of clean energy.\nIn the latest twist in the battle over the Nu, provincial officials told Chinese reporters in March that they would suspend construction of small dams and instead establish a national park along the river. But environmentalists remain wary.\nI recently spent nearly a week along a 250-mile stretch of the river, traveling from the prefecture capital of Liuku to the Tibetan border to see what was at stake in this battle and why environmental groups and local residents have fought the dams so fiercely.\nThis valley, in China\u2019s southwest Yunnan Province, is home to a kaleidoscope of ethnic and religious communities unparalleled in China. Farmers tend to fields along steep, terraced valley walls. Pastors hold services in churches overlooking the waters, while Tibetan lamas perform rituals in hilltop monasteries. And guesthouse owners open their doors to tourists eager to glimpse this wild corner of their country.\nDams would result in the flooding of many of these villages and undermine the river\u2019s role as a lifeline through the valley.\nOver the years, government agencies and state firms have proposed building multiple dams along the 1,700-mile river. Most of these plans have been scrapped, and the fight is now focused on proposals for four dams on the pristine upper stretch that flows through this valley, and a fifth one in Tibet.\nThese dams would contribute to the 350 gigawatts of hydropower capacity that Beijing wants to have built by 2020. By comparison, the United States has more than 80 gigawatts of hydropower capacity.\nPreliminary construction work has been touch and go for years, and the four sites were abandoned when I visited. There were suspension bridges, rusted transport skiffs and small man-made caves in the valley walls, but no workers in sight.\n\u201cThe dam is no good for the environment, so the government stopped it,\u201d said Abao, a resident of Dongfeng Village, far up the valley. He recently visited the fifth site, upriver in Tibet, and said construction appeared to have halted there.\nBut given past swings, residents said they were worried about work resuming.\n\u201cThe water flow wouldn\u2019t be normal, and there would be less fish in the water,\u201d said Yang Wendong, 37, an ethnic Nu resident of a mushroom-rich mountain village, Qiunatong, by the Tibet border. \u201cThe benefits from hydropower are temporary.\u201d\nIn Xiaoshaba, near the proposed dam site farthest downriver, the government has already relocated residents, the start of what will be a huge resettlement effort along the entire valley if the dams are approved.\nThe village\u2019s 120 households have been forced to give up their livestock and farmland and move into two-story buildings nearby. Some run small shops or lease space in the buildings.\nAs I stood on a road overlooking the empty village, Yu Wenxiang, 60, invited me into his sister-in-law\u2019s house and complained that the government had yet to compensate his family with a new home. \u201cThe government promised there were a total of 10 homes they would still give out, but they haven\u2019t handed those out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been a long time.\u201d\nTo the north, in the village of Laomudeng, Yu Wulin, a guesthouse owner, said the dams would have \u201cno good benefits for the local people,\u201d and would choke off the trickle of tourists coming to the region since 2003. That was when it was recognized as one of the world\u2019s most ecologically diverse and fragile places and designated a Unesco World Heritage Site.\nIn March, officials from Yunnan Province \u2014 who along with the China Huadian Corporation, one of the country\u2019s largest state energy firms, had promoted the dams \u2014 appeared to reverse themselves and propose a national park.\nResidents I spoke with applauded the idea. \u201cMy generation will not see the benefits of the national park project, but the next generation will,\u201d said Yang Yi, a minivan driver in Gongshan, an upriver town.\nBut Wang Yongchen, the director of Green Earth Volunteers, a group in Beijing that has led the fight against dams on the Nu for more than a decade, expressed some skepticism. She said the officials\u2019 statements could be interpreted to mean only that construction of smaller hydropower stations using water from the Nu\u2019s tributaries would be suspended. More than 100 of these smaller stations have already been built in the valley.\n\u201cWe want the central government to make a decision on these four dams, to cancel them,\u201d Ms. Wang said.\nMs. Wang and other environmentalists acknowledge that China needs to wean itself off coal and other fossil fuels to combat global warming, but maintain that it can do so without resorting to as much hydropower or nuclear power as proposed by the government.\nSome said the construction of dams could contribute to climate change because organic matter submerged by dams and reservoirs may release significant amounts of methane when they decompose. Methane is a greenhouse gas.\nThere are also commercial rationales for not building the dams. Some energy analysts say much of the electricity generated by hydropower in Yunnan is wasted because the transmission system to the national electricity grid is limited and outdated. Others say the electricity does not end up on the grid because the network gives coal-fired plants preferential treatment over firms specializing in alternative power generation.\n\u201cYunnan already has more hydropower capacity than it uses,\u201d said Zhang Boting, vice chairman of the China Society for Hydropower Engineering. \u201cMany stations in Yunnan are already letting water run free because there is no market for it.\u201d\nA spree of dam building is already underway on other major rivers of western China, which flow into neighboring countries and are critical for life across Asia. In October, China began operating the giant Zangmu Dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet, upsetting India and Bangladesh because the river is an important waterway in their countries. Proposed dams on the Mekong have raised similar anxieties.\nBut environmentalists have succeeded in persuading the central government to block some projects. In Yunnan, the proposed Guonian Dam on the Mekong, known as the Lancang in China, was canceled because of its potential impact on a glacier. Last year, Beijing also rejected plans to build a dam on the Yangtze because of the potential effects on a protected zone for fish.\nSome climate change researchers say building hydropower capacity is critical for China as it tries to move away from coal.\n\u201cHydropower, in China\u2019s sustainable development process, occupies a rather important role,\u201d said Yang Fuqiang of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cBut with regards to the Nu River,\u201d he added, \u201cI personally think the best thing for China is to preserve a perfect, untouched river. Don\u2019t construct large-scale dams on it.\u201d\nChen Zuyu, a prominent hydropower scientist, estimates that the country has installed less than half of 700 gigawatts of potential hydropower capacity, and said it should push ahead.\n\u201cChina is still in the golden era of hydropower development,\u201d he said. \u201cChina can keep developing hydropower for another 30 years, and then it will be done.\u201d\nMr. Chen said the Nu was ready to be developed, but noted, \u201cEnvironmental issues are political issues and are the hardest to resolve.\u201d"}, {"text": "ISIS Seems to Tailor Attacks for Different Audiences\n2016-07-03T01:32:58.000Z\nThe first to be killed was a jogger, gunned down last September during his daily run in the leafy diplomatic quarter of Bangladesh\u2019s capital, Dhaka. He was identified as a 50-year-old Italian aid worker, and the police say the men who murdered him had been given instructions to kill a white foreigner at random.\nIn October, a Japanese man was killed. In November, gunmen riding a motorcycle pulled alongside a Catholic priest in northern Bangladesh and opened fire, wounding him.\nFor the Islamic State terrorist group, which broadly advised operatives it sent to Europe to kill \u201canyone and everyone,\u201d the group\u2019s tactics in Bangladesh have seemed more controlled. In the past nine months, it has claimed 19 attacks in the South Asian country, nearly all of them targeted assassinations singling out religious minorities and foreigners. They included hacking to death a Hindu man, stabbing to death a Shiite preacher, murdering a Muslim villager who had been accused of converting to Christianity and sending suicide bombers into Shiite mosques.\nFor years, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, has pursued a campaign of wholesale slaughter in Syria and Iraq. And in the attacks the group has directed or indirectly inspired in Western countries \u2014 including the coordinated killings in Paris and Brussels and the mass shooting inside an Orlando, Fla., nightclub \u2014 the assailants killed at random.\nBut a closer look at the attack the Islamic State has claimed in Bangladesh \u2014 and at the fact that it has not claimed bombings attributed to it in Turkey, including the airport attack this past week \u2014 suggests a group that is tailoring its approach for different regions and for different target audiences.\n\u201cFor I.S. to maintain support among its followers and prospects, it must take different considerations into account when planning an attack in a Muslim country versus non-Muslim countries,\u201d argues Rita Katz, the director of the SITE Intelligence Group, which has tracked the group\u2019s attacks in Bangladesh. \u201cI.S. encourages the killing of random civilians in France, Belgium, America or other Western nations, but in a country like Turkey, I.S. must be sure that it isn\u2019t killing Muslims \u2014 or at least make it look like it\u2019s trying not to,\u201d she wrote in an analysis recently published online.\nThe issue of killing Sunni civilians has been a main point of contention with Al Qaeda after the Islamic State broke away from the terror network several years ago. And it surfaced again in the past week.\nAfter the triple suicide bombing at the Istanbul airport on Tuesday, a Qaeda official used Twitter to issue a stinging rebuke of the attack blamed on ISIS. \u201cThe Turkish people are Muslims, & their blood is sacred. A true mujahid would give his life up for them, not massacre them #IstanbulAttack,\u201d wrote Abu Sulayman al-Muhajir, who has been described as an Australian member of Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Syria, according to a transcript provided by SITE.\nThe Islamic State\u2019s uncharacteristic silence about the attacks in Turkey, when it tends to quickly claim bombings elsewhere, reflects the balancing act the terror group must undertake when carrying out violence in predominantly Muslim nations, analysts say.\nMs. Katz said the Islamic State \u201chas shown comparable discretion when conducting attacks in other Muslim countries, focusing on government targets, perceived religious deviants and enemy factions, as opposed to random civilians.\u201d\nFor example, when the terror group last month claimed its first bombing in Jordan, it made sure to identify its target as an American-Jordanian military base. In May, the Islamic State carried out a bombing on a Shiite mosque in Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia. And in January, when it struck in Jakarta, Indonesia, the group took pains to frame the attack as one against tourists, not locals, Ms. Katz wrote.\nThat kind of hedging is more typical of Al Qaeda, which has called on its fighters to avoid operations that would cause mass casualties among Muslim civilians.\nA visual tour of the 126 places that defined the group\u2019s territory.\nIn reality, though, Al Qaeda, like ISIS, continues to kill large numbers of Muslims in its attacks. But that has not stopped the two groups from arguing about it.\nThe disagreement dates back to at least 2005, when the then-No. 2 of Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahri, wrote a letter of complaint to the head of the group\u2019s affiliate in Iraq, chastising him for repeated attacks on Shiite shrines, which the Qaeda leadership feared would turn the population against them. The recipient of that letter was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who carried out the strikes anyway. His jihadist branch, Al Qaeda in Iraq, would years later re-emerge as the Islamic State.\nIn the years since the letter to Mr. Zarqawi, Al Qaeda went further. In one speech, Mr. Zawahri advised Qaeda fighters across the world to avoid killing religious minorities, including Christians, and to design operations that minimized Muslim casualties.\nIn 2013, when Al Qaeda loyalists stormed a BP-operated gas plant in southern Algeria, they separated their hostages by faith, releasing hundreds of Muslim workers while holding and killing the plant\u2019s Western employees, a fact they touted in an after-action report sent to a senior Qaeda leader.\nThese tactics were far from perfect: Muslims still died in the Algeria attack, and in numerous others by Al Qaeda, including in their siege that same year at a mall in Kenya, where they asked shoppers to recite Quranic scripture in an effort to separate Muslims from non-Muslims.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very stark difference in approach,\u201d says Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who studies jihadist groups. \u201cAl Qaeda wants Muslims to believe that its terrorism is morally justifiable, whereas the Islamic State argues that only its followers have moral legitimacy.\u201d\nIn the most recent attack attributed to the Islamic State, on the Holey Artisan Bakery in Bangladesh\u2019s diplomatic quarter, the attackers were more selective about their target than the Islamic State tends to be.\nThe bakery is in what expatriates affectionately call the \u201cTri-State\u201d area of Dhaka, referring to the intersection of three exclusive neighborhoods \u2014 Gulshan, Baridhara and Banani \u2014 that are popular with foreigners, said Lori Ann Walsh Imdad, a 45-year-old United States citizen who lives a block and a half from the scene of Friday\u2019s standoff. \u201cWhen you walked by, you would always see someone you recognized,\u201d she said, adding that it was founded to provide expatriates with the comfort foods they missed, including American-style bagels and cream cheese.\nOn Saturday, the Islamic State released images of the attackers, describing them as having \u201ccharged into the middle of the gathering of nationals from Crusader nations in Bangladesh.\u201d While the casualty breakdown is not yet known and it is unclear how many Muslims were killed in the attack, the group\u2019s description suggested it was eager to pass off the slaughter as aimed exclusively at non-Muslims.\nAccounts from witnesses said that some of the attackers sought to calm their hostages, calling for Bengalis to come out from hiding and explaining they were only seeking foreigners to kill. Hours later, the gunmen released a group of women who wore hijabs.\nThough ISIS may have been trying to signal restraint with its attacks in Bangladesh, its tactics are still less targeted than those of Al Qaeda, said Amarnath Amarasingam, a fellow at the George Washington University Program on Extremism.\nAl Qaeda\u2019s branch in the Indian subcontinent has focused on killing those they claim have insulted Islam, including secular bloggers.\nFor his research, Mr. Amarasingam interviewed a man he said was a member of Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in the region who derisively compared the group\u2019s handiwork to that of ISIS. \u201cAQ is targeting the best from the best. but ISIS guys killing in jungle, in village, innocent Hindu old guy etc, just to increase the number of claim,\u201d read one private message from the Qaeda member that was shared by Mr. Amarasingam."}, {"text": "Brazen Heist of Millions Puts Focus on the Philippines\n2016-03-16T21:21:13.000Z\nMANILA \u2014 It is a financial whodunit for the digital era: More than $80 million of Bangladesh\u2019s money vanished last month after it was electronically transferred out of that country\u2019s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nAs officials around the world search for the money and place blame, the caper is highlighting what looks like a weak point in the global financial system that allowed the money to get by regulators: the murky banking system of the Philippines.\nThe country\u2019s investigators are now looking into how the money came to be transferred to that Pacific nation \u2014 and what happened to it afterward. The trip, which appears to jump from Philippine banks to the country\u2019s lightly regulated casinos and then to points unknown, touches on a number of pressure points where United States officials and experts say the country is vulnerable to potential corruption and money-laundering.\nSpecifically, they point to the country\u2019s increasingly flush casino industry, which is exempt from many of the anti-money-laundering requirements in the Philippines. The Philippines also retains what one United States official once called some of the world\u2019s toughest bank secrecy laws, recalling a time before the rise of concerns about terrorism financing and tax evasion, when countries promised privacy in the hopes of becoming financial hubs.\n\u201cThey picked us to launder this money because our system is full of loopholes,\u201d Sergio R. Osme\u00f1a III, a Philippine senator who leads a committee on banks and financial institutions, said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cWe have been trying to amend these laws for decades, but we can\u2019t get it through congress.\u201d\nAlready the theft \u2014 one of the largest digital heists in history \u2014 has caused ripples round the globe. On Tuesday, Bangladesh\u2019s top central banker resigned. Bangladeshi officials have blamed their counterparts at the New York Fed.\nThe New York Fed has said that the transfer requests came through official channels and that any security breach most likely came from Bangladesh. Officials who run the global money transfer system known as Swift said its systems had not been breached and said the matter was an internal issue at Bangladesh\u2019s central bank.\nIn the Philippines, lawmakers this week questioned employees of local banks that had processed the transfers. They expressed frustration during that hearing at bank employees who declined to answer questions and cited their rights against self-incrimination.\nAt this point, it is unclear exactly what went wrong and where the system broke down. But the people behind the theft made mistakes and tripped alarms.\nIn early February, they requested that more than $100 million in money that Bangladesh keeps at the New York Fed be transferred out. On one transfer request, they misspelled the word \u201cfoundation,\u201d as \u201cfandation,\u201d putting a halt to about $20 million they tried to move to Sri Lanka.\nIt is not clear whether the New York Fed spotted the typos, or failed to spot them.\nThe culprits appear to have made off with about $81 million transferred to the Philippines, raising broader concerns about the country\u2019s financial controls.\nThe Philippines \u2014 a close American ally and a crucial part of Washington\u2019s efforts to counter China\u2019s growing regional might \u2014 has moved in recent years to bring its disclosure requirements around the movement of large funds into line with international standards. It has enacted legislation against money laundering and set up a dedicated regulatory body to handle violations.\nBut experts and American officials say it remains a difficult place to catch money launderers.\nIn a report a year ago on financial crimes, the United States Department of State cited the country\u2019s tight bank secrecy laws, a lack of regulation around casinos and difficulties faced by local regulators in watching transactions involving real estate, jewels and nonprofit groups. It said that in the first 10 months of 2014, the Philippines had one conviction and no prosecutions begun on money-laundering charges.\n\u201cThe small number of prosecutions and convictions,\u201d the report said, \u201cis telling.\u201d\nSeveral United States diplomatic cables published by the group WikiLeaks also showed frustration with the laws. \u201cThe bank secrecy laws in the Philippines are among the strictest in the world,\u201d Francis J. Ricciardone, then the United States ambassador, wrote in a 2005 cable. A successor, Kristie Kenney, said in a 2008 cable that the bank secrecy laws and poor whistle-blower protections hindered corruption and graft investigations.\nThe bank secrecy laws are a legacy of Ferdinand Marcos, the country\u2019s former dictator, who hoped they would help turn the Philippines into a financial hub. Though they were weakened in 2001 as part of an effort to fight terrorism funding, the laws still limit access by authorities without permission from the depositor.\nThe bank secrecy laws have become sticking points in corruption trials there. During his 2012 impeachment trial, Renato C. Corona, the chief justice of the country\u2019s supreme court, said he would not hand over a waiver of his bank privacy rights unless the lawmakers accusing him did the same for their own accounts. He was impeached, but he has denied the accusations of corruption.\nMore recent concern has focused on the Philippines\u2019 casinos. They are exempt from the anti-money-laundering law, meaning they are not required to report suspicious transactions.\n\u201cA good reason for targeting the Philippines could be the unusual situation where casinos have not been required to comply with the same anti-money-laundering regime that governs the banking system,\u201d said Paul Bromberg, the chief executive of Spectrum Asia, an investigative and gambling industry consultancy. \u201cOmitting the gaming industry from the formal compliance regime has been quite controversial.\u201d\nBuilt to rival Macau and other Asian gambling hubs, the Philippines\u2019 casino sector has had some success in attracting large-scale foreign investment. Three huge casino hotels have opened on the outskirts of Manila in recent years. With a required minimum investment of $1 billion each, they are the first such properties in the country to approach the size and scope of Las Vegas-style resorts.\nThe new casinos have helped to lure some high rollers, known as V.I.P. gamblers, from mainland China to the Philippines, increasing total gambling revenue to nearly $3 billion last year. That compares with about $30 billion in Macau and $5 billion in Singapore last year.\nMoney from the Bangladesh central bank ended up being transferred to one of the Philippines\u2019 newer casinos, Solaire, lawmakers learned in the hearing on Tuesday.\nIn response to questioning, Silverio Benny Tan, the corporate secretary of Bloomberry Resorts, the parent company of Solaire, said the equivalent of about $29 million was transferred in February to accounts at the casino controlled by a junket operator named Weikang Xu, according to video record of the proceedings. Junket operators are middlemen who bring high-rolling players to casinos and, especially in the case of gamblers from China, lend them money for gambling.\nMr. Xu\u2019s nationality was not clear, and he couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\nMr. Osme\u00f1a, the senator, said the operators of the casinos involved are being invited to testify at a Senate hearing on Thursday to try to trace the money.\n\u201cThe casinos here in the Philippines are a black hole,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the money goes in there, it is gone.\u201d"}, {"text": "My Father, the Editor, Under Fire\n2016-03-03T14:56:11.000Z\nI scrolled through a series of videos and images. The first one was titled \u201cConfession,\u201d and featured a newspaper editor being harangued by a talk-show host. Further down, I saw a photograph of a crowd burning an effigy of this man. There was another, a Photoshopped image of the man with devil\u2019s horns affixed to his head. Then there were the news stories, the tally of lawsuits against him rising to 30, 40, 70 cases. Finally, there was a statement from the prime minister of Bangladesh: The editor should resign and face trial.\nThe editor is my father, Mahfuz Anam, and the newspaper is The Daily Star, the English-language paper he co-founded 25 years ago.\nMy father used to joke that one of his ambitions was to open an ice-cream parlor. Instead, at the age of 41, he left a career at the United Nations to start a newspaper.\nI was 15, and we were living in Thailand at the time. Soon, we had packed up our lives and returned to our hometown, Dhaka. The newspaper was born in January 1991, just as the eight-year military dictatorship of President H. M. Ershad ended. With the onset of democracy, my father was able to return to Bangladesh and fulfill his duty to the country that he, as a freedom fighter, helped liberate 20 years before.\nWithin months of taking on the editorship of the paper, my father criticized the first democratically elected government for its failure to reach out to the opposition and create a bipartisan consensus. He then lambasted the opposition for boycotting Parliament and for resorting to general strikes as a means of protest. In a deeply divided political climate, he set the tone for independent journalism, meting out criticism for both parties if they failed to serve the greater good.\nThe Daily Star became the biggest circulation English-language daily newspaper in the country, with a sister publication in Bangla called Prothom Alo. Together, they are a major force in the independent print media and attest to the relative freedom enjoyed by the press in Bangladesh since the end of the dictatorship, something to be proud of in a region where journalists are regularly imprisoned and disappeared.\nYet my father has not been immune from the heavy hand of the state. He has faced pressure from the government, the intelligence services, the army, the police \u2014 all the institutions from which he has demanded transparency.\nAt no point was this greater than in 2007, when an army-backed caretaker government held power for two years in the run-up to national elections. During this period, the intelligence services supplied stories to the press in the form of transcripts, audiotapes and videos in which people confessed to having bribed government officials, including the Awami League leader and current prime minister, Sheikh Hasina. These reports couldn\u2019t be independently verified, but The Daily Star, along with other media outlets, ran the stories anyway.\nIn July 2007, Ms. Hasina was arrested on charges of corruption. She was detained in the grounds of the Parliament for 11 months.\nOnce the military rule ended, the witnesses who had accused Ms. Hasina recanted, claiming their stories were extracted under duress; these retractions were reported in The Daily Star. Even so, over time, my father came to regret his judgment in deciding to run the original story without corroboration; on Feb. 3, on the occasion of The Daily Star\u2019s 25th anniversary, he went on a late-night talk show and said as much.\nThe following morning, the airwaves were awash with his \u201cconfession.\u201d The son of Prime Minister Hasina, Sajeeb Wazed, called for my father\u2019s arrest on charges of treason, alleging that he was the cause of Ms. Hasina\u2019s incarceration. Since then, scores of lawsuits charging my father with criminal defamation and sedition have been lodged in courts all over Bangladesh.\nThis is only the latest chapter in the state\u2019s targeting of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo. In March 2015, The Daily Star published a photograph of a recruitment poster produced by the banned Islamist group Hizb-ut-Tahrir with the caption \u201cterrorism rears its ugly head\u201d; Ms. Hasina told Parliament that the paper had \u201chelped the radical cause\u201d by printing the photograph and the state would \u201cmove against\u201d those who had published it. In August, a sudden drop in advertising from the telecoms sector was widely believed to have been ordered by state intelligence.\nAnd now this. Doubtless, the publication of unverifiable reports based on \u201cconfessions\u201d made by people in custody \u2014 though a common media practice in Bangladesh \u2014 should be questioned, and this could be an excellent opportunity to revise journalistic practice. Instead, the state is exploiting the chance to double down on its suppression of free speech.\nWhen something like this happens to someone you love, it is difficult not to focus on his immediate safety. Yet the harassment of my father is not about the government\u2019s ire against one man, but about the stifling of the independent media in Bangladesh and the general narrowing of critical space.\nMs. Hasina herself has now gone on the record that she, too, believes the rumor that my father was behind her arrest. Rather than investigating the intelligence task force, which coerced the confessions, or the judicial process that led to the case against Ms. Hasina, or the officials involved in her arrest, the government has brought down the full force of the state on a newspaper.\nMy father sent a text message to me in London the other day. \u201cI\u2019m being sued for 17 billion dollars,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is more than the total budget of the country at independence.\u201d I hear the smile behind the words. I also feel the sadness behind the smile.\nI wonder if this is how he felt in 1958, when his father was arrested by the Pakistani military dictatorship for being a Bengali nationalist. My grandfather spent four years in jail, released only when his health had deteriorated so badly that the authorities were afraid he\u2019d die in custody.\nA year ago, the blogger and free speech activist Avijit Roy was murdered as he was leaving the Ekushey book fair. Then, we feared the violent extremists who were murdering our writers on the streets. Now, it is the state itself that is brutally suppressing political dissent. Caught between a paranoid government and the threats of violent fringe groups, the free media is the victim.\nGuiltily, I dream of that ice-cream shop, its sweet blandness, and that other life we might have had. Of course, it was never going to be. Dissent is in the blood, and now the story must be seen through.\nI fear the worst for my father. However things are resolved for him personally, his beloved country will emerge the poorer for his ordeal."}, {"text": "Corrections: July 28, 2016\n2016-07-28T05:09:26.000Z\nFRONT PAGE\nAn article on June 28 about the political muddle and rising economic fears that followed Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union referred incorrectly to Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s communication with Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, meant to ensure that Britain\u2019s exit would not endanger the fragile peace in Northern Ireland.

Human rights groups relay allegations of rape and the slaughter of children. Thousands of refugees have fled across the border to Bangladesh, while aid workers have been prevented from reaching the afflicted.\nAs the Myanmar Army unleashes a brutal counterinsurgency campaign against the Rohingya in the north, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s leader, has remained nearly silent, putting her status as an exemplar of democratic values and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate in a different light.\nHuman rights advocates accuse her of condoning a military campaign designed to drive the Rohingya, a Muslim minority in this majority-Buddhist nation, off their land in Rakhine State and out of the country. The United Nations human rights agency has said the abuses may amount to crimes against humanity.\nNow, nearly two months after the campaign began, it remains unclear what Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s plan is. She has chosen not to visit the area, close to the border with Bangladesh, which has been sealed under a military directive designed to keep out foreign aid workers and journalists.\nAnd though she has created an advisory commission headed by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, to look into long-term reconciliation in Rakhine State, she has largely defended the military\u2019s behavior.\n\u201cShow me a country without human rights issues,\u201d she said at an Oct. 12 news conference. \u201cEvery country has human rights abuses. I am taking seriously allegations of human rights violations in this country.\u201d\nA few weeks later during a visit to Tokyo, she said, \u201cWe have been very careful not to blame anyone until we have complete evidence about who has been responsible.\u201d\nThe Obama administration had hoped that once Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi came to power, the plight of the Rohingya would improve. Instead, their living conditions have deteriorated, American officials say. Near the town of Sittwe, south of where the military campaign is being carried out, more than 100,000 Rohingya live in internment camps, after their properties were demolished in communal violence in 2012.\nThe army began its campaign this fall, after it said armed men killed nine police officers on Oct. 9. But instead of retaliating against what is believed to be a small group of poorly armed Rohingya men, it has uprooted tens of thousands of impoverished civilians, most of whom lead a hand-to-mouth existence as rice farmers and petty traders.\nThe use of helicopter gunships and the \u201cwholesale burning of villages\u201d amounted to \u201cgross violations of human rights,\u201d said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an early supporter of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi.\nExperts say the army\u2019s excessive methods are adapted from British counterinsurgency tactics from the colonial era, known as the \u201cfour cuts.\u201d The military has honed those practices during decades of fighting ethnic groups in other parts of Myanmar, said U Aung Thu Nyein, director of the Institute for Strategy and Policy in Myanmar.\nThose tactics include denying armed groups access to intelligence, finance, recruits and food by pushing civilian populations away from where they usually live. About 10,000 Rohingya have struggled across the border into Bangladesh since the operation began, many of them weak after evading Bangladeshi patrols that have officially closed the border, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees said.\nThe refugees were fleeing security forces who were \u201ckilling men, shooting them, slaughtering children, raping women, burning and looting houses, forcing these people to cross the river\u201d into Bangladesh, John McKissick, the head of the agency\u2019s office in the Bangladeshi outpost, Cox\u2019s Bazaar, told the BBC last week.\nThe ultimate goal was \u201cthe ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority in Myanmar,\u201d Mr. McKissick said.\n\u201cDescriptions coming out of there are consistent with decades of abuse by the military against the Karen, Chin and Shan ethnic people,\u201d said Tyler Giannini, a professor at Harvard Law School and a co-director of its International Human Rights Clinic. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is beholden on the government to investigate what\u2019s going on against the Rohingya and hold those responsible accountable.\u201d\nAs the civilian leader of the government, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi now shares power with the military. The army controls three vital cabinet posts: defense, home affairs and border affairs. These are the ministries running the anti-insurgency operation in Rakhine State.\nMost of the information she receives on the Rohingya is from military leaders, and they have convinced her that the Rohingya in Rakhine are terrorists, analysts in Myanmar say. Her government advisers are mostly former military officers, or veteran civil servants with firm beliefs about the superiority of Buddhist values over all others, they say.\nA spokesman for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said she was \u201cstanding\u201d with the military. \u201cShe knows everything,\u201d said U Zaw Htay, the spokesman. \u201cThe military has been briefing her on every important issue.\u201d\nFurther, there is little pushback against the military from the Myanmar news media or other possible quarters of criticism, said Kelley Currie, a senior fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, a private group that promotes international security in Washington, and who regularly visits Myanmar.\n\u201c\u2018Progressive\u2019 elements have either gone silent or joined in anti-Muslim and anti-ethnic rhetoric based on information that is sole-sourced to the military,\u201d she said.\nFiona MacGregor, a reporter who wrote about alleged rapes of Rohingya women by the military for The Myanmar Times, a privately run newspaper, said she was fired after her article appeared.\nSo far, the government has declined requests to appoint an independent inquiry into the military\u2019s abuses. Instead, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is depending on the advisory commission, which does not include any Rohingya members. Mr. Annan is scheduled to visit Sittwe on Friday.\nMr. Giannini said there is enough evidence to warrant an independent commission similar to one conducted in the Darfur region of Sudan under the auspices of the United Nations in 2004. That inquiry found the Sudanese military had committed war crimes and referred the matter to the International Criminal Court.\nSatellite images reviewed by Human Rights Watch captured over four days in November showed that entire villages in Rakhine State had been razed and more than 1,250 buildings were destroyed by fire, said Matthew Smith, chief executive of Fortify Rights, a group that specializes in the Rohingya.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve steadily received allegations of mass rape of Rohingya women and girls by army soldiers,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cWith a gun to his head, one man was reportedly forced to watch as soldiers raped his 14-year-old daughter.\u201d\nAbout 30,000 men, women and children are in \u201cdesperate need\u201d of food, shelter and medical care, said Vivian Tan, a spokeswoman for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. About 160,000 vulnerable people have been cut off from health care, school feedings and maternal care, she said.\nMost of the aid workers who should be tending to the displaced have been forced to leave the area and have been refused travel permits to return, Mr. Smith said. The office of the state counselor, which Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi presides over, is in charge of travel permits for the Rakhine region.\nOf 26 workers distributing aid before Oct. 9, only six were still there, he said.\nLike many who admired Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s steadfastness during 15 years of house arrest under the former junta, Mr. Giannini, the Harvard Law professor, said he was baffled by her failure to speak out.\n\u201cShe says she is a politician,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou can have politics and you can have protection of the civilian population at the same time.\u201d"}, {"text": "At Sydney Restaurant, Stars Are on the Plate\n2016-01-04T15:46:42.000Z\nPlenty of restaurants draw a crowd, not because of their cuisine but because of their star-studded clientele. At trendy Bang in the Surry Hills neighborhood of Sydney, a message atop the menu announces that the place is a \u201cfavourite of celebrities.\u201d But that does not mean diners are in for great people-watching at the risk of a lackluster meal.\n\u201cThe line is meant to be tongue-in-cheek,\u201d said Nicholas Gurney, who opened the restaurant last January with Tapos Singha, its chef, who is a Bangladesh native. \u201cSince it\u2019s not the sort of place where celebrities flock, we thought it was funny.\u201d\nLucky for these two, noncelebrities have flocked for the real attraction: the A-list dishes put out by Mr. Singha that celebrate the street food of his youth. He always adds a twist, as in his favorite, inspired by the spicy omelets he ate as a child: a duck egg version with blue swimmer crabs, green chiles, grape tomatoes and garlic chives. Or a wagyu tri-tip curry with chive flowers and shatkora. The rind of that last ingredient, a citrus fruit from Bangladesh, gives the dish a slightly sour flavor.\nStaff uniforms are equally distinctive.\n\u201cIn Sydney, the trend is for waiters to wear white T-shirts and neutral aprons,\u201d Mr. Gurney said. \u201cBut we wanted to counter that with a more unique look.\u201d\nAnd so, servers scurry from the open kitchen to the cluster of two dozen or so tables in T-shirts emblazoned with the image of a Bengal tiger. The animal\u2019s colors carry over into the design of the high-ceiling dining room as well, which is accented with black, white and orange.\nTables are close enough that it\u2019s most fun to order by simply spying what\u2019s on someone else\u2019s plate then asking the waiter about it. This approach will likely lead to a dish of Bang Bhaji: supercrisp kale fritters that don\u2019t crumble on the way from plate to mouth as so many do. (The secret is chickpea batter.)\nFrom there, it is best to keep peeking around until you spot your next course. And if it just so happens to be the likes of Russell Crowe at a nearby table, you may be too busy focusing on what he\u2019s eating to notice that there is a bona fide Australian celebrity in your midst."}, {"text": "What Does Your Playlist Say About You?\n2016-05-08T12:02:07.000Z\n(Race/Related is a newsletter exploring race with reporting, essays, art and discussion. You can receive it via email.)\nEarle M. Lacey, my father, played an upright bass in a jazz band in the 1950s, and when he listened to jazz he tuned out all the other instruments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the bass,\u201d he would frequently tell me. \u201cBoom, boom, boom; boom, boom, boom, boom.\u201d\nNo offense to the trumpeters, the saxophonists, or the vocalists out there \u2014 you\u2019re all essential \u2014 but focusing on the very heartbeat of a song, or anything else for that matter, isn\u2019t bad advice. His battered bass is now in my living room and I can\u2019t listen to jazz without thinking about him, a black musician in an interracial band in the days of segregation.\nMusic often speaks to our identities and memories. This week, that\u2019s Race/Related\u2019s focus.\nYou\u2019ll hear from a New York Times reporter, David Gonzalez, who connected with his father, who was from Puerto Rico, through his father\u2019s love of boleros; and from Shreeya Sinha, a Times editor who is a digital storyteller by day and an aspiring D.J. by night.\nHer musical tastes are as global as she is \u2014 an Indian millennial who grew up in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, among other places \u2014 but she believes an uncomfortable confrontation with a neighbor would have been avoided if she were more into pop.\nWe\u2019re also featuring a Spotify playlist of songs from Race/Related readers and contributors. When the Times newsroom starts to get to me, I sometimes pop on headphones and listen to Bob Marley\u2019s first No.1 hit, \u201cSimmer Down.\u201d We asked the executive editor Dean Baquet, who comes from a long line of New Orleans jazz musicians but describes himself as a failed trumpet player, to weigh in on his favorite song, too.\n\u2013 Marc Lacey\n_____\nMy earliest memory of being alive comes with its own soundtrack. My father, Pedro, used to sit with his battered guitar by the window of our first-floor apartment in the Bronx and slowly pluck out the songs he had learned decades earlier in Puerto Rico.\nThey were romantic boleros, filled with melancholy and heartbreak, or traditional aguinaldos from his own rural childhood in Caguas.\nGod, I hated those songs.\nDuring the 1960s, when Puerto Ricans were depicted as knife-wielding know-nothings who would be the downfall of the South Bronx, the last thing I wanted to hear was some corny music that reminded me of where my parents were from. Besides, by the end of that decade I was too enamored of Jimi Hendrix, Creedence and The Guess Who to even give a second thought to papi\u2019s music. So while he tried once to teach me guitar, all I ever learned to play were records.\nA few weeks ago, I was driving by Van Cortlandt Park on a sunny morning when one of those old songs popped up randomly. I only had to hear a few notes from the lead guitar to know it was \u201cNoche de Ronda\u201d by D\u00fao P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez, one of papi\u2019s favorite groups. With flowery, poetic lyrics, they declared loyalty to a vanished lover, vowing to wait until death.\nWaiting. Maybe that was also a theme of papi\u2019s life. He had come here as a teenager to work in factories where, in time, he would lose most of two fingers on his playing hand. No longer able to play leads, he switched to rhythm. He didn\u2019t really talk about that. Nor did he talk much about Puerto Rico, having only gone back to visit once in the mid-1940s after he married my mother.\nMusic was the link to the island he left behind. Along with his brother Eusebio, and Luis Reyes, a family friend, they would break out the guitars to perform the music of their youth.\nTo look back on them now \u2014 in a 1950s picture my sister Alice found \u2014 was a revelation. During the week, they toiled in factories or as janitors. But on the weekends, they stood proudly, one foot on a chair, dressed in jackets and ties, flanked by their wives who were just as dolled up.\nThere are things you do to feed your family, and there are things you do to feed your soul. Papi\u2019s music was his sustenance in a foreign land. No matter what happened on the streets of the South Bronx, inside those living rooms they had recreated a bit of Puerto Rico. They could perform magic, coaxing from their guitars sounds that transported them and kept them alive, even if for many of them the toll of life here would lead to early graves.\nPapi was no exception. He was 59 when he died on March 12, 1980, after having been diagnosed months earlier with lung cancer. Soon after his death, I was at a record store on Broadway, where I spied a cassette of boleros. I bought it, went home and started listening.\nAll I could do was cry. In an instant, my mind was flooded with images from those old house parties: the sounds of guitars, the garlicky smell of pernil in the oven, my uncle Juan with his stogie clenched in his teeth. I recalled my father, sitting by the window on Beck Street, humming to himself as he played, slapping the guitar to keep time.\nIn the years since then, I have bought tons of that old music. Now, just as papi\u2019s music kept a part of Puerto Rico close to him, it now keeps part of him close to me.\nGod, I love those songs.\n\u2013 David Gonzalez\n_____\n\u201cI hate to be a pain,\u201d said the angry, handwritten note slipped under the door of my New York apartment by a neighbor, \u201cbut frankly, you are being a pain.\u201d\nSquabbles between neighbors are nothing new but I had one I\u2019ll never forget after I temporarily moved into a small studio in a fancy building on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.\nAnyone who knows me knows I love music. My taste is eclectic. I played in my school\u2019s jazz band while living in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas, love the rapper Nas and can get lost in house music, the pulsating bass and tribal rhythms mixed with R&B, soul, funk and all that good stuff.\nThough the music is big and bumpy, I tried to be tame and respectful. A little music in the morning and evening but not after 10 p.m. I kept the volume low.\nOne night, just before 10 p.m., I heard a succession of bangs on my door and low-grade yelling for at least 10 minutes. As a single woman living in New York, I was not about to open the door. I figured it was a drunk guy knocking at what he thought was his ex\u2019s place.\nOn another night, I got a normal knock on the door. It was Will from security telling me my neighbor had complained about the noise. I invited Will in to listen himself. He agreed it wasn\u2019t loud and I considered the case closed but I kept hearing bangs, now through the wall.\nThe next time I saw my neighbor, who was white and in his early 50s, I politely introduced myself, and asked that we work out a solution. He got aggressive quick. He said he would complain, night or day, if he heard any music from my apartment. He even threatened to make sure I couldn\u2019t renew my lease. His wife, standing nearby, added, \u201cSo what do you even do?\u201d She seemed surprised that a short Indian girl who liked electronic music could actually be an editor at The New York Times.\nI continued trying to pacify the situation. Eventually, he acknowledged that it was not so much the volume, but the music itself. \u201cHow can anyone like that music?\u201d he asked me.\nTo be neighborly, I told him I\u2019d tone it down even more. I put away the subwoofer and bought a portable, wireless speaker.\nThat\u2019s when the note came:\n\u201cIn the event you are not aware of the bass from your apartment. It is better than it was, but it is still TORTURE!!!. Your enjoyment is to my detriment. IT IS NOT FAIR + UNACCEPTABLE. Technology can improve this situation. You still need to improve the situation. I hate to be a pain but frankly, you are being a pain. My tolerance is waning. Do something ASAP.\u201d\nLiving in New York forces a certain level of tolerance when it comes to music. (I once lived next to an opera singer.) I wondered whether this man was discriminating against the genre and formed an opinion about the sort of person I was for liking it. I decided to move elsewhere, to Brooklyn, and still wonder if what I faced was musical profiling.\n\u2013 Shreeya Sinha\n_____\nWe couldn\u2019t do a music issue without a playlist.

But they provoke memories for me that are certainly about race, memories of dimly lit house parties in working class New Orleans neighborhoods like Vascoville, which we called Boscoville, for obvious reasons. Of course everyone there was black.

Government officials in the United States and South Korea have blamed those attacks on North Korea, though they have not provided independent verification.\nOn Thursday, the Symantec researchers said they had uncovered evidence linking an attack at a bank in the Philippines last October with attacks on Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam in December and one in February on the central bank of Bangladesh that resulted in the theft of more than $81 million.\n\u201cIf you believe North Korea was behind those attacks, then the bank attacks were also the work of North Korea,\u201d said Eric Chien, a security researcher at Symantec, who found that identical code was used across all three attacks.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen an attack where a nation-state has gone in and stolen money,\u201d Mr. Chien added. \u201cThis is a first.\u201d\nThe attacks have raised alarms in the global banking industry because the thieves gained access to Swift, a Brussels-based banking consortium that runs what is considered the world\u2019s most secure payment messaging system. Swift\u2019s system is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money from one country to another \u2014 one reason that it is a tempting target for criminals.\nSwift has warned publicly that the attacks are part of a broad coordinated assault on banks, though it has not assigned blame. It has also emphasized that it was the banks\u2019 connection points to its network \u2014 and not the core Swift messaging network itself \u2014 that the attackers were able to breach. Also, American bankers have noted that the security lapses all occurred at banks in third-world countries, which may give some comfort to banking customers in the United States.\nSecurity researchers and American government officials have tied thousands of attacks to nations in the past. They have linked the United States and Israel to an attack that destroyed Iranian centrifuges, and the Chinese military and contractors to attacks that stole military and trade secrets from thousands of foreign entities.\nBut the latest spate of attacks on banks in Bangladesh and Southeast Asia would be the first time, security researchers say, that a nation has used malicious code to steal purely for financial profit.\nThe idea that Pyongyang had turned to digital theft would not be surprising. North Korea\u2019s economy has been ravaged by sanctions, food shortages and other deprivations. Pyongyang does not publish economic data, but estimates have put North Korea\u2019s gross domestic product between $12 billion and $40 billion, tiny when compared with South Korea\u2019s economic output of more than $1.4 trillion.\nIn the attack at Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in February, the thieves tried to transfer $1 billion in funds from an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Fed officials became suspicious of the some of requested transfers and released only $81 million to accounts in the Philippines.\n\u201cIf you presume it\u2019s North Korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Chien said. \u201cThis is not small change for them.\u201d\nSymantec researchers said it was possible that the bank in the Philippines containing the North Korean code was also involved in the Bangladesh bank scheme and the attempted breach on the Vietnamese bank. The researchers would not identify the Philippines bank and did not say whether the thieves had been successful in transferring funds. Researchers were able to confirm only that the attackers had managed to breach the bank and install identical code strings on the bank\u2019s computer systems \u2014 the same code that they discovered in Bangladesh, Vietnam and the two previous attacks at Sony in 2014 and South Korea in 2013.\nMr. Chien noted that the attackers not only used identical numbers but wrote the code in the same, unusual sequence across all three attacks.\nMr. Chien said the evidence pointed to all three attacks being the work of the \u201cLazarus Group,\u201d a name his team gave to the attackers behind the Sony and South Korean attacks.\nOfficials have pointed to North Korea\u2019s threat of \u201cmerciless countermeasures\u201d against Sony if the studio released \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a movie by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg that made fun of North Korea and includes a fictional assassination of its leader. F.B.I. analysts also note critical mistakes North Korean hackers made, such as logging into their attack servers from known North Korean Internet addresses and even logging into both their Facebook account and Sony\u2019s servers from the same computers.\nIn the months since evidence of the attacks involving the Swift network started to emerge, investigators have been looking for commonalities at numerous other potential breaches. It remains unclear whether these breaches are connected to the ones in Bangladesh and Vietnam, but they too have occurred in or around Southeast Asia.\nThere is no evidence to date that the thieves have gone after large American or European banks, though new possible attacks are being reported weekly. Last week, evidence emerged that Banco del Austro, an Ecuadorean bank, was infiltrated by hackers who were also able to sneak onto the Swift network. The thieves transferred several million dollars to accounts around the world, according to a lawsuit the bank filed in federal court in the United States against Wells Fargo, which facilitated one of the transfers.\nResearchers have yet to unearth any of the code used in the Ecuador attack, but banking analysts say it is probably no coincidence that these attacks are happening in the developing world, where security measures tend not to be as tight as they are in financial hubs like New York and London.\nSwift has issued numerous warnings in recent weeks urging banks to step up their security protocols. Analysts worry that the breaches could have a chilling effect on global finance; larger banks may become reluctant or even refuse to transact with smaller banks in the developing world unless they can have assurances that their networks have not been compromised by thieves and malware.\nAt a conference on Tuesday in Brussels, Swift\u2019s chief executive, Gottfried Leibbrandt, said the recent attacks could do far more damage than breaches on retailers and telephone companies, which he said suffer largely reputational and legal hits.\n\u201cBanks that are compromised like this can be put out of business,\u201d Mr. Leibbrandt said.\nNorth Korea has long been known for creative attempts to generate badly needed hard currency. In the last decade, United States government officials accused North Korea of counterfeiting $100 bills, which were known as \u201csuperdollars\u201d or \u201csupernotes\u201d because the fakes were nearly flawless. The Federal Reserve began thwarting that effort by circulating a new $100 bill over the last three years that makes counterfeiting nearly impossible: The redesigned $100 is easier to authenticate and harder to replicate.\n\u201cNorth Korea is hurting for money,\u201d said Herb Lin, the senior research scholar for cyberpolicy and security at Stanford University\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation and a fellow at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution. \u201cThey\u2019ve been cut out of the financial system because of sanctions. They had been among the best counterfeiters in the world, and only recently have they been stymied in the counterfeiting of superdollars. If it\u2019s true that we\u2019ve cut them off from that, then it\u2019s not at all surprising that they would turn to something else.\u201d"}, {"text": "Lending a Hand (and Fingers, and Fingertips) to Myths\n2016-11-03T21:50:59.000Z\nThe man in the photograph at right is angled slightly to one side, his arm curved and his fingers \u2014 held together, sharply separated from the thumb \u2014 pointing down into what appears to be an upside-down fish. Above him floats a bee, and a snake curls languorously over a branch, appearing to watch his activities with interest.\nAt this moment in Akram Khan\u2019s \u201cChotto Desh,\u201d the man is playing a small boy who has set off into the forest, searching for honey though it is forbidden by the gods to take it. It\u2019s a mythical tale, part of the simple story that Mr. Khan \u2014 a British choreographer of Bangladeshi origin \u2014 tells in this work for children that opens at the New Victory Theater on Friday.\nIn a phone interview Mr. Khan explained the origins of \u201cChotto Desh\u201d (\u201csmall homeland\u201d in Bengali), and talked about the kind of physicality he explores in the piece, which he and the children\u2019s theater director Sue Buckminster adapted from his \u201cDesh\u201d (2011).\nThe movement is strongly focused on gestures and the hands. \u201cIn Western dance,\u201d he said, \u201cgesture tends to stop at the wrists, but in Indian dance, which I trained in first, hand positions and gestures have highly codified meanings. The energy is in the fingers and even the fingertips, and the hands are always in use.\u201d\nAnd because the work is for children, Mr. Khan said, he kept everything \u201cvery clear and deliberate, specially in this section where you have the lovely line drawings of the animals, which also have very specific shapes.\u201d\nThe story begins when a man (played at separate performances by Dennis Alamanos or Nicolas Ricchini) can\u2019t unlock his cellphone and rings a help line. A 12-year-old boy in Bangladesh answers his call, and their conversation takes the man back to his childhood holidays there, and to memories of his grandparents, the stories they told him, and his conflicted relationship with his father.\nThe story in the picture, about the boy discovering honey in forest, is one the central character has learned from his grandmother. (The fable was written by Karthika Nair, who has collaborated with Mr. Khan on several projects.)\n\u201cHe wants to take the honey, but is told that he can\u2019t take food until it is ready,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cIt is a little like \u2018The Jungle Book,\u2019 which I loved as a child. But it\u2019s also about the clash between nature, which has its own time, and humans, whose sense of timing is different. We want things fast, and that\u2019s not always right.\u201d\nMr. Khan said that he felt the themes of identity, exclusion and belonging in \u201cChotto Desh\u201d were more relevant than ever, and that it was important for children to understand the issues. \u201cWe are all migrants if you go back, often just a little way, and we can easily forget it,\u201d he said."}, {"text": "One Man in Italy Begs for Asylum, and Another Decides His Fate\n2016-12-10T18:30:58.000Z\nROME \u2014 Traffic noise floated through an open window as a Bangladeshi migrant named Nanue Matabor took a seat inside a tiny immigration office in central Rome. Only 19, Mr. Matabor had waited months for this hearing. He was asking for the right to remain in Europe. His life was in the balance. He stared at the floor, terrified.\nFirst came the formalities. Mr. Matabor speaks only Bengali, so an interpreter explained the asylum system to him \u2014 and the possibility that his application could be denied. Then basic questions: Was his name spelled correctly? Was his birth date correct? Did he belong to a certain Bangladeshi ethnic group?\n\u201cI\u2019m an orphan,\u201d Mr. Matabor replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know my ethnic group.\u201d\nFor the next 46 minutes, Mr. Matabor sat inside one of Rome\u2019s Territorial Commissions for the Recognition of International Protection and pleaded for asylum to an audience of one \u2014 a smartly dressed Italian civil servant named Giorgio De Francesco. One man asking for protection; another man charged with deciding his fate.\nAcross the world, more than 65 million people migrated to escape conflict, hardship or persecution last year, either inside their own countries or across borders, the most since World War II. More than one million refugees arrived in Europe on smuggler boats, a fourfold increase from the previous year, as record numbers also applied for asylum \u2014 an exodus that has continued this year.\nBut having made it to Europe, many migrants face the challenge of proving they qualify to stay. Public attitudes have hardened against them. Most European economies remain weak and unable to absorb new workers.\nAsylum systems in countries like Italy are overwhelmed, and some nations are tightening their requirements. Simply being from a poor or war-torn place is generally not enough. This fall, for example, the European Union reached an agreement with Afghanistan to send back home tens of thousands of Afghan migrants who had reached Europe.\nFor the moment, a hierarchy of human misery prevails: People fleeing well-defined conflicts, like the civil war in Syria, or oppressive states, like Eritrea, have a far higher chance of success, while the fate of many others can hinge on their individual stories.\nMr. De Francesco\u2019s job amounts to parsing the misery, picking winners and losers from a pool of applicants who had lost so much already.\nIn early May, Mr. De Francesco was busy as I sat in his hearing room and listened to Mr. Matabor tell his life story. Usually, asylum hearings are confidential, but Italy\u2019s Interior Ministry allowed me to attend nearly a dozen hearings this spring so long as I had the permission of the applicants. I then kept up with those applicants as they waited for answers.\nOne Nigerian man, Franck Iyanu, described how thugs had killed his brother as his stepfather tried to steal his land. He feared the police as much as his stepfather.\nOne afternoon, three Syrian families appeared \u2014 part of a group of Syrians whom Pope Francis had brought to Rome from a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. I was one of the reporters traveling with Francis on that trip in April, and the Syrians had clambered onto the papal plane, dazed by their good fortune. Now, I unexpectedly met them again in the hearing room.\nDuring his hearing, Mr. Matabor described growing up illiterate in a Bangladeshi orphanage until a family informally adopted him. But the parents died, and he lived with his adoptive brother, a figure in opposition politics. Men came looking for the brother and instead found Mr. Matabor, beating him unconscious and threatening to kill him.\nMr. Matabor borrowed money, fled to Libya and worked in a hotel. The hotel was destroyed in Libya\u2019s civil war. He escaped on a smuggler boat and arrived in Italy last year. In his absence, his young wife in Bangladesh had given birth to his son. He has never met the baby.\n\u201cThey will kill me,\u201d Mr. Matabor said, explaining what would happen if he went back to Bangladesh. \u201cThey want to find my brother, but they will kill me for revenge.\u201d\nMr. De Francesco listened quietly, typing notes on his computer until the hearing ended and he hit a button. The printer whirred to life, spitting out three pages.\nThose pieces of paper represented Mr. Matabor\u2019s old life, and would be added to his official application for a new one. He signed his name, and later that day Mr. De Francesco presented the case for a vote to the five-member asylum commission he oversees.\nThe odds were not good: Nearly two-thirds of asylum applicants in Italy are refused asylum or lower levels of protection. Mr. Matabor\u2019s answer would not come until October.\nDuring one of his worst days, Mr. De Francesco walked to Piazza della Minerva. There, surrounded by the decaying grandeur of the ancient city, he said, he nearly broke down after hearing the case of a Nigerian woman.\n\u201cShe had suffered a lot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cShe had lost her parents. Her family had mistreated her.\u201d He needed to step away to compose himself because he knew he would have to vote against her, and that her application would be denied. \u201cThese are not things that qualify you for international protection,\u201d he said.\nRefugees have always existed, but the right to asylum was established by the United Nations as a response to the Holocaust and the aftermath of World War II. Under the 1951 Refugee Convention, a refugee was defined as someone who had been persecuted, or had a reasonable fear of persecution, because of race, religion, ethnicity, membership in a certain group or political views.\nMr. De Francesco, 52, grew up in Rome as part of the post-World War II generation, born when an optimistic Europe was rebuilding and the political integration of the Continent was considered the best safeguard against another apocalyptic conflict. He \u201cdreamed of a united Europe, like a federation of states.\u201d\nTrained as a lawyer, Mr. De Francesco spent years in Italy\u2019s Interior Ministry, writing legislation for Parliament. But as he watched the arrival of migrants stir a political crisis in Europe, Mr. De Francesco requested a transfer to the overworked asylum system.\n\u201cThe refugee problem is a real emergency,\u201d he said.\nNow Mr. De Francesco worries that public anxiety over migration is threatening the ideals of the European project. Denmark introduced a much-criticized measure allowing the authorities to seize cash and valuables such as jewelry and wedding rings from asylum seekers as payment for housing them.\nItaly has led the rescue efforts of migrants in the Mediterranean. Yet a July poll by the Pew Research Center found that more than 60 percent of Italians were worried that refugees would increase the risk of terrorism, and even more thought refugees could become an economic burden on the country.\nLast year, Italy registered about 83,200 new asylum applications, the highest number ever recorded. Overwhelmed, the Interior Ministry rapidly expanded the number of commissions hearing asylum cases to 48, from only 20 two years ago.\nYet the question is as much about the quality of the commissions as the quantity, as inconsistencies plague asylum systems in Italy and across Europe.\n\u201cThe same case can be presented in Britain, and in Italy, and in Germany, and in France \u2014 and there could be four different results,\u201d said Bruce Leimsidor, an expert on European asylum law at Ca\u2019 Foscari University in Venice. \u201cThe same case could be presented to four different commissions in Italy, and you could get four different results.\u201d\nTo keep pace with an unceasing workload, the five members of Mr. De Francesco\u2019s commission hear cases separately and then present their findings on each case to the full commission for a vote.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have only one person deciding the life of someone else,\u201d said Mario Morcone, the Interior Ministry official who oversees the immigration system.\nYet for now, that is close to the reality \u2014 as well as Mr. Francesco\u2019s burden. \u201cI know I will apply the law well,\u201d Mr. De Francesco said.\n\u201cBut there are certain human cases that don\u2019t fall under the right categories. That hits me hard. That is the hardest thing to do.\u201d\nOn the morning of May 6, I sat in the asylum hearings of some of the Syrians whom Pope Francis had brought to Rome. For Mr. De Francesco, the Syrians fell directly in the \u201cright categories.\u201d One woman, Wafaa Eid, reached into her bag and presented her Syrian identity card and a packet of documents, which included a short statement of support from the pope.\nDressed conservatively in a head scarf and knee-length black sweater, Ms. Eid spoke of how she had fled the outskirts of Damascus with her family and then paid a smuggler in Turkey for passage to Greece. There, to her surprise, the pope scooped them up.\n\u201cIf we returned to Syria,\u201d she said, \u201cwe would no longer have a home, and we wouldn\u2019t know where to go.\u201d\nSome asylum hearings last hours. This one lasted 26 minutes.\n\u201cVery good,\u201d Mr. De Francesco said.\nMs. Eid jumped out of her chair.\n\u201cThank you! Thank you very much!\u201d she said, giddy and smiling.\nFew people have endured more misery and death in recent years than the Syrians, and earning asylum is mostly a foregone conclusion for them. In Italy, about 90 percent of Syrians were granted protection during the first five months of this year.\n\u201cFor everyone coming from Syria \u2014 if we are sure they are coming from Syria \u2014 they deserve protection,\u201d Mr. De Francesco told me.\nLess easily classified are the situations in Nigeria, Gambia, Bangladesh and so many of the countries that are the biggest suppliers of migrants into Italy. Only 2 percent of Nigerian applicants were granted refugee status during the first five months of this year (though others did receive lower levels of protection).\nMany of these people had been working in Libya during the long dictatorship of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, when the country was a destination for laborers from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. But with Libya now in chaos, those workers are fleeing to Italy.\nSome scholars argue that the definition of a refugee is outdated and should be re-examined. Traditionally, people who leave a country because of poverty are deemed \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d and do not qualify for asylum.\nBut new factors, intertwined with poverty, are pushing people to leave, like weak governance or a lawlessness that invites impunity.\n\u201cWe have a shifting dynamic, where more and more people are fleeing countries that are fragile,\u201d said Alexander Betts, a migration expert at the University of Oxford. \u201cCollectively, the world has a real challenge in how we categorize people who cross international borders.\u201d\nDr. Betts added: \u201cWe will see displacement and mobility as defining issues of the 21st century.\u201d\nNanue Matabor, pen in hand, stared blankly at a piece of paper. He was failing Italian class. A teacher stood at the other end of the long table prepping Chinese and African students for an exam. One of Mr. Matabor\u2019s classmates, a migrant from Mali, leaned over and jabbed his finger at the empty paper.\n\u201cScrivi,\u201d the man said in Italian. Write.\nMr. Matabor cannot read or write in Bengali, and his teacher told me that he was often absent from class. The humiliation of trying to learn a second language when you can only speak your first apparently discouraged him.\nIt was June, more than a month since the hearings, and I had gone to Tuscany to visit some of the asylum seekers I had met in Rome. They were living in reception centers run by charities and private entrepreneurs, and studying Italian. But mostly they waited for word on their asylum application.\n\u201cEat, sleep, eat, sleep,\u201d Mr. Iyanu, one of the Nigerians, said in frustration, describing his daily routine.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know when they will call me. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nMr. Matabor lived in a reception center in the town of Calenzano, not far from Florence, which was run by Caritas, the Catholic charity. Forty migrants slept on bunk beds and took meals of pasta and salad on plastic plates. For midday prayers, Mr. Matabor and other Muslims spread small rugs or towels on the hallway floor. A dirt backyard served as a truncated soccer pitch.\nBarely three years ago, Italy\u2019s asylum system accommodated about 27,800 people as they waited for resolution of their cases. Today, there are nearly 176,700.\nFor migrants, it is a crapshoot. Some are placed in well-run centers that provide good services and help them prepare for asylum hearings. Others are not. Some have their asylum hearings before well-trained commissions. Others do not.\nA denial of asylum is not an end to the process. A person can choose to appeal in the Italian legal system, which could take a year or longer.\nOr a person can simply melt into the streets, without documentation, living illegally. Some have taken up drug dealing. Others sell trinkets on city streets. Still others struggle to subsist, depending on soup kitchens for meals or working illegally for small shops or factories for paltry wages.\n\u201cOne option is not to have a document and to be a slave here,\u201d Katia Fitermann, a counselor who works with Mr. Matabor and other migrants. \u201cThey get paid two euros an hour. You come out of one exploitative situation and you get back into another one.\u201d\nMr. Matabor understands the importance of a \u201cyes\u201d from the commission. \u201cIf they don\u2019t give me the document, and I return to Bangladesh, these political people will kill me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I stay here without a job or documents, it is like dying.\u201d\nThe first person I heard from was Patrick Yeboah, a Ghanaian who spent nearly three years working construction in Libya.\n\u201cToday is bad news for me,\u201d he said in an audio file he sent me on WhatsApp on Sept. 20. \u201cI am granted my results. It is negative.\u201d\nThe two Nigerians, Mr. Iyanu and Monday Osayomwanbor, got the same bad news. The Syrians earned full refugee protection and were settling in Rome.\n\u201cWe are happy,\u201d Ms. Eid said.\nFor Mr. De Francesco, the applicants kept coming. Since I had left his hearing room in early May, his commission had heard about 1,200 more cases.\nHe knew his job was to uphold the law but still anguished over cases where an applicant had suffered so much yet did not qualify for protection.\n\u201cThe day I no longer feel that, I\u2019ll ask to stop,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would have lost my humanity.\u201d\nFinally, on Oct. 6, I went to Florence to meet Mr. Matabor.\nAt the immigration office, Africans, Bangladeshis and Afghans loitered outside. Most of them had waited for months for an asylum decision. It took barely two minutes to receive the answer. One Moroccan woman came out sobbing. A man from Mali came out smiling.\nFinally, Mr. Matabor went inside. His wife in Bangladesh was waiting for the answer. A minute passed, maybe two, before he walked out, holding a piece of paper. As a translator spoke to other Bangladeshis, explaining the process of appeal, or how the government would buy them a ticket to return to Bangladesh, Mr. Matabor stood alone, his back turned, and quietly cried."}, {"text": "Uber Drivers Up Against the App\n2016-02-19T18:30:11.000Z\nOn Super Bowl Sunday, a few hundred Uber drivers met in the cold in a public park in Queens, plotting to disrupt the app that thousands of New Yorkers were about to use to get in place to watch the big game. Gathered angrily on rows of wooden benches were Uzbeks, Tajiks, Russians, Kenyans, Serbs and Bangladeshis, many of them waving handmade signs. Their yellow placards attacked the ride-hailing service in the innumerable languages of polyglot New York. \u201cShame on Uber!\u201d one announced in Spanish. \u201cUber Broke Our Hearts!\u201d said another in Tibetan. Then in English: \u201cWe Made You Billionaires!\u201d and \u201cWe Are Not Slaves!\u201d\nTen days earlier, Uber had reduced the drivers\u2019 rates by 15 percent, prompting protests at the company\u2019s Long Island City office as well as in a parking lot at La Guardia Airport where vehicles wait for passengers. The Super Bowl event was meant to build momentum on those actions by turning Uber\u2019s app against itself. When it was over, the drivers planned to spread throughout the city and order rides from their colleagues who were working. As cars showed up, they would pay their peers for coming, then urge them to go home in solidarity.\n\u201cWe want to show Uber that without us full-time drivers, they won\u2019t have any cars on the road,\u201d Abdoul Diallo shouted from atop a concrete stage. Mr. Diallo, a Guinean immigrant who has emerged as a leader of the strikes, was holding up his own sign: \u201cNo Drivers, No Uber \u2014 It\u2019s That Simple.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the formula!\u201d he hollered to the crowd.\n\nIt has been nearly five years since Uber arrived in New York City. With its Randian philosophy and proprietary algorithms, the company promised to reshape the driving industry, and in many ways that promise has come true. A million New Yorkers have become accustomed to making cars materialize by pulling out their smartphones \u2014 and not just in Manhattan, but also in the other boroughs, which have long been underserved by for-hire providers. In part as a result, taxi owners have seen their profits crumble, taxi lenders are slowly going under and taxi unions are scrambling to protect their members\u2019 jobs.\nMore recently, however, Uber\u2019s indomitable rise has been clouded by an insurgency from a small but vocal portion of its own drivers who say they feel neglected, even used. From spring 2014 to spring 2015, the company quadrupled its business in the city, and for nearly a year it has been signing up new customers at a rate of 30,000 a week. The drivers argue that such dynamic growth would not have been possible without them: They, after all, supply the cars that keep the network liquid. Drawn to the company by advertisements that promised decent wages, many now contend that they are victims of a corporate bait-and-switch. As Uber has obtained a solid foothold in the market (and a $60 billion valuation), the drivers are complaining that it has slashed its prices in an effort to destroy the competition and to finance its expansion on their backs.\n\u201cIn the beginning, your company was great for both drivers and customers,\u201d Mr. Diallo and his partners wrote this month in a letter to the service. \u201cYou treated drivers well and we loved you for that. Little did we know that it would be a short-lived momentary ecstasy that you used to lure us in in great numbers, just so that you can execute your plans and strategies toward world domination.\u201d\nUber, mostly through the voice of Josh Mohrer, the 33-year-old general manager of Uber New York, has said it is pained by the grievances of the drivers, who, while not employees of the service, are known as \u201cdriver-partners\u201d in the company\u2019s jargon. Like most tech operations, Uber has a data set for everything, and Mr. Mohrer said his numbers proved that January\u2019s price cut, like a steeper one two years ago, increased the demand for rides and therefore led to larger driver paychecks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not intuitive to think that lower fares will mean more money, but that is the reality,\u201d Mr. Mohrer said. He added that he understood why the drivers might be anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s a big ask to say, \u2018Just trust us.\u2019\u201d\nAnd yet there are underlying reasons for the drivers not to trust him. Uber, like other players in the gig economy, has a tenuous relationship with those who make a living from its software. Its drivers \u2014 34,000 in New York \u2014 are independent contractors who buy their own cars, pay for gas and maintenance, and provide their own insurance. Although they get no benefits, they remit to Uber 20 to 25 percent of what they make as a fee to use the service. And unlike its competitors like Lyft, Uber does not permit tipping through its app, but it still reserves the right to \u201cdeactivate\u201d its drivers, sometimes for little more than a subpar rider rating.\nTwo years ago, Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview about the company\u2019s plan to field a fleet of driverless vehicles that a reason the service was relatively expensive was that customers were paying for \u201cthe other dude in the car.\u201d As the company\u2019s ridership explodes and the investor class anticipates a potential public offering, the drivers say they often feel like just some other dude: a frictional human substance that gets in the way of an idealized experience of seamless digital travel.\n\u201cUber treats its drivers however it wants,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cBut we\u2019re the ones who do everything except provide the technology.\u201d\n\nA former import-export trader who studied for a business degree, Mr. Diallo, 29, has been driving for the company for three years in a $50,000 Chevrolet Suburban. At first, he said, the job was great: He could afford his lease and still make money because he was taking in as much as $5,000 a week.\nBut in 2014, Uber cut its rates by 20 percent and not long after that it increased its commissions. Last year, it forced new drivers working for its luxury arm, Uber Black, to pick up passengers through its less expensive option, UberX. On top of this, Mr. Diallo claimed that Uber\u2019s aggressive hiring has flooded the city with too many drivers chasing too few fares.\nThe price cuts last month were the final straw that set off the rebellion. Most of the drivers learned about the change through a company email, whose lack of warning and remoteness were softened by the fact that Uber promised, for a month, to guarantee an hourly wage at pre-cut levels. Within days of the announcement \u2014 and despite the guarantees \u2014 Mr. Diallo and two other drivers, Fabio Krasniqi and Farrukh Khamdamov, decided on a strike. Calling themselves the Uber Drivers Network, they created a Facebook page, designed a flier and paid for nearly 20,000 copies at a print shop near La Guardia.\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t make a living,\u201d Mr. Diallo said on the phone after a meeting to coordinate the New York actions with others in London and San Francisco. \u201cThey\u2019re picking up $8 fares. They\u2019re driving their cars into the ground. Collectively, there\u2019s a lot of money coming in, but no one individual is making much.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere it\u2019s literally unbearable.\u201d\nUber likes to say that its drivers, not its riders, are its customers. And while the company might not give its customers health care or a pension, it does provide them access to high-tech support centers, modeled on Apple\u2019s Genius Bars, where they can ask questions about commercial licenses, receive free medical exams or get a can of soda. Uber also helps its drivers negotiate leases with car dealers.\nThe conflict over the price cuts has been especially vexing for the company, which is adamant that the lower rates have been a boon to both the drivers and its own bottom line. Shortly after the strikers wrote to Uber, Mr. Kalanick posted a memo onto his Facebook page showing that the previous cuts had increased the average driver\u2019s gross hourly wages from $28 to $37. On Tuesday, Mr. Mohrer released numbers indicating that from the three weeks before the last round of cuts to the three weeks after, drivers\u2019 wages went up by 17 percent.\nUber also disputes the claim that there are too many drivers in New York. There are still more taxi riders that the company could woo, and, according to Mr. Mohrer, after the recent cuts were made, trips in the Bronx and Queens, where many drivers live, went up by nearly 25 percent.\nBut if all this data has the weight of scripture for Uber executives, it has been less persuasive to the drivers, who say the statistics do not fully describe the experience of working for the company. Though lower prices might increase their workload and thus their gross, they say, the increased revenue will be eroded by a corresponding increase in expenses.\nAt the Super Bowl rally, a driver named Mustafa, who declined to give his last name because he feared reprisals from Uber, said he expected to make about $40 an hour after the cuts. But that was before he paid for higher costs of maintenance, gas and washes; for his car lease, insurance and sales and income taxes; for emissions inspections and the 2.5 percent of earnings he gives each year to the Black Car Fund, a drivers\u2019 trade group, for workers\u2019 compensation; and, of course, for his commissions.\n\u201cWhen you put it together, the numbers don\u2019t add up,\u201d Mustafa said. \u201cI\u2019m taking home less than minimum wage.\u201d\nAnd beyond money, culture matters, too, the drivers say. Some mentioned a photograph that Mr. Mohrer posted on Twitter during his early days at Uber, which showed him smiling with Mr. Kalanick above a message that read, \u201cJamming with @travisk and plotting city domination.\u201d Others pointed to their own support of Uber this summer when the company went to war with Mayor Bill de Blasio, who wanted to cap its growth, ostensibly to lessen road congestion. During the fight, which it won when Mr. de Blasio dropped his plan for the cap, Uber mobilized millions of dollars and an all-star team of political tacticians, but it also made use of the sympathetic image of hard-working immigrants telling City Hall that Uber put food on the table for their families.\n\u201cWe stood behind them,\u201d said Ronnie Paulino, a driver who has worked for Uber for a year. \u201cThen they turned around and cut our pay.\u201d\n\nAfter speaking this month to an economics class at New York University, Mr. Mohrer acknowledged that when he first came to Uber, there were fewer drivers and stronger bonds between them and his management team. But as the fleet has grown, he said, he has tried to remain responsive to the drivers, who, on average, work 30 hours a week \u2014 or triple the rate of their peers in smaller cities.\n\u201cThey\u2019re more vested and engaged in Uber, so we take a more careful approach here,\u201d Mr. Mohrer said. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a deeper relationship.\u201d\nBut deeper doesn\u2019t necessarily mean easier. A few weeks ago, Mr. Mohrer met with the leaders of the strikes at his office on West 27th Street in Chelsea\u2019s gallery district. He said they had a frank discussion about the rate cuts, which could be rescinded if the cuts do not achieve their goals. While he was not explicit about what those goals might be, he insisted that the conversation had been useful. \u201cI want to do this regularly,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving drivers the opportunity to speak to me and my staff can result in more rapid change.\u201d\nThe strikers found the meeting less successful. \u201cIt was a joke,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cThey treated us like jokers.\u201d From his perspective, Mr. Mohrer offered no concessions on the cuts and was firm on only one position: that there would never be a tipping option on Uber\u2019s app.\nAnd that was the message Mr. Krasniqi delivered to the crowd in Queens on Super Bowl Sunday. Cupping his hands to his mouth, he reported on the meeting, then told the drivers to call their friends and relatives who also worked for Uber and urge them to stop driving.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we built them up \u2014 with our friends and families,\u201d Mr. Krasniqi roared. \u201cAnd if we built them up, we can destroy them!\u201d\nIt is hard to tell at this point just how serious the threat to Uber from sustained unrest would be. The challenges of organizing a work force composed of men and women of disparate ethnicities and languages loosely connected by a cloud-based app are significant. \u201cIf the drivers can come together in a block causing problems, they might get something,\u201d said Evan Rawley, a professor of strategy at the Columbia Business School who studies the taxi industry. \u201cBut this is not West Virginia coal miners who all grew up together in the same small town.\u201d\nUber has been somewhat clumsy in dealing with the problems with its fleet. In a stroke of unfortunate timing, Wired magazine published a 3,000-word treatise on Uber\u2019s new corporate logo one day after the drivers went on strike outside its New York office. It was an inadvertent study in tech-world navel-gazing: as hundreds of immigrants were splashed across the Internet attacking Uber, Wired described how Mr. Kalanick had been working for two years on the logo, immersing himself in organic color schemes and kerning.\nThere is a potential wild card: Class-action lawsuits have been filed against Uber, including in the federal courts in Brooklyn and San Francisco, which seek to make the drivers full employees. If the suits are successful, they could cripple Uber\u2019s business model, though some legal experts have said they are skeptical that the drivers could prevail when they use their own vehicles, and decide themselves when and whether to pick up passengers.\nThat leaves the traditional route of union organizing, which, in the case of the strikers in New York, has become chaotic. About a year ago, the Uber Drivers Network approached Local 1181 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, one of whose organizers has been helping them plan rallies and collect union cards. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance, an advocacy group for yellow cabdrivers, claims to have signed up nearly 5,000 Uber drivers in the city. And on Feb. 2, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1430, filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board asking to represent another 600 Uber drivers who work at La Guardia.\nMr. Diallo and his team have been working on a secret weapon: a driver-owned app to compete with those from Lyft and Uber, those from other ride-hailing companies like Gett and Via, and the taxi industry\u2019s own two e-hailing systems, Way2Ride and Arro. The drivers designed the app themselves and have hired a company called Swift Technologies to build it. It could be ready as early as next month.\n\u201cThe solution is not to stay with Uber,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cThe solution is to have our own platform \u2014 to build a real partnership and really be partners.\u201d\nFor now, however, they are still planning strikes, even if the one on Super Bowl Sunday was of questionable effectiveness. The drivers celebrated the action on their Facebook page, posting a screen shot of Uber\u2019s app that night \u2014 accompanied by the hashtag #SHUTDOWNSUPERBOWL \u2014 that showed a wait time at Kennedy Airport of 72 minutes.\nBut the very next morning, Uber sent an email to its drivers announcing that the day before, it had broken its record for the most trips on a Sunday.\n\u201cThanks to you, our driver-partners,\u201d the email read, \u201chundreds of thousands of New Yorkers moved safely around the city this weekend.\u201d"}, {"text": "Two-Thirds of the World Faces Severe Water Shortages\n2016-02-13T00:33:09.000Z\nAbout four billion people, or two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, face severe water shortages during at least one month every year, far more than was previously thought, according to Arjen Y. Hoekstra, a professor of water management at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.\nIn a paper published Friday in the journal Science Advances, Dr. Hoekstra and his colleague Mesfin M. Mekonnen designed a computer model to create what they say is a more accurate picture of water scarcity around the world. Severe water scarcity can lead to crop failure and low crop yields, which could cause food price increases as well as famine and widespread starvation.\nAn area experiences severe water scarcity when its farms, industries and households consume double the amount of water available in that area.\n\u201cThat means that groundwater levels are falling, lakes are drying up, less water is flowing in rivers, and water supplies for industry and farmers are threatened,\u201d Dr. Hoekstra said in an email.\nNot everyone would suffer equally. In more affluent countries, severe water scarcity could mean water rations for showering and gardening, while in very poor countries it could lead to shortages of drinking water.\nHalf of the four billion people who experience conditions of severe water scarcity at least one month of the year live in either China or India, Dr. Hoeskstra said. Of the remaining two billion, the majority live mostly in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, Mexico and the western and southern parts of the United States, such as California, Texas and Florida.\nPrevious studies had estimated that between 1.7 and 3.1 billion people were affected by extreme water shortages. But according to Dr. Hoekstra, those studies either used measurements that were too general in size or used yearly averages that were not as precise as monthly data.\n\u201cFreshwater scarcity is a major risk to the global economy, affecting four billion people directly,\u201d Dr. Hoekstra said. \u201cBut since the remaining people in the world receive part of their food from the affected areas, it involves us all.\u201d"}, {"text": "New York City May Double Number of Food Vendor Permits\n2016-10-11T01:31:59.000Z\nFor eight years, Julia Chimborazo has sold Italian ice on the streets of Brooklyn and Queens, doing what she can to support her two young children and send money to a third, who still lives in her native Ecuador.\nShe is part of the movable feast of street food vendors in New York City, offering a rich variety of native and innovative options, seldom from the same location. And Ms. Chimborazo, like many others, does so illegally.\nThere is a limit on the number of food carts and trucks allowed on the city\u2019s streets, and even those who have managed to secure a permit \u2014 often on the black resale market \u2014 have found that the cost and difficulty of doing business can outweigh the benefits.\nWith that in mind, the City Council intends to consider legislation that would gradually double the number of food vendor permits issued over the course of seven years, making it possible for 600 more street vendors to begin legally selling food each year.\nSince the early 1980s, the number of food vendor permits allowed by the city\u2019s health department has stayed at about 4,235, causing many vendors to turn to a black market, where two-year, full-time permits can cost up to $25,000. Vendors who obtain a two-year permit from the city pay $200 and can renew it indefinitely. Under the proposed legislation, a two-year permit would cost $1,000.\nThe legislation, called the Street Vending Modernization Act and sponsored by Melissa Mark-Viverito, the Council speaker, and at least six other members, would aim to curb the black market while boosting enforcement of regulations, especially in congested areas.\nPreference would be given to vendors on the city\u2019s waiting lists for permits; approximately 2,500 people are currently on the list for full-time permits. Thirty-five permits would be set aside for veterans and disabled people. A new dedicated vendor law enforcement unit would be created to unburden local officers from ensuring that vendor rules are followed. The bills would also refine certain outdated rules and restrictions applied to food vendors.\n\u201cIn an era of relentless gentrification, street vendors are the ultimate mom and pops,\u201d said Councilman Mark Levine, a Democrat who is sponsoring the core bills in the package being introduced at a Council meeting on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a path to entrepreneurship as long as this city has existed,\u201d Mr. Levine, who represents much of Harlem, added.\nWithout a permit, Ms. Chimborazo, 35, has had her cart taken away and has paid more than $1,300 in fines. \u201cSometimes, I don\u2019t even go outside to sell, out of fear,\u201d she said in Spanish. With a permit, she said, \u201cWe would have a better life, my kids would have more.\u201d\nSean Basinski, director of the Street Vendor Project at the Urban Justice Center, has led a campaign for the past two and a half years to eliminate the cap on food vendor permits. He estimates there are a total of 10,000 to 12,000 food vendors in the city, including those selling without permits.\nBy relieving the financial obstacles to running a food cart or truck, Mr. Basinski said, vendors would have the flexibility to offer more innovative products. A larger variety of foods would be sold in certain neighborhoods where the options are slimmer. Many Bangladeshi vendors, for example, would rather sell their food than hot dogs, Mr. Basinski said. \u201cBut they can\u2019t take that risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know hot dogs sell.\u201d\nDan Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership and the Bryant Park Management Corporation, has been a staunch opponent of increasing the number of food vendor permits. In Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Biederman said, food trucks and carts crowd sidewalks, release fumes, create loud noise from generators and more frequently skirt health codes. \u201cThe streets of New York already look bad,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to look incredibly bad if this program goes in.\u201d\nBut for Adam Sobel, the chef and owner of the Cinnamon Snail, a Vendy Award-winning food truck, a permit would allow him to expand sales of his popular vegan foods to parts of the city that lack those options. Mr. Sobel decided to shut down the bulk of his food truck operations last year, after renting a permit for five years from a man who would fly in from Pakistan to visit the health department with him. He now runs a stand, and operates a food truck at public events in New York City and New Jersey.\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to break the law,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be able to go to sleep at night and not have anxiety about getting arrested for some of my vegan sandwiches.\u201d"}, {"text": "After Attacks on Muslims, Many Ask: Where Is the Outpouring?\n2016-07-06T01:13:25.000Z\nPARIS \u2014 In recent days, jihadists killed 41 people at Istanbul\u2019s bustling, shiny airport; 22 at a cafe in Bangladesh; and at least 250 celebrating the final days of Ramadan in Baghdad. Then the Islamic State attacked, again, with bombings in three cities in Saudi Arabia.\nBy Tuesday, Michel Kilo, a Syrian dissident, was leaning wearily over his coffee at a Left Bank cafe, wondering: Where was the global outrage? Where was the outpouring that came after the same terrorist groups unleashed horror in Brussels and here in Paris? In a supposedly globalized world, do nonwhites, non-Christians and non-Westerners count as fully human?\n\u201cAll this crazy violence has a goal,\u201d Mr. Kilo, who is Christian, said: to create a backlash against Muslims, divide societies and \u201cmake Sunnis feel that no matter what happens, they don\u2019t have any other option.\u201d\nThis is not the first time that the West seems to have shrugged off massacres in predominantly Muslim countries. But the relative indifference after so many deaths caused by the very groups that have plagued the West is more than a matter of hurt feelings.\nOne of the primary goals of the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups is to drive a wedge between Sunni Muslims and the wider world, to fuel alienation as a recruiting tool. And when that world appears to show less empathy for the victims of attacks in Muslim nations, who have borne the brunt of the Islamic State\u2019s massacres and predatory rule, it seems to prove their point.\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t #PrayForIraq trending?\u201d Razan Hasan of Baghdad posted on Twitter. \u201cOh yeah no one cares about us.\u201d\nHira Saeed of Ottawa asked on Twitter why Facebook had not activated its Safety Check feature after recent attacks as it did for Brussels, Paris and Orlando, Fla., and why social media had not been similarly filled with the flags of Turkey, Bangladesh and Iraq. \u201cThe hypocrisy is the western world is strong,\u201d she wrote.\nThe global mood increasingly feels like one of atavism, of retreat into narrower identities of nation, politics or sect, with Britain voting to leave the European Union and many Americans supporting the nativist presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.\nThe violence feeds a growing impulse among many in the West to fear Muslims and Arabs, which has already prompted a political crisis over immigration that, in turn, has buttressed extremists\u2019 goals. Europe is convulsing over a movement to reject refugees from Syria and Iraq, who are themselves fleeing violence by jihadists and their own governments.\nIt is in Syria and Iraq that the Islamic State has established its so-called caliphate, ruling overwhelmingly Muslim populations with the threat of gruesome violence. The group has killed Muslims in those countries by the thousands, by far the largest share of its victims.\nWhen Islamic State militants mowed down cafegoers in Paris in November, people across the world adorned public landmarks and their private Facebook pages with the French flag \u2014 not just in Europe and the United States, but also, with an empathy born of experience, in Syria and Iraq.\nBut over the past week, Facebook activated its Safety Check feature, which allows people in the vicinity of a disaster to mark themselves safe, only after the attack on the Istanbul airport.\nThe flags of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Bangladesh have not been widely projected on landmarks or adopted as profile pictures. (Photographs on social media showed that in Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of Europe\u2019s two majority-Muslim countries, the Turkish flag was beamed onto a bridge in Mostar, the scene of sectarian killings in the 1990s.) Some wonder if part of the reason is that three of those flags bear Islamic symbols or slogans.\n\u201cMore deaths in Iraq in the last week than Paris and Orlando combined but nobody is changing their profile pics, building colours, etc.,\u201d Kareem Rahaman wrote on Twitter.\nThere are some understandable reasons for the differing reactions. People typically identify more closely with places and cultures that are familiar to them. With Iraq, there is also a degree of fatigue, and a feeling that a bombing there is less surprising than one in Europe.\nDeadly attacks have been a constant in Iraq after years of American occupation, followed by a sectarian war in which Sunni and Shiite militias slaughtered civilians of the opposite sect. Still, while terrorist attacks in Europe may feel more surprising to the West \u2014 though they have become all too common there, too \u2014 that does not explain the relative indifference to attacks in Istanbul, Saudi Arabia or Bangladesh.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens in Iraq,\u201d Sajad Jiyad, a researcher in Iraq who rushed to the scene of the Baghdad bombing and found that one of his friends had died there, wrote on his own blog. \u201cDeaths become just statistics, and the frequency of attacks means the shock doesn\u2019t register as it would elsewhere, or that you have enough time to feel sad or grieve.\u201d\nIn the Muslim world, the partly sectarian nature of some conflicts shades people\u2019s reactions, producing a kind of internal sympathy gap. People from one sect or political group often discount or excuse casualties from another.\nIn Iraq, the Islamic State took root within an insurgency against the country\u2019s Shiite-led government, and Shiite militias fighting it have been accused of brutality as well. In Syria, it is just one menace; many more Syrians have been killed by the government\u2019s attacks on areas held by Sunni insurgents, including rebel groups opposed to the Islamic State.\nMr. Jiyad added that the Islamic State was \u201choping to incite a reaction and a spiral into endless violence,\u201d and that Iraqis played into that when they mourned more for their own sect than for others.\nIn the West, though, there is a tendency in certain quarters, legitimized by some politicians, to conflate extremist Islamist militants with the Muslim societies that are often their primary victims, or to dismiss Muslim countries as inherently violent.\n\u201cEither Iraqi blood is too cheap or murder is normalized,\u201d Sayed Saleh Qazwini, an Islamic educator in Michigan, wrote on Twitter.\nIn Paris, a rainbow flag hangs on the Hotel de Ville, memorializing the 49 people gunned down at a gay nightclub in Orlando last month. But in a corner shop on Monday, the woman who served me had no such sympathy for the Middle East.\nWhen she asked where I lived, and I told her Beirut, Lebanon, she exclaimed about the violence in the region. Struggling to explain that there is a lot more than just violence happening there, I said: \u201cYes, there are a lot of problems. What can one do?\u201d\n\u201cExterminer les islamistes,\u201d she said grimly. Exterminate: a strong word. Islamists: a broad category of people.\nMr. Kilo, who spent years in the prisons of the Syrian government and opposes both it and the Islamic State, said his life in Paris had changed since November. Speaking Arabic is now suspect. He sees fear in French people\u2019s eyes when they see Syrians.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid, too,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone could blow himself up anytime.\u201d\nHe has written an article that will be published in the newspaper Al Araby Al Jadeed, titled \u201cThe Curse of Syria.\u201d\nThe failure of empathy is broader than the Islamic State, he said; it extends to the international community\u2019s unwillingness or inability to stop the slaughter of the Syrian civil war, which began with protests for political change.\n\u201cIf we lose all humanity,\u201d Mr. Kilo said, \u201cif you allow the slaughter of a nation for five and a half years, after all the leaders of the international community declared the right of these people to revolt against their government, then expect Islamic State \u2014 and many other Islamic States in other forms and shapes.\u201d"}, {"text": "Snacks of Nepal Are a High Point at Woodside Cafe in Queens\n2016-09-08T17:25:31.000Z\nThe momos are giants, fat round dumplings with furrowed peaks, rising from a pink-orange sauce the color of penne alla vodka. It tastes a little like penne alla vodka, too, oddly, inexactly and wonderfully \u2014 marinara meets tikka masala, with momos as tortelloni writ large.\nThe awning outside Woodside Cafe, on Broadway in Woodside, Queens, promises \u201cItalian, American, Nepali, Indian Food.\u201d Such a combination may be unique in New York, if not Kathmandu, Nepal, where #pastamomo is an Instagram hashtag. (Another, unrelated Woodside Cafe, a half-mile away on Woodside Avenue, offers a different kind of fusion: American diner and Irish pub.)\nCustomers sometimes speculate that this Woodside Cafe was once a wholly Italian restaurant, quietly subsumed by a Nepalese chef who kept making Italian dishes to placate regulars, stealthily dropping them from the menu over time. In fact, the chef, Purushotam Khadgi, ran an Italian-Nepalese restaurant in Kathmandu, his hometown, and cooked at an Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side for 14 years.\nMr. Khadgi came to New York in 1995; his wife, Shova, who ran a Nepalese restaurant of her own back home, and their four sons, Pradeet, Prasant, Pratap and Prassida, joined him 11 years later. The family settled in Woodside, down the street from the acclaimed Bangladeshi restaurant Spicy Mina. When it closed in 2010, they took over the storefront and installed a pizza counter.\nThe pizza has vanished. Now there is chatamari, which comes from the Newars, the indigenous people who ruled the Kathmandu Valley for centuries. The menu describes it as a rice-flour crepe, akin to an Indian dosa, but it\u2019s denser, crispy at the circumference and sinking like a pancake the farther you go in. The surface is blasted with sunspots, mashed black-eyed peas swirled over mashed potatoes, under a rubble of meat and an egg cracked at the last minute, white and yolk caught midflight. (Ignore the tuft of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes on the side, a holdover from the restaurant\u2019s more Continental days.)\nThe kitchen is exceptional at snacks, like musya palu, roasted soybeans burnished in mustard oil, and woh, lentil cakes that maintain a careful distinction between tenderness and disintegration. Macha tareko are small whiting cosseted in yogurt, ginger, garlic and garam masala, then surrendered to the fryer. They emerge like time-crusted fossils, throats slit and heads arched back, brittle and flaking, and are beautiful to eat, bones and all.\nA collection of appetizers, arranged like a small-scale thali, comes with beaten rice, the grains smashed into gossamer flakes, as thin as skin. Alone, they taste something like scraps from the wake of a parade, but when strategically scooped up with curry, they crackle in the mouth.\nThe larger-format Newari thali is a wreath of food around a dome of rice: a tumble of choila, meat licked by open flame, harboring smoke like an unreleased demon; black-eyed peas softened in mustard oil, chickpeas ticking with cumin, and more of that musya palu; achar, pickles more incisive than sweet; mustard greens like a pause in flavor, tasting of little but themselves. Additional bowls supply broth, sour from bamboo shoots, and curry, perhaps best with strips of sukuti, beef air-dried in-house into a pliant jerky.\n\u201cNepalese don\u2019t really eat dessert,\u201d Prasant Khadgi, the second-oldest son, explained one night.

The soft-spoken Khadgi sons, who range in age from 21 to 28, take turns helping in the kitchen, running the floor and mixing pi\u00f1a coladas.\nThey list Japanese sake on the menu as a correlative to chyang, a Himalayan rice beer, which caused my table some confusion: Did it come from Japan or Nepal?\n\u201cIt is sake from Japan,\u201d Pratap Khadgi, the third-oldest son, confirmed. \u201cBut it tastes the same.\u201d"}, {"text": "14 Countries Press Myanmar to Allow Aid in Rohingya Areas\n2016-12-09T11:21:45.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 Fourteen governments urged Myanmar on Friday to allow a full resumption of aid to a predominantly Muslim part of Rakhine State, as the United Nations described an apparent escalation of what activists have called a humanitarian crisis there.\nThe United Nations also reported on Friday that thousands of people in the northern part of the state, a conflict-torn border area, have not had access to health services or food assistance for two months and that close to 22,000 Muslims had arrived in neighboring Bangladesh since Nov. 1.\nThe main ethnic group in the northern part of Rakhine is the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority whose members are barred from citizenship in Myanmar, which is mostly Buddhist.\n\u201cAs friends of Myanmar, we are deeply concerned by the humanitarian situation\u201d in the northern part of Rakhine, the diplomatic missions of Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States said in the statement on Friday.\nAid is \u201cdesperately needed to address serious humanitarian needs, but also to begin to restore the confidence and hope that are essential to a restoration of peace and stability,\u201d the statement added.\nRights activists say that Rakhine\u2019s north has been unstable since Oct. 9, when nine police officers were killed in an attack on a border post there. The Myanmar government has largely sealed off the area to journalists, diplomats and aid workers as it conducts a brutal counterinsurgency in Rohingya villages that has included rapes, arson attacks and the killing of unarmed civilians, activists say. Myanmar officials have denied any wrongdoing.\nKofi Annan, the former head of the United Nations, visited the northern areas of the state last weekend as part of a government-appointed commission that is studying conditions there.\n\u201cWe have been given the assurance that humanitarian assistance is allowed access and trust that all communities in need will receive the assistance they require,\u201d Mr. Annan told reporters in Yangon on Tuesday.\nBut Pierre P\u00e9ron, a spokesman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in a statement on Friday that only about 20,000 of the more than 150,000 people who were receiving food, cash or nutrition assistance in northern Rakhine before Oct. 9 had received any since. He said the aid shortfall was the result of recent \u201cmovement restrictions.\u201d\nMost people who live outside the area\u2019s main population centers, including 7,600 pregnant women, have not had access to primary health care services or emergency referrals, Mr. P\u00e9ron said in the statement."}, {"text": "Win a Trip in 2017\n"}, {"text": "In Western Myanmar, a Lockdown and Fears of More Violence\n2016-10-19T12:33:13.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 More than a week after attacks on police officers began a wave of bloodshed in western Myanmar, a lockdown by security forces has prevented aid workers from operating in the area, and new videos of what appear to be local Muslims calling for resistance have raised fears of more violence.\nMaj. Gen. Aung Soe, the deputy minister for home affairs, told reporters on Monday in Naypyidaw, the capital, that 30 attackers had been killed in Rakhine State since the Oct. 9 assaults on three border posts that left nine police officers dead. Activists from the Rohingya ethnic group, a persecuted Muslim minority who number more than a million in Rakhine, have accused the security forces of waging a counterinsurgency campaign against civilians, and they have circulated photos that they say show security forces burning Rohingya homes.\nNeither the government\u2019s nor the activists\u2019 version of events could be independently verified. But an advocacy group, Fortify Rights, recently said that it had interviewed witnesses who described what appeared to be extrajudicial killings by the military.\nA United Nations World Food Program official, Arsen Sahakyan, said Tuesday that a lockdown in the area since the Oct. 9 attacks had halted the agency\u2019s relief work in villages there, which typically reaches 70,000 people per month during the lean agricultural season from May to November. Pregnant or lactating women and young children also receive year-round food assistance under the program, he added.\nNow that road access has been severely curtailed, \u201cpeople report to the office, but that\u2019s it,\u201d said Mr. Sahakyan, the agency\u2019s partnerships officer in Myanmar, referring to its field office in northern Rakhine. \u201cWe cannot go to the areas where we normally distribute food.\u201d\nRakhine State, which borders Bangladesh, has long been haunted by ethnic unrest, and it was the site of violence between Buddhists and Muslims in 2012 that left hundreds dead. Rohingya are denied citizenship by Myanmar\u2019s government, which considers them migrants from Bangladesh, even if their families have been in the country for generations.\nThe government has attributed the Oct. 9 attacks to organized Muslim militants, though it offered no evidence and has since appeared to backtrack somewhat from the charge. Last Friday, President Htin Kyaw\u2019s office said the attacks had been carried out by an organization called Aqa Mul Mujahidin, which it said had links to another little-known group, the Rohingya Solidarity Organization.\nSeveral analysts and activists who follow Myanmar said in interviews that they had never heard of the first group and that the second was thought to be defunct. On Monday, according to news reports, the Foreign Ministry\u2019s permanent secretary, U Kyaw Zeya, said the statement from the president\u2019s office was preliminary and should not be used to \u201cstart making accusations, much less condemnations.\u201d\nBut videos have circulated since the attacks that appear to show armed Rohingya men in Rakhine calling for violent jihad. One that emerged in recent days, showing four men holding military-grade weapons, has an English-language voice-over that makes several demands of the government, including returning land that it said had been taken from Rohingya.\n\u201cWe stand as an independent body which is free from all elements of terror in any nature but seeks fundamental but legitimate rights and justice for all Arakanese, including our innocent Rohingyas and other civilians dying from the continuous military assault,\u201d the voice-over said. Rakhine State is also known as Arakan State.\nJasminder Singh, an analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore who studies terrorism in Southeast Asia, said Wednesday that both the videos and the Oct. 9 attacks appeared to be the work of a new group called Harakah al-Yaqin, or the Movement of Certainty, possibly inspired by Al Qaeda or the Islamic State, and that the initial attackers appeared to have entered Rakhine by boat. He said he had reached those conclusions after studying the videos and Facebook pages maintained by Rohingya groups, which feature postings from around Asia.\nBut U Kyaw Min, the chairman of the Democracy and Human Rights Party, a registered political party in Myanmar whose Rohingya members are barred from running for office, said he did not believe the attacks were the work of organized militants.\nMr. Kyaw Min said information he had gathered from people in Rakhine suggested the attacks had been carried out by gang members involved in drug trafficking, not terrorists with links to overseas Islamist groups. He said he believed the government had fabricated a link between armed Rohingya and foreign terrorists as a pretext for eventually forcing people in northern Rakhine to live in refugee camps.\n\u201cThe Rohingya are the sufferers,\u201d he said.\nMore than 100,000 people already live in refugee camps in southern Rakhine, on the fringes of the state capital, Sittwe. Most are Rohingya, though some are Rakhine, a Buddhist ethnic minority that has also been persecuted by the Myanmar Army. All were displaced in the 2012 fighting between the Rohingya and the Rakhine, which broke out around Sittwe and killed dozens.\nThe de facto leader of Myanmar\u2019s government, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has in recent months called for reconciliation between the two groups. In August, she appointed Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, as chairman of an advisory commission on Rakhine State with the goal of opening a dialogue with local political and community leaders.\nMr. Annan visited Sittwe in September, and the commission is expected to file a report in 2017. But analysts said the recent violence, coupled with the jihadist videos circulating online and the government\u2019s warnings about Islamist terrorism, was fueling anti-Muslim sentiment across Myanmar and making the prospect of ethnic reconciliation in Rakhine State look increasingly remote.\nWidney Brown, director of programs at Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group based in New York that has documented human rights violations by the authorities against both Rohingya and Rakhine people in Rakhine State, said it was imperative that the Myanmar government conduct an impartial investigation into the Oct. 9 attacks and the subsequent violence.\n\u201cThere needs to be accountability,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be clear: on both sides.\u201d"}, {"text": "Violence Escalates Between Myanmar Forces and Rohingya\n2016-11-13T17:56:01.000Z\nSITTWE, Myanmar \u2014 Violence between the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim population, and Myanmar\u2019s security forces escalated over the weekend as two soldiers were killed by crudely armed attackers, said government officials and Muslim residents. In retaliation, troops of the Buddhist-majority government used helicopters to fire at the attackers in dense forest in northwestern Myanmar, a government spokesman said.\nThe two soldiers were killed Saturday by attackers armed with guns, knives and spears near the village of Gwason, south of Maungdaw, the main town in northern Rakhine, said the state information officer, U San Nwe. About 500 attackers were involved in the clash, he said. The area is closed to Western journalists, making it impossible to verify the scale of the fighting.\nThe remote enclave of northern Rakhine State, close to the Bangladeshi border, has been under siege since the government sent security forces to hunt for what it said were armed Rohingya assailants who had killed nine police officers in early October.\nSince then, human rights groups have received reports of killings of unarmed Rohingya men by Myanmar soldiers, rapes of Rohingya women by soldiers in a number of villages, and beatings of Rohingya men held in detention in the town of Maungdaw. Before the latest attack, as many as 100 Rohingya civilians may have been killed, the groups say.\nWestern diplomats have called on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who leads Myanmar\u2019s government, to conduct an independent investigation into the violence. So far, she has declined, allowing a Rakhine State committee to investigate. She has also urged that specific complaints be filed with a commission headed by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, that was formed in August.\nHer spokesman, U Zaw Htay, said on Sunday that the latest attacks made it necessary for the military and police operation to continue until the culprits were arrested and the weapons they had seized were found. The troops have been instructed to respect human rights, he said. But Myanmar\u2019s army is known to be poorly trained and has a record rife with human rights abuses, including rape, in its battles with various separatist groups over many years, Western diplomats say.\nAlso on Saturday, a police car was hit by the blast from a roadside mine near the village of Kyikanpyin, north of Maungdaw, where five of the nine police officers were killed on Oct. 9, according to the Ministry of Information in Naypyidaw, the capital. No one was killed in the blast on Saturday.\nReached by telephone in Maungdaw on Sunday, Mohammed Sultan, a retired Rohingya teacher, said some students had told him that their villages had been set on fire. \u201cOne of my pupils said he was hiding in the rice field,\u201d Mr. Sultan said. The connection then went dead, he said.\nHigh-definition satellite images taken in October and this month showed widespread burning of Rohingya villages, Human Rights Watch said on Sunday.\nAlthough relations between the Rohingya and the security forces have always been tense, the tactic of Rohingya men attacking police stations, targeting security forces and apparently planting roadside bombs is new, government officials and Rohingya activists say.\nThe motivation for the increase in violence by what appears to be a small group of armed Rohingya men is not clear.\nThe government, providing little proof, immediately blamed two little-known groups: Aqa Mul Mujahidin and the Rohingya Solidarity Organization.\nThe decades-long repression of the Rohingya by the Myanmar authorities made the population of about one million Rohingya fertile ground for Islamic radicalization, activists and diplomats say.\nHere in Sittwe, in southern Rakhine, more than 100,000 Rohingya have been kept in what amount to internment camps for four years, prevented from traveling and forbidden to reclaim land and property destroyed during communal violence in 2012.\nThe new violence north of Sittwe was worse than that four years ago, said Mohamed Saed, a community leader. \u201cThen, it was communal violence between two groups: Rohingya and Rakhine Buddhists,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is now direct government repression.\u201d\nSeveral Rohingya leaders said they did not believe Rohingya ties to radical jihadists were the cause of the attacks five weeks ago. New, harsh proposals by the government may have been the catalyst, they suggested.\nIn September, a Rakhine official, Col. Htein Lin, said the government would destroy all \u201cillegally\u201d built structures, including more than 2,500 houses, 600 shops, a dozen mosques and more than 30 schools.\nU Kyaw Min, a Rohingya who is the chairman of the Democracy and Human Rights Party, said, \u201cThat was saying we have to reduce the population of Rohingya and push them over the border to Bangladesh.\u201d\nThe attitude of officials in Rakhine State toward the Rohingya is unequivocal. They call the Rohingya \u201cBengalis,\u201d implying that they belong in Bangladesh.\nA leader of the Arakan National Party, U Aung Win, said it was now necessary to form a special paramilitary force.\nThe Rohingya make up more than 90 percent of northern Rakinine State\u2019s population, outnumbering the Rakhine Buddhists, so more protection is needed for the Buddhist minority, Mr. Aung Win said. The two groups cannot live together, he insisted.\nMr. Aung Win is also the chairman of the Rakhine State investigation into the Oct. 9 attacks.\nThe Rohingya villages around Kyikanpyin have become armed camps, according to telephone conversations and text messages from villagers to friends in Sittwe. Food is scarce, and a strict dusk-to-dawn curfew is enforced, they say. In those areas, villagers say soldiers have raped women and stolen their jewelry.\nThree women, ages 23, 21 and 17, were raped Wednesday by soldiers living in the local school, said Mohamed Rahim, a village leader in Pyoung Pai, not far from Kyikanpyin.\n\u201cThe villagers were told to gather in the rice fields, but the three girls were told to stay in the house with their mother,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cBefore the rape, they told the mother to get out. I then saw the military enter the house.\u201d\nMyanmar officials deny that rapes have occurred. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to rape a Bengali woman,\u201d Mr. Aung Win said. \u201cAll the Bengali villages are covered by bamboo netting and plastic.\u201d\nIn a recent interview with the BBC, Mr. Aung Win said it was impossible that soldiers had raped the women because Rohingya \u201care very dirty.\u201d\nThe question of the rapes is particularly sensitive. The Myanmar Times newspaper fired a journalist, Fiona MacGregor, for writing an article about alleged rapes of Rohingya women on Oct. 19."}, {"text": "An American in a Strange Land\n2016-11-04T09:00:10.000Z\nI heard it often, traveling around Europe as a journalist. I even heard it from an immigration officer at Gatwick Airport outside London, who teased me as he looked at my passport. I was an American abroad, which meant being held accountable for the strange and fevered state of my homeland, which meant facing some version of the question \u201cWhat is going on in the United States?\u201d Sometimes the query had an air of schadenfreude, but just as often there was a hint of real concern. The rest of the world already seemed to be going off the rails. It couldn\u2019t afford to have America follow.\nI didn\u2019t really know how to respond. I hadn\u2019t lived in the United States since 2003, when The New York Times moved me to Beijing as a foreign correspondent, along with my wife and two kids. We assumed we would move back home soon enough, but it never happened. We lived for six years in China, where our third child was born, followed by four years in New Delhi, where my beat was South Asia. By the time we settled in Rome in 2013, we had drifted into the category of American expatriates. When we saw our countrymen around the city \u2014 big, friendly tourists, a bit loud \u2014 my kids referred to them as \u201cthe Americans.\u201d\nWe weren\u2019t completely cut off. Most summers, we visited family and friends in the States; the kids streamed the American shows; my wife listened to \u201cMorning Edition.\u201d I worked for an American company, for American bosses, and I wrote articles trying to explain the world to a mostly American audience. All of this created the gentle illusion that we were still truly connected to home. Yet as the years passed, I realized that I had lost touch, that the country I left was no longer the same.\nThe year I moved away, George W. Bush stood beneath a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner on an aircraft carrier and declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq. Facebook hadn\u2019t yet been turned into a company. The iPhone did not exist. I left before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, before Detroit went bankrupt. I missed the Great Recession (though I am still living the European translation of it). I missed most of the last two presidencies. I missed Brangelina.\nInstead, I witnessed from the other side the global forces that would bring profound changes to America. I visited industrial regions of southern China where the ground seemed to vibrate under the weight and bustle of all the countless new factories. Once iPhones had been invented, it was Chinese workers who assembled them. I watched Bangladeshi seamstresses stitch clothes sold at Walmart. American consumers benefited from the cheaper goods, but American manufacturers did not. Between January 2000 and December 2014, the United States lost roughly five million manufacturing jobs.\nThen I moved to Rome and watched the European Union grow ineffective and paralyzed, as the dream of a vibrant, unified Europe seemed to wither. Democracy was losing ground in Hungary and the Philippines; it had all but surrendered in Russia. Syria became a slaughterhouse. The Islamic State dispatched terrorists around the world. China\u2019s politics became more oppressive, as President Xi Jinping cracked down on dissent and nurtured a Maoist-style cult of personality. Economic globalization was supposed to accelerate political liberalization around the world, but instead authoritarianism appeared to be on the rise. The West, it seemed, had failed to anticipate the possibility that globalization could contribute to the destabilization of \u2014 or pose a threat to \u2014 democracy, even in the United States.\nThis summer, I decided I wanted to explore this place that had become a foreign country to me. I didn\u2019t understand what had happened since I left, why so many people seemed so disillusioned and angry. I planned a zigzag route, revisiting places where I once lived or worked, a 29-day sprint through 11 states (and four time zones). I knew I would be moving too fast to make any sweeping declaration about the state of America, and I wouldn\u2019t ask people which presidential candidate they were voting for. I was more interested in why they were so anxious about the present and the future. I wanted to find out why the country was fragmenting rather than binding together. Most of all I wanted to see with my own eyes what had changed \u2014 and so much had changed.\nBy the time I arrived in Washington in late July, the notion that American democracy could come unmoored was not being easily laughed off. Before beginning my journey in earnest, I paid a visit to Patrick J. Buchanan at his white mansion near the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Northern Virginia. I\u2019d thought of Buchanan often over the last year, as Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination. In 1992, I covered Buchanan during a campaign stop in Macomb County, outside Detroit, when he was a Republican insurgent running for president, the Trump of that era. He mocked Republican elites, denounced free trade and globalization, antagonized minorities and vowed to build a \u201cBuchanan fence\u201d along the Mexican border. Buchanan\u2019s nostalgia for the era of white-majority America was often interpreted, not without cause, as barely concealed racism. He lost in 1992, and again in 1996 and 2000, but he always predicted that his issues and his angry coalition would endure.\nWhen I asked if he had any concern about this election damaging American democracy, he said he didn\u2019t worry too much about that. He talked about the European Union as evidence of the political dangers posed by immigration and described \u201cethno-nationalism\u201d and economic nationalism as potent political forces. \u201cI look around the world, and I think all those countries are coming apart,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think ours is going to come apart. The melting pot is not melting anymore.\u201d\nI mentioned that I was leaving the next day to travel along the Texas-Mexico border. Buchanan grimaced for a moment and jokingly offered to lend me a shotgun. I thanked him, and later I flew off into the heat.\nFrom the sky, there is no border. The helicopter thump-thumped above downtown El Paso as we passed over the concrete ditch through which the Rio Grande flows, dividing El Paso from the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. If not for the ditch, you\u2019d assume the two cities were one, a single urban sprawl blanketing a valley between two desolate mountain ranges. Only when we headed west did the border become distinctly visible, a straight brown line jutting into the scrub desert. I could see a metal fence that divided the two countries and, near it, the white S.U.V.s of the American agents on patrol. My colleague, the photographer Tom\u00e1s Munita, leaned out of the copter to take pictures.\nI had been in contact with United States Customs and Border Protection but never thought to mention my aerial tour. A few hours after we landed, an agency spokesman emailed me. He was friendly but anxious: Agents reported seeing someone taking photographs from a helicopter tracing the border. Was it us?\nI had gone to El Paso often as a national correspondent for The Times, and I always liked the atmosphere there. Everybody seemed to know everybody else. El Paso is isolated from most of Texas, yet Ju\u00e1rez lies no more than a long baseball toss away. There is a fluid give and take between the two sides, even as the disparities are stark: Ju\u00e1rez has frequently ranked among the most violent cities in the world, while El Paso routinely rates among the safest municipalities in the United States.\nMy helicopter ride had come about in typical El Paso fashion: I called a state senator, who connected me to the county judge, who nudged a local businessman to organize the trip. They saw it as a good opportunity to help rebut the 2016 election narrative that the border was a lawless, out-of-control sieve through which illegal immigrants flooded north and wreaked violence upon unsuspecting Americans. The county judge, Veronica Escobar, had grown wearily accustomed to the assumptions made in other parts of the country. \u201cOne of the first questions people frequently ask is, Will I be safe?\u201d she told me. \u201cYou can tell people that deportations are up and that in-migration is down from Mexico. You can tell people that the border has never been safer. You can provide people with as many statistics as possible \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t make a difference.\u201d\nEscobar, a Democrat and El Paso County\u2019s highest elected official, grew up here and considers the city an unlikely oasis of tolerance. She is Mexican-American; the city\u2019s police chief is African-American. We had dinner my first night in El Paso, and when I mentioned something Pat Buchanan said to me \u2014 he dared me to drive around El Paso with a Trump bumper sticker on my car \u2014 she laughed. But she worried that El Paso was changing. Even some of her own relatives, people who had moved away from El Paso, have posted pro-Trump, anti-immigrant messages on Facebook. Fear and anger overcame the facts on the ground, she said.\n\u201cHow did America get that way?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\nI was starting my journey in El Paso because six months earlier I was across the border in Ju\u00e1rez, on the outside of America, looking in. As a correspondent based in Rome, I also cover the Vatican, so I traveled with Pope Francis\u2019 retinue on his trip to Mexico in February. His final stop was Ju\u00e1rez. As he prayed for migrants at the border\u2019s edge, I stared through the fence into the United States. Snipers were posted on rooftops; police cars with flashing lights blocked an overpass; agents watched from horseback or peered across the border with binoculars. Presumably some of this was to protect the pope, but I flew back to Italy startled by this show of force, this demonstration of American power and anxiety.\nA girl playing at her house in Baton Rouge, La., not far from where the police shot and killed Alton Sterling.\u00a0\nA girl playing at her house in Baton Rouge, La., not far from where the police shot and killed Alton Sterling.\u00a0\nCars entering the United States via a bridge that connects Ciudad\u00a0Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico,\u00a0and El Paso, Tex.\u00a0\nAn aerial view of the border fence, looking west from El Paso.\u00a0\nThe Lincoln Memorial.\nA diner with his handgun holstered in a San Antonio restaurant.

Since I left, the number of Border Patrol agents nationwide had roughly doubled, to more than 20,000, a vast majority of them stationed along the 1,989-mile border with Mexico. They have motion detectors, helicopters, cameras, fixed-wing aircraft and drones at their disposal. Their boats ply stretches of the Rio Grande. Texas state troopers have also been dispatched to \u201csecure the border.\u201d\nThe El Paso County sheriff, Richard Wiles, who has criticized the buildup, told me that so many troopers were present that they often had little to do besides enforce traffic laws. \u201cIt is a waste of money,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cIt was a response to the rhetoric that the border is unsafe. And that is wrong.\u201d (A new study by the Border Network for Human Rights found that troopers have been disproportionately stopping Latino motorists in many border counties, including El Paso.) At a convention of the Texas Republican Party this year, Gov. Greg Abbott falsely stated that the Islamic State was \u201crunning through the border.\u201d In April 2015, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch asserted that the Islamic State had a training camp in Mexico, near El Paso. Again, there was no evidence to back up the claim.\nSafety feels like a tenuous concept right now, when a malcontent can detonate a homemade bomb in Chelsea or suicide bombers can blow themselves up outside a soccer stadium in Paris. But so much of the safety rhetoric around the border blends legitimate concerns \u2014 especially when it comes to smuggled drugs, money and weapons moving in both directions \u2014 with political opportunism. The rate of people being apprehended while trying to cross the border from Mexico declined in 2015 and is now at its lowest point in more than 40 years. And even as President Obama pushed for immigration reform, his administration approved high numbers of deportations.\nOne afternoon, I pulled up to a checkpoint on Interstate 10, about an hour or so east of El Paso, near the town of Sierra Blanca, Tex. A Border Patrol agent in a bulletproof vest asked if I was an American citizen while a dog sniffed the rental car for drugs. Less than an hour later, a Texas state trooper pulled me over on State Highway 90 in Presidio County for failing to use my blinker while changing lanes. The road was so quiet that a jack rabbit hopped across. The trooper asked if I was an American citizen, checked my passport and sent me on my way with a warning. Traffic enforcement.\nI had forgotten how big the people are, how big the cars are, how much fried food can be stacked onto a single plate. Everything seemed larger than I remembered, even the night sky. Driving along the 610 Loop in Houston, I saw a cigar shop named SERIOUS CIGARS that was easily triple the size of my grocery in Rome.\n\u201cThis country is huge,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said one day. \u201cIt is like 50 countries all together.\u201d\nTom\u00e1s, a Chilean, has traveled the world, but this was his first long tour across the United States. On seeing one rural road sign, he asked what it meant to \u201cadopt a highway.\u201d Another day, another road sign: \u201cHitchhikers May Be Escaping Inmates.\u201d Tom\u00e1s was startled by how thoroughly so many American cities emptied out at night. In Colorado Springs, we attended a rodeo where the announcer made a long soliloquy praising our military for defending our freedom at home. Tom\u00e1s had embedded many times with American forces in Afghanistan. He liked the soldiers, but he didn\u2019t understand how sending troops to other countries, particularly Iraq, kept Americans free at home.\nBefore the rodeo, I met two ranchers, Rob Alexander and Bill Craig. The air smelled faintly of horse manure as we sat on a plastic cooler drinking Coors. Alexander, 53, explained that the rodeo was a fund-raiser for ranch hands, who often lacked health insurance or a safety net to help out in emergencies. Ranching families had taken a hit in the past two decades, in part because trade agreements led to the consolidation of many cattle operations and an increase in imported beef from South America. Craig, 35, is a fourth-generation rancher, but he said land is now so expensive and profit so meager that he could never afford to start a ranch from scratch today. They talked like men whose lifestyles and values were endangered.\n\u201cSomething is wrong,\u201d Craig said. \u201cWatch the TV. The moral compass is so far out of whack in our country right now.\u201d\nAt the University of Texas at Austin, I met Lisa Moore, a professor of English and women\u2019s studies who is one of three plaintiffs suing to overturn a new state law allowing students to carry concealed handguns on campus. Born in Canada but a resident of Texas for 27 years, Moore is a naturalized American citizen who is still a bit baffled by her new country. \u201cThat is the weirdness of the United States to me: Everybody is always talking about their rights,\u201d she said, while identity in Canada derives from the idea of the social compact.\nMoore is a gay, married mother of two children who teaches courses on L.G.B.T. literature. \u201cCampus carry\u201d infringes on free speech, she argues, by inhibiting her ability to provide a safe learning environment. What if a student becomes enraged by the subject matter and pulls out a Glock?\nAmerican gun manufacturers produced 3.3 million guns the year I left for China, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. By 2014, the number was nine million (supplemented by 3.6 million guns imported into the country). According to some recent estimates, there are now roughly as many guns as people in the United States, maybe even more. To many foreigners, the American infatuation with guns is an inexplicable, if defining, national trait. On a taxi ride in Beijing once, the driver, upon discovering I was American, shaped his hand like a pistol and began shooting imaginary bullets.\nAt a firing range outside Austin, I met six guys shooting semiautomatic rifles. Several of them worked for Defense Distributed, the open-source organization in Austin that came up with a plastic handgun whose design can be downloaded from the web and produced with a 3-D printer. The State Department ordered the company to remove the design code, but the company is challenging that order in court. For Benjamin Denio, at the time a 36-year-old who worked in desktop support and did product testing at Defense Distributed, being able to produce your own plastic gun is a safeguard against the tyranny of the state. \u201cThe term I would use to describe the level of vitriol in the country,\u201d Denio said, \u201cis that it is the \u2018cold civil war.\u2019\u2009\u201d\nI was running into so many disgruntled people that I began to worry, as I dipped in and out of places, that I was inadvertently being drawn to angry people. I figured I would get a taste of Middle America by stopping in Russell, Kan., which I visited 20 years earlier when a local hero, Bob Dole, was the 1996 Republican presidential nominee. Walking along the redbrick Main Street, I saw a crowd streaming out of a local theater. Inside, Christina Fowler, a pastor, had just finished services for her nondenominational congregation. Today was her son\u2019s birthday, and she invited me to a potluck lunch with the congregation in her backyard.\nEveryone sat at folding tables eating potato salad and lasagna. I sat with the associate pastor, Lonnie Whitten Jr., and a congregant named Cindy, who asked that her last name not be published. Whitten, who had a bushy ZZ Top beard and arms covered in tattoos, described himself as a reformed bad boy. This congregation, he said, was moving away from the culture of the \u201ccorporate church\u201d and also opposed same-sex marriage. Cindy had been part of a local delegation taken to San Diego for the 1996 Republican National Convention as living proof of Dole\u2019s hometown values. \u201cWe were treated like royalty!\u201d she said. Now 59, Cindy explained that too many ministers around the country watered down the true message of the Gospel, serving up baby food, not meat. And what was the real message? That homosexuality is a sin. That Islam is incompatible with Christianity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time when someone gives the signal,\u201d she told me of Muslims living in America, \u201cand we\u2019re all going to be beheaded.\u201d\nI ate some potato salad, a bit stunned.\nMy iPhone broke in Baton Rouge, La. \u2014 something to do with the \u201clightning port\u201d \u2014 so I headed to the Mall of Louisiana. I walked into the carefully engineered retail ecosystem of the Apple store, where a young, friendly, racially mixed staff in matching blue shirts circulated in the showroom. Apple products lay sparsely across the counters like pieces of art. I waited at the Genius Bar until an Apple employee gave me a replacement iPhone 6. Only later did I realize that the Mall of Louisiana had played a not-insignificant role in the continuing struggle over segregation in Baton Rouge.\nLiving in Louisiana in the 1990s, I regularly visited the capital for stories about state politics. I thought back to 1991, when the white supremacist David Duke made it to a runoff in his gubernatorial campaign against Edwin Edwards, the former Democratic governor who was perpetually under investigation for corruption. \u201cVote for the Crook: It\u2019s Important,\u201d his supporters\u2019 bumper stickers read. (Years later, he was finally convicted.) Now Duke is running for the Senate, and his re-emergence has coincided with the racial splintering of Baton Rouge.\nOn July 5, Alton Sterling was shot by the police as he sold CDs outside a convenience store. The police shooting of yet another black man, captured on video, became a national scandal. Twelve days later, a black veteran of the Marines shot six law-enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, killing three, including one who was black.\nOne afternoon, Lionel Bazile Jr. picked me up at my hotel for a tour of the neighborhood where Sterling was killed. Bazile, a 66-year-old retired postman, is a Roman Catholic and a member of an interracial, interfaith coalition called Together Baton Rouge. It was founded about six years ago, after a prominent black pastor, Lee T. Wesley, led an outreach effort to some white ministers and community leaders because he felt the city was dangerously, if silently, divided. That split became clear when a predominantly white group of organizers in southern Baton Rouge sought to create their own school system and, ultimately, incorporate their own city, St. George. They needed a new school system, they argued, because the East Baton Rouge Parish schools were struggling. But carving out a wealthy area of Baton Rouge as a new municipality would have drained tax revenues from the surrounding city and gutted the funding for Baton Rouge public schools. The new municipality was also laid out to include the Mall of Louisiana, a major source of sales-tax revenue. Bazile, along with others from Together Baton Rouge, helped defeat the St. George movement, but the underlying problems had hardly gone away.\n\u201cNow we are crossing Florida Boulevard,\u201d Bazile told me as we rode in his truck. \u201cWe call Florida Boulevard the Mason-Dixon line that divides Baton Rouge.\u201d\nOnce we entered North Baton Rouge, the historically black section of the city, the road immediately became bumpier. According to Bazile, the neighborhood received only a small slice of the money from the citywide road-improvement project. \u201cYou are not going to see too many shopping centers around here,\u201d he said as we passed dilapidated strip malls. We drove by a hospital where the emergency room had been closed down. During our drive, I did not see a single national chain store.\nNorth Baton Rouge had apparently died from gradual abandonment. Most politicians ignored the neighborhood. When crime began to rise, Bazile\u2019s home was burglarized four times, and the value of his property began to depreciate. He and his family moved out, as did many middle-class black families. The Mall of Louisiana opened in the late 1990s near the city\u2019s predominantly white southern suburbs and soon became a magnet for more public and private investment. \u201cNorth Baton Rouge was dying,\u201d Bazile said, \u201cbut southern Baton Rouge was booming.\u201d\nBazile and I pulled into the parking lot of the Triple S Food Mart, where Sterling was killed. Someone had painted Sterling\u2019s image on the side of the store, and soggy bouquets of flowers and tributes lay piled on the pavement. Veda Washington-Abusaleh, one of Sterling\u2019s aunts, stood nearby with a protest poster rolled up in her hands. She told me she was out there every day. When I explained that I was a journalist, she began shouting. \u201cAin\u2019t nothing changed!\u201d she said. \u201cIt is still the same. I can tell you what needs to change! White police officers need to be better trained.\u201d She pointed to the spot in the parking lot where activists and political leaders erected a stage in the days after the killing. \u201cRight where his blood stained the street,\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt is a political thing for them. But I want justice.\u201d\nA lot of people did. Today, Baton Rouge is a reminder of the entrenched racial and economic segregation in many American cities. Nationally, stubborn disparities remain between whites and blacks as far as income, college-graduation levels and employment. The median adjusted income for white households was roughly $71,300 in 2014, compared with $43,300 for black ones. The median net worth of white households is about 13 times as high as that of black ones, according to the most recent figures from the Pew Research Center. John Logan, a sociologist at Brown University, told me that racially biased economic development is one reason these disparities remain entrenched. Black communities have been routinely passed over for commercial projects, like shopping malls, which attract other development projects and lift property values.\nOn my last morning in Baton Rouge, I met Gary Chambers Jr., a black civil rights advocate and journalist who was a leader of the protests over the Sterling killing. We met at an IHOP, which Chambers picked because the franchise was black-owned. Chambers had become an outspoken advocate for North Baton Rouge and a blunt critic of the city\u2019s racial status quo. He blamed the police and politicians, including the city\u2019s black mayor. Chambers described his own agenda as being unabashedly \u201cpro-black.\u201d \u201cWe are supposed to live in this society where we want everybody to be a part of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd we do. But I live in Baton Rouge, and it\u2019s just not the case.\u201d\nTo Chambers, the Sterling killing was as much about economics as bad policing. \u201cWhy is Alton Sterling selling CDs in the middle of the night, outside a convenience store in the hood?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have economic opportunities in North Baton Rouge.\u201d When I mentioned Together Baton Rouge and the efforts to build deeper relationships between whites and blacks, Chambers chuckled softly and then paused a moment. \u201cThey are all right,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying.\u201d\nBut I could tell he was skeptical. He told me that it was time for the older generation to simply get out of the way. \u201cI\u2019m 31,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you\u2019ve been in office since the \u201980s and my community looks like this, then you have some blame. My generation is inheriting this. We didn\u2019t create this. So don\u2019t tell us how to feel about it.\u201d\nA week or so after I left Baton Rouge, the city flooded; some areas were inundated with six to eight feet of water. Parts of the region were declared disaster areas. After I sent a sympathy note to Broderick Bagert, an organizer of Together Baton Rouge, he wrote back: \u201cWe\u2019ll invite you back when the plague of locusts arrives, which I understand is expected to be next week.\u201d\nI lived in the Bay Area as a teenager, and while it was affluent then, the levels of wealth, along with the cost of living, are magnitudes greater today. Tom\u00e1s and I arrived in San Francisco late at night after searching for hotels online. A basic room at a Holiday Inn was more than $300. Finally, we found one advertised at $217 a night that turned out to be in the Tenderloin, the neighborhood that has long absorbed new immigrants but has also become the catch basin for the city\u2019s poorer residents. One reason for this is that churches, nonprofit groups and city agencies operate soup kitchens and subsidized housing programs in the neighborhood. But another is the tech money driving up property values in neighborhoods like SoMa, the Mission and Bayview.\nThis has pushed some low-income people onto the streets, or out of the city, and intensified the pressure on street people to move on, often to the Tenderloin and other commercial neighborhoods downtown. After three days in the city, Tom\u00e1s and I were dazed by what we had seen: drug addicts shooting up; two people engaging in oral sex, in broad daylight; a young woman vomiting on the sidewalk, unable to digest a donated pastry; homeless people camping on streets that reeked of urine; two old men, wheeling their possessions in dueling grocery carts, fighting midday on Market Street near the offices of Twitter, with one man waving a steel rod and the other swinging a bear knife until the police arrived.\n\u201cHomelessness issues are very real, but they are also very symbolic of so many other inequities and stressors that are happening in the city,\u201d Peter Cohen, an affordable-housing advocate, told me one morning. \u201cYou say, What\u2019s the problem? The tech economy is booming. Employment is up. It only becomes apparent when you drill down to the level of the neighborhood. We are struggling in San Francisco, to some extent, with the excesses of wealth that have concentrated here.\u201d\nIn the November elections, San Francisco has multiple local ballot initiatives related to homelessness (which has been a woefully nonexistent issue in the presidential campaign). There is also a battle over the rapidly expanding sharing economy, some of whose largest companies were started in the area. Airbnb, which is based in San Francisco, markets thousands of units in the city and spent heavily to defeat a local ballot initiative last November that would have severely restricted short-term rentals. In June, the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors approved some restrictions anyway, prompting a lawsuit from Airbnb. Whatever the outcome, the usual parameters of housing issues \u2014 say, tenants versus landlords \u2014 seem forever changed.\nDale Carlson, a consultant who has played a central role in the political fight against Airbnb, said the sharing economy has contributed to the rise in rents and has encouraged some landlords to evict tenants and convert apartments to short-term rentals. (Advocates for house-sharing platforms say the rentals are vital in helping people make extra money to afford the high cost of living in the city.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially, Who gets to live here?\u201d Carlson said of the political fight. \u201cAnd who is squeezed out?\u201d\nOne day, I drove down Highway 101 to Silicon Valley to meet Reid Hoffman, a partner at the venture-capital firm Greylock and the chairman of LinkedIn, the professional-social-networking company, which was then in the process of being sold to Microsoft for $26.2 billion. Hoffman founded LinkedIn the same year I left for Beijing; now he was a billionaire. He is politically active, having supported and advised Obama and raised money for and donated money to Hillary Clinton. I mentioned how the election had become a referendum of sorts on globalization and trade, yet there had been little discussion about the next big earthquake \u2014 artificial intelligence, or the approaching world of self-driving cars, smartphones that can diagnose a melanoma and much more. Globalization may have ravaged blue-collar America, but artificial intelligence could cut through the white-collar professions in much the same way.\nHoffman said the reactions to artificial intelligence range from utopian to dystopian. The utopians predict huge productivity gains and rapid advances in medicine, genetic sequencing, fighting climate change and other areas. The dystopians predict a \u201cRobocalypse\u201d in which machines supplant people and, possibly, threaten humanity itself. \u201cMy point of view,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it is a massive transformation and does really impact the future of humanity, but that we can steer it more toward utopia rather than dystopia with intelligence and diligence.\u201d\nEither way, another major economic shift is coming, perhaps sooner than people realize. Hoffman said that many of the jobs in today\u2019s economy will change fundamentally during the next 20 years. On the same day I met with Hoffman, Uber announced a pilot program to test self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. It also bought a company developing self-driving trucks. \u201cWe have to make sure that we don\u2019t have a massive imbalance of society by which you have a small number of people that own the robots and everyone else is scrambling,\u201d he said.\nBack in the Tenderloin, I met with Del Seymour, a former drug dealer who runs a nonprofit organization called Code Tenderloin, in which he trains local low-income people for the job market. In recent years, the city had granted major tax breaks to companies that opened offices in the area, and Seymour offered tours to show tech workers their new neighborhood. I joined a small group from Zendesk, a cloud-based customer-service software company founded in Denmark whose headquarters are in the Tenderloin. Its employees had already done volunteer work with a local nonprofit organization, distributing clean syringes to local drug users to prevent the spread of AIDS. It was not the usual tech job.\nThe tour ended inside the Cadillac Hotel. Jerry Garcia once lived there in the early 1960s, Muhammad Ali once sparred there, and it now has many subsidized rooms for low-income residents. Seymour asked the Zendesk employees to sit in the lobby and praised the company for its volunteer work. But then he pointed out that tech companies hire more than just techies \u2014 about 30 percent of the jobs, he said, did not require technical training. He told them how he was once one of the biggest dope dealers on Taylor Street. He had changed, however, and other people in the Tenderloin could, too. \u201cLet us in your back door,\u201d he said, his voice rising like that of a preacher. \u201cWe don\u2019t want your food. We don\u2019t want your sympathy. We want jobs.\u201d\nI was in Detroit, in the August heat, and it was just so weird. Downtown was coming back, but so much else was strangely empty. Entire neighborhoods were practically abandoned, and arsonists had torched hundreds of houses. Wildflowers grew on the empty lots. It was as if the city had fragmented into mismatched pieces. One street was a ghost town. Another was a construction site for a new Red Wings hockey stadium.\n\u201cThere will be fires tonight,\u201d Elaine Cromie said as we drove through the city streets. \u201cThat is for sure.\u201d\nCromie, a freelance news photographer, was giving me a tour of the city. Even though Detroit was out of bankruptcy and downtown boosters were pushing a resurgence narrative, the arson fires were still happening often enough that the local media had to pick and choose which ones to cover. \u201cIt\u2019s really only news if it is a hazardous-materials fire,\u201d she said.\nWe turned onto Goldengate Street and parked near a few vacated houses. Trees still shaded the rotting homes where middle-class families once lived, before many of them walked away from bad mortgages. The emptiness of some streets reminded me of photographs of the depopulated, decaying buildings left behind after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. That part of Ukraine has been largely without people for 30 years and is now known as the Zone of Alienation, which seemed like a fitting phrase to describe parts of Detroit too.\nFive years back, the organizers of Occupy Detroit spent the winter on Goldengate, but the anticapitalist movement fizzled and the street today is mostly populated by hippies and squatters. It is, in fact, a counterculture oasis, known as Fireweed Universe-City. Cromie was looking for a guy who was supposed to connect us with a community leader, Doctor Bob, but instead we bumped into Zack Zduniak. Zduniak, 26, had simply checked out of mainstream America, which today\u2019s Detroit made possible.\nZduniak grew up in suburban St. Clair Shores in an era of diminished prospects, while the local auto industry declined. He liked living off the grid, but it wasn\u2019t easy; he was sleeping with his cat in a friend\u2019s delivery truck. He worked part-time at a restaurant, sometimes foraged for berries and knew which churches gave out free food. Visitors turned up, often Europeans, some via couchsurfing.com, for a binge of partying or a voyeuristic taste of life on the antimaterialist fringe. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to be involved in this crazy, consumerist society,\u201d he told me.\nZduniak thought Doctor Bob could better represent the community, so we knocked on his door. Bob Pizzimenti is a chiropractor, urban farmer and the proprietor of the healing center and vegetarian cafe down the street, which was the only nearby outpost of private enterprise that I spotted. Everyone called him Doctor Bob. He bought his two-story brick house six years ago for $1,400 when others were fleeing. He liked that there were seemingly no rules in Detroit. He bought several empty lots around his house and planted corn and other vegetables on them. He wanted a different type of community, something new. He thought America had lost its way.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve bought into a system that nobody believes in, but everybody walks around like something real is going on,\u201d he told me. He added: \u201cThis is real.\u201d He was pointing to a stalk of corn."}, {"text": "A Place Where Lightning Strikes Almost 300 Days a Year\n2016-05-16T20:49:21.000Z\nThey call it \u201cthe Never-Ending Storm of Catatumbo,\u201d or \u201cMaracaibo\u2019s Lighthouse.\u201d Its lightning is so familiar, people in the state of Zulia in Venezuela even put it on their flag.\nLess than half an hour after the first cloud forms, it starts to flash. It does this faster and faster \u2014 200 flashes a minute is not uncommon. After that, the cloud becomes a giant bulb that lights up the night.\n\u201cYou can read a newspaper in the middle of the night because it\u2019s so bright,\u201d said Jonas Pointek, a photographer who has documented the storms.\nLocals in the area known as Lake Maracaibo, by the Catatumbo River in Venezuela, can expect a display of this sort during more than 80 percent of the year, mainly from April to November \u2014 an average of 297 days, to be exact, according to an analysis published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.\nThis was enough that NASA has declared the area the lightning capital of the world, dethroning Africa\u2019s Congo Basin. The reason for the change: Sixteen years worth of data from the lightning sensors on a satellite allowed the team to analyze the numbers with unprecedented precision.\n\u201cStorm chasers have to drive down highways or up mountains,\u201d said Alan Highton, of Catatumbo Camp,  who has specialized in lightning tourism in the area for eight years. \u201cBut the unique thing about the Catatumbo is you can just sit there at our camp, drink a cold beer, and the storms will come to you.\u201d He says the prettiest storms come in November, and according to the data, they peak in September.\nThe secret to Catatumbo lightning lies in the unique topography of the land. The Andes Mountains surround Lake Maracaibo like a horseshoe from the south, and the Caribbean Sea meets it on the north. Cool mountain breezes move into the valley at night and collide with warm wind from the sea and lake in a way that creates optimal conditions for lightning.\nAlthough most people survive lightning strikes with severe neurological injuries, they can occasionally be deadly. (In recent days, 65 people were killed by lightning in Bangladesh, according to CNN.)\nAccording to Mr. Highton, when lightning is near, the residents do little to prepare other than stay indoors, where even if lightning strikes a tin roof, they\u2019re protected by wooden floors. But fishermen have been killed on the lake.\n\u201cOn a boat, you can run but you can\u2019t hide,\u201d Mr. Highton said.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the odds of being struck by lightning in your lifetime in the United States are 1 in 12,000. According to Mr. Highton, lightning strikes one to three people every year near Lake Maracaibo.\nThere\u2019s no surefire way to prepare. But perhaps that will change. This week, scientists are sending weather balloons above Lake Maracaibo as part of a continuing, separate project that will help them better predict when and where lightning will strike."}, {"text": "Let Smokers See the Warning They Need\n2016-06-03T07:21:20.000Z\nBALTIMORE \u2014 FIVE years ago this month, the Food and Drug Administration released some striking images of the damage that smoking can do. These stark and disturbing pictures dominated the news cycle, as millions of Americans got a glimpse of the unvarnished truth.\nIn one, healthy lungs were juxtaposed with blackened and diseased ones that had been poisoned by tobacco. Another photo zoomed in on a human mouth, the teeth stained and rotted, and the lower lip abscessed. Yet another showed a woman wailing in pain from the deadly effects of secondhand smoking.\nThe F.D.A.\u2019s message to the public was that tobacco companies would soon be required to include such images on every pack of cigarettes. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services at the time, welcomed the move.\n\u201cThese labels are frank, honest and powerful depictions of the health risks of smoking,\u201d she noted, \u201cand they will help encourage smokers to quit, and prevent children from smoking.\u201d\nBig Tobacco\u2019s response? Within months, an industry group sued the F.D.A., its then commissioner, Margaret Hamburg, and Ms. Sebelius herself on First Amendment grounds, arguing that the requirements to display these warnings on tobacco products were unconstitutional and would make them \u201ca mouthpiece for the Government\u2019s emotionally charged anti-smoking message.\u201d\nThe industry won an injunction when the presiding judge agreed that the images were \u201ccalculated to provoke\u201d rather than disseminate \u201cpurely factual and uncontroversial information.\u201d The court\u2019s ruling \u2014 inform, but do not inflame \u2014 sent the federal health authorities back to the drawing board.\nThe same industry that brought the world the infamous Marlboro cowboy and Joe Camel was now fighting corrective images designed to direct consumers away from cigarettes, a product that kills half of its long-term users. The success of the industry\u2019s lawsuit means that five years after the labels were announced with such fanfare, and seven years after the law that mandated them was passed, America is still waiting.\nHow many deaths could have been prevented if the tobacco companies had not succeeded in staying the F.D.A.\u2019s hand?\nNew research estimates that at least 3,000 deaths attributable to smoking in the United States could be averted in the first five years when the new labeling goes into effect. But the Food and Drug Administration already has a wealth of evidence to justify its implementation of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the 2009 law that requires the agency to deliver the new labels. And no court ruling has removed the F.D.A.\u2019s obligation to devise such warnings.\nOne recent study found that labels with graphic images worked better than ones with text warnings only, by giving people a more memorable and negative view of smoking. Another study of young people between the ages of 18 and 30 found that the labels made them more fearful of the health effects of smoking and more wary about taking up the habit. Research conducted around the F.D.A.\u2019s announcement found that graphic labels improved people\u2019s recall of the warning and health risks of smoking.\nAs a recent voting member of the F.D.A.\u2019s Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, I reached out to Mitch Zeller, the director of the agency\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, to ask why the new labeling still hadn\u2019t seen the light of day. Mr. Zeller told me that the center was doing research to develop new warning labels that conformed with the 2009 law. This kind of research can take time, he said, and it is important to accumulate the best evidence for the proposed warnings. Mr. Zeller could not provide specifics on a timeline for implementation.\nIt was less than a decade ago that American tobacco companies were found liable for covering up the health risks from smoking. The delay over labeling has once again made the United States an outlier in the global effort to address this pressing public health need. Nearly 80 countries around the world \u2014 from Bangladesh and Canada to Egypt and Pakistan \u2014 have embraced graphic labels and the resounding research behind them. Some, like Australia and Britain, have gone further still and forced companies to remove their branding, and display only stark images on their packaging.\nIn the United States, though, the tobacco companies are still winning, while the people who continue to smoke are losing out. As are the children who will take up smoking. And as are those among us who will lose a parent, a sibling or a child to tobacco-caused disease. More than 50 years after the surgeon general\u2019s report on \u201cSmoking and Health\u201d laid bare the dangers of smoking, America is still beholden to Big Tobacco.\nThis industry has bullied us enough. The Food and Drug Administration has deferred action for too long, and must meet the tobacco companies with the same vigor, audacity and urgency that the industry has employed so effectively for decades. The F.D.A. must uphold its mandate and deliver the kind of public health service that the law requires and that America deserves."}, {"text": "Why I Was Wrong About Welfare Reform\n2016-06-18T18:30:06.000Z\nTULSA, Okla. \u2014 IN 1996, President Bill Clinton signed a controversial compromise bill for welfare reform, promising to \u201cend welfare as we know it.\u201d\nI was sympathetic to that goal at the time, but I\u2019ve decided that I was wrong. What I\u2019ve found in my reporting over the years is that welfare \u201creform\u201d is a misnomer and that cash welfare is essentially dead, leaving some families with children utterly destitute.\nEvery year I hold a \u201cwin a trip\u201d contest to choose a university student to accompany me on a reporting trip to cover global poverty in places like Congo or Myanmar. This year we decided to journey as well to Tulsa, in the heartland of America, because the embarrassing truth is that welfare reform has resulted in a layer of destitution that echoes poverty in countries like Bangladesh.\nRecent research finds that because of welfare reform, roughly three million American children live in households with incomes of less than $2 per person per day, a global metric of extreme poverty. That\u2019s one American child in 25. They would be counted as extremely poor if they lived in Africa, and they are our neighbors in the most powerful nation in the world.\nSo my win-a-trip winner, Cassidy McDonald, an aspiring journalist from the University of Notre Dame, and I interviewed families in Tulsa. Extreme poverty is not the same in the U.S. as in Africa, for America has better safety nets from the government and from churches and charities. But it\u2019s still staggering, and instead of mitigating the problem, \u201cwelfare reform\u201d has exacerbated it.\nOne of the people I met was Hailey, a toddler with blond hair, a winning smile and worrying prospects. She was born with drugs in her system to a young woman addicted to opioids, the family says, so she is cared for by her grandmother, Bobbie Ingraham, 47. Ingraham is clearly devoted to the girl, but she is struggling herself.\nIngraham acknowledges that for most of her life she battled drug addictions and committed crimes (mostly writing fake prescriptions for pain pills), and married a man who beat her and is now in prison. Ingraham recounts a litany of health issues \u2014 she spent eight days in the hospital this spring \u2014 that make it difficult for her to find a job.\nShe receives food stamps, and she has a home that she inherited from her grandmother. But she has zero cash income from work or benefits \u2014 zero! \u2014 so she can\u2019t make utility payments, and her electricity, gas and water have been cut off.\nThese days, Ingraham says, she\u2019s avoiding drugs and crime \u2014 she says she has been \u201cclean\u201d for 13 months \u2014 and she cried as she spoke of trying to raise a toddler on nothing more than food stamps and church clothing donations. \u201cI just love this baby so much,\u201d she says.\nI supported welfare reform because initially it seemed to be working. Liberal predictions of children sleeping on grates did not come to pass, and on the contrary, there was a burst of employment for low-income single mothers as people moved from welfare to work.\nBut the employment bump stalled, and the replacement program for welfare, called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, has pretty much collapsed, especially in Republican states like Oklahoma. There are now more postage stamp collectors in America than there are families collecting cash welfare, and so kids like Hailey grow up in chaotic households in which there is simply no money.\n\u201cWelfare is dead,\u201d declares an important book, \u201c$2 a Day,\u201d an expos\u00e9 of extreme poverty by Kathryn J. Edin and H. Luke Shaefer. It is their research that finds that roughly three million American children live in households earning less than $2 per person per day.\nYet it\u2019s also true that the old welfare system was a wreck, creating dependency and cycles of poverty, as the real experts on poverty sometimes acknowledge.\n\u201cI think welfare reform was good,\u201d Ashley Hene, 29, told me, even though she has run into the replacement program\u2019s time limits. \u201cEverybody was taking advantage of it.\u201d\nStephanie Johnson, 35, who is raising four children through odd jobs, agreed. \u201cIf it was readily available, I\u2019d abuse it; I\u2019d say they\u2019re giving me free money,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople use these systems as a crutch more than a steppingstone.\u201d\nSo here\u2019s where I come down. Welfare reform has failed, but the solution is not a reversion to the old program. Rather, let\u2019s build new programs targeting children in particular and drawing from the growing base of evidence of what works.\nThat starts with free long-acting birth control for young women who want it (70 percent of pregnancies among young single women are unplanned). Follow that with high-quality early-childhood programs and prekindergarten, drug treatment, parenting coaching and financial literacy training, and a much greater emphasis on jobs programs to usher the poor into the labor force and bring them income.\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt relied on aggressive jobs programs in the 1930s. Let\u2019s turn to them again for people who can\u2019t find work in the private sector. These measures won\u2019t solve America\u2019s poverty problem, but at least they\u2019ll give Hailey a fighting chance."}, {"text": "Ending the Horror of Myanmar\u2019s Abuse of Muslims\n2016-01-25T08:21:17.000Z\nThe government of Myanmar\u2019s departing president, Thein Sein, oversaw the systematic persecution of the country\u2019s Rohingya Muslim minority \u2014 a human rights debacle that one study has described as genocide. Mr. Thein Sein also signed four bills into law last year regulating interfaith marriage, birth spacing and religious conversion that clearly targeted Myanmar\u2019s Muslim minority.\nBy the hundreds of thousands, Muslims in Myanmar have been stripped of their citizenship, sent to concentration camps where they are deprived of basic medical care, jobs and even food, and held prisoners in villages they are not allowed to leave. Thousands more have fled the camps by risking their lives at the hands of criminal syndicates that traffic them to Malaysia and Bangladesh or force them into servitude on fishing boats.\nThe question now is what Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will do to ease their plight. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the revered winner of the Nobel Peace Prize whose National League for Democracy party won a majority of seats in Parliament in November, was herself persecuted and held under house arrest. But during the campaign she remained stubbornly silent on the fate of the Rohingya, clearly a political calculation in a country where anti-Muslim sentiment had been whipped to a fever pitch.\nNow that her party has won, as Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken pointed out at a meeting with leaders in Myanmar on Jan. 18, there is an urgent need to make sure the new government respects the human rights of all people when it takes power in March. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is already taking action to end festering conflicts between Myanmar\u2019s military and armed ethnic groups, and promises to strengthen fragile democratic institutions and bring economic opportunity to Myanmar\u2019s people.\nBut, as Nicholas Kristof recently pointed out in a column in The Times, these are political challenges, while what has been done to the Rohingya is \u201ca crime against humanity.\u201d\nAs soon as the political transition is complete, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and her party must move swiftly to redress discrimination against Myanmar\u2019s Muslims and to end the Rohingya\u2019s terrible plight. This means overturning Mr. Thein Sein\u2019s egregiously discriminatory laws targeting Muslims, restoring citizenship to the Rohingya and other Muslims, allowing the Rohingya to leave the squalid camps to return to their homes and businesses and to travel, and outlawing hate crimes and hate speech toward religious minorities.\nSome of the American economic sanctions originally aimed at forcing the military regime to end abuses, loosen its grip and move toward democracy remain in place, prohibiting American companies from doing business with corporations and individuals tied to the generals. They should remain in effect until the new government makes tangible progress on all human rights fronts."}, {"text": "ISIS Bombing in Baghdad Casts Doubt on Iraqi Leader\u2019s Ability to Unite\n2016-07-04T16:40:34.000Z\nBAGHDAD \u2014 As grief-stricken Iraqis held a candlelight vigil Sunday night at the site of a car bombing that killed more than 150 people, workers often using the flashlights from their cellphones were still pulling bodies from the rubble.\nAs Sunday gave way to Monday morning, with bodies still buried, some began expressing their grief through politics, waving banners listing the dead and demanding that officials, including Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, resign.\nThe attack in a shopping area in the Karada neighborhood was the deadliest in Baghdad in many years, and after the final death toll is known it could become the deadliest ever.\nAs bloody as it was, the bombing in Baghdad was but the worst of a wave of global terrorism in recent days attributed to militants aligned with the Islamic State. Seemingly unconnected to any political purpose and intended to kill indiscriminately, be it by gunfire, explosions or, in the case of a restaurant in Bangladesh, an arsenal including swords, the violence has cut across religions, national identities, ages and professions.\nThe violence touched people from all parts of the globe. More than 40 were killed at Istanbul\u2019s main airport last week \u2014 Saudis, Iraqis and citizens of Iran, China, Tunisia and Ukraine, though most were Turkish. Among the dead were taxi drivers, an interpreter helping tourists, a customs officer and an airport worker who was looking forward to his wedding, which would have been at the end of this week.\nIn Bangladesh, young men, many of them  from privileged backgrounds, used guns, bombs, knives and swords in an assault on foreigners at a popular restaurant on a Friday night. They killed 22 people, many in gruesome fashion. The dead included nine Italians, one of whom was pregnant; seven urban planners from Japan; a Bangladeshi woman who worked for art galleries; a 19-year-old Indian woman attending the University of California, Berkeley; two other college students; and two police officers.\nIn Iraq, the victims were all Iraqis. Desperate to respond to the public\u2019s grief and anger, Mr. Abadi tried to assuage Iraqis\u2019 desire for revenge by promising to speed the executions of Islamic State militants on death row. Later in the day, the Justice Ministry announced that five convicted terrorists had been executed, and images of their hangings were shown on state television.\nMr. Abadi also announced a series of new security measures, most prominently an order that the Iraqi police and soldiers stop using bomb detectors that long ago were determined to be fakes. The wandlike devices have been used for years at Baghdad\u2019s checkpoints and have been derided by a public angered by the government\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. In 2013, a British man was convicted of fraud and sentenced to 10 years in prison for selling millions of dollars\u2019 worth of the fake devices to the Iraqi government.\nNevertheless, on Monday morning the police were still using the devices at checkpoints across Baghdad, underscoring how little ever changes, even though Iraq has been consumed by violence for more than a decade. Just this year, through June, nearly 5,000 Iraqi civilians and security force members had been killed by militant attacks and conflict, according to the United Nations.\nAs the Islamic State loses territory, it is shifting to insurgent tactics in Baghdad.\nProtests have been fairly muted so far, with grief for the dead still the overwhelming emotion for Iraqis. That is affording a bit of breathing space for Mr. Abadi, a Shiite who became prime minister in 2014 with the backing of American officials who believed he could reunite the country in the face of an onslaught by the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State.\nStill, analysts say, the bombing presents a political challenge. \u201cThis sort of violence can destroy the legitimacy of a leader,\u201d said Maria Fantappie, the Iraq analyst for the International Crisis Group.\nWith faith in his ability to unite the country and protect its citizens shaken, Mr. Abadi is likely to face further calls for his ouster, analysts said. They would also not rule out the possible return of street protesters, who twice this year stormed the fortified Green Zone, the secure area that houses government buildings, and ransacked Parliament.\n\u201cI think it will be a bad summer,\u201d Ms. Fantappie said of the prospect of further protests.\nMr. Abadi has long struggled to secure his power in the face of opposition from other Shiite leaders, including former Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. Mr. Maliki was pushed out in 2014, partly because Washington believed that he had pursued sectarian policies that alienated the Sunni minority and led to the rise of the Islamic State.\nEver since, Mr. Maliki has sought to undermine Mr. Abadi, and in an interview with the BBC just before the bombing, he said he would happily become prime minister again if \u201cthe country needs me.\u201d\nHakim al-Zamili, a Shiite lawmaker who is the head of Parliament\u2019s Security and Defense Committee, promised an investigation of the bombing and called for the resignations of the officials responsible for securing Baghdad.\nThe bombing, claimed by the Islamic State, took the glow off Iraq\u2019s recent recapture of Falluja from the militant group, a victory that had given Mr. Abadi a substantial political lift. It also undercut his assertion that the taking of Falluja was vital because it served as a haven near Baghdad for the assembly of car bombs.\nAfter the victory in Falluja, optimistic Iraqi officials talked excitedly about marching on Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, which fell to the Islamic State in 2014. But after this latest attack, that operation could be delayed, fulfilling another Islamic State goal. Each time the militant group has lost territory, it has launched attacks in Baghdad, forcing Iraqi officials to concern themselves with security in the capital.\nThe death toll continued to rise on Monday from the attack, which occurred as Iraqis were out enjoying one of the last evenings of the holy month of Ramadan. They had filled the cafes and shops of the area\u2019s malls, buying food and new clothes for Eid al-Fitr, the post-Ramadan celebration, and some were watching Italy and Germany play in the European championship soccer tournament.\nOfficials said Monday afternoon that 155 had been killed and that at least 192 had been wounded. Dozens of people were still unaccounted for, and many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition.\nIn its statement claiming responsibility, the Islamic State said it had targeted Shiites. But Karada is a reflection of Baghdad at its multicultural best, with Shiite and Sunni mosques and a smattering of churches. Iraqis of all identities were among the victims.\nHundreds of people gathered at Baghdad\u2019s morgue on Monday to try to identify bodies. A morgue worker, Samar Ali, said officials were taking DNA samples from people with missing relatives, in the hope of identifying otherwise unrecognizable bodies, which she said would take at least 16 days.\n\u201cThe suffering of the families will last for weeks until we are able to identify them,\u201d she said.\nIraqis on Monday turned to social media to mourn those they had lost, sharing pictures of loved ones and stories about them. There were many children among the dead, and many young men who were out on the town.\nOnce again, Iraq said goodbye to some of its best and brightest.\nOne of those was Ahmad Dhia, who had two young children and was working to advance Iraq\u2019s agricultural industry, writing research papers on how to improve crop production and working with ministries. His friends and family called his phone for hours on Sunday before his body was finally pulled from the rubble late in the evening.\nAnother was Adel Euro, who had founded a dance academy in Baghdad and was involved in protests last summer demanding the government tackle corruption. He was also affiliated with a New York-based dance company called Battery Dance, which mentored him online and worked with him last year in Amman, Jordan.\nIn honoring him on its Facebook page, Battery Dance used the words that Mr. Euro once wrote alongside a photograph of himself: \u201cSometimes in life, we need a few bad days in order to keep the good ones in perspective.\u201d"}, {"text": "Why Is It So Difficult for Syrian Refugees to Get Into the U.S.?\n2016-01-20T10:00:06.000Z\n\u2018We aren\u2019t the kind of family that sends our daughters to work,\u2019\u2019 Mahmoud al-Haj Ali told me one evening this fall. He\u2019d just returned to the family\u2019s dingy second-floor apartment in Aurora, Ill., from the warehouse where he and his 19-year-old daughter, Sham, sorted boxes. At work, Mahmoud tried to keep her in sight. \u2018\u2018I saw how tired she was,\u2019\u2019 he continued. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s more than she can take.\u2019\u2019 Sham\u2019s English classes provided only a shaky foundation in the language, and she struggled to negotiate basic conversations. Mahmoud also spoke little English \u2014 we were sitting with an interpreter \u2014 but he could manage the essential. Mahmoud work tomorrow, Mahmoud no work tomorrow, he said in self-parody. But he, too, was tired. He rolled up his sweatpants to reveal a swollen leg. In Syria, Mahmoud, 57, who once owned a flourishing locksmith business in the Emirates, would have already retired.\n\u2018\u2018We didn\u2019t expect it to be so expensive,\u2019\u2019 he said of life in Aurora, an industrial river town 41 miles from Chicago, where the al-Haj Alis arrived in March. \u2018\u2018What can we do?\u2019\u2019 The federal government and the nine nongovernmental agencies that help to relocate refugees in the United States select cities like Aurora because housing and jobs are readily available and the cost of living is relatively low. The al-Haj Alis also receive help with the rent from a local organization, the Syrian Community Network. Still, it isn\u2019t enough. Mahmoud and his wife, Azizeh, had been counting on their son Waseem, who is 27 and trained as a psychologist, to help support the family. His wife, Noorhan, and their two young sons were supposed to be in Aurora, too. But, at the last minute, something went wrong with their application to resettle in America. Now they were stuck in Jordan.\nMahmoud flipped through the spiral notebook in which he calculates monthly expenses: Internet, $52; garbage collection, $40; rent, $1,125; repayments on the United States government loan for the plane tickets from Amman to America, $172. Mahmoud went into his and Azizeh\u2019s bedroom and found the bill for the family\u2019s airfare: $6,130. \u2018\u2018Since I used to own a business, I like to record everything,\u2019\u2019 he said.\nMost nights, Mahmoud works at the warehouse until 11 before returning home with Sham. The al-Haj Alis\u2019 sons Ahmad and Mohamed arrive home around then, too, from six-hour after-school shifts at a local supermarket. Although they\u2019re twins, the boys, 17, dress and act as if they weren\u2019t. Mohamed, curls stiffened with gel, favors a tie. Ahmad, an artist, is often bed-headed and prefers sweatsuits. Every day he tucks a Syrian flag into his waistband before heading to West Aurora High School, despite the occasional trouble the flag invites. At the supermarket, he mans the cash register; he likes to interact with customers, in part to show off the Syrian identity to which he clings. Mohamed, who is shyer and speaks far less about Syria, prefers to herd the stray carts in the parking lot.\nNow, collapsed on the couch, the twins scrolled through homemade videos of Ahmad strolling around their new neighborhood in sunglasses and found footage showing the rubble of their hometown, 6,000 miles away. The al-Haj Ali family comes from Khirbet Ghazaleh, a town of 16,000. It is 15 miles from Daraa, where the revolution against Assad began, in 2011, after his security forces arrested and tortured a group of students for writing antigovernment slogans.\nThe al-Haj Ali twins were only 13 at the time. They had nothing to do with the protests. Nor did anyone else in the immediate family. Although they listened to news reports of the Assad government\u2019s ferocious attacks on civilians, they saw little indication, at first, of the violence around them. There was the odd black helicopter in the sky. And once, when Waseem was taking Azizeh to driving school, they watched a group of protesters carrying olive branches stream out of Daraa. Only later did they realize these were people fleeing a massacre by Assad\u2019s forces.\nThen the airstrikes began. Government security forces raided the family\u2019s home dozens of times. Their cousins, who lived next door, were imprisoned and tortured. Still, the al-Haj Alis hung on; they adapted to living in a war zone, spending evenings in the dark. Then, one morning in August 2012, they learned from a television news report that Azizeh\u2019s brother, a high-ranking official in Assad\u2019s military, had defected overnight to Jordan. His family would most likely be punished, with death, in his stead. He hadn\u2019t warned them. He couldn\u2019t: His phone was bugged, and sending a message would only have further endangered them. The al-Haj Alis never slept at home again. Within days, they left Syria for Jordan by car. Azizeh feared they\u2019d be unable to make it across the border and was even more terrified that the names of her family members would be on a blacklist and that they would be arrested. Mahmoud handed their keys to a neighbor whose house had been flattened by airstrikes. \u2018\u2018If we\u2019re not back by sunset,\u2019\u2019 he told her, \u2018\u2018you can have our house.\u2019\u2019\nThe war scattered the al-Haj Alis across the globe. Mahmoud, his wife, the twins and Sham made it to Aurora after a 30-month stay in Amman, Jordan. Two elder daughters, Rasha and Ruba, are in the Netherlands. Rasha arrived with her husband two years ago, and this fall Ruba followed. She and her three boys fled first to Morocco, then to Spain by boat, making their way on foot to an asylum center in the Nether\u00adlands, sharing a single room with two other families. (Ruba would like to bring her sons to America, but now that they are in a safe country, there is little chance of resettlement in the United States.) A third daughter, Rana, recently gave birth in Egypt; her 1-month-old is officially stateless. Another, Fatimah, is in Jordan. Yet the child of greatest concern to the family is their adult son, Waseem.\nThe al-Haj Alis worry he may never make it to Aurora. The family had been in Illinois for eight months when ISIS attacked in Paris, killing 130 people. Early reports claimed that one of the terrorists made his way to Europe by posing as a Syrian refugee. European countries imposed new border restrictions, and 31 American governors, including the governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, called for a moratorium on Syrian refugees. In December, when a militant couple shot up a center for the disabled in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14 and earning accolades from ISIS, the rhetoric grew more vociferous. A store clerk was shot in Michigan, a Somali restaurant was set ablaze in North Dakota and anti-Muslim hate crimes spiked around the United States.\nAzizeh wondered if she had brought her sons from Syria only to put them at risk in America, and if Waseem would ever join them now.\nThe al-Haj Alis are five of the 2,647 Syrian refugees who have been resettled in the United States, roughly 0.06 percent of the more than 4.5 million driven from the country since the uprising began in 2011. The scale of the crisis is such that of the 20 million refugees flooding the world today, one in four is Syrian. Although President Obama has committed to bringing at least 10,000 more Syrians to the United States by this October, that number is still a trickle compared with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s effort to resettle 25,000 in Canada; Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s acceptance of nearly 93,000 in Germany last fall; and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s promise to bring 30,000 more Syrian refugees to France over the next two years. Why has the United States taken so few?\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s extremely difficult to get into the United States as a refugee \u2014 the odds of winning the Powerball are probably better,\u2019\u2019 says David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, which helps place refugees from 40 countries in American cities. And Syrians are subject to an extra degree of vetting. Although all refugees are screened by the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I., the Defense Department, the State Department and United States Customs and Border Protection, among other intelligence agencies, Syrians must complete what is known as the Enhanced Syrian Review. This is an added screening by caseworkers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in Washington, which assesses each Syrian case and selects some for processing through the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate office. This extra step was put in place because of the difficulty of assessing the allegiances of the various rebel groups in Syria\u2019s continuing war \u2014 what Barbara Strack, chief of the Refugee Affairs Division at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, describes as \u2018\u2018the myriad actors and dynamic nature of the conflict.\u2019\u2019\nUntil recently, Syria\u2019s refugees were not a pressing domestic political concern. To many Americans, the war in Syria seemed remote, a problem for Syria\u2019s neighbors. Of greater import were the 11 million immigrants who had entered the United States illegally. Then last summer, images of the Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi lying dead on the Turkish shore mobilized American sympathies in favor of refugees, and the Obama administration found itself faulted for admitting so few. Quietly, President Obama directed Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, to work with the State Department to find out why vetting for Syrian refugees required 18 to 24 months.\nMcDonough, known for urging Obama to be cautious in engaging militarily in Syria, took the issue of refugees personally. As a Catholic growing up in Stillwater, Minn., the 10th of 11 children, he worked with his church to help arriving Vietnamese refugees. Now, carrying a stack of charts and graphs, he met with refugee advocates and members of Congress to learn about the pitfalls and procedural bottlenecks within the resettlement program and to study potential means of bringing Syrians more quickly to the United States without compromising on security. In closed-door National Security Council meetings last year, he advised State Department officials to lift bureaucratic hurdles. As a result, the United States has opened up refugee-processing centers in new locations that refugees can actually reach, including one in Erbil, in northern Iraq. By streamlining the process of resettling Syrian refugees, the Obama administration also hoped to demonstrate support for its European allies. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s important to the president\u2019s view to show our allies overseas, who are taking a considerable influx of Syrians, that we support them and we\u2019re doing our part,\u2019\u2019 McDonough told me recently.\nParis threatened to change everything. The Syrian passport found near the body of one mili\u00adtant turned out to be a fake, but at least two of the attackers had exploited the refugee routes from the Middle East to Europe. Overnight, the global good will toward refugees that had been building all but vanished. Suddenly, the images of hundreds of thousands of refugees heading north inspired not empathy but alarm. According to the Soufan Group, a New York-based company that provides security-intelligence services, between 27,000 and 31,000 foreign fighters have gone to Iraq or Syria since the start of Syria\u2019s civil war, the vast majority to fight alongside ISIS. At least 10 percent have headed back home. What once seemed like a trickle of vulnerable civilians now looked, to some, like a potentially dangerous flood.\nRepublican presidential candidates seized on the Syrian refugee issue as proof that Obama wasn\u2019t keeping Americans safe. Dr. Ben Carson conflated Syrian refugees with \u2018\u2018rabid dogs.\u2019\u2019 Jeb Bush called for deprioritizing Muslim refugees from the Middle East in favor of Christians. Senator Ted Cruz echoed this sentiment, proclaiming that Muslims should be sent to \u2018\u2018Muslim-majority\u2019\u2019 countries while \u2018\u2018Christians who are being targeted for genocide, for persecution, Christians who are being beheaded or crucified, we should be providing safe haven to them.\u2019\u2019 Donald Trump upped the ante by calling for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States.\nIn November, Republicans and some Democrats rallied behind House Bill 4038, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, introduced by Representative Michael T. McCaul of Texas to slow the arrival of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the United States. Days before the House vote, McDonough and Jeh Johnson, secretary of homeland security, briefed members of Congress on the Syrian-refugee-resettlement program and its screening process, in an attempt to reassure them that such a measure was unnecessary. The House nonetheless voted in favor of the bill, and as 2015 drew to a close, the Syrian refugee issue was at risk of becoming part of the year-end omnibus bill amid discussions of a government shutdown.\nIn the face of mounting political opposition, the president, in a choreographed Trudeau-esque gesture at the National Archives in Washington, welcomed 31 people from 25 countries at their citizenship ceremony. In private, McDonough rang up supporters and opponents alike. \u2018\u2018Every phone call I\u2019ve had with my friends on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democrat, and with governors around the country, I\u2019ve underscored that we recognize the fear,\u2019\u2019 McDonough told me. He spoke of the need to \u2018\u2018send a message\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018the Assad regime and to ISIL that the United States will continue to play the role that it has, that the world has become accustomed to it playing \u2014 mainly the role of alleviating suffering at the source and of being a refuge for the most vulnerable people.\u2019\u2019\nThe Syrian crisis is often described as a crisis of migration, but that\u2019s not how it began. \u2018\u2018This exodus didn\u2019t come out of nowhere,\u2019\u2019 says Dr. Zaher Sahloul, senior adviser for the Syrian American Medical Society. The war in Syria has left some 250,000 people dead and displaced millions. And Syrian-American activists often refer to it as Obama\u2019s Rwanda. \u2018\u2018From Day 1 of the Syrian catastrophe,\u2019\u2019 says Bassam Barabandi, co-founder of the organization People Demand Change, \u2018\u2018the U.S. started signing checks to the U.N., but they missed the point.\u2019\u2019 The point, he said, is ending the war, not creating a welfare state made up of refugees.\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s not a zero-sum choice,\u2019\u2019 Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Blinken, who served as Obama\u2019s national security adviser before returning to the State Department, where he began his career, has been asked by the White House to handle the thorny refugee issue. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re working 36 hours a day to solve the war in Syria,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018but meanwhile, what do you do about the huge immediate challenge of more than four million people displaced from their country?\u2019\u2019\nFor millions of Syrians, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan have become vast waiting rooms. \u2018\u2018The two biggest drivers of onward migration are lack of access to education and lack of access to work,\u2019\u2019 Blinken told me recently, at the United States Embassy in Amman. The United States frequently trumpets the fact that of the countries donating to the United Nations in support of Syrian refugees, it gives the most aid, much of it going to front-line countries. But this is in part a self-serving strategy. The United States supports Syria\u2019s neighbors so that they can withstand the pressures of millions of additional people. Refugees place a large burden on natural resources and social services. As a result, relations between Syrians and their hosts are souring. (Jordanians, groaning under the burden of 633,000 refugees, joke darkly that they live \u2018\u2018between Iraq and a hard place.\u2019\u2019) Part of American strategy in the region has been to ease tensions between Syrians and their hosts. The United States provides services (schools and hospitals) for the refugees as well as for the citizens of host countries. They also allocate money for development to keep the host country happy. In Jordan, Blinken had just attended a falafel lunch with Jordanian venture capitalists who started a fund, with United States government support, to incubate technology start-ups.\nResettlement in the United States, however, remains a political challenge. \u2018\u2018This is where ISIL neatly joins the problem,\u2019\u2019 Blinken said. \u2018\u2018Very few of the refugees we admit are young males without families \u2014 we focus on women, children, the sick and those vulnerable to violence. But you now have this new concern that these refugee populations will somehow be infiltrated by terrorists.\u2019\u2019 In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, European countries hardened their stance on refugees, making illegal migration more difficult by closing borders. (For the first time in 50 years, for instance, those crossing between Denmark and Sweden have to show photo ID.) Turkey is under pressure to do the same. Recently, after receiving promises of $3.25 billion in aid from the E.U., Turkey reportedly arrested 1,300 asylum seekers trying to cross the sea to Greece.\nThe refugees already in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan are more likely to be stuck there, which means that a humanitarian crisis is becoming an economic-development problem. Syrians, many of whom lived sophisticated lives, are often unable to access even the most basic services. \u2018\u2018These are people who had microwaves and cars, and now they\u2019re in tin boxes in the desert,\u2019\u2019 says Jonathan Campbell of the World Food Program. The key factor in their migration is hopelessness. This past fall, the W.F.P. sent text messages to 230,000 Syrians living in Jordan to tell them that their food benefits were going to be substantially reduced because of lack of funding and donor fatigue. (They were later restored.) Although the United States made a large pledge, other countries, facing financial crises at home, did not. As a result, 64 percent of the refugees told the W.F.P. they were going to be forced to leave the country. One family out of every four took a child out of school to work. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not a pull factor that makes them move, it\u2019s a push factor,\u2019\u2019 says Myriam Baele, head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees\u2019 refugee-resettlement unit in Jordan. \u2018\u2018If there isn\u2019t a means to survive here, they will go,\u2019\u2019 she went on. \u2018\u2018Either to Europe or back to Syria, where they will die.\u2019\u2019\nWaseem al-Haj Ali and his wife, Noorhan, keep two blue suitcases packed in the apartment they once shared with their family in Amman. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a nightmare,\u2019\u2019 Waseem said on a recent evening. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no future here in Jordan. I can\u2019t even get a driver\u2019s license.\u2019\u2019 In exasperation, he raised his eyebrows, bushy like his father\u2019s. The apartment\u2019s peeling walls were covered in blue and purple flowers, drawn by his brother Ahmad before he left for America.\nEarly last spring in Amman, when the al-Haj Alis were all still together, Waseem, Noorhan and their sons, who are 4 and 2, cleared the Enhanced Syrian Review and completed four days of cul\u00adtural-orientation classes \u2014 which include everything from pictures of what to pack (warm clothing and money) and what not to (weapons and illegal drugs) to the importance Americans place on such concepts as punctuality and pri\u00advacy. These courses are offered only to those who are in the process of resettling in the United States. Noorhan, who had been studying in Syria to become a teacher and whose dark eyes glitter with an easy intelligence, paid special attention to the weather. \u2018\u2018Arizona is like the gulf,\u2019\u2019 she recalled learning. \u2018\u2018Hot, dry and full of snakes.\u2019\u2019\nTen days before Waseem and his family were scheduled to leave, they had completed everything but their medical exams. Then they received a call from the Americans: They couldn\u2019t go just yet. Something had come up in their security clearance, Waseem recalled being told. In retrospect, Waseem\u2019s parents wonder if they should have waited for him. The plan had always been for Waseem to support the family: Azizeh had three ruptured disks and needed back surgery; Mahmoud had an old leg injury. But if the al-Haj Alis had delayed and lost their place in line, they might never have gotten to America. Waseem now feels guilty that he encouraged them to go ahead. He wasn\u2019t sure his parents could make it without him. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m trying to be patient for my parents,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If it weren\u2019t for them, I would\u2019ve already left.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2018If we don\u2019t get a call from the Americans before smuggling season begins in the spring, we\u2019ll leave for Europe,\u2019\u2019 he went on. The last thing he and his wife wanted to do was take two toddlers over the sea. Like everyone else, they had seen the photos of Alan on the beach. Their children couldn\u2019t swim, and neither could Noorhan. But what choice did they have?\n\u2018\u2018We think only about traveling,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018All we want is to go the United States.\u2019\u2019 Day after day, he checked the news on Facebook and chatted with his mother in Aurora. \u2018\u2018We hope to live in a simple house, with a car outside, and just to watch our kids grow up,\u2019\u2019 Noorhan said. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s it. We don\u2019t want a palace or some luxury life.\u2019\u2019\nWhen the rest of his family left in March, Waseem thought he would have to wait for about a month at the most. One month was now eight. As it grew colder, he stopped walking along the highway looking for illegal construction jobs. The market for day laborers was drying up. He didn\u2019t dare ask for work in the strip of neon-lit shawarma stands downtown, even though many were staffed by fellow refu\u00adgees. If he was caught working, Waseem could be imprisoned, transferred to the refugee camps, where only the poorest of the poor live, or sent back to Syria. Still, he had to find a way to pay the $247 rent on the apartment he once shared with his parents. He and Noorhan relied increasingly on whatever Mahmoud could send back from America. Instead of helping to support his parents, he was taking from them. \u2018\u2018My father used to be a wealthy man,\u2019\u2019 Waseem said, recalling Mahmoud\u2019s locksmith business in Abu Dhabi. Once the war began, Mahmoud sold the business for $120,000. For nearly five years, that money supported more than a dozen family members in five different countries. Now the money was gone.\nAmong Syrian refugees, \u2018\u2018on hold\u2019\u2019 is the most dreaded category. It is extremely difficult to get clear answers about why the hold has been applied or when it will be lifted. To try to learn more, Waseem designated The New York Times as a third party with the legal right to inquire about his case. In response to an email from The Times in November, the International Organization for Migration would say only that Waseem\u2019s case \u2018\u2018is currently on hold pending further review by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\u2019\u2019\nOfficials cannot comment on individual cases, but when briefed on the case as a hypothetical, immigration officers and resettlement experts offered several possible explanations: It could be as simple as an applicant\u2019s security clearance having expired while a family member waited to be vetted. Or maybe Waseem\u2019s name sounds like a name on a terrorist watch-list. Or maybe, at the very last minute, \u2018\u2018recurrent vetting\u2019\u2019 raised a red flag. Recurrent vetting, which began in 2015, checks names through a series of databases right up to when the flight lands in the United States. As a senior intelligence officer with the National Counterterrorism Center described it: \u2018\u2018If you have an 800 credit score and you\u2019re good for a new Visa card, and two weeks from now they find out that, hey, two years ago, you changed your name to cover up a prior bankruptcy, then they can take away that card.\u2019\u2019\nOr maybe it was Azizeh\u2019s brother. As a former military member of the Assad regime, he might still count as a black mark. Even though he defected early on, he could, by some bureaucratic oversight, still be designated a security risk to the United States. When reached in Qatar this fall, via Skype, he expressed relief that all of his family had made it out of Syria alive. He, too, was searching for a new country. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not looking for beauty or history,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m looking for a country with human rights and freedom.\u2019\u2019 Other family members described specific questions regarding Azizeh\u2019s brother posed to them by American immigration officers in Jordan. For example, did they serve him coffee or tea when he was in their homes? This was most likely a question to determine whether the family had provided material support \u2014 which could include a cup of coffee, a glass of water, a ride \u2014 to someone designated to be an enemy of the United States.\nAs months passed with no answers, Waseem turned over the strange questions he was asked during his final interview. Could these hold the key to the predicament in which he now found himself? Did he intend to commit terrorism in the United States? No. Did he intend to visit a prostitute in the United States? No. Refugees often refer to questions like the last one as \u2018\u2018the crazy questions,\u2019\u2019 a senior immigration official told me: queries that, by law, immigration officials must ask to determine grounds of inadmissibility, even though they\u2019re anachronistic. Others include Are you a member of the Nazi Party? and Are you a habitual drunkard?\nThe system of vetting refugees was first overhauled after Sept. 11. Since then, America\u2019s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and conflicts in Africa and Asia have led to further refinements in how the United States evaluates refugees. Since 2007, for instance, the Defense Department has worked with the Homeland Security Department to share its intelligence on Iraqis, who represent one of the largest influxes of refugees to the United States in the last decade (more than 85,000 since 2008). Many won the right to apply for admission to the United States after risking their lives to aid American soldiers. Yet, as these Iraqis began to arrive, opposition to resettling them was swift. It began, for the most part, with fringe groups. Ann Corcoran, a conservative from rural Maryland, started a blog called Refugee Resettlement Watch, in which she chronicles news re\u00adlated to Muslims and others arriving in the United States. She warns that Muslims are coming to build \u2018\u2018cities within cities\u2019\u2019 and to establish Shariah law in America. Corcoran told me that in Iowa last spring, she handed her book, \u2018\u2018Refugee Resettlement and Hijra to America,\u2019\u2019 directly to Donald Trump.\nResettling refugees isn\u2019t a perfect process. \u2018\u2018No immigration program is completely without risk,\u2019\u2019 a senior intelligence officer says. Yet over more than a decade, the United States agencies involved in the program have learned to communicate more effectively. \u2018\u2018We got a lot smarter and developed additional relationships with the intelligence community beginning with the large-scale Iraqi processing in 2007,\u2019\u2019 Strack, of U.S.C.I.S., says. She adds, \u2018\u2018We are the opposite of stove-piped \u2014 we\u2019re incredibly networked.\u2019\u2019\nOne common misconception about how a Syrian refugee comes to America is that she simply approaches the United States Embassy in Jordan or Turkey or wherever she first lands. This is not how resettlement works. To be legally designated a refugee, she must first apply to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. U.N.H.C.R. takes a photograph and scans her iris. Verification can take anywhere from a couple of months to a few years before she\u2019s interviewed in person. Although these interviews aren\u2019t considered security vetting, caseworkers are trained to eliminate those who may be lying, as well as those who have persecuted others or may be war criminals.\nIn addition to collecting biometric data like iris scans and photographs, U.N.H.C.R. case officers are trained in basic facial recognition and have 2-D screening capabilities to detect fake passports. The goal is to make sure people meet the criteria of the refugee convention, established after World War II. They\u2019re also experts in country-of-origin information. \u2018\u2018Listen, I know where your school is, I know the colors of its walls,\u2019\u2019 one U.N.H.C.R. officer says. \u2018\u2018We detect lies based on what\u2019s happened in the country of origin. It\u2019s not just hour-by-hour events; it\u2019s ethnicity, region, family. We know the custom \u2014 we know what their dresses look like.\u2019\u2019\nU.N.H.C.R. then advocates for the most vulnerable 10 percent; the other 90 percent will have to make a new life as best they can. Of the 20 million refugees worldwide, less than 1 percent will be officially resettled, and of those, the United States takes about half. Resettlement is only one of three options. The others are returning home (which, for most Syrians, is impossible) or remaining in the host country (which, given the pressures Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon are under, is becoming increasingly difficult). Those either barred or \u2018\u2018deprioritized\u2019\u2019 include individuals with certain military ties, as well as families with missing members. This is to guard against the possibility that the missing member may be fighting alongside an anti-American group like ISIS and later try to rejoin his family.\nSyrians, like other refugees, don\u2019t choose the country they end up in. U.N.H.C.R. selects the best option based on various criteria specified by host countries, like those from the most vulnerable groups or victims of torture. But there are limits to the requests countries can make. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re not a labor department,\u2019\u2019 a senior U.N.H.C.R. official said. \u2018\u2018If countries come to us asking for a particular religion, we don\u2019t encourage that.\u2019\u2019\nAll of this takes place before U.N.H.C.R. refers the case to any one country. Once U.N.H.C.R. provides a complete file to the United States, then the applicant\u2019s entire family visits the State Department\u2019s Resettlement Support Center for a prescreening interview. At this point, each individual is run through several databases, including ones at the Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I. and the Department of Defense, and entered into the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System, which warehouses the data and facilitates interagency screening checks. A pilot program will soon include iris scans, which are currently used by U.N.H.C.R. only for identification, not security purposes.\nThis fall, in several closed-door classified briefings before Congress and in public hearings, Anne C. Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, defended the rigorous vetting process. Of the more than 784,000 refugees who have been admitted to the United States in the last 14 years, five have been arrested on terrorism-related charges: One was an Uzbek man arrested in Idaho; the other four were refugees from Iraq. Such mistakes have provided fodder for those who worry that the country is exposing itself to needless risk. \u2018\u2018ISIS has vowed to send its operatives into the West posing as refugees,\u2019\u2019 says McCaul, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. \u2018\u2018The threat is real.\u2019\u2019 Advocates say that the threat of a refugee being a terrorist is statistically negligible. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t leave holes, and we don\u2019t take chances,\u2019\u2019 Richard told me. \u2018\u2018If there\u2019s any doubt about someone, they don\u2019t come.\u2019\u2019 Indeed, as Le\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, director of U.S.C.I.S., recently testified in Congress, the United States has barred 30 individuals from entering \u2018\u2018based on their showing up in the databases.\u2019\u2019 (When queried, a senior intelligence official would say only that there were individuals of \u2018\u2018national security concern.\u2019\u2019) Emily Gray, the executive director in Aurora of World Relief, a branch of the agency assigned by the United States government to help resettle the al-Haj Ali family, says, \u2018\u2018You\u2019d have to be a really stupid terrorist to come this way.\u2019\u2019\nAfter the U.S.C.I.S. officers in Washington conduct the enhanced review, the entire family is scheduled for another interview with a member of the Refugee Affairs Division, a team of 10 to 14 immigration officers from U.S.C.I.S. who spend six weeks on \u2018\u2018circuit rides\u2019\u2019 \u2014 traveling up to four times a year to Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and other locations in the region, interviewing refugees being considered for resettlement in the United States.\n\u2018\u2018Just having an interview doesn\u2019t sound so secure, but this is one heck of an interview,\u2019\u2019 Richard says. \u2018\u2018First off, refugees are people fleeing tyrannical governments, so they may not trust people in positions of authority. They may be used to lying. They have to be prepared to have this interview, and if they\u2019re caught lying, then they\u2019re not going to make it, no matter how worthy.\u2019\u2019 At the end of this process, there are four possible outcomes: immediate acceptance, which is rare and can still involve waiting another 18 months, especially if there is a new marriage or birth; acceptance pending verification; denial; and the limbo into which Waseem al-Haj Ali and his family have now fallen, \u2018\u2018on hold.\u2019\u2019\nFrom Jordan, one afternoon late this fall, Waseem called his mother in Chicago. \u2018\u2018How are you?\u2019\u2019 he asked. He hadn\u2019t anticipated her reply. She was fine, thank God, she said, but there was something wrong at the twins\u2019 school. The night before, she received a call from the school saying there would be police there the next day and it was fine if the boys stayed home. She wasn\u2019t sure what that meant or if other Syrians had received the same call. Azizeh sent the boys anyway. They survived airstrikes and house-to-house raids by Assad\u2019s security forces; they could face American high school. \u2018\u2018Oh,\u2019\u2019 Waseem said, and hung up. He and Noorhan were taken aback. What if, after all they had endured, his parents or Sham or the twins were hurt in America? Waseem was the one who was supposed to protect them, and all he could do was sit on the couch in Amman and accept handouts from his father.\n\u2018\u2018The worst thing is this game of waiting,\u2019\u2019 Issam Smeir, a psychologist in Aurora with World Relief who has counseled the al-Haj Alis, says. \u2018\u2018It kills your soul.\u2019\u2019\nThe situation unfolding at West Aurora High wasn\u2019t quite as Azizeh understood it. Ron Murphy, an assistant principal of operations at the high school, explained that yes, the Aurora police were called in as a precaution (Mohamed even snapped a selfie with an officer). But it had nothing to do with the boys. After a student tweeted his support for Trump and Trump\u2019s stance on immigration, a Twitter war broke out. Even though there was no credible threat, the school took steps to reassure parents and defuse the situation. More than half of the school\u2019s population is Hispanic.\nThe issue was immigration, not Islam, Murphy said. The school district models diversity remarkably; the twins were enrolled alongside Iraqis, Nepalis, Bangladeshis and immigrants from 57 countries in a curriculum for students learning English. Ahmad and Mohamed grumbled about it; these kids were uncool, and they only saw regular Americans during gym class.\nOutside school, the opposition to Syrian refugees wore on: In nearby Indiana, a Syrian family had to be rerouted to Connecticut because of the governor\u2019s opposition. In an attempt to block the arrival of another Syrian family, Texas sued the International Rescue Committee, the resettlement agency working with that family, as well as the federal government.\nIn Congress, as the year drew to a close, House Bill 4038, which would have barred Syr\u00adian refugees, at least for a time, never came to the floor of the Senate, nor was it part of the omnibus \u2014 a pair of victories for McDonough and the White House. Instead, the mass shooting in San Bernardino refocused national security concerns on the visa-waiver program, which the administration had long seen as a problem.\nIn January 2016, even as rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, key players in the war in Syria, imperiled upcoming cease-fire negotiations at the U.N. The Senate stood poised to consider new legislation that would halt the arrival of Syrian refugees. \u2018\u2018We cannot stand by while jihadists try to exploit humanitarian programs to reach our shores undetected,\u2019\u2019 Michael McCaul, who sponsored 4038, said, citing serious screening gaps. Senator Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, who recently introduced a similar bill in the Senate, also supports such legislation. \u2018\u2018Reputable media outlets are uncovering examples of how terrorists infiltrate the Iraq and Syria refugee programs in an effort to commit acts of violence against the American people and our allies,\u2019\u2019 Kirk said. \u2018\u2018Common sense requires thoughtful measures to keep Americans safe.\u2019\u2019\nOne winter afternoon, not long after the incident at the boys\u2019 school, Azizeh nursed a cup of tea and talked bleakly of the family\u2019s future. What if the governor had the power to keep Waseem out of Illinois? And if he couldn\u2019t come, what would they do? Then there were the boys. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m worried someone will target them,\u2019\u2019 she said.\nShe also worried about herself and Sham. The long coats and hijabs they wore when they went out might attract the wrong kind of attention. Sham had come to America at the worst age possible. At 19, she wasn\u2019t eligible to attend high school, and her English was too poor to pursue her dreams of becoming a lawyer. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s too expensive,\u2019\u2019 Sham said. \u2018\u2018It would take too many years.\u2019\u2019\nTo secure a future for her, her parents had accepted the marriage proposal of an Iraqi used-car salesman named Layth Alali, Azizeh told me. Fifteen years older than Sham, Alali came to the country on a much-coveted Special Immigrant Visa in 2010, as part of the group of Iraqis who had worked with the United States military. (In Baghdad, he was the head of a checkpoint set up by the Americans.) The whole thing was rushed; he had asked just two weeks earlier, and the engagement ceremony was taking place immediately.\nAfter picking Sham and Azizeh up in a BMW S.U.V., Alali drove them to a prom-dress shop in Aurora, and they had less than an hour to find a dress. Sham picked out a spangled strapless confection, but Azizeh worried it exposed too much flesh. \u2018\u2018Problem, problem, problem,\u2019\u2019 she said, pointing to her daughter\u2019s bare neck, arms and shoulders. In the end, she snapped a picture and sent it via WhatsApp to her daughter-in-law, Noorhan, who was, as usual, sitting idle in the apartment in Jordan. A few seconds later, Noorhan sent back a smiley-face emoji with hearts for eyes. The dress, however flawed, was a yes.\nIn a life marked by disappointment and compromise, Azizeh remarked, what did the dress really matter? As a married woman, Sham would be more secure, and so would her family. At least, Azizeh said, Sham would no longer have to work in the office-supply warehouse.\nThe family had other concerns. The boys needed hundreds of dollars of dental work that Medicaid didn\u2019t cover. The al-Haj Alis were struggling to make the rent, and winter was coming, which meant a new bill for heating. Azizeh was trying to figure out what kind of program might help pay the gas bill. As the temperature dropped and it grew dark at 4:30 in the afternoon, Ahmad and Mohamed seemed to be slowing down; Azizeh had to prod them off the couch to get them to work at the market.\nSchool was still a challenge. After nearly a year, neither spoke enough English to hold a conversation. Unlike their fellow refugees, who learned English by watching television and American movies, the boys preferred to spend their downtime watching Arabic-language news about Syria or YouTube videos from home.\nFor a long time, when they looked on Google Earth, they could see the debris of their family\u2019s homes, which had been either burned or bombed. Now a mysterious white film obscured satellite images of the town. Was it a glitch, or a security measure on the part of the Assad regime to protect this strategic town, which now serves as a military base?\nIf Ahmad and Mohamed had stayed in Syria, they might be dead by now \u2014 either killed by the Assad government\u2019s barrel bombs or fallen among the young men who have joined up with the Free Syrian Army. When one of their friends or cousins fighting with the F.S.A. is killed, the boys study the photographs of his death, often posted on Facebook in tribute, with a mixture of envy and guilt.\nIssam Smeir, the World Relief counselor, met with the al-Haj Ali family to help them handle the psychological stress of Waseem\u2019s unexpected absence. He was watching for signs of depression in the boys. \u2018\u2018Depression in kids doesn\u2019t look like sadness,\u2019\u2019 Smeir said. \u2018\u2018It looks like restlessness and anger.\u2019\u2019 The biggest argument that Ahmad has had at school involved fellow Syrians who support the Assad regime. The two sides got into a fight over which flag was the true Syrian flag \u2014 the one belonging to the Assad regime, or the revolutionary flag that Ahmad tucks into his waistband.\n\u2018\u2018Students ask about what Syria was like before the war,\u2019\u2019 Ahmad said at home after work one evening. \u2018\u2018We say it was beautiful. It\u2019s kind of baffling how people feel that the value of those who die in France is higher than those who die in countries like Iraq or Syria.\u2019\u2019 That day at school, during their first-period English class, their reading-comprehension portion involved a lesson about Cappadocia, Turkey, where people built an underground city to protect themselves during invasions. Afterward, the teacher handed out work sheets quizzing the kids on what they had learned. Why did people in Turkey live underground? The answer was B: to hide from their enemies. But Ahmad circled C: to live.\nThree days later, a text came in from Noorhan. More American politicians were opposing Syrians, and what she and Waseem had been reading on Facebook made them think the United States was shutting its borders tighter than ever. It looked as if they were going to have to take their boys over the sea. \u2018\u2018After all the news,\u2019\u2019 she wrote, \u2018\u2018we have no hope to travel to America.\u2019\u2019"}, {"text": "Carrie Fisher, Trump, Israel: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing\n2016-12-28T22:56:13.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email?

But that was before \u201cBrexit.\u201d\nThe vote by Britons to leave the European Union was, among other things, part of an argument over national identity: how much of the outside to let in, what (and, sometimes with ugly overtones, who) defines Britishness in a global age.\n\u201cThe Great British Baking Show\u201d (titled \u201cThe Great British Bake Off\u201d in Britain), which returns Friday on PBS, is hardly a political program. But it engages similar ideas in its own meringue-light way.\nIn structure, this is a typical cooking competition, in which a dozen bakers execute tall challenges and face weekly eliminations. (The current season \u2014 which is the third to air in the United States but was the sixth in Britain \u2014 has already finished on the BBC, so beware online spoilers.)\nThere\u2019s a cheerful town-fair vibe: no trash talk; the occasional low-key drama over a runny custard; plenty of saucy puns from the hosts, Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc. (Referencing the distinctive fissure on a Madeira cake: \u201cBakers, time to reveal your cracks!\u201d)\nThe confections tower like Nelson\u2019s Column; the whipped cream mounds up like fog on the heath. For an airy, refreshing summer diversion, you need no more.\nWhat distinguishes the show is how national identity is baked into the concept. It presents a firm, if tongue in cheek, notion of Britishness as something you can feel and taste, but something that is evolving as well.\nThe challenges are held under a tent, against a backdrop of pastoral green, little Union Jack pennants bordering the work area. There\u2019s a great deal of attention to what constitutes a \u201cproper\u201d British dessert. These pronouncements are often handed down, in a voice of pure English cream, by the delightfully authoritative judge Mary Berry (working together with the celebrity baker Paul Hollywood).\nBut the amateurs turning out the tarts make a diverse picture of modern Britain \u2014 including contestants of Lithuanian, Filipino and Bangladeshi heritage \u2014 the various concoctions incorporating jackfruit and cilantro into the traditional biscuits and soda breads.\nFood is heritage, but the world comes in through the kitchen window. The \u201cEnglish\u201d classics featured in the challenges are replete with international connections (Black Forest g\u00e2teau) and flavored with the fruits of empire (nutmeg, clove, pepper).\nSo the show\u2019s notion of what it means to be a great British baker is less about nostalgia than synthesis. Kitchen citizenship means being able to reproduce the country\u2019s pastry patrimony and recognize its formal requirements. But you also need to advance it, putting something of yourself into it.\nThe tension between classicism and creativity is part of nearly any cooking show \u2014 you don\u2019t win with boring. But here, it\u2019s also about the interpretation of culture, the idea of nationhood as something that requires both continuity and growth.\nNadiya Hussain, a Luton-born Muslim contestant who wears a hijab, seems to describe this idea as she stirs cardamom into her Madeira cake batter in the first episode. Too much of the spice tastes \u201cmedicinal,\u201d she says; too little, and you don\u2019t get the flavor. \u201cIt\u2019s finding a balance,\u201d she says.\nAs it is with Britain, so is it with \u201cThe Great British Baking Show.\u201d Even as the country\u2019s politics turn inward, it continues to stir in the spice."}, {"text": "Kofi Annan, in Myanmar, Voices Concern Over Reported Abuses of Rohingya\n2016-12-06T17:30:46.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 Kofi Annan, the former head of the United Nations, said in Myanmar on Tuesday that he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by reports of human rights abuses in the country\u2019s restive Rakhine State, where dozens of Rohingya Muslims are said to have been killed since October in a crackdown by the military.\nMr. Annan, who leads a commission that was formed in August to study conditions in Rakhine, spoke to reporters at the end of a weeklong visit to Myanmar, which included a trip to the northern areas of northern Rakhine where the army has been conducting a counterinsurgency campaign. Activists have relayed stories of rapes, arson, targeted killings and other atrocities said to have been committed against the Rohingya there by the army since Oct. 9, when insurgents killed nine police officers in attacks on border posts.\n\u201cWe stressed in all our meetings that wherever security operations might be necessary, civilians must be protected at all times, and I urge the security services to act in full compliance with the rule of law,\u201d Mr. Annan said on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe also stressed that security operations must not impede humanitarian access to the population,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been given the assurance that humanitarian assistance is allowed access and trust that all communities in need will receive the assistance they require.\u201d\nRights groups have reported that some villages in the area have been sealed off by the military, and that organizations that provide food aid and other assistance have been denied access.\nMr. Annan\u2019s commission was formed with backing from Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, weeks before the military crackdown began in October. The panel is expected to make recommendations to the government in late 2017 for alleviating Rakhine\u2019s ethnic strife and impoverished conditions.\nBut the panel has faced criticism from multiple directions. Some rights groups have accused it of playing down the Rohingya\u2019s plight, while some critics in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, say it has advocated for the Rohingya at the expense of Rakhine\u2019s Buddhist majority, some of whom clashed with the Rohingya in 2012 in a spasm of violence further south in the state that left dozens dead.\nPerhaps the only point of agreement among the critics has been that they expect the panel to do little to improve the dire situation in Rakhine.\nSpeaking of Mr. Annan, Syed Hamid Albar, a former Malaysian foreign minister and the special Myanmar envoy for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, said, \u201cHe\u2019s a former secretary general, a very experienced diplomat and very well accepted, and he does not want a repeat of Rwanda\u201d in Southeast Asia, referring to that African country\u2019s 1994 genocide.\nHowever, speaking about the panel\u2019s members, he said, \u201cThe perception outside is that, even facing this serious situation, they don\u2019t seem to be able to move.\u201d\nThe Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, as Mr. Annan\u2019s commission is formally known, was created at the Myanmar government\u2019s behest, and in collaboration with Mr. Annan\u2019s charitable foundation, as a \u201cneutral and impartial body, which aims to propose concrete measures for improving the welfare of all people in Rakhine State,\u201d according to its website. It has six experts from Myanmar and three from overseas, including Mr. Annan. None of its members are Rohingya.\nSome human rights experts said the commission\u2019s mandate was flawed from the start. Myanmar, they note, has said that the panel will operate in accordance with a 1982 law that is used to deny the Rohingya citizenship, on the pretext that they are not among Myanmar\u2019s recognized \u201cnational races.\u201d\nAnother problem, they said, is that the commission\u2019s mandate focuses broadly on development and does not take an investigative approach to human rights violations, which they argue is essential, especially in light of the recent deaths.\nMatthew Smith, the chief executive of Fortify Rights, a Southeast Asia-based advocacy group that has monitored human rights violations in Rakhine, likened the commission\u2019s approach to \u201csending an ill-equipped plumber to fix an electrical problem.\u201d\n\u201cWe want the commission to succeed and we welcomed it, but if the commission isn\u2019t careful, it may inadvertently participate in a whitewash,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an email.\nWhile the crackdown in Rakhine began in response to the killings of police officers in October, human rights groups say the response has been disproportionate to the scale of the threat, especially because the area, along the border with Bangladesh, has never been a hotbed of Islamic militancy. Thousands of the Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, and the United Nations human rights agency has said that abuses against the Rohingya may amount to crimes against humanity.\nThe crackdown has led to growing international criticism, including by the government of Malaysia, a Muslim-majority nation, whose Foreign Ministry has called it \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d Prime Minister Najib Razak led a rally on Sunday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2019s capital, protesting the crackdown in Rakhine.\nAt the rally, Mr. Najib singled out Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate, as not having done enough to prevent the bloodshed. \u201cDoes she really have a Nobel Peace Prize?\u201d he asked.\nOn Tuesday in Yangon, Mr. Annan told reporters that the recent violence in Rakhine had underscored the \u201cimportance and immediacy\u201d of his commission\u2019s work. But some analysts said the mounting international criticism of the government\u2019s actions in Rakhine made the commission\u2019s work look even less relevant.\nPenny Green, a law professor and expert on genocide at Queen Mary University of London, said that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had most likely chosen Mr. Annan, a fellow Nobel laureate, to lead the commission because he was a public figure whose \u201cenormous moral capital\u201d would portray her government in a positive light. But \u201chis personal reputation as somebody who has defended human rights should be on the line here, too,\u201d Professor Green said.\nMuhammad Noor, the managing director of Rohingya Vision, a satellite television broadcaster with offices in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, said the panel was overly concerned with diplomacy at the cost of ignoring what he called a human rights \u201cdisaster.\u201d\nHe said his own information, compiled from sources within Rakhine, indicated that more than 200 Rohingya had been killed in the north since October, a far larger number than rights groups had reported.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not helping at all,\u201d Mr. Noor said of the commission."}, {"text": "Simon & Schuster Creates Imprint for Muslim-Themed Children\u2019s Books\n2016-02-24T21:40:09.000Z\nAs a young Pakistani-American Muslim girl growing up in Connecticut, Zareen Jaffery used to devour novels by Beverly Cleary and Judy Blume, hoping those stories would offer some clues for how to fit in.\n\u201cI remember looking at books to try to figure out, \u2018What does it mean to be American? Am I doing this right?\u2019\u201d Ms. Jaffery said. \u201cThe truth is, I didn\u2019t see myself reflected in books back then.\u201d\nSome 30 years later, Muslim characters remain scarce in mainstream children\u2019s literature. But now Ms. Jaffery, an executive editor of Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers, is in a position to change that.\nMs. Jaffery is heading a new children\u2019s imprint, Salaam Reads, dedicated to publishing books that feature Muslim characters and stories. The imprint, which Simon & Schuster announced this week, will release nine or more books a year, ranging from board books and picture books to middle grade and young adult titles.\nThe creation of a Muslim-themed children\u2019s imprint is likely to further fuel the continuing discussion about diversity in children\u2019s publishing. Salaam Reads is also arriving in the middle of a fractious and polarizing political debate about immigration and racial and religious profiling, when minority groups, and American Muslims in particular, feel they are being targeted.\nMs. Jaffery, 37, had long been bothered by the lack of Muslim characters in children\u2019s literature. But the problem started to feel more acute about three years ago, when she began reading books with her young nieces and nephews. \u201cIt was hard not to notice that none of those books really reflected their experience,\u201d she said.\nShe brought up the idea of seeking out books about Muslims with Justin Chanda, the publisher of Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers. Rather than just releasing a scattered selection of books, they decided to create a new imprint, and chose the name Salaam, which means peace in Arabic. The books won\u2019t emphasize theology or Islamic doctrine, Mr. Chanda said, but will highlight the experience of being Muslim through their characters and plots.\n\u201cWe have a chance to provide people with a more nuanced and, in my estimation, a more honest portrayal of the lives of everyday Muslims,\u201d Ms. Jaffery said.\nSo far, Salaam Reads has acquired four books that will come out in 2017, including \u201cSalam Alaikum,\u201d a picture book based on a song by the British teen pop singer Harris J. Others planned for release next year are \u201cMusa, Moises, Mo and Kevin,\u201d a picture book about four kindergarten friends who learn about one another\u2019s holiday traditions; \u201cThe Gauntlet of Blood and Sand\u201d by Karuna Riazi, about a 12-year-old Bangladeshi-American who sets out to save her brother from a supernatural board game, and \u201cYo Soy Muslim,\u201d a picture book by the poet Mark Gonzales.\nMr. Gonzales, an alumnus of HBO\u2019s \u201cDef Poetry Jam\u201d who converted to Islam, said he was immediately game when Ms. Jaffery recruited him to write a book for the imprint.\n\u201cAs a person who was born as the child of Mexican and French immigrants, I grew up being invisible to society, and if not invisible, demonized,\u201d said Mr. Gonzales. \u201cIt was important to me, thinking about what it would mean for every child to have a book when they\u2019re growing up that they can see themselves in.\u201d"}, {"text": "Calls Grow for Access to Western Myanmar in Face of Military Lockdown\n2016-10-27T12:34:34.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 In the aftermath of violence this month in western Myanmar that has left scores of people dead, the authorities are facing mounting pressure to lift a weekslong military lockdown that advocacy groups say has trapped Muslims in their communities and largely prevented aid workers from helping them.\nPeople in the northern part of Rakhine State have watched the Myanmar Army and the border police loot shops, rape women, burn homes and Qurans, and shoot unarmed people in the days and weeks since an attack this month on a guard post near the Bangladeshi border killed nine police officers, rights activists say. The United Nations, in a statement on Monday, urged the government to address \u201cgrowing reports of human rights violations\u201d in the area.\nThe violence this month has largely affected members of the Rohingya ethnic group, a stateless Muslim minority with roughly one million members in Rakhine State. The Rohingya have been unable to obtain Myanmar citizenship, even though many of their families have lived in the country for generations.\nMuch of northern Rakhine remained inaccessible to international relief agencies because of the military operations and travel restrictions, activists and aid workers said this week. They added that thousands of Rohingya people had not been permitted to leave their villages \u2014 even as some members of the Rakhine group, a Buddhist ethnic minority in Myanmar that has occasionally clashed with both the Rohingya and the government in recent years, have fled south to Sittwe, the provincial capital.\nInternational nonprofit groups have been unable to reach those displaced by the violence and to offer humanitarian programs like basic health services, Marta Kaszubska, the coordinator of the INGO Forum Myanmar, a consortium of international nonprofits in the country, said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe longer this situation continues, the more vulnerable people will get, as food supplies dwindle and life-threatening health problems are left untreated,\u201d she added.\nBut U Tin Maung Swe, the spokesman for the Rakhine government, disputed accounts of human rights violations. Reports of soldiers and border police officers killing and terrorizing villagers were untrue, he said in a brief telephone interview on Thursday, and the area had never been under lockdown. \u201cIf you want to go, I will arrange access,\u201d he said.\nReports of human rights violations in northern Rakhine could not be independently verified. Mr. Tin Maung Swe declined to say why he believed they were untrue.\nThe European Commission reported last week that 10,000 internally displaced Rohingya people were confined in coastal Maungdaw Township, where much of the violence has taken place this month, and that 1,000 Rakhine people had been relocated from northern Rakhine State to a new refugee camp on a soccer field in Sittwe. It said that 2,000 other Rakhine people were sheltering in monasteries, temples and schools in Maungdaw and neighboring Buthidaung Township.\nA spasm of violence between Rohingya and Rakhine people in the Sittwe area in 2012 that killed dozens displaced more than 100,000 people. The vast majority of those are Rohingya, but some are Rakhine. They now live separately in refugee camps along Sittwe\u2019s rural fringes.\nNaing Min, a Rohingya villager in northern Rakhine, said he had witnessed border police officers and Myanmar Army soldiers driving people out of War Pate, a village in Maungdaw Township, in recent days.\n\u201cThen they\u2019re burning the houses,\u201d Mr. Naing Min said by telephone on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this from a half-mile away.\u201d\nAbdul Rasheed, a Rohingya activist in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s cultural and business capital, said his contacts in northern Rakhine had documented 119 rapes and the burning or demolition of 700 to 800 homes since the attack this month on the border post. More than 200 people there had also been killed by the authorities or disappeared, he added, and many others were wounded by gunfire but unable to find medical treatment. He said he based his assessment on telephone conversations with more than 20 people in the area.\nMr. Rasheed said he worried that the military\u2019s response to the initial attack may only aggravate the grievances that many Rohingya have harbored against the Myanmar government for years, driving them to further violence.\n\u201cMany people may resist against this lawless action,\u201d he said in a WhatsApp message on Thursday. \u201cCould be harmful for our people.\u201d\nVideos have circulated online this month that appear to show groups of heavily armed Rohingya men calling for jihad against the authorities. Activists and government officials say the videos appear to be authentic. But Fortify Rights, an advocacy group in Southeast Asia, has said the videos are unusual and should not be taken as signs of widespread militancy among Muslims in the area.\nChris Lewa, a Rohingya rights advocate in Thailand, said that shootings and house burnings had appeared to taper off in northern Rakhine but that the authorities were now arresting community and religious leaders, many of whom had not yet been released.\n\u201cWhat exactly happens to them once they get arrested?\u201d Ms. Lewa asked. \u201cWe\u2019re of course concerned they would be tortured.\u201d\nMyanmar\u2019s de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has called for investigations into the violence in northern Rakhine and cautioned against making accusations without evidence. Other officials have denied any wrongdoing.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything lawless,\u201d U Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Myanmar\u2019s president, U Htin Kyaw, said in response to the statement by the United Nations, according to the Irrawaddy, a website that covers Myanmar.\nThe United Nations World Food Program, which provides food assistance for tens of thousands in Rakhine, said that it had begun distributing cash assistance on Wednesday to 20,000 people from vulnerable households in Buthidaung Township and that several schools in Buthidaung and Maungdaw had reopened after being closed this month.\nBut an official at the agency, Arsen Sahakyan, said that the planned distribution of food supplements to 17,000 pregnant women, nursing mothers and malnourished children in areas only accessible by river was delayed and that the agency would resume giving food to 50,000 people in Maungdaw once the area became accessible. It was also \u201cassessing the feasibility,\u201d he added, of resuming a program that normally feeds 65,000 students."}, {"text": "Soccer Team With International Flavor Mixes Drills and Assimilation\n2016-08-23T20:40:26.000Z\nOn a blistering summer day in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, an English soccer coach gave a pep talk to a group of 14 players as they sat attentively on a knee-high wall.\nWhether the message was getting through was open to debate; only a handful of the players arrayed before the coach, Jonathan Vaughan, spoke English as their first language.\nAhmed Mohamed, a 17-year old from Alexandria, Egypt, had joined the team only days earlier. In doing so, he became part of a group that included players from Benin and Egypt, Nigeria and Guinea, Bangladesh, Jamaica and Uzbekistan. Mohamed joked that he had seen such ethnically diverse rosters at the elite levels of the game, where top clubs regularly scout and purchase the brightest talents from across the globe. But at the amateur level, a roster of similar diversity remains extremely rare.\nOn his new club, though, it is the norm. Mohamed\u2019s team, Rooklyn International, has created its cosmopolitan mix by using soccer as a way to help young immigrants in New York City \u2014 newcomers, asylum seekers and refugees \u2014 integrate with other teenagers who find themselves in a similar situation.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we are the same people,\u201d said Md Ayub Nabi, 19, who moved to New York from Bangladesh five years ago and joined Rooklyn International despite having little experience with the game before he arrived in the United States.\nSince March, Rooklyn has attracted recruits from at least 10 nations. Last year, 53 players attended one or more Rooklyn practices or games; those players, ages 14 to 20, had roots in 15 countries and spoke 10 languages.\nElisha Aninye, a 19-year-old who moved to New York from Lagos, Nigeria, in November 2015, said he had joined Rooklyn\u2019s program to \u201cgain new skills and meet new lads.\u201d Aninye was the captain of Rooklyn that day in the park, where he and his teammates wore matching yellow jerseys provided as part of a league organized by the New York Police Department.\nDespite their wide-ranging backgrounds and their varied understanding of Vaughan\u2019s instructions and mannerisms, Rooklyn looked very much like a unit. But the program\u2019s roots stretch back to a time when Rooklyn the team wasn\u2019t even Rooklyn at all.\nIn the spring of 2008, Soccer Without Borders, an international organization with the same soccer-based integrative goals as Rooklyn, decided to set up a New York chapter through an agreement with the International Rescue Committee, a nonprofit humanitarian group. Seeking a unifying thread for the children of the families it was resettling, the organizations arranged occasional volunteer-led pickup soccer games for the city\u2019s immigrant youth, focusing on the social elements of the sport, rather than the competitive ones.\nPlayers of varying abilities came and went, but by April 2013 organizers began to see a shift in intentions of the immigrants who were coming to the program.\n\u201cThey wanted to play in M.L.S., for Manchester United or Real Madrid,\u201d said Prospero Herrera, Rooklyn\u2019s co-director and coach. \u201cWe asked the players what they wanted to be in the future, and they said soccer players.\u201d\nThe occasional pickup games soon became consistent, free weekend practices for the young players, as the program drafted a model aimed at improving participants\u2019 soccer skills, as well as their life skills. In 2014, the organizers began holding regular weekday training sessions and entered the players in their first competitive tournament. The Brooklyn International High School, an educational facility that looks to improve students\u2019 English skills and help them adapt to American life, also partnered with the program.\n\u201cThe kids come to me often and say, \u2018Where can I play outside of the school?\u2019\u201d said Paul Allen, the soccer coach at Brooklyn International High School. \u201cUnfortunately, in my experience, there are club teams all over New York, but some of them are really competitive, and for some there are costs involved. So the greatest thing is that here is another place for the kids to have organized athletics.\u201d\nThe school\u2019s focus is mirrored in the weekend training sessions that Herrera, 29, oversees at McLaughlin Park in Brooklyn. Players are encouraged to introduce themselves in English to an ever-changing group, stating their names, ages, home countries, how long they have lived in New York and how long they have been playing soccer. Some find the task comfortable; others look to teammates who may know the words they seek.\nIn 2015, the New York program separated from Soccer Without Borders, which currently maintains year-round chapters in Boston; Baltimore; Greeley, Colo.; and Oakland, Calif. A memorandum of understanding was drafted so that the International Rescue Committee\u2019s New York office, where Herrera works, would oversee the program. With the input of players, coaches, staff members and graphic designers, the organizers began a rebranding process, eventually settling on the Rooklyn International Football Association.\nFor some of Rooklyn\u2019s competitive matches last year, the roster was \u201cbetween 65 and 75 percent refugees or asylees,\u201d Herrera said. That percentage is likely to decrease this year, he added, as many players from the group are either too old to play in competitive games or have left to attend college.\n\u201cWhen I came here, many people helped me,\u201d said Mohamed Condoe, 20, a former refugee from Guinea who played for Rooklyn last year. \u201cFootball helped me because my family do not speak much English.\u201d\nCondoe now works as a delivery person. While he is too old to play in competitive matches, he has tried to remain a part of the Rooklyn program.\nNext year, with its agreement with the International Rescue Committee now expired, organizers intend to reach out to new groups that work with refugees, asylum seekers and young immigrants.\nCurrently reliant on donations and the work of a handful of volunteers, Rooklyn\u2019s organizers are also in the process of applying for nonprofit status, which they hope will allow them to finance a part-time position to oversee the program\u2019s expansion. This change, Herrera said, could mean more practice sessions, the introduction of a girls team and joining a year-round recreational league.\nThough some Rooklyn players were clearly much younger than their opposition this summer, even the youngest ones, at 14, were given equal playing time \u2014 part of the club\u2019s focus on social integration over on-field results. Between the two matches Rooklyn played on a scorching hot day in July \u2014 both of which ended in narrow defeats \u2014 Steben Houenou, 15, of Porto-Novo, Benin, explained to some of his teammates how much he liked the food in New York, especially the cheesecake, which he had not tasted before moving to the United States three years ago.\nFor the other young immigrants, the universal topic of conversation for a group brought together by soccer was, not surprisingly, soccer. Messi or Ronaldo? Barcelona or Real Madrid?\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s about integration,\u201d Vaughan said of the Rooklyn program. \u201cYoung people using soccer and coming together in a safe spot.\u201d"}, {"text": "At Carnival Fresh Market in Brooklyn, a United Nations for the Palate\n2016-10-07T20:06:49.000Z\nFrom the outside, Carnival Fresh Market looks like any other corner produce store. Crates filled with onions, peaches and four-for-$5 mangoes sit stacked, end to end, under a red-and-yellow striped awning.\nJust inside this three-year-old shop in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn, however, a United Nations of foodstuffs awaits. Here in the bulk bins are blue-black Uzbeki raisins and nuggets of chocolate-dipped halvah.

In 2013, he bought an existing grocery store on the tiny island of concrete where Church Avenue and Beverley Road converge, as well as the two small clothing businesses adjacent to it, and began to make big changes.\n\u201cThings are much more organized now,\u201d said Nima Ullah, 20, whose family shopped at the location\u2019s previous store. \u201cThe old place did not have so many canned goods or fresh desserts,\u201d she said, gesturing toward a display case filled with baklava, Russian sour-cream cakes and other pastries made in nearby bakeries.\nMr. Tas, 29, who immigrated from Turkey in 2009, handles most of the store\u2019s daily operations. But he and Mr. Karakaya share a fervent preoccupation with improving customer service. Mr. Tas keeps detailed lists and spreadsheets on his phone that outline plans for making the shop function better. Most days the shelves are not only restocked but also rearranged to fit in new products, like a live-action game of Tetris. \u201cWe want our customers to wonder what we\u2019re going to have tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Tas said.\nOutside, bags of slightly overripe produce are sold at a discounted rate, \u201cfor people who cannot afford the full price,\u201d Mr. Tas said. Last April, before Passover, boxes of matzo appeared on the shelves. Last June and July, during Ramadan, an already impressive selection of dates swelled considerably to accommodate Muslim families who traditionally break their daily fast with a piece of the dried fruit.\nMany of Kensington\u2019s residents hold multiple jobs or finish work shifts in the middle of the night, which is why Carnival stays open 24 hours a day. During last winter\u2019s big snowstorm, the shop glowed like a lighthouse amid a sea of darkened storefronts.\nElsewhere in Brooklyn, things trend toward the slick, big and basic. But Carnival, it seems, didn\u2019t get the memo.

Our grandchildren are here.\u201d\nIn Florida, from the architecture that reminds Dr. Chandran of Chennai, India, to the vegetarian meals and Bollywood dance classes, \u201cwe have created a mini-India, a piece of India,\u201d Mr. Ignatius said.\nThe Chandrans moved into their three-bedroom condominium in 2011, paying $250,000, and now they lead yoga classes in ShantiNiketan\u2019s meditation room.\nMr. Chandran, 77, a former corporate vice president, conducts Hindu prayers each weekday morning in a small on-site temple. For festivals, Dr. Chandran puts on the silk saris she found few occasions to wear in Newport News, Va.\n\u201cYou feel more at home here,\u201d she said.\nDevelopers call these kinds of housing options \u201caffinity group communities,\u201d said Robert G. Kramer, chief executive of the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care, an industry research group.\nIn addition to those established by and for members of religious groups, they include retirement communities for military officers, for gays and lesbians, and for the alumni of particular colleges and universities.\nFacilities for specific ethnic groups have appeared more recently, but \u201cI think we\u2019ll see more of them,\u201d Mr. Kramer said. \u201cWe\u2019re such a polyglot culture.\u201d\nAmong those already in operation:\n\u25a0 Aegis Gardens, a 64-unit Chinese-American assisted living complex in Fremont, Calif., opened in 2001. With a staff that speaks Mandarin and Cantonese, daily tai chi sessions and a Chinese chef, it maintains nearly 100 percent occupancy, said Dwayne Clark, the chief executive of Aegis Living.\nSo the company, which operates 30 assisted living facilities on the West Coast, is building a second Chinese-American facility, a $50 million independent living, assisted living and memory care campus in Newcastle, Wash., scheduled to open next year.\nMonthly rents are likely to start at $5,300, executives said, not including help with the activities of daily living.\n\u25a0 ShantiNiketan began with 54 apartments when the Chandrans moved in. Now it has 174, with 120 more condos for Indian-Americans under construction, and Mr. Ignatius plans an initial public offering to finance similar developments near Los Angeles, Dallas and Chicago.\n\u25a0 Dr. Mukund Thakar began creating Indian-American floors in New Jersey nursing homes a decade ago, hiring Indian physicians, nurses, aides and dietitians. His Indian Nursing Home program now operates in eight facilities around the state and one in the Bronx.\n\u25a0 In Queens, a small nonprofit group called India Home runs \u201cculturally appropriate\u201d senior center programs for South Asian immigrants. The Desi Senior Center in Jamaica, Queens, for example, attracts older Bangladeshis with hot halal lunches, English instruction and a screen separating men from women in exercise classes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Catholic Charities senior center two blocks away, but they would not go there,\u201d because nobody on the staff speaks Bengali, said Lakshman Kalasapudi, India Home\u2019s program manager.\nAs for Latinos, \u201cI expect to see the first Hispanic facilities in Southern California and the Southwest,\u201d said Mr. Kramer of the National Investment Center.\nFor years, New Old Age readers from other countries have insisted that their cultures revere elders and revile children who don\u2019t care for their parents in multigenerational homes. But even in those societies, where elder care frequently depended on the unpaid labor of women, demographic and socioeconomic shifts have made a difference. Nursing homes have sprouted across China, for instance.\nThough Chinese-American families (like most American families) try to keep older relatives at home as long as possible, \u201ca lot of my residents have said it\u2019s very lonely if your children are at work, your grandchildren are at school, and you\u2019re alone with a caregiver, dozing in front of the TV,\u201d said Emily Poon, the general manager of Aegis Gardens in Fremont.\nIn standard assisted living, they might feel even more disconnected. \u201cThe majority can\u2019t speak English well,\u201d Ms. Poon said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t communicate effectively with the staff or the other residents.\u201d They might find the food unpalatable, the activities unengaging. Isolation breeds its own physical and psychological dangers.\nAlice and George Louie, 90-year-old Chinese immigrants, moved to Aegis Gardens in 2012 to be near their daughter and son-in-law. The staff helps Mr. Louie, who has dementia, with his medications. Mrs. Louie, who has diabetes and uses a walker, practices tai chi and calligraphy. They eat meals with other Cantonese speakers.\n\u201cFor the Chinese New Year, you never saw a place so extravagantly decorated,\u201d Mrs. Louie said. The festivities included traditional lion dancers, jugglers and gymnasts; the dining room served dim sum.\nFor administrators, ethnic facilities can pose special challenges. Aegis executives had to petition to change the Fremont community\u2019s street address, Mr. Clark said, because it contained the numeral 4, considered unlucky in Chinese culture. Inside the facility, apartment numbers jump from 103 to 105 and 239 to 251.\nDays before the opening, a feng shui practitioner decreed that the fountain in the courtyard be torn out because its outer rim contained points; he was mollified when workers hastily sawed off the points.\nA larger challenge: How long will the market for ethnically specific senior housing and programs last? Immigrants\u2019 more assimilated offspring may care less about traditional cooking or a Gujarati-speaking staff. \u201cFor first-generation Indians, this is working out great,\u201d Mr. Ignatius said of ShantiNiketan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure my children will come here.\u201d\nBut if the need 40 years hence looks uncertain, the demand right now is pressing, said Dr. Vasundhara Kalasapudi, the executive director of India Home. The group wants to establish day programs for South Asians with dementia, as well as assisted living facilities and nursing homes.\n\u201cThis is a common topic for all of us, how difficult it is to take care of families with medical problems,\u201d she said.\nOr nonmedical problems. Dr. Kalasapudi, a geriatric psychiatrist, recalled being pressed into service to talk to a hospitalized Indian immigrant who suffered, the staff believed, from depression. Her mother tongue was Telugu, but they managed to communicate in Hindi.\n\u201cI\u2019m not depressed,\u201d the patient told her. \u201cI just don\u2019t like the food.\u201d"}, {"text": "Corrections: August 3, 2016\n2016-08-03T04:07:47.000Z\nFRONT PAGE\nAn article on July 3 about an attack on a restaurant in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in which 20 hostages were killed after an 11-hour siege misspelled, in some editions, the given name and misstated the surname of a cook at the restaurant who hid in a washroom with eight other men.

Most of the victims, like Mr. Thu Ya, are members of the Rohingya ethnic group.\nThe Myanmar government has described the action by the army and the border police as a counterinsurgency response to an attack this month on a nearby border post that killed nine police officers.\nRights groups in the region say they have received reports that soldiers and police officers have shot unarmed people, raped women, looted shops and burned homes. Local officials deny those reports.\nMr. Thu Ya, who said he was planning to sleep in a tent on Friday in a neighboring village, spoke by phone on Friday to Saw Nang, a reporter for The New York Times in Mandalay, Myanmar:\nOn the night of Oct. 9, I was fast asleep. Suddenly I heard the sound of a gun at 3 in the morning.\nAt first I thought it was a firecracker. But finally I realized that it was a gun shooting. The sound was coming from the Border Guard post.\nI woke up my family and ran away, passing through the farm. We could not carry anything with us because we just had to run away to save our lives.\nWe ran to the west of the village. I heard the sound of guns shooting until early dawn.\nWhen we reached the western Kyee Kan Pyin villages, we had to stay two or three families in one house together. After two or three days, we went back to our home.\nThen the village administrator, U Zaw Phyo Tun, told everyone in the villages that we had to destroy our fence. If not we would be arrested. So we destroyed our fence. We slept one night in our home.\nThe next day U Zaw Phyo Tun called two imams to meet with supervisor Thura San Lwin of the Border Guard force. The imams said they were told by Mr. Thura San Lwin that all the villagers from Kyee Kan Pyin must leave our homes and go away. If not they will beat, torture and kill us with guns, they threatened.\nWe packed our belongings as much as we could and had to leave our village, and we are now staying at western Kyee Kan Pyin village.\nSupervisor Thura San Lwin from the Border Guard force also told the imam that our leaving home was according to the mandate.\nNow we have a shortage of food. I have nine family members, and our village has 300 families.\nNow about 100 Border Guard forces are pitching a camp in our village\u2019s school.\nThey also are arresting the men. So if we hear news that the Border Guard force is coming, we have to run away from one place to another. Now all the men here have no settled place.\nThey also rape the women when men are away. They took all the foodstuffs from our village\u2019s store.\nNo journalists are coming to our villages to see the real situation. I saw some journalists who were wearing a press jacket with the military truck. But they didn\u2019t speak with any of us.\nThe Border Guard police are arresting 20 or 30 men from each village and torturing them. One of them was trying to run to escape and was shot. Then the government announced that they had killed a terrorist.\nI know attacking and killing the Border Guard police is insulting sovereignty. But it\u2019s nothing to do with us.\nThey should not treat us in an inhuman manner.\nI want to go back to our home and live peacefully again. Now our lives have no guarantees anymore. You can talk with me by phone now, but maybe I will die tomorrow."}, {"text": "Donald Trump\u2019s Sham Patriotism\n2016-07-23T18:30:27.000Z\nIn his bid for the White House, Donald Trump is playing many roles: law-and-order strongman, sky\u2019s-the-limit builder, dealmaker extraordinaire. But perhaps none is more emphatic than all-American patriot.\nHis blood pumps red, white and blue, or so he assures us. In his dreams and decisions, he sees his country above all else. \u201cThe most important difference between our plan and that of our opponent,\u201d he told Republicans in Cleveland on Thursday night, \u201cis that our plan will put America first.\u201d\nBut this lavishly professed love is a largely semantic affair. It\u2019s fickle. It\u2019s reckless. Under its guise, he\u2019s apparently prepared to jettison values that really do make America great and alliances that really do keep America safer. His patriotism brims with grievances.\nIt sulks. Last week he suggested to The Times\u2019s David Sanger and Maggie Haberman that if Russia invaded a NATO ally that wasn\u2019t pulling its weight financially, he might not rise to its defense.\nHis patriotism doesn\u2019t add up. On one hand, it leads him to echo conservatives\u2019 longstanding charge that President Obama belittles our country by apologizing too much for it. On the other, Trump told Sanger and Haberman that he\u2019d refrain from reprimanding allies with poor records on civil liberties because the United States is no paragon.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a right to lecture,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at what is happening in our country. How are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood?\u201d\nThat\u2019s a shocking statement in the context of Republican complaints that Democrats fail to appreciate and celebrate American exceptionalism. But it\u2019s not so surprising from Trump, who excused Vladimir Putin\u2019s criminality by saying that we Americans aren\u2019t ones to talk.\nHe was on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d He\u2019d been praising Putin\u2019s strength. And when Joe Scarborough pointed out that Putin \u201ckills journalists that don\u2019t agree with him,\u201d Trump responded: \u201cWell, I think our country does plenty of killing also, Joe.\u201d\nPlenty of Killing: That could have been the title of Trump\u2019s convention speech, a pitch-black warning about a country soaked in blood. While it\u2019s customary for politicians who are arguing for change to describe a troubled nation with an unsustainable status quo, Trump evoked a dystopia out of \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d a land damned near unlovable.\nNone of the people I call patriots see America that darkly or take such an incendiary tack. But his political strategy, like so much else in his life, is about what he deems best for Trump. It\u2019s self that he salutes, not any flag. And while he harnessed his egoism somewhat during that speech, it raged anew on Friday, when he destroyed any momentum his remarks might have given him with a rambling, ranting, unnecessary news conference.\n\u201cIt was the summer of Trump,\u201d he said, complimenting the success of his campaign. \u201cIt was the autumn of Trump. It was the Christmas of Trump. It was everything.\u201d And he attacked Ted Cruz anew, again mentioning the National Enquirer story that linked Cruz\u2019s father to John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination and saying that the Enquirer deserves more respect than it gets.\nThere\u2019s no easy way to judge patriotism, and I\u2019m suspicious of two of the most commonly used yardsticks. But by both of those measures \u2014 a readiness to serve in the military and a devotion to domestically made goods \u2014 Trump isn\u2019t much of a patriot.\nDuring the Vietnam War, he used his status as a college student to receive four draft deferments. Then he got a medical exemption \u2014 something foot-related. The malady couldn\u2019t have been all that crippling, because when he was asked about it last year, he vaguely mentioned a bone spur but failed to recall whether it was in his right or left heel.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to look it up,\u201d he told reporters.\nHis supposed regard for the military is often lip service. If it were any match for his schoolyard nastiness, it would have stopped him from dismissing John McCain\u2019s five and a half years as a prisoner of war by saying, \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d And if it were any match for his situational stinginess, he would have given that big charitable donation to veterans that he\u2019d promised before journalists had to shame him into making good on his pledge.\nHis current vow to punish American companies that outsource jobs and to prevent them from using undocumented immigrants here in the United States rewrites his own business history, one of \u201cputting profits, rather than America, first,\u201d wrote The Times\u2019s Alan Rappeport last month.\n\u201cMost of his line of suits, ties and cuff links bear a \u2018Made in China\u2019 label,\u201d Rappeport noted. \u201cSome also come from factories in Bangladesh, Mexico and Vietnam.\u201d\nFurniture in the Trump Home collection was manufactured in Turkey, and Trump Home crystal was made in Slovenia.\nMoreover, undocumented immigrants have worked on the construction of properties bearing (and blaring) Trump\u2019s name.\nYou didn\u2019t hear any of that at the convention on Wednesday night, when the theme was in fact \u201cMake America First Again,\u201d a nod to Trump\u2019s call for trade agreements with better terms for America and a foreign policy more narrowly tailored to American interests.\nThat call has been central to his political success, as the conservative columnist Peggy Noonan observed in a column last spring. She noted that Trump\u2019s proclamations \u201cradiate the idea that he\u2019s not at all interested in ideology, only in making America great again.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s saying he\u2019s on America\u2019s side, period,\u201d Noonan wrote, adding that neither Obama nor George W. Bush communicated that message as persuasively. Her column had the headline: \u201cSimple Patriotism Trumps Ideology.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s nothing simple about a patriotism that allows someone to brag, as Trump has done, about paying as little in taxes as he can possibly get away with, and that permits him to flout an important political tradition of candidates\u2019 releasing their tax returns.\nThere\u2019s nothing simple about a patriotism that advocates torture, as Trump has also done, when our conduct in waging war is ideally what sets us apart from less principled countries and earns us the respect of the world.\nAnd there\u2019s nothing simple about a patriotism that\u2019s really an amalgam of nativism, racism, isolationism and xenophobia and that denies this country\u2019s distinction as a land of fresh starts, its arms open to a diverse world. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigrants wasn\u2019t patriotic, nor was the Star of David in that offensive tweet.\n\u201cPatriotism,\u201d the 18th-century writer Samuel Johnson once said, \u201cis the last refuge of a scoundrel.\u201d It\u2019s also a convenient cloak for a narcissist. Trump wears it shamelessly, but not so well that you can\u2019t see through it."}, {"text": "Your Thursday Briefing\n2016-03-17T09:51:25.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email?

Where's yours?#SemperFi#USMC pic.twitter.com/QSf2O9PTi2\nNow, Mr. Rashid, who served five years in the Marine Corps and worked in avionics, deploying three times, has been outraged again by Mr. Trump.\nThis time it is because of the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s disparaging comments about Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of an Army captain killed by a car bomb in Iraq in 2004, who criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed policies toward Muslims at the Democratic National Convention.\nThe episode \u201cbrought tears to my eyes,\u201d Mr. Rashid said. \u201cThese are people who sacrificed their own child, their own blood.\u201d\nBut, he said, his anger is tempered by his own experience in the military, where people were overwhelmingly accepting and supportive.\n\u201cI experienced nothing but love and camaraderie from all the Marines I served with,\u201d said Mr. Rashid, who joined the Marines in 1997. \u201cI was often the first Muslim many of them had ever met, but there was no racism, no bigotry. It doesn\u2019t really matter your faith: We were all Marines first.\u201d\nStill, as Mr. Rashid acknowledges, Muslims in the military face numerous challenges. For one, 15 years of war in Muslim countries has made serving in the military a cultural minefield. Among some non-Muslim soldiers, Islam itself, not extremism, is often seen as the problem.\nIn interviews, Muslim soldiers said they had all encountered at one time or another what one called \u201cknucklehead\u201d comments equating them with terrorists. Things got worse after 13 people were killed at Fort Hood in 2009 by a Muslim Army psychiatrist who said the United States\u2019 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were wars against all Muslims.\nOther problems come from the cultural barriers, like a ban on facial hair, and dealing with military food that is often rife with pork, forbidden by Islam. Few bases have Muslim prayer services, and only five of the Army\u2019s roughly 2,900 chaplains are imams.\n\u201cIt can be challenging,\u201d said Mr. Rashid, whose family moved from Pakistan when he was 10. \u201cThe nature of military service is not very conducive to practicing your faith, but Islam is flexible.\u201d\n\u201cI am here as an American,\u201d he added. \u201cI benefit from the liberty and opportunity of this country, and it is my obligation to serve this nation in some way.\u201d\nThousands of Muslims have served in the military since at least the Civil War, but they make up a disproportionately small portion of the force. Just 3,939 troops currently list their faith as Islam, according to Pentagon data. They make up just 0.3 percent of the military; Muslims are estimated to make up about 1 percent of the civilian population.\nTheir numbers are so few that some go most of their career without meeting another Muslim in uniform.\nIn Europe, some countries have made moves to encourage Muslims to enlist. The British Army, which has similarly low participation among Muslims, two years ago launched a recruiting initiative, the Armed Forces Muslim Forum. The armed forces allow fasting during Ramadan and make accommodations for daily prayers, setting up prayer rooms on bases and recently adding one to a warship.\nThe Pentagon does not track how many Muslim troops have died in combat since 2001, but they have served in all branches \u2014 as officers, combat troops, interpreters and intelligence gatherers.\nSome say that life in the military became harder after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\u201cAfter 9/11, I really started noticing a change,\u201d said Mansoor Shams, who was born in Pakistan and served in the Marine Corps from 2000 to 2004. \u201cA few guys made negative comments, sometimes half-joking, calling me the Taliban. I decided to nip it in the bud, and most of the guys understood.\u201d\nSome troops also find it difficult to fight in countries their families may be from. But when it comes to religious liberty, they say, the military has gone to considerable lengths to be accommodating. Troops have time to pray and can fast during Ramadan. The military even makes halal versions of M.R.E.s \u2014 meals ready to eat, its plastic-wrapped field rations \u2014 along with kosher and vegetarian versions.\n\u201cThe halal M.R.E.s are actually pretty good, maybe even better than regular M.R.E.s,\u201d said Capt. Nadi Kassim, a company commander in the Army\u2019s Second Cavalry Regiment.\nCaptain Kassim, a child of Palestinian refugees who graduated from the United States Military Academy in 2010, has felt nothing but support from the military since he was a cadet, he said.\n\u201cI was never singled out for being a guy named Nadi Kassim,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Army minimizes differences and rewards achievement, and I really thrived in that.\u201d\nWhen a recent field exercise fell during Ramadan, Captain Kassim said, the support unit doing the cooking set aside meals so he and another Muslim could eat after sunset. \u201cWe did not ask them to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just did it on their own to show they supported us.\u201d\nThough easy to overlook, Muslim culture has a firm toehold in the military, said Cmdr. Abuhena Saifulislam, a chaplain who serves as an imam in the Navy and Marine Corps, a job he has held for 20 years. Every Friday, he said, an imam holds prayers in the Pentagon, and at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, where he is stationed, he leads prayers daily.\nCommander Saifulislam has been invited to lead prayers at the White House by President George W. Bush and President Obama. On his latest visit, during the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr, he walked into the White House with a 95-year-old Muslim who had fought in World War II.\n\u201cMany times I have been to Afghanistan,\u201d he said. \u201cI let them know there how we as Muslims live in America. And I have made great relationships.\u201d\nCommander Saifulislam oversaw the building of a mosque at Camp Lejeune, complete with separate entrances for men and women. And in his long career in the military, he said, he has ministered to many more Christians than Muslims and has never faced a backlash.\n\u201cWhen I was young, I came here from Bangladesh without a family,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in many ways the military became my family. I wouldn\u2019t have stayed 20 years unless I felt welcome.\u201d"}, {"text": "Forget the Tie. Give a Gift That Matters.\n2016-12-01T08:21:25.000Z\nSure, you can buy your uncle a necktie that he won\u2019t wear, or your niece an Amazon certificate that she\u2019ll forget to use. Or you can help remove shrapnel from an injured child in Syria, or assist students at risk of genocide in South Sudan.\nThe major aid organizations have special catalogs this time of year: You can buy an alpaca for a family for $150 at Heifer International, help educate a girl for $75 at Save the Children or help extend a much-admired microsavings program for $25 at Care. But this year my annual holiday gift list is special. I\u2019ve tied some items to the election of Donald Trump, and I\u2019ve looked for organizations that you may not have heard of:\n\u25a0 One battle over the coming four years will involve family planning, because of G.O.P. efforts to defund Title X family planning programs and repeal Obamacare, which provides free birth control. So consider a donation to one of the most effective counterforces: the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, thenationalcampaign.org.\nThe campaign takes no position on abortion (except to note that family planning reduces abortions), and it has bipartisan leadership, so it is more likely to get a hearing in a G.O.P.-controlled Washington.\n\u25a0 As Syria and Russia commit war crimes in Aleppo, heroic physicians from America and other countries are traveling secretly to rebel-held areas of Syria to treat the wounded in underground hospitals and call attention to the carnage. They work through the Syrian American Medical Society, SAMS, sams-usa.net, which supports more than 100 medical facilities in Syria.\n\u25a0 Human rights and press freedoms seem likely to get much less attention from the next administration, which makes this a good time to support the Committee to Protect Journalists, cpj.org. The C.P.J. speaks up for imprisoned journalists worldwide and tries to end impunity for those who murder journalists (at least 40 journalists have been killed worldwide so far in 2016 for their work).\nIn the same vein, consider buying a gift subscription to a reliable news organization for yourself or a friend \u2014 as an investment in a robust civil society.\n\u25a0 The recent hurricane in Haiti was devastating, and one of the most effective aid organizations in Haiti is Fonkoze, fonkoze.org, which has adopted a \u201cgraduation model\u201d that has been particularly successful at combating global poverty.\nFounded by a local Catholic priest, Fonkoze works with the most impoverished women in Haiti over 18 months to get them earning regular incomes through raising livestock or selling merchandise. It\u2019s about teaching people how to fish, not handing out fish. I\u2019ve seen it in action. It\u2019s terrific.\n\u25a0 Congo is home to probably the most lethal conflict since World War II, and it is sometimes called the rape capital of the world. One of the heroes there is Dr. Denis Mukwege, who founded the Panzi hospital to treat injured women and risks his life to stand up to warlords. He has survived an assassination attempt and some day will get the Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 but in the meantime, you can support his hospital at panzifoundation.org.\n\u25a0 Criminal justice may suffer setbacks in the coming years, which makes this an excellent time to support groups like Equal Justice Initiative, EJI.org, founded by a legendary lawyer named Bryan Stevenson. If attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions has an opposite, it is Stevenson.\nE.J.I. fights for indigent defendants and has won the release of inmates who were falsely arrested. It battles mass incarceration and is a voice for racial justice. And Stevenson\u2019s memoir, \u201cJust Mercy,\u201d also makes a great gift.\n\u25a0 I\u2019ve reported on crimes against humanity unfolding in South Sudan, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, and now the United Nations is warning of the risk of full-blown genocide. In this impossible situation, a South Sudan-born American named Valentino Deng is running a high school, one of few still functioning. It needs support so students can get an education and build their country.\nYou may remember Valentino: He\u2019s the \u201clost boy\u201d at the center of Dave Eggers\u2019s best-selling book \u201cWhat Is the What.\u201d What he has done since, in founding this school, is even more impressive.\nIt\u2019s time to announce my annual win-a-trip contest, in which I choose a university student to accompany me on a reporting trip looking at global poverty and justice issues. I\u2019m thinking about a 2017 trip to Liberia and Sierra Leone, or perhaps to Bangladesh. Information about how to apply is on my blog, nytimes.com/ontheground, and thanks in advance to the Center for Global Development in Washington for helping me pick a winner.\nThe win-a-trip journey is exhausting and may involve bed bugs, rats and the worst food you\u2019ve ever eaten. But it is a chance to help shine a light on important and neglected topics, so if you know students perfect for the trip, encourage them to apply."}, {"text": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Convention: Day 1\n2016-07-25T12:58:31.000Z\n"}, {"text": "Your Monday Briefing: Ted Cruz, Aleppo, Leicester City\n2016-05-02T09:48:30.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email?

Shoppers ignore vibrations from falling bombs. Buildings stand sliced in half, wires and beds and bathtubs exposed, with families still living inside. Most days, doctors have just seconds to decide which children to try to save and which to let die, as parents shriek and explosions shake the ground.\nThree American doctors said such scenes were replaying in their minds after a recent visit to the insurgent-held section of Aleppo. The doctors provided a fresh perspective on life there, because their Syrian colleagues in Aleppo, after four years of bombardment by government forces, have grown tired of describing the horrors to the outside world and have, in some sense, stopped noticing.\n\u201cFor them, that\u2019s just their life,\u201d said Dr. Samer Attar, one of the American doctors from the Syrian American Medical Society who volunteered for two weeks in rebel territory, then raced for the Turkish border just as pro-government forces cut off the last route out.\nTheir mission was to relieve, and honor, exhausted medical workers; bear witness to the ordeal of civilians in Aleppo; and press the world to help them. But now, the doctors said, the emergency has grown even more dire. Since Thursday, eastern Aleppo has been completely encircled, bracing for a starve-or-surrender siege like the ones government forces have used to take back other rebellious areas, and intense bombing continues.\nDr. Attar, an orthopedist from Chicago, recalled leaning over three children crowded onto a single gurney to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a boy, about 10 years old, who was not breathing, one of his legs blown open.\n\u201cIt was mass chaos, patients on the floor, a man with his foot on top of his belly,\u201d Dr. Attar said. \u201cThe chief surgeon said, \u2018I need you to focus on this man bleeding to death, because he\u2019s still conscious, breathing, and has a better chance of making it.\u2019\u201d\nAs painful as that was, Dr. Attar said, he was awed by the doctor\u2019s calm efficiency.\n\u201cThese are everyday decisions for them,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are not isolated attacks like the horrible things\u201d \u2014 terrorist attacks in places like Bangladesh and Nice, France \u2014 \u201cthat are happening all over the world. In Aleppo, these bombings are happening every day.\u201d\nSpeaking by telephone between surgical operations at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he works, Dr. Attar, 40, said he had flashbacks whenever he heard the wheels of a gurney.\n\u201cYou feel like there\u2019s a freight train running through your head,\u201d he said of life in eastern Aleppo. \u201cI have no other way of conveying the fear and horror and dread and despair of living there.\u201d\nAleppo is a crucial prize in the Syrian war. Once Syria\u2019s largest city, with about two million people, it has been divided since 2012 between government-controlled territory in the west and rebel-held areas in the east.\nOn both sides, civilians have suffered for years from indiscriminate attacks. But only the government and its Russian allies have warplanes, making the bombardment of the east more devastating. Four hospitals were hit last weekend, and a strike Sunday on another in Dara\u2019a Province killed six.\nMedical organizations say the government has systematically singled out medical workers across Syria; the group Physicians for Human Rights has documented the deaths of more than 700, most killed by pro-government forces. Opposition groups say this violence is part of a scorched-earth policy to drive out residents by denying them basic services.\nSyrian officials and their Russian allies deny that, saying that they are targeting terrorists and that civilians can leave eastern Aleppo through humanitarian corridors. On Saturday, the Syrian state news media reported that dozens of families had started leaving rebel-held neighborhoods for shelters in western Aleppo, a claim disputed by some opposition activists.\nEach side accused the other of preventing civilians from leaving. Some residents said they feared that the government would throw them in jail.\nThe United Nations says nearly 300,000 people still live in the east, but estimates vary widely. There are several insurgent groups, some backed by the United States. There are also fighters from the Nusra Front, a group linked to Al Qaeda that has changed its name to the Levant Conquest Front.\nThe Islamic State \u2014 whose attacks around the world have sucked attention away from the Syrian conflict, which helped spur its rise \u2014 does not have a major presence in the city, but it holds territory northeast of it.\nOnly three main hospitals are still open, and five are out of service, according to the medical society. All rely on the group or other aid agencies for money to pay employees and for supplies. All are surrounded by sandbags and other protective barriers.\nMost of the hospitals have moved much of their work to basements and newly dug underground extensions. There are fewer than three dozen doctors; just one is a neurosurgeon, and he is still in training.\nAs the siege tightens, conditions will become worse. Medical supplies could run out within a month. Malnutrition could weaken people further. As the road to Turkey has come under regular fire, people have died because there are not enough doctors to treat them, vital equipment and supplies are missing, and the sick and injured cannot be evacuated safely.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to fathom how doctors in Aleppo take this, day after day, minute after minute,\u201d said Dr. Zaher Sahloul, another visiting volunteer, who runs global aid programs for the medical society.\nDr. Sahloul recalled treating a tailor with a head wound. The man had been rushing home from his shop, thinking he had heard an explosion from that direction, when another blast knocked him down.\nSoon enough, his wife, Fatima, and their three children were carried in. Two of them, Abdo, 9, and Eilaf, 3, died. Fatima, 25, lost her unborn child, and was likely to die because the roads were too dangerous to evacuate her. Mahmoud, 7, survived.\nDr. Mohammad al-Ahmad, 50, a Syrian radiologist in Aleppo, has moved his family safely to Turkey. He said he had recently watched two boys and three girls being pulled from the rubble of a building; the boys lived, but the girls died. He watched their parents hugging their shrouded bodies.\n\u201cSometimes, you can\u2019t hold yourself from crying,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I look in front of me, there is no other way. God gave me this mission.\u201d\nDr. Ahmad took comfort, he said, in knowing that the doctors from abroad had risked their lives to help Aleppo\u2019s residents. He said Dr. Attar had told him, \u201cMy soul, my blood, is not more precious than yours.\u201d\nAs the doctors drove in from Turkey, they said, the road stank of metal and rotting flesh. Smoke from recent airstrikes could be seen in the distance on either side. Dr. Sahloul and Dr. Attar are of Syrian descent and know the country well. But Dr. John Kahler, a semiretired pediatrician who works at a community health center in Chicago, was making his first trip to Syria.\nDr. Kahler had expected something like his mission to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, he said, but the destruction was \u201cpowers of 10 worse.\u201d\nIn the chaos, it was hard to follow up on patients and learn who had lived and who had died. Bodies wrapped in white shrouds were piled outside. Some were unidentified children. \u201cNo parents came looking for them, or they were unrecognizable, too badly burned or crushed,\u201d Dr. Attar said.\nDr. Kahler, 69, was most struck by the intimacy of the war. One night he went to the top floors of a hospital. In one direction, he said, \u201cyou see nothing but black\u201d; in the other were the lights of western Aleppo, \u201cfunctioning somewhat, universities open.\u201d\n\u201cHalf the city light, half dark,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what a civil war does. It isn\u2019t just humans who are doing it, an invading horde. It\u2019s your cousins.\u201d\nOne day, the doctors were told that the siege was tightening and that they would soon be trapped. They dashed for the border, speeding up to avoid shelling and gunfire, slowing to avoid bomb craters.\nBack home, Dr. Sahloul urged the White House and the United Nations to do more to protect civilians in Syria. Dr. Attar has called for the United States to \u201cboldly confront Russia\u201d over Syria, but even a month without airstrikes would be a victory, he said.\nDr. Ahmad, the Syrian radiologist, left a few days after the visitors, but by then, things were worse. He rode in a car with makeshift armor, dusted with dirt in an attempt at camouflage, but it was peppered with gunfire.\nNow he is stuck in Turkey, to his family\u2019s relief. But he wants to return to Aleppo.\n\u201cOur life is there,\u201d he said."}, {"text": "If a Carrot for Jordan Works, Syrian Refugees Will Stay Put\n2016-07-09T18:31:39.000Z\nAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 On a busy thoroughfare in Amman, Jordan\u2019s capital, a coffee seller named Mohammed Al Mulki no longer shivers when he sees a police car pull up. At a nearby sweet shop, the counterman, Zuheir Taleb, no longer slips out of the back when a uniformed official walks in.\nAnd in the country\u2019s north, on scorching fields a few miles from the Syrian border, Badra Hadahed, a diabetic grandmother doing backbreaking work, no longer worries that she will be plucked from the cucumber fields and sent back to her home.\nLike many Syrians who fled their country\u2019s civil war, all three had been working illegally in Jordan. But under a shrewd, delicate experiment that grew out of Europe\u2019s desire to contain the influx of foreigners to its shores, Jordan has been persuaded to let these Syrians make an honest living \u2014 in return for potentially big financial rewards.\nJordan, which has 650,000 Syrian refugees registered with the United Nations inside its borders, has long made it nearly impossible for them to work legally, citing concerns about high unemployment among its citizens. But under the new experiment, the government has given out 13,000 work permits to Syrians, and is promising to issue up to 50,000 by year\u2019s end \u2014 and tens of thousands more in the future.\nIn exchange, the World Bank is giving Jordan a $300 million interest-free loan, the likes of which are traditionally reserved for extremely poor countries in Africa. Western nations, including the United States, have offered roughly $60 million to build schools to accommodate Syrian children. And Jordan is close to clinching what it wants most: tax-free exports to the European Union, especially garments stitched in its industrial export zones.\nIn short, Western leaders are using their financial and political leverage to convince Jordan that it is worthwhile to help refugees improve their lot in this country so they do not cross the Mediterranean Sea in flimsy rafts in search of a better life in Europe. It is a stark shift for both donor countries and Jordan, which, after absorbing generations of refugees from wars across the Middle East, had tried to keep Syrians from establishing a permanent foothold.\n\u201cSome may say this is the one shot that the government has to extract a lot of money,\u201d Stefan Dercon, a professor at Oxford University and the chief economist at the British government\u2019s development aid agency, which supports the effort in Jordan. \u201cI would say it is also the only shot that it will have to really reform its economy and create jobs, with substantial international funding.\u201d\nJordan is not the only country trying to leverage Europe\u2019s anxiety about refugees and migrants. Turkey has negotiated a deal that involves taking back most of those who traveled across the Aegean Sea into Greece in exchange for $6.6 billion in European aid and a proposed waiver of visas for Turks entering Europe.\nEurope is also  promising over $4 billion in aid to several African countries in exchange for their help in stemming the exodus out of the continent. Even Sudan, long under European and American sanctions for its human rights record, is reaping money as part of the package. Libya is getting assistance from Europe to keep migrant boats from crossing the Mediterranean, an approach that Human Rights Watch describes as outsourcing \u201cthe dirty work to Libyan forces.\u201d\nThe shifts in refugee aid policies come as war and persecution drive near-record numbers from their home countries and into poor and middle-income countries like Jordan, where they are blamed for straining public services and driving down wages by working for less.\nThe Jordan deal, announced in February as part of the Jordan Compact, is described optimistically by its framers as \u201cturning the Syrian refugee crisis into a development opportunity.\u201d Its goal is to draw new foreign investment and create jobs for both Jordanians and Syrians. The risk, its proponents privately point out, is that no new investments will pour in, Jordan\u2019s economy will continue to languish and local resentment will grow.\nUntil recently, barely 5,000 Syrian refugees had work permits. The International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency that supports and devises work policies, estimated that 50,000 people in Jordan worked off the books \u2014 roughly the number that the government is promising to legalize this year alone.\nFor Jordan\u2019s leaders, grappling with debt and an economy growing at an anemic 2.4 percent, access to the European market is a critical incentive.\nBut antipathy to Syrian refugees runs high among the Jordanian public, so much so that Bassam Badareen, a Jordanian political columnist, recently suggested that the government had \u201canesthetized\u201d the citizenry before agreeing to let refugees work here.\nJordanian officials have taken pains to point out that Syrians are allowed to work mainly in low-end jobs in construction and agriculture that are unattractive to most Jordanians. They also point out that those holding work permits must be paid the minimum wage of about $270 a month, which helps blunt criticism that refugees drive down wages.\nThe challenge for Jordan is to demonstrate that the new deal will revive its economy and create jobs that its citizens want.\n\u201cThis is a good opportunity for Jordan to attract new investment,\u201d said Raed Nimri, a Jordanian engineer turned aid worker with Mercy Corps, a group based in Oregon that assists people during crises. \u201cIn five years, 10 years, the Syrians are going to go home. The investment is going to stay.\u201d\nThere are still many uncertainties. Jordanian officials point out that they are waiting for much of the aid that has been promised and for the European Council to approve the trade concessions that Jordan hopes will draw foreign businesses. Refugees are often nervous that signing up for work permits may imperil other aid they get from the United Nations.\nOne industry being targeted is garment manufacturing in factories in special export zones.\nOne of those, the Al Hassan Industrial Zone, sits barely a half-hour drive from the Syrian border, near the city of Irbid in northern Jordan, now home to an estimated 300,000 Syrians. The factories there employ barely any Syrians or Jordanians. Instead, they employ thousands of women from poor countries under temporary contracts.\nAmong them: Baby Hawladar, a mother of two from Bangladesh who defied her husband\u2019s orders to travel halfway around the world to hunch over a sewing machine 10 hours a day, six days a week.\nOn a recent afternoon, Ms. Hawladar, 27, was stitching Under Armour yoga pants for export to the United States. She has been in the job two years, working for about $155 a month, plus overtime, and a room and meals. Her goal is to stay a bit longer to save enough money to build a house in her home village.\nEvery week, her children call and ask when she is coming home. Every week, she says, \u201cSoon.\u201d\nWestern Union sends agents directly to the factory floor. Bangladeshi migrants around the world sent $15 billion in remittances back home last year. Replacing workers like her with Syrian refugees, some economists say, would be like robbing Peter to pay Paul \u2014 rewarding those fleeing war to the detriment of others fleeing poverty.\nNot far from the industrial zone, leaning over rows of cucumbers on a vast farm close to the Syrian border, were migrant workers from Egypt, Pakistan and Syria, plus a few Jordanians. In May, after the loosening of work rules, the farm\u2019s owner, Jamal Muhammad Zoabi, obtained permits for the 100 or so Syrians who used to work for him illegally.\nMs. Hadahed, the grandmother, was one of them, having taken over the job from her son after he was picked up in a police raid last year for working without a permit. He was deported back to Hama, the Syrian province now partly controlled by the Islamic State.\nExhausted, ailing, her head spinning some days in the heat, Ms. Hadahed supports herself, her daughter-in-law and two grandchildren on her $270 monthly wage. She does not have much of a choice. Every time she speaks to her son on the phone, he warns her: \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t come back.\u201d\nMr. Zoabi, the farmer, knows something about the perils of life on the other side.\nBefore the war, he grew watermelon in Syria. He went back last year to collect some money he was owed, only to be detained, he said, by Islamic State fighters at a checkpoint. Mr. Zoabi said they had held him for six hours. They made him watch as they beheaded an entire family and then threw the heads into an icebox.\nMr. Zoabi said he had paid the fighters close to $3,000, before being allowed to leave. \u201cIt was the worst trip of my life,\u201d he recalled. \u201cImagine living there.\u201d"}, {"text": "You Say Tomato, These Moths Say Dinner\n2016-08-29T20:13:28.000Z\nThe streets of Bu\u00f1ol, Spain, will run red this week as 20,000 people hurl tomatoes at one another during La Tomatina, the world\u2019s biggest food fight.\nIt\u2019s a luxury that others envy.\nAround the world, tomato crops are being ravaged by an invasive moth no larger than an eyelash. Originally from Chile, Tuta absoluta, also known as the tomato leaf miner, was introduced to Europe in 2006 via a container of infested tomatoes imported to Castell\u00f3n, a Spanish province not far from Bu\u00f1ol. It spread throughout Europe, then to the Middle East, Africa and Asia.\nThe toll is particularly devastating in developing countries, where many farmers can\u2019t afford integrated pest management (I.P.M.), the multipronged approach that has proved most effective at keeping the moth at bay.\nEarlier this year, officials in northern Nigeria, where tomatoes are a staple, declared a state of emergency in Kaduna State, a major producer of the country\u2019s tomatoes. By May, the moth had destroyed more than 80 percent of tomato crops in Kaduna; the price for a large basket of tomatoes rose to $212, from just $1.50 to $7.50 before the shortage.\nAt the peak of the outbreak, a Nigerian website published an article about Spain\u2019s tomatofest headlined: \u201cLa Tomatina: 17 tomato photos that will make Nigerians cry \u2018where is our God?\u2019 \u201d\nThough the leaf miner\u2019s range in Europe is extensive, from Spain to Lithuania, many farmers have kept the moth\u2019s numbers under control with an arsenal of specialized tactics. These include pheromones that lure the moths into traps or disrupt their mating; biopesticides based on bacteria, fungi or oils; chemical pesticides that are highly selective; and the introduction of the leaf miner\u2019s natural enemies.\nThe last measure has been extremely effective in Spain, said Alberto Urbaneja, a professor at the Valencian Institute of Agricultural Research and one of the first to research the Tuta absoluta invasion in Europe. \u201cIf you can establish a good I.P.M. system based on biological control, it is possible to manage Tuta,\u201d he said.\nIn countries with low financial resources, farmers often don\u2019t take action until the pest has moved in. When it does, farmers turn to the pesticides they have on hand, which typically kill a broad spectrum of pests.\nThese chemicals are environmentally harmful and eventually lead to pesticide-resistant bugs.\nIn some countries, the problem comes down to a lack of technical knowledge or government support. With funding from USAID, Muni Muniappan, the director of the IPM Innovation Lab based at Virginia Tech, has been running workshops around the world to help farmers prepare for the inevitable spread of the leaf miner, which also attacks such crops as potatoes, eggplants and peppers.\nMeeting the pest head-on \u201crequires lots of training and information,\u201d Dr. Muniappan said. But his work is currently limited to seven countries in Africa and Asia, including Bangladesh and Nepal, where scientists successfully caught the start of a Tuta absoluta invasion earlier this summer.\nExperts say it\u2019s only a matter of time before the moth invades the remaining countries within its geographical limits, including the United States, where the Agriculture Department has been monitoring Tuta absoluta and regulating the import of tomatoes since 2009.\nThe moths have a high reproductive capacity \u2014 each female produces up to 300 offspring in her lifetime \u2014 and they are small enough to be transported by wind, Dr. Urbanejo said. Their larvae devour tomato leaves, stems, fruits and flowers; uncontrolled, the pest can damage 100 percent of a crop.\nNevertheless, with the right combination of methods, countries should be able to keep the moth at manageable levels, Dr. Urbanejo said.\nThe problem is already showing signs of stabilizing in some African countries, including Kenya, where the moth was first detected in 2013. Farmers there are starting to use pheromone lures and adaptive practices like alternating tomatoes with other crops, said Fathiya Khamis, a scientist at the International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi.\nAt least one company in Kenya, Kenya Biologics, now sells pheromone traps locally, and Dr. Khamis\u2019s team is looking into other options as well, like fungal biopesticides and specialized nets.\nAs farmers adopt more sustainable strategies, tomato lovers may ultimately have to adjust to higher prices. Still, the drastic price hikes that initially accompanied outbreaks have settled down. In Kenya, tomato prices rose to $1.25 a kilogram after the moth outbreak from just 60 cents. Now, prices hover around $1. Tomato prices are now just slightly above what they were before the outbreak in Nigeria as well, said Orode Doherty, a doctor who lives in Lagos.\nAs for La Tomatina, its organizers say it is not contributing to tomato shortages; 145 to 160 tons of wild tomatoes are grown in western Spain just for the festival. These tomatoes aren\u2019t cultivated, harvested or processed as they would be for human consumption, said Miguel Sanfeliu, a representative at La Tomatina.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like growing trees to make confetti for a party,\u201d he said."}, {"text": "Satellite Images Can Pinpoint Poverty Where Surveys Can\u2019t\n2016-04-01T16:35:53.000Z\nAn explosion of data has already changed how we market products and politicians. Now a similar innovation is beginning to change how we combat poverty around the world.\nConsider an unlikely problem: finding the poor. Even in a world riddled with poverty, nearly every government, nonprofit and aid agency struggles with this issue. Where in Kigali should the Rwandan health ministry place a new health clinic? Which rural districts in India should receive rice at subsidized prices? All these decisions require not just knowing poverty exists, but pinpointing areas of greatest need.\nBut until very recently, the data commonly used to answer these questions came almost exclusively from countrywide surveys, which are expensive and logistically challenging. It is very difficult to randomly sample people in the rural areas of Bihar in India or in a slum like Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya, where even just mapping the streets is its own project.\nThese challenges make new kinds of data \u2014 information that can be gathered indirectly using algorithms and novel sources \u2014 particularly valuable. Google searches and Twitter and Facebook posts, which are very useful in the United States, are unlikely to help us in Kibera or Dhaka, Bangladesh. But the core idea behind these sources of data \u2014 measuring without asking people directly \u2014 can be enormously helpful.\nTake the case of measuring the most basic of economic variables: gross domestic product. The numbers can be unreliable in countries where the statistical infrastructure is weak, the informal businesses do not want to be tracked and the numbers may be manipulated. Morten Jerven, an economist at Simon Fraser University, argues in his book, \u201cPoor Numbers,\u201d that for many African countries the lack of quality data impedes development.\nTo see how questionable official data can be, consider that in 2015 North Korea released a budgetary report claiming its economy had grown by roughly 225 percent. To verify this dubious economic miracle, we can turn to NASA, which has produced revealing nighttime satellite images. One image shows an ocean of lights in South Korea and China.\nIt also shows a vast darkness between them, depicting the grim reality of North Korea, where night lighting is a rare luxury. If North Korea is experiencing an economic miracle, it is a purely daytime affair.\nNighttime luminosity tells us not just about electrification but also about economic activity more broadly, and statistical work shows it reliably correlates with economic performance. North Korea is not the only country where satellite photos tell a story that differs from the one told by official data. A seminal paper in the American Economic Review found estimates of income growth in many places that differed from official data by as much as three percentage points annually.\nSatellite photos provide a level of geographic specificity that national accounts do not. Another set of researchers used visual algorithms (related to those that recognize your face on Facebook or help navigate cars) to analyze these images pixel by pixel. Through this process, they could quantify poverty in each square kilometer of Uganda.\nSatellite photos provide other useful information. In rural areas, we can see crops in the ground, allowing us to estimate harvest size \u2014 even before the actual harvest. This data gives us a direct window into an essential part of the economic lives of many of the world\u2019s rural poor. The information can be used to build early warning systems for crop failure, to create crop insurance or target other forms of assistance.\nThere are many other important, unconventional sources of data. Consider cellphones. For most of the world\u2019s poor, each call and text has a very noticeable and real monetary cost.\nThe economist Joshua Blumenstock at the University of Washington uses cellphone metadata (who calls whom, when and for how long) to measure wealth. For instance, people who make calls at certain times of the day are wealthier, and people who make lots of short calls tend to be poorer than people who make fewer, longer ones. In a paper in Science, using data from Rwanda, he quantifies poverty at very high levels of resolution, focusing not just on individual villages but on individual people.\nOf course, all these data sources \u2014 satellites, cellphones and many others \u2014 work even better in concert. Flowminder is a nonprofit organization that has taken on this challenge of combining data.\nWe are beginning to see tangible benefits. For example, GiveDirectly, a nonprofit group that gives cash to the poor, now uses satellite imagery to identify villages where thatched roofs signal that they may need help. \u201cRemote sensing data can be powerful, especially when combined with cheap classification tools like crowdsourcing or machine learning,\u201d says Paul Niehaus, co-founder of the organization. \u201cThey\u2019ve let us strip cost and time out of the process.\u201d\nThe World Bank recently held its Big Data Innovation Challenge. Many of the winners used novel data sets to improve measurement and decision making, and their titles paint vivid, if wonky, pictures: \u201cImproved Real Time Decision Making of Infrastructure Investments for the Philippines by Linking Geo-Spatial Road Network Data With Rich Geo-Tagged Social Data Collected Through Mobile Phones\u201d and \u201cCombining Taxi GPS Data and Open-Source Software for Evidence-Based Traffic Management and Planning.\u201d\nSome of these projects are about changing how we use old sources of data. Typically we take surveys to determine which variables are most correlated with poverty, such as having a thatched roof or a dirt floor or not having a toilet. These variables are then added up to form a score that ranks households. Those with the highest rank may be deemed eligible for help, whether it is a microloan, a food subsidy or a cash transfer.\nBut this kind of simple score card does not take advantage of the latest technologies. For example, in the United States, modern credit scoring agencies do not simply add a few variables. They use predictive algorithms to scour data for complex relationships most associated with default, which are then combined into a tailored prediction of credit risk. Why should the financial services industry, where mere dollars are at stake, be using more advanced technologies than the aid industry, where human life is at stake?\nA winning World Bank Innovation Challenge project, with which I collaborated, aims to close this gap. Melissa Adelman, an economist at the World Bank and one of the lead researchers in our project, says: \u201cExisting surveys may contain much more information for poverty measurement than is actually used. We\u2019re exploring how many more of the poor could be identified and targeted for services by using machine-learning tools. It\u2019s exciting because those better algorithms are essentially free to use, so the benefit-to-cost ratio of any gain in targeting will be very large.\u201d\nAll of these efforts improve efficiency. It doesn\u2019t sound very romantic: Costs go down and accuracy goes up. Typically, efficiency gains like these excite only technocrats. But when these improvements truly help the neediest, all of us should be excited."}, {"text": "With Organic Cotton and Online Ads, Boll & Branch Helps Indian Farmers\n2016-06-16T19:55:26.000Z\nWhen Scott and Missy Tannen were putting the final touches on their home renovation in Summit, N.J., a few years ago, they embarked on a seemingly pedestrian chore: choosing sheets for their new king bed.\nMs. Tannen set off to the mall in search of quality bedding but quickly fell down a rabbit hole. Where were the sheets made? Were the cotton farmers well compensated? Were the factory workers well treated?\nWith consumers increasingly concerned about such matters, Ms. Tannen expected sales associates at stores like Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bed Bath & Beyond to be fluent in answering such queries. Instead, she said, \u201cWhen we started looking for information at the retail level, we realized that no one knew what they were talking about.\u201d\nNearly five years later, the Tannens\u2019 quest for answers has made them unlikely entrepreneurs in the luxury bedding industry. They are partners in a three-year-old company, Boll & Branch, that they say is on track to sell $40 million worth of sheets and towels this year and is profitable.\nIn building Boll & Branch, the Tannens have tried to create a supply chain that improves the livelihoods of farmers and factory workers in India. They also have followed the lead of recent consumer goods companies like the eyeglasses maker Warby Parker and the mattress maker Casper by going all in on e-commerce.\nMr. Tannen, 38, previously founded a video game company and worked in the marketing departments of Wrigley and Kraft. Ms. Tannen, 39, was a third-grade teacher who had become a full-time mother. But once they began thinking about where their sheets came from, the problem nagged at them, provoking radical career changes.\nIn 2013, they decided to take a gamble and use the profits Mr. Tannen had made from the sale of his video game company to start Boll & Branch. Their goal was to make high-end sheets while using good farming and labor practices. Doing so would put them on the moral high ground. Just as important, it would make Boll & Branch stand out in a crowded marketplace. (Other companies, including Parachute, also sell bedding directly to consumers, and some boast that they follow socially responsible practices.)\nThe Tannens began buying thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of sheets to examine different weaves, and spent their spare time researching the cotton industry. The more they learned, the less they liked what they found.\nIn India, one of the largest cotton and garment producers, many farmers are dependent on genetically modified crops. Those seeds and the necessary pesticides may increase yields, but they also cost the farmers money, further eroding their slim profits.\nIt does not get much better further along the supply chain. According to a recent report by the Center for Research on Multinational Corporations, a Dutch nonprofit organization, and the India Committee of the Netherlands, forced labor, child labor and poor working conditions are common in Indian garment factories.\nIf the Tannens were going to create a high-minded bedding company, they would have to do better than the status quo.\nThe first step was to find a reliable source of organic cotton. Besides being more expensive for farmers, conventional cotton farming methods \u2014 particularly the use of pesticides \u2014 may be taking a toll on the health of field workers.\nAfter some searching, the Tannens found Chetna Organic, a nonprofit organization that works with cotton farmers in central and southern India. The Chetna members grow their crops without genetically modified seeds or pesticides, and they use significantly less water than conventional farmers. Chetna is certified by Fair Trade USA, the Global Organic Textile Standard and Fairtrade International, and it maintains stringent internal controls.\nThe Tannens had already settled on using organic cotton when a tragedy prompted them to raise their sights still higher. In April 2013, the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people. That disaster, and others in recent years, prompted many big retailers to pay closer attention to conditions in garment factories. The Tannens hopped on that bandwagon, resolving to carefully scrutinize their factories, too.\nThey opted for Rajlakshmi Cotton Mills, an organic and Fair Trade certified textile factory in Kolkata, India, with which Chetna has a partnership.\nThe approach they are taking has its costs. Mr. Tannen estimates that using organic cotton and Fair Trade labor doubles those expenses, and so far the demand for organic sheets is not great in the United States. But they have resolved to press on.\nNicole Bassett, former director of sustainability at Prana and former manager of social responsibility at another apparel company, Patagonia, said Boll & Branch had a leg up on many other retailers.\n\u201cPeople are creating brands all the time these days,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they asked if there was a better way to do this. At Prana, we were taking years to convert these supply chains. They got to start from the beginning.\u201d\nIn May 2013, the Tannens placed their first order, for 1,500 sets of ivory and white sheets. The ivory sheets arrived with a green hue. But after eliminating such kinks, Boll & Branch sold its first sheets in January 2014, and it has been growing fast since. Sales were about $1.7 million that year and jumped to $13.5 million last year, the Tannens said. This year, they predicted, sales should roughly triple.\nFor Chetna, Boll & Branch was a godsend. Previously, demand for organic cotton was spotty at best. \u201cCotton is a commodity at the end of the day,\u201d said Arun Chandra Ambatipudi, one of the founders of Chetna. \u201cIf you don\u2019t show access to markets, interest will wane.\u201d\nBut now, Boll & Branch is buying more than half of the organic cotton Chetna\u2019s 15,000 farmers produce, about 1,200 metric tons this year. And because Boll & Branch will need the cotton to keep coming, it has begun giving Chetna farmers cash advances, injecting a welcome degree of financial stability into an often volatile occupation.\nThough it has accepted higher costs for materials and labor, the company has found ways to increase margins. Instead of selling at wholesale prices to retailers, Boll & Branch primarily advertises online and sells directly through its own website.\nOn its own, Boll & Branch will not solve the plight of Indian farmers. Compared with the sales of the big wholesalers of sheets, the company\u2019s sales remain a rounding error. Even so, Mr. Tannen contends it is only a matter of time before many more consumers start expecting the cotton in their sheets, towels and even clothes to be organic and ethically sourced.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a change in consciousness among some consumer segments,\u201d Mr. Tannen said. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking about the people on the other side of the product.\u201d"}, {"text": "Women\u2019s Rights Are a National Security Issue\n2016-12-26T08:21:12.000Z\nThe Trump transition team asked the State Department last week to submit details of programs and jobs that focus on promoting gender equality. Maybe it\u2019s for benign purposes \u2014 or better, a signal that the administration wants to make women\u2019s empowerment a cornerstone of its foreign policy. But this seems unlikely, to put it mildly, given that such a commitment was absent from Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign, and alongside Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to defund Planned Parenthood.\nWhatever the reason for their request, Mr. Trump and Rex W. Tillerson, his pick for secretary of state, should remember that women\u2019s rights are tied directly to national security. The State Department\u2019s gender equality programs are not just politically correct fluff \u2014 they deal with matters of life and death, like rape during war, genital cutting, forced marriage and access to education. The State Department provides essential funding to combat these problems.\nNongovernmental organizations around the world that work with survivors of rape and sexual violence are supported by small grants from the State Department, for example. One program in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh trained 450 imams to extol the importance of girls\u2019 education in their Friday sermons and, when officiating at marriages, to ask for the bride\u2019s age and proof of her consent. The United States Agency for International Development helps girls purchase books and pay fees so they can finish grade school. This kind of work is important not just for the women and girls who directly benefit from them, but also for the security of their countries.\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton was not the first person to argue that national security is linked to women\u2019s equality when she made it a cornerstone of American foreign policy. President George W. Bush identified \u201crespect for women\u201d as one of the \u201cnonnegotiable demands of human dignity.\u201d Even President Xi Jinping of China said in 2015 that \u201cevery step taken to promote women\u2019s cause has been a giant step forward for the progress of human civilization.\u201d\nThis is not just hot air. Over a decade\u2019s worth of research shows that women\u2019s advancement is critical to stability and to reducing political violence. Countries where women are empowered are vastly more secure, whether the issue is food security, countering violent extremism or resolving disputes with other nations peacefully.\nRecruitment by terrorist groups is a prime example. A forthcoming paper by one of us, Professor Hudson, and Hilary Matfess, a researcher at the Institute for Defense Analyses, has found that swiftly rising \u201cbride prices\u201d (money or goods given by the groom to the bride\u2019s family) makes it easier for terrorists to recruit members.\nBride prices typically act like a regressive tax on young men, and in some places, that burden has risen rapidly. In South Sudan, for example, a bride cost 12 cows a decade ago. But the going rate in recent years has been over 50 cows, 50 goats and $12,000. These marriage practices not only cast women as chattel, but also create widespread resentment among young men.\nTerrorist groups such as Boko Haram in West Africa and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan have found it easy to recruit in such a context, and in South Sudan, two-thirds of men surveyed reported they had to steal cattle to pay for brides, stoking ethnic conflict. A realist foreign policy would use this knowledge in efforts to reduce terrorist groups\u2019 recruitment, perhaps also tracking bride price trajectories while encouraging a cap on prices and even changes in the practice, as Uganda has recently done.\nFurthermore, it is also vital to include women\u2019s priorities in negotiations and transitions from conflict to peace. A study of the landmark United Nations resolution on women, peace and security found that peace agreements were significantly more durable when women took part in the negotiations. A realist foreign policy would take note of this. For example, to gain a lasting peace accord in Afghanistan, policy makers should make sure that both Afghan and American women are at the negotiating table in meaningful numbers.\nThe strongest antidote to the instability caused by gender inequality is to attack the constellation of forces that cause women to suffer, such as child marriage and unequal property rights. Our foreign policy should ensure that women have not only a place at the table, but a real voice when major decisions are made.\nEven if the new administration is not poised to be as attentive to gender issues as previous ones, the United States still has obligations under international treaties, and also some of our own policies. The United States National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security requires the State and Defense Departments, along with the Agency for International Development, to meet benchmarks on efforts for women\u2019s inclusion and empowerment.\nConsider what Ryan Crocker, a former ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq, said about the fate of Afghan women: \u201cNo one is going to be dumb enough to say, \u2018Oh, forget the women; that\u2019s not important.\u2019 \u201d\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Trump called for a return to \u201cforeign policy realism,\u201d in which national security is the foremost concern, the stakes are zero-sum and the most powerful states are the only ones that matter. To build such a foreign policy, women\u2019s rights are an indispensable pillar."}, {"text": "What Is a Constant Cycle of Violent News Doing to Us?\n2016-07-15T20:27:39.000Z\nIt has been a rough year.\nBy now, our violence is down to a pattern, and there is a choreography to our reactions.\nA killer seeks out a nightclub, a church, an airport, a courthouse, a protest. Someone is shot on video, sometimes by the police, and marchers fill the streets. An attack is carried out in France, America, Turkey, Bangladesh, Lebanon, Tunisia, Nigeria, and then claimed and celebrated by a radical terror group.\nOur phones vibrate with news alerts. The talking heads fill air over cable news captions that shout \u201cbreaking news\u201d in red. Rumors and misinformation abound. The comments erupt on Twitter, Facebook and news sites.\nJournalists create multimedia stories that focus on videos, photos and graphic accounts from victims and witnesses. The experts give interviews, and the latest tools of immediacy are put to use. After thedeadly terror attack in Nice, France, The Times invited grief counselors to be interviewed on Facebook Live. Within days, attention had turned to a shooting in Baton Rouge that left three law enforcement officers dead.\nSo, what is this doing to us? \nIt depends on the individual, but living in a digitally linked world where broadcasts of violence are instantaneous and almost commonplace means that many of us are becoming desensitized, Anita Gadhia-Smith, a psychologist in Washington, said Friday.\n\u201cWith the frequency of shootings and terror attacks there is a sense of anxiety that\u2019s building in people,\u201d she said, \u201ca sense of vulnerability and powerlessness.\u201d\nDr. Smith added: \u201cThere is a heightened alarm, but there can also be some desensitization that\u2019s happening.\u201d\nThe constant stream of news on social media can also be traumatic. A team of researchers at the University of Bradford in England told a British psychology conference last year that exposure to violent imagery on social media can cause symptoms that are similar to post-traumatic stress disorder, defined as a persistent emotional reaction to a traumatic event that severely impairs one\u2019s life.\nIn an analysis conducted by the Bradford researchers, 189 participants were shown images and provided with stories of violent events, including the Sept. 11 attacks, school shootings and suicide bombings.\nThe researchers\u2019 analysis showed that 22 percent of those who participated were significantly affected by what they saw.\nThe study also found that people who view violent events more often were more affected than people who saw them less frequently, and that people who described themselves as extroverts with outgoing personalities were at a higher risk to be disturbed by the images.\nWhat can we do about it? \nThe self-care advice hasn\u2019t changed. It is natural to want to follow along with incremental updates on social media and in the news. But it\u2019s important to know that this can heighten your anxiety.\nAnne Marie Albano, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders, said in an interview after the 2015 Paris attacks that it might be a good idea to limit your exposure to social media.\nDesignating times to plug into the news \u2014 checking Twitter in the morning over coffee, but not listening to the radio while driving your kids to school, for instance \u2014 can help you manage anxiety if you are feeling stressed.\n\u201cThis will help you balance a realistic and credible threat with information that is sensationalized,\u201d Dr. Albano said, \u201cor a rush to report something or talk about something that doesn\u2019t have the impact that you would think it has.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re feeling anxiety about a possible attack, compare your fear with the facts. \nWhen you fear the worst, it\u2019s hard to remember that, say, a flight or a train ride has extraordinarily high odds of being safe. But you have to try.\nHumans are bad at assessing risk, Martin Seif, a psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders and the fear of flying, said in an interview late last year.\n\u201cEvery single anxiety-management technique is based on the premise that your reaction is out of proportion\u201d to the likelihood of danger, Dr. Seif said.\nAlso, remember to take a breath. \nA guide to dealing with terrorism released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation encourages closing your eyes and taking deep breaths to feel calmer.\nTaking a walk or talking to a close friend can also help.\nThe guide also recommends avoiding alcohol and drugs, exercising regularly and eating healthy foods \u2014 basic self-care guidelines that help reduce stress.\nMake sure you have a plan to contact your family if something happens, especially if cellular networks are overloaded or transportation is disrupted, but remember that you most likely will not need it, experts say.\nIf you have children, the American Psychological Association recommends asking them how they are feeling about the news. Keep in mind that it is possible for children to be influenced by news reports and the adult conversations around them.\nLastly, keep your daily routine. \nDr. Albano said that a primary worry in the field of psychology is people \u201cgoing out of their way to be so safe that it shrinks their world.\u201d\n\u201cTerrorists thrive on this kind of thing,\u201d she added. \u201cThey want to see the population change their practices.\u201d\nGoing out of your way to avoid interacting with strangers \u2014 by refusing to take mass transit, for example \u2014 can stoke fear and anxiety in children, she said.\nThe best way to help children cope with acts of violence is to start by listening to them, Sean Rogers, a psychotherapist who works with children and teenagers, told The Times on his Facebook Live appearance.\n\u201dListening is curative,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the basis of all therapies.\u201d"}, {"text": "Drawing Up a Hit List to Erase Traces of a Hostage Siege in Queens\n2016-05-29T17:06:35.000Z\nIn the house in Queens that morning, a telephone rang.\nA stranger with a gun stood nearby, his face hidden behind a ski mask. He pointed the gun at one of the men who lived there.\n\u201cPick up the phone,\u201d he said, according to a criminal complaint. \u201cSpeak in English. Anything other than English, I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d\nThe hostage answered.\nThe events on that March day last year, with police officers arriving in droves to an armed robbery in one home and a standoff in another, rattled the predominantly Bangladeshi block in Jamaica, a block that breathed a collective sigh of relief when the suspect surrendered that afternoon.\nBut that relief disappeared last week with the disclosure by prosecutors of a far more sinister scheme in connection with that day, one meant to ensure that the suspect\u2019s trial would end in his favor. The addresses of both homes and the names of people inside had been jotted on a list. The list was for a hit man, the police and prosecutors said, with instructions to kill everyone on it so they could not testify.\nA young man outside one of the homes brushed off a reporter on Wednesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still going on,\u201d he said, before driving away.\nIt all began on March 16, 2015, a Monday, around 8 a.m. A man in a ski mask knocked on the front door of an attached house on a block of 168th Street, one of several nearly identical homes in a row. But the door was not chosen at random.\nThe man\u2019s name was Edward Leasure, 35, the police said. He had been in prison twice after convictions for theft and robbery. A woman answered his knock, and Mr. Leasure stepped inside, according to the criminal complaint. He led the woman and her husband into a bedroom.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the safe?\u201d he asked the husband, according to the complaint. \u201cYou had a big party Saturday night. I know you have a safe. Show me the safe or I\u2019ll shoot your wife in the foot.\u201d\nThe woman grabbed some cash, $300, and handed it to Mr. Leasure. Then he left, not through the front door, but through an exit that led to the roof, said a neighbor, Arman Hossain, 37. He climbed over the short partitions that separated the rowhouses, passing over one house, then another and another, stopping at the fourth.\nThe police were coming. The couple from the first house had called 911, and officers arrived in cars and vans and, from above, a helicopter.\nMr. Leasure entered the second home and punched a woman in the shoulder, according to the complaint. He gathered her and two other people in a room at gunpoint. \u201cBe calm. Don\u2019t scream,\u201d he said, according to the complaint. \u201cI\u2019m just going to wait until the police leave.\u201d\nThat is when the phone rang. It was the hostage\u2019s brother calling, at the urging of the police. Officers, suspecting that Mr. Leasure was hiding inside, had instructed the brother about what to say on the phone.\nSpeaking in their native Bengali, the brother asked, \u201cIs there a man in there with a gun?\u201d the complaint states. \u201cIf there is, say, \u2018O.K., see you for dinner.\u2019\u201d\nThe hostage, careful to obey his captor, answered in English. \u201cO.K., O.K., O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cYes. Dinner.\u201d\nThe call ended. Mr. Leasure took a pair of pants from the house and stashed his own in a pile of laundry, the complaint states. He also hid his ski mask, jacket, boots and, in a dresser drawer, his gun.\nTwo floors below, in the basement, Mr. Hossain, the neighbor, was unaware of the situation upstairs and why the police were outside. \u201cI hear \u2018boom, boom boom\u2019 on my door,\u201d he said last week. \u201cSWAT team.\u201d Officers hurried him outside to a van.\nThe standoff lasted about four hours. Mr. Leasure surrendered.\nHis trial was set for next month. Last week, prosecutors announced the arrests of Mr. Leasure\u2019s girlfriend and his father and described the murder-for-hire plot.\nOne month ago, the father, Eddie Marcus, 53, approached a man in Jamaica, the same neighborhood the standoff was in, and offered to pay him to kill witnesses who would be testifying against his son, according to another criminal complaint. Mr. Marcus gave the man the list of names, the complaint states.\nA few days later, Mr. Marcus introduced the man, who is not identified in the complaint, but who cooperated with the Queens district attorney\u2019s office, to his son\u2019s girlfriend, Latisha Larrymore, 31. Ms. Larrymore said she knew someone who would sell him a gun and a silencer, the complaint states.\nOn May 12, in a telephone call monitored by the police, Ms. Larrymore told the man she had asked a friend for money, but the friend had refused, the complaint states. She discussed forms of collateral.\nThe plot ended there. Ms. Larrymore and Mr. Marcus were arrested on May 23 and charged with conspiracy and solicitation to commit murder. Ms. Larrymore, according to the complaint, said that Mr. Leasure, from jail, had instructed her to meet his father because his father had found \u201ca lawyer who will take care of the situation,\u201d which she said was code for a hit man\nThe account of Ms. Larrymore\u2019s actions is difficult to reconcile with her public persona in recent months. Ms. Larrymore, who poses atop her motorcycle in Facebook photos, was in an accident in July and lost a leg. Her recovery and rehabilitation have been the subject of Facebook videos applauded by her friends, as well as the focus of an online fund-raising effort.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, because she\u2019s a churchgoing person,\u201d her grandfather, Wendell Larrymore, 81, said on Friday. \u201cShe got mixed up with the wrong person.\u201d\nMr. Leasure has not been charged in the conspiracy. His scheduled trial date in June \u2014 and its list of witnesses \u2014 remains unchanged."}, {"text": "Manohar Aich, 4-Foot-11 Bodybuilder Known as the Pocket Hercules, Dies at 103\n2016-06-10T03:14:46.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 They called him the Pocket Hercules.\nAs a teenager he could bend steel bars in his bare hands, as well as with his teeth. At 39, after he had taken up bodybuilding, he won the Mr. Universe competition. And he managed all this despite being only 4 feet 11 inches, thus the nickname.\nManohar Aich died last Sunday in India at 103, remembered not only for his almost superhuman strength but also for a colorful life. As an airman in the colonial Royal Air Force, he was court-martialed for insubordination and imprisoned. He performed for more than a decade in a traveling circus, where he flexed muscles in time to music. And he ran a gym on the ground floor of the three-story building in which he lived, grooming some of India\u2019s greatest bodybuilders.\nBeyond all that, he was revered for leading a profoundly simple life, both physically and philosophically. He never drank or smoked, and he kept to a diet of rice, fish, vegetables, lentils, fruit and milk. Dismissive of high-tech exercise machines, he trained himself and others through thousands of repetitions of Indian-style push-ups and squats, known as dand and bethak.\nHis refrain, \u201cas it is,\u201d summed up his life philosophy, said Bishnu Aich, 68, the eldest of Mr. Aich\u2019s four children, three of whom survive him.\n\u201cHe never allowed himself to worry about anything,\u201d Bishnu Aich, who helped Mr. Aich run his gym, said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe took everything as it was, as it came. That was the secret to his success and his happiness and his long, long life.\u201d\nManohar Aich was born on March 17, 1913, in the village of Putia in Comilla District, which was then part of British India and is now in Bangladesh. After overcoming a severe illness as a child, he devoted himself to healthy living and strength training, inspired by watching local wrestlers exercise. He copied their push-up and squat regimens in what became a lifelong conviction that simple exercise was the key to building strength \u2014 and success in life.\nWhen Mr. Aich was a teenager, his father became too sick to work, so the young man began supporting his family by performing feats of strength at local events, his son said.\nBesides bending steel rods, he tore 1,000-page books in half, dragged 450-pound loads down the street and balanced himself by resting his abdomen on the tip of a sword. He had a scar on his neck where a sword had once pierced him when he slipped while performing the stunt.\nIn his late 20s, Mr. Aich moved to Kolkata, the commercial hub then known as Calcutta, and continued to build his strength by working out at a gym. He supported himself by selling coconuts at the city\u2019s main railway station.\nMr. Aich entered the British colonial air force in the 1940s. Influenced by the independence movement, he joined an uprising against his superiors and was imprisoned by the British military in 1947 after slapping an officer. In jail, he exercised and trained with weights for as many as 12 hours a day.\nHe was released under an amnesty program a year or two later, after independence had been won. With the chiseled physique he had enhanced in jail, he won a Mr. Hercules contest in 1950, earning the moniker the Pocket Hercules.\nMr. Aich was so much smaller than India\u2019s other famous bodybuilder, Premchand Degra, that Mr. Degra said he carried him on his shoulder at a competition in New Delhi in 1993, a moment captured in a photograph that became famous in India.\nMr. Aich participated in his first Mr. Universe contest in 1951 in London, placing second. He went on to win that contest on his second try, after a year of training in London and working for British Railways. He returned to India a national hero.\nMadhukar Talwalkar, 83, a bodybuilder who is the chairman of a large fitness chain, remembered being grateful as a young man for the chance to apply oil to Mr. Aich\u2019s body at competitions, \u201cjust for the chance to touch our country\u2019s Mr. Universe.\u201d\nKshitish Chatterjee, also 83, who trained at Mr. Aich\u2019s gym and represented India in three international competitions, said Mr. Aich was a taskmaster.\n\u201cIf you skipped any workout, you\u2019d get a good kick or tappar,\u201d he said in an interview, using the Hindi word for slap. \u201cNobody who worked with him ever forgets his coaching \u2014 to work with single-minded dedication and not to worry about anything.\u201d\nMr. Aich affirmed that teaching, telling The Daily Mail: \u201cI never allow any sort of tension to grip me. I had to struggle to earn money since my young days, but whatever the situation, I remained happy.\u201d\nMr. Aich took up circus performing in the 1960s, traveling around India with his family. His best-loved act was known as muscle dancing, in which he rippled his body to music, Bishnu Aich said.\nChetan Pathare, the general secretary of the Indian Bodybuilders Federation, said he had never seen anyone with better muscle control than Mr. Aich. \u201cIf he wanted, he could flex only his left pectoral muscle,\u201d he said.\nThat strength and muscle control stayed with Mr. Aich well into his 80s.\n\u201cHe gave performances until he was 87, showing his muscles,\u201d Mr. Talwalkar said. \u201cHe was wrinkled and bald, but he always had an eight-pack, even in old age.\u201d\nMr. Aich never cashed in on his fame. Even after winning the Mr. Universe title, he continued to struggle financially, but he never complained about it, his friends and family said. To the end, they said, he hewed to his philosophy of \u201cas it is.\u201d"}, {"text": "First-Degree Murder Charge Added in Killing of Queens Imam and Aide\n2016-08-17T00:43:32.000Z\nThe Queens district attorney\u2019s office on Tuesday upgraded the charges against a man accused of gunning down an imam and his assistant on a sidewalk, adding a single count of first-degree murder for an attack that a prosecutor described in court as a \u201ccoldblooded and premeditated assassination.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the man, Oscar Morel, 35, made his first appearance in Queens Criminal Court since his arrest in the Saturday afternoon attack. He is accused of approaching the imam, Alauddin Akonjee, 55, and his assistant, Thara Miah, 64, from behind in the Ozone Park neighborhood and shooting them execution-style.\nAlthough investigators said they had not determined the motive for the attack, Peter McCormack, an assistant district attorney, described it as \u201ca most horrendous and despicable act.\u201d\n\u201cThe defendant ran up behind both of them and pumped numerous bullets into them,\u201d he said, \u201cstriking them both in the head, leaving them lying on the street mortally wounded.\u201d\nMr. Morel, chained at his hands and feet, shuffled into a packed courtroom, filled with worshipers from the men\u2019s mosque in Ozone Park, family members of the victims and some of Mr. Morel\u2019s relatives. His mother sat with her head in her hands.\nThe judge ordered that Mr. Morel be held without bail. He is scheduled to return to court on Thursday.\nHis lawyer, Leonard Ressler, said that his client maintained his innocence. He said that Mr. Morel denied any involvement and \u201cinsists this case proceeds as quickly as possible.\u201d\nMr. Morel, who has been in police custody since late Sunday, was charged on Monday night with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\nIn a search of Mr. Morel\u2019s home Monday night, investigators found a weapon that ballistics tests confirmed was used in the attack, law enforcement officials said. The weapon, a .38-caliber revolver, was found inside a wall in his apartment, officials said.\nProsecutors added the first-degree murder charge, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole, because the attack was believed to be \u201cthe intentional killing of two individuals during the same transaction,\u201d the district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said in a statement.\nPursuing such a charge is an unusual step, officials said, typically reserved for cases like the killing of a police officer. Examples in recent years in Queens include the case of Mazoltuv Borukhova and Mikhail Mallayev, who were convicted in the 2007 killing of Dr. Borukhova\u2019s estranged husband at a playground in front of the couple\u2019s 4-year-old daughter, and the Wendy\u2019s massacre in 2000, in which bound-and-gagged fast-food workers were shot execution-style.\nMany in the Bangladeshi community who live in the area around Ozone Park have argued that the attack on Saturday was a hate crime, noting that the men were dressed in religious garb. Officials said prosecuting the case as a hate crime remained possible.\n\u201cWhile the motivation for this violent act is still unclear and continues to be investigated, one of the possible motives being explored is whether this was a hate crime,\u201d Mr. Brown said. Regardless of whether a hate crime had been committed, he added, \u201cthe crime will be vigorously prosecuted, and we will seek the most serious penalties that our law allows.\u201d\ntranscript\nImam and His Assistant\n\nCity officials and members of the Al-Furqan Jame Masjid outside the mosque in Ozone Park, Queens, on Sunday. The mosque\u2019s imam, Alauddin Akonjee, and his assistant, Thara Miah, were fatally shot on Saturday after leaving afternoon prayers.\nOutside the courthouse after the arraignment, the victims\u2019 relatives said they were struggling to grasp what had happened. \u201cI would like to ask that man why he killed my brother,\u201d said Mashuk Uddin, Mr. Miah\u2019s brother. \u201cI want to know what was his reason.\u201d\nMr. Morel, who was seen after his arrest wearing a work shirt embroidered with his name and the New School\u2019s logo, has worked as a porter for the university since November 2013, the school said in a statement. He had one previous arrest, on a misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession, law enforcement officials said.\nHis relatives declined to talk to reporters after the hearing.\nAli Rivera, a longtime friend of Mr. Morel\u2019s, said he was stunned by the allegations. He added that he had never heard Mr. Morel, whom he saw two weeks ago at a family function, say anything disparaging about Muslims. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. \u201cHe never messes with anybody. I don\u2019t believe he could do it.\u201d\nThe authorities said that Mr. Morel had walked up behind Mr. Akonjee and Mr. Miah near the intersection of Liberty Avenue and 79th Street, shot them and then drove off in a Chevrolet sport utility vehicle. Officials said that investigators had video footage of the attack and of Mr. Morel in the vehicle from surveillance cameras in the area.\nMr. McCormack said Mr. Morel had viewed videos of the car from before and after the murder and identified himself to the police as the person on the tape, but denied committing the murders.\nNear Mr. Morel\u2019s apartment, a basement unit in a two-story house with blue shingles on Miller Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn, neighbors said that he had not lived there long, perhaps only a few months.\nBut even in that time, his next-door neighbor Andreina Adames said, he did not make a good impression. She called Mr. Morel, who typically came in and out alone through a back entrance, \u201csilent\u201d and \u201cweird.\u201d\n\u201cHe never hung out with us,\u201d Ms. Adames said. \u201cHe never even said hello.\u201d"}, {"text": "In Milan, Ermenegildo Zegna and Ralph Lauren Zero In on the One Percent\n2016-01-17T15:23:21.000Z\nMILAN \u2014 Horizontal is not the only direction for market expansion in the rag trade. Increasingly, designer ambitions are turning vertical. Considered in global terms, the population of the One Percent amounts to a nationality of its own, a new reality duly reflected in Stefano Pilati\u2019s Ermenegildo Zegna collection for men, titled Ermenegildo Zegna Couture.\nWith models either wearing or toting numbers \u2014 as at classic women\u2019s couture shows of yesteryear \u2014 and parading around a fake fur runway to tracks from David Bowie\u2019s \u201cYoung Americans,\u201d (deftly remixed by Michel Gaubert), Mr. Pilati homed in on textures, on the complexly woven materials one expects from a textile powerhouse like Lanificio Zegna, and on embellishments stitched by hand.\nIf trailblazing wasn\u2019t the point of a staid grouping of tunic coats over quilted jackets, full-pleated trousers, blouson jackets of diamond jacquard, sweeping cloaks of monochrome, or a deceptively simple raglan-sleeved camel hair overcoat even a non-expert could tell was a masterpiece of tailoring, that was the point. Mr. Pilati drew an imaginary line with the collection between his wealthy potential consumer and vulgar Instagram hoi polloi. His clothes conveyed the quiet aura of money, chastely created and largely invisible. \u201cThe fabric speaks to me,\u201d Mr. Pilati said of his creative process. This season it spoke in a whisper.\nRalph Lauren was early to the superrich, of course; his romance with their queer folkways dates back decades. Locust Valley never looked quite as good as it did after Mr. Lauren got through with it. His West Egg homages were retailed to the masses, however \u2014 and still are, under the Polo label. At the upper end of his offerings, Mr. Lauren doubles down on the Jay Gatsby fantasia with arrays like the Purple Label suits shown at Casa Campanini, his Liberty-style palazzo built in 1941.\nOut on the street, hundreds of fans grew delirious whenever Lucky Blue Smith \u2014 the male model with the Windex blue eyes and 1.9 million Instagram followers \u2014 gazed out a window. Indoors all was serenity as guests sipped Champagne and nibbled tartlets of salt cod mousse passed by liveried waiters. The models arrayed in tableaux had a time-capture aspect. Whether dressed in lean double-breasted suits, brocade evening jackets out of Wong Kar-wai, feather-light shearling dusters, trucker jackets of shearling manipulated to resemble ponyskin, or the custom ski wear that is Mr. Lauren\u2019s latest venture (amboyna burl ski-poles, anyone?), the image conveyed was of a freeze frame shot depicting young Mr. Moneybags, circa the winter of 2016.\nTrue, the slouchy \u201cathleisure\u201d sweatpants were a lot like those regular Joes will wear while watching Super Bowl 50 in February. But Purple Label customers won\u2019t be sitting feet up on the coffee table between a six-pack of Bud and a bowl of Doritos. They\u2019ll be nibbling bacalao mousse tartlets while clad in knitted cashmere sweats from Ralph Lauren, gazing down at the rest of us from the window of a Gulfstream G650.\nAt a slacker point along the arc of income is Costume National, a label whose designer, Ennio Capasa, termed himself in a backstage chat as the \u201cvictim of vampires\u201d of Main Street. The blood suckers he had in mind have names. Many of us have bought $15 shirts made in Bangladeshi sweat shops at their stores.\nSo lightning quick are fast-fashion chains at getting designer runway looks to consumers that designers like Mr. Capasa can no longer keep pace. \u201cThey are vampirizing our creativity,\u201d he said, before sending out a tidily edited collection inspired, as usual, by rock musicians like his friend Mr. Bowie and whose high point was a sequence of reed thin suits in colors like electric blue, aquamarine or grass green. No fortune teller was required to know that those same suits at a fraction of what Costume National charges will soon be seen on the floor at Zara or Topshop or H&M.\nIn many ways, the true design challenges lately have had less to do with runway offerings than with back office strategies for mapping and reconfiguring markets. The majority owner of Pal Zileri, an Italian mass-market label, is the Qatari group Mayhoola for Investments, which also owns a majority stake in Valentino; it not long ago brought in Mauro Ravizza Krieger as creative director to revamp the Zileri image. Adding fancy stuff like suits in d\u00e9grad\u00e9 finishes or threaded through with Lurex, Mr. Krieger aims to introduce male consumers to \u201cavant craft,\u201d whatever that is. While the phrase is vaporous, his ambitions are far from it: \u201cWe want to do it all at a point that is not crazy on the price.\u201d\nLabels like Jil Sander once had a lock on a certain consumer bandwidth. For a time the brand almost defined the work uniform of those in the art dealing or head-shrinking business. Nowadays it\u2019s hard to fathom who the designer Rodolfo Paglialunga has in mind when he reprises what often seem like Helmut Lang\u2019s Greatest Hits collections. A decade after retiring from the business, Mr. Lang remains fashion\u2019s Type O: the universal donor.\nHence, Mr. Paglialunga\u2019s bomber jackets, boiler suits, sleeveless vests in what he termed \u201can unremitting\u201d \u2014 actually rather lovely \u2014 palette of khaki, olive drab or black looked pretty familiar. It\u2019s a pity psychiatrists don\u2019t wear Jil Sander anymore, though, since a therapist might have a field day analyzing the ribbed jumpers with woolly fleece-patched shoulders or the reversed overcoats that button up the rear, defying a wearer to dress himself.\nMilan sometimes seems about equally a destination for gifted journeymen and nut-job divas. Neil Barrett falls so squarely into the former category one sometimes wishes he\u2019d have the occasional tantrum or throw a phone. Once again, he showed here that few in the business are his equal at walking a line between sports- and work wear. Once again, he riffed on familiar themes and motifs: anoraks, biker jackets, Harrington bombers in soccer jersey colors reminiscent of the 1970s. And as in past, his collection left at least one observer willing him to cut loose, smoke a spliff or go on a tear.\nSimilarly, Massimiliano Giornetti, the creative director of Salvatore Ferragamo, could afford to loosen up a bit. Mr. Giornetti is one of the most courteous men in the business \u2014 a good thing in a gentleman, less so in a designer \u2014 and his show of discreetly mismatched checks and tweeds, the best cut trousers seen this week and blouson jackets in tomato red suffered from an excess of correctness. Too much politeness can be a bad thing.\nAnother creator of controlled temperament, Tomas Maier of Bottega Veneta put on a typically assured show, held as usual at Sunday morning church time. That Mr. Maier designs for the One Percent has never been in question. That his designs increasingly skew toward the evolving tastes of a new class that favors invisibility over ostentation was telegraphed by the restraint of the double-breasted cashmere jacket that opened the show (worn over a sweater); the voluminous dark tweed coats; the lumberjack plaid shirt jackets no lumberjack will ever be able to afford. The terms Mr. Maier used to explain the collection were like keywords for the new rich: unostentatious, calm and discreet.\nOstentation, not discretion, is Versace territory, as are inspired and even occasionally wacko flights of creative fancy. Astronomy, astrology and space travel were all evoked in a delightfully theatrical show that opened with runners sprinting in the dark beneath black lights, their track suits illuminated in patterned fiber optics. The most audacious element of a collection mostly without gimmicks had almost nothing to do with NASA, high technology or anybody\u2019s rising sign, however. In a world dominated by clerical black, we tend to forget about the color wheel as a design tool. Suddenly a pang of longing for chromatic dispersion can overcome you when a designer like Donatella Versace does something as simple as send out a few handsome lugs wearing enormous coats and big wooly sweaters in colors like lilac or baby blue."}, {"text": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote Has European Workers in Britain Unsure of Future\n2016-06-13T19:54:13.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 Filipe Graca hovered over an espresso machine at the British food chain Pret A Manger and frothed out a cafe latte for a waiting customer. Until last year, he had struggled to find any kind of a job in his native Portugal. But when he arrived in London, he was able to work almost right away.\nSo were the young women from Hungary, France and Albania who cheerfully tended the cash registers. And the staff from Poland, Spain and Italy cleaning tables and preparing sandwiches for the lunch crowd. Only one thing seemed to bother them: the prospect that Britain might actually leave the European Union.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the U.K. will vote for a Brexit, but if they do, it would be bad,\u201d said Mr. Graca, who was working to help finance his studies for a computer science degree.\n\u201cLook around,\u201d he added, gesturing to colleagues who hailed from 10 nations across Europe. \u201cEveryone here is from another country.\u201d\nBritain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201d\nStep into nearly any London restaurant, hotel or retail shop and chances are that most people serving your meal, checking you in or ringing up your sale are not British. Peer inside a construction site, and a hive of nationalities is busy building. Even the British farm vegetables on your plate were probably harvested by European immigrants.\nAs Britain prepares to vote on whether to retain its membership in the European Union, dire warnings have been multiplying about the punch to the British economy, and especially the vaunted financial industry, should the so-called Brexit happen. But some of the hardest-hit businesses are likely to be in the goods and services that Britons deal with every day.\nFor decades, the hospitality, retail, food and construction industries in particular have taken advantage of the bloc\u2019s rules allowing freedom of movement, meaning Europeans like Mr. Graca can work legally in any of the 28 countries that are members. Non-Europeans must obtain work visas under immigration rules that require graduate-level skills and a minimum annual salary of 20,800 pounds.\nShould Britain leave and start requiring European citizens to clear the same visa hurdles as other foreign workers, three-quarters of the 2.2 million people from other E.U. countries currently working in Britain wouldn\u2019t make the cut, according to the Migration Observatory at Oxford University. More than 90 percent of the 442,000 European migrants working at British hotels and restaurants also would not qualify.\nWhile European nationals working in Britain make up just 5 percent of the 31.5 million-strong work force, compared to 11 percent from overseas, they have become a visible flash point in the overall debate about whether and what type of immigration really works for Britain.\nThe \u201cleave\u201d camp argues that it has been too easy for \u201cmigrant workers\u201d from Europe to waltz into the country and take British jobs. \u201cWe have absolutely no power to control the numbers who are coming with no job offers and no qualifications from the 28 E.U. countries,\u201d Boris Johnson, the former London mayor, said in a recent speech rallying for a Brexit.\nBritish businesses have faced criticism for hiring them. Greencore, Britain\u2019s biggest sandwich maker, drew fire for seeking hundreds of Hungarian employees for a new sandwich factory in Northampton, an hour north of London. Pret A Manger, whose stores dot street corners across Britain, has been faulted for employing relatively few British workers. (A spokesman for Pret A Manger declined to comment.)\nCritics also point to the low wages that many E.U. workers seem willing to take in labor-intensive industries, especially people fleeing struggling economies. Nearly 40 percent of the more than two million European workers in Britain hail from low-wage nations such as Poland and Romania. And since a debt crisis struck the European south, growing numbers of Italians, Greeks, Spanish and Portuguese have left for a chance at any employment in Britain.\nBut for many Europeans grateful to have a job, what is considered a low wage in the eyes of some British is better than what they would get back home. \u201cThere are no jobs in Portugal,\u201d said Mr. Graca, who was hoping to be promoted to barista, which pays \u00a39.20 an hour, more than Pret\u2019s base pay of \u00a38.50 and higher than the \u00a37.20 rate considered a living wage. \u201cI\u2019m here to work and earn money,\u201d he said.\nAny \u201cout\u201d vote would not force Europeans to leave Britain, at least not right away. For the next two years, the British government would negotiate new treaties with the European Union over labor movement and other matters.\nStill, with the referendum looming, thousands of workers across the city are bracing for a potentially murky future. Employers are grappling with uncertainty about whether they will be able to hire Europeans as easily as before.\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is what is going to be the status of those people going forward,\u201d said Keith Howells, the chief executive of Mott MacDonald, a major construction services firm with projects in Britain and worldwide. Around 20 percent of his workers in Britain are from elsewhere in the European Union.\n\u201cWill they be welcome or not? Will they be subject to quotas or won\u2019t they?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially hugely destabilizing.\u201d\nThat\u2019s especially true for London\u2019s restaurants, bars and hotels, since Europeans make up most employees.\nA British departure from the bloc \u201cwould impact the industry big time, and those who work here,\u201d said Filippo Castellana, an Italian who manages the French restaurant Le Garrick in Covent Garden. On a recent day, patrons were served steak frites and onion soup by staff members from Poland, Latvia, Hungary, Lithuania and France.\n\u201cWe depend on European workers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be insane for Britain to leave.\u201d\nAround the corner at Suvlaki, a Greek restaurant specializing in grilled meat skewers and stuffed pitas, the owner, Yannis Theodorakakos, was preparing to tally the impact if he needed to obtain work visas for the 13 European citizens working on his staff.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world,\u201d Mr. Theodorakakos said. A former banker, he expects that an independent Britain would start operating like Switzerland, whose relationship with the European Union is framed by bilateral treaties giving it greater control over immigration. \u201cBut if I had to use visas in the future to hire from the E.U., it would cost us money as employers,\u201d he said.\nThat argument riles backers of the \u201cleave\u201d lobby, who argue that European citizens distort the labor market in part because they are able to come into Britain with virtually no checks and start looking for a job.\nRecently, Britain\u2019s popular curry houses aligned themselves with pro-Brexit campaigners, complaining that skilled chefs from places like Bangladesh must get expensive, time-consuming visas while Europeans with little restaurant expertise can work right away. A Brexit would even an unfair playing field, they say.\nBut to those who claim their business could be crippled without European labor, such talk is a feeble diversion from the elephant in the room in the Brexit debate.\n\u201cThe fact is we\u2019re doing jobs that most British people don\u2019t want to do,\u201d said Anna Pawelec, the manager of Pillars of Hercules, a 150-year-old pub on Greek Street near Soho that has British owners but is run almost entirely by Poles.\n\u201cMost of them wouldn\u2019t get out of bed for the money we earn,\u201d added Ms. Pawelec, standing behind a row of beer taps as the song \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire\u201d blared from loudspeakers.\n\u201cForeign people work hard,\u201d she added. \u201cWe contribute hugely to this country. So everyone is thinking the same thing: Don\u2019t tell me to leave.\u201d"}, {"text": "When Women Fight ISIS\n2016-08-18T15:05:31.000Z\nTwo years ago this month, the Islamic State attacked the Yazidis, a Kurdish religious minority who live around Sinjar Mountain in Iraq. The militants came down on unprotected villages like Byron\u2019s wolf on the fold, slaughtering the men and taking away thousands of women and children to be sold as sex slaves.\nAny Yazidis who could escape fled higher into the mountains without food, adequate clothing or even, in some cases, shoes. They remained trapped there for days, in harsh conditions and with little international support. Those who had originally promised to protect them, the pesh merga soldiers of Masoud Barzani\u2019s political party in Iraqi Kurdistan, had melted away in their hour of need.\nIt was Kurdish guerrillas from Syria and Turkey who eventually fought their way over the mountain through Islamic State territory, opening a corridor to bring Yazidi survivors to safety in the self-declared autonomous area of Syria called Rojava, the Kurdish word for west.\nMany of these guerrillas were women, for a basic principle of the decades-long Kurdish liberation movement is that women cannot wait for others to defend them, but must themselves fight to be free. Indeed, some of these women say that they fight for other women, because they know what horrors await those captured by the Islamic State.\nIn Rojava\u2019s war against the Islamic State, women can be found not only in the ranks but also in command of guerrilla units. After their rescue from Mount Sinjar, some Yazidi women decided to follow this example, and started their own militia, the Women\u2019s Protection Unit-Shengal (another name for Sinjar). Similarly, in Iraqi Kurdistan, Yazidi women rescued from sexual slavery have formed their own brigade.\nThough female guerrillas have fought in national liberation struggles in places from China to Vietnam, Cuba to Nicaragua, Mozambique, Angola, Iran and the Palestinian territories, mainstream global feminist organizations have tended to follow the lead of the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom, founded during World War I, which holds that the solution to women\u2019s victimization in wartime is, first, to oppose war and, second, to make sure women are at the negotiating table when wars end.\nThe Kurdish liberation movement\u2019s approach, on the contrary, emphasizes self-defense in both military and social terms. Female guerrillas are meant to be seen as exemplars who show that female leadership is crucial in every sphere of society. In Rojava\u2019s system of autonomous democracy (the area is within Syria\u2019s borders), there are strong mandates for the participation of women in governance, and all organizations are led by both a man and a woman. Committees of women have real authority over problems like forced marriage and domestic violence.\nBut it is the female warrior in particular who offers a powerful counterimage to that of the raped and dishonored victim who is considered a source of shame to her family and community. Ancient, patriarchal ideas have made rape and sexual slavery a central strategy in genocidal conflicts, meant to destroy the very identity of the enemy. That\u2019s how rape was used in Bosnia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (and earlier, in the partition of India and the liberation war of Bangladesh), and that\u2019s how it is being used today in Iraq and Syria.\nWomen like the Yazidis who have been subjected to sexual violence on such a terrible scale cannot easily be reintegrated into old patterns, nor will they thrive if they are seen \u2014 and see themselves \u2014 as shamed victims. Part of the process of rehabilitation has to involve challenging the stigma survivors face.\nOf course, there are ways to do this without taking up arms. But the fact that some of the survivors in the refugee camps of Iraqi Kurdistan, which is still heavily patriarchal, have chosen this path indicates the influence of the radical Kurdish female guerrillas. A women\u2019s council formed last July by Rojava-influenced Yazidis went so far as to declare that the goal should not be to \u201cbuy back\u201d abducted women and children, as is common when dealing with the Islamic State, but to liberate them and at the same time establish new traditions of self-defense.\nThat won\u2019t be easy. Two years after their capture, thousands of Yazidi women and children remain in captivity. Many more are scattered in refugee camps in Turkey, Iraq or Rojava, while others have tried to flee to Europe, some drowning on the way. But the epicenter of the Yazidi struggle remains Sinjar Mountain, the ancestral home to which many now in Iraqi refugee camps desperately want to return.\nOne barrier in their way remains the same Iraqi Kurdish forces of Masoud Barzani who abandoned them two years ago, and whose pesh merga have capriciously operated the checkpoint at the border crossing that leads to both Rojava and the north side of Sinjar Mountain, making adequate access to essential supplies and building materials difficult if not impossible. This has been done in cooperation with Turkey\u2019s blockade of the Rojava Kurds.\nThose of us moved by the plight of the Yazidis and the image of women fighting the Islamic State can, and should, do more than express admiration from afar. We need to help the American government listen to its own ideas about gender equality, democracy and pluralism. The United States recently promised Mr. Barzani\u2019s forces a generous amount of military aid.\nThe price tag for that aid must be freedom of movement for the Yazidis, so they can return to their homes and rebuild, hopefully with full involvement by women and survivors of the Islamic State\u2019s sexual violence, and a permanent end to the blockade of Rojava, whose guerrillas have been some of the only forces capable of fighting the Islamic State \u2014 not in spite of their feminism, but because of it."}, {"text": "Your Wednesday Briefing: Merrick Garland, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump\n2016-03-16T09:51:42.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email?

It does not require a car ride or a small fortune to keep up.\nMr. Carter, 32, an adjunct professor of music at the City College of New York, simply holes up at the Inwood Library in northern Manhattan with his research books. It is quiet, air-conditioned and open every day.\n\u201cI\u2019m a total leech of public libraries,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my summer hangout.

In so doing, they are reaffirming their role as an essential part of civic life in America by making themselves indispensable to new generations of patrons.\nStory time at libraries in Manhattan and the Bronx is now so popular that ticket lines must be formed, while coding classes have waiting lists in the thousands. A library in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, runs a fully equipped recording studio that can be reserved at no cost; many libraries in the borough lend laptops and portable wireless devices to those without internet access at home.\ntranscript\nn/a\nIn Queens, which has a large South Asian population, a library in Jamaica offers sewing classes in Bengali for Bangladeshi women, some of whom now earn a living as seamstresses. Libraries in Flushing and South Jamaica teach social media skills to small-business owners.\nNationally, public libraries are redefining their mission at a time when access to technology, and the ability to use it, is said to deepen class stratification, leaving many poor and disadvantaged communities behind. Sari Feldman, president of the American Library Association, said library workers had shown people how to file online for welfare benefits and taught classes in science, technology, engineering and math to children who could not afford to go to summer camps.\n\u201cAll libraries are having a renaissance,\u201d Ms. Feldman said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that libraries have really stepped up to take on roles that are needed in a community.\u201d\nNew York City\u2019s 217 public libraries have rebounded in the past two years amid an infusion of city dollars, after years of budget and service cuts. An outpouring of support from library lovers has served as a reminder that the institutions are a crucial part of many lives.\nA recent contest to recognize neighborhood libraries underscored their vitality: 18,766 online and paper nominations were submitted in one month, up from about 4,300 when the yearly competition was started in 2013. Nearly every library was nominated at least once. Some received hundreds of nods.\nOne young man wrote that he was homeless when he started going to the Arverne branch of the Queens Library, where the staff not only helped him study to become a security guard but also hired him to work as a mentor to teenagers. Today, that man, Richard Johnson, has two jobs and his own apartment.\n\u201cEver since becoming a member of the Queens Library, I have been bettering my life,\u201d he wrote in his statement.\nThe city\u2019s three library systems \u2014 the New York Public Library, the Brooklyn Public Library and the Queens Library \u2014 have intensified their efforts to mobilize the public. An exhibit at the New York Public Library\u2019s landmark building on Fifth Avenue last year highlighted Andrew Carnegie\u2019s 1901 gift of $5.2 million to build a network of city libraries, in a pointed reminder that the city had promised, in return, to pay for their operation and upkeep.\nIn the past two years, more than 250,000 people, including the author Judy Blume and the musician Patti Smith, have signed on to a letter campaign in support of the libraries. Library workers have held story time on the steps of City Hall, and showed up at budget hearings in bright orange T-shirts emblazoned with the words: \u201cKeep Investing in Libraries, Keep Investing in New Yorkers.\u201d\nThe message was heard. In the 2016 fiscal year the libraries received $360 million for operating costs, $33 million more than the year before \u2014 the largest increase in recent times. For the 2017 fiscal year, which began on Friday, city financing for the libraries increased slightly to $365 million. But in a more significant victory, city leaders agreed to preserve past increases in future budgets, the difference, say, between getting a one-year bonus or a permanent raise.\nCity Councilman Andy King, who represents northeast Bronx and is chairman of the Libraries Subcommittee, said previous years of budget cuts had left the libraries on life support. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re in a financial position to let the blood flow again,\u201d Mr. King, a Democrat, said. \u201cLibraries are a lifeline, which we can\u2019t afford to ever let fall again.\u201d\nTony Marx, president of the New York Public Library, which has 92 branches in the Bronx, in Manhattan and on Staten Island, said library officials no longer had to worry about plugging budget holes and could instead focus on building services and programs. They have hired 120 more staff members, including 67 librarians for children and young adult literature alone. They have spent $1.1 million on books and materials and expanded seats in early literacy programs for toddlers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a mere year into this reinvestment, and the results are immediate: longer hours, more librarians and thousands more seats for education programming,\u201d Mr. Marx said.\nLibraries are now open on Saturdays, and in some cases, Sundays, too. At the Queens Library, which has 65 locations, more than 765,000 people visited on Saturdays alone from last November to May. Library officials have hired another 129 staff members and spent more than $2.6 million on new books, including e-books and periodicals.\n\u201cWe are energized and serving the needs of the people who come through our doors,\u201d said Dennis M. Walcott, the president of the Queens Library and former schools chancellor, who works from a desk on the main floor of the Central Library in Jamaica so he can take questions and complaints in person.\nThe Brooklyn Public Library has hired 95 new staff members, two-thirds of whom are librarians, and bought 50,000 more books and other materials. Last year, about 8.7 million people used its 60 libraries, a 3 percent increase from the year before.\nLinda Johnson, the president of the Brooklyn Public Library, said 552 satellite libraries had been set up in schools, senior centers and homeless shelters to promote literacy and bring books, technology and other services to those who are unable to visit their branches. Twenty of the satellites are at Rikers Island, the city\u2019s main jail complex, where inmates can now read books to their children at outside neighborhood branches through video conferencing.\nThe library contest that drew so many nominations was the idea of Reynold Levy, 71, a former president of Lincoln Center and a lifelong user of libraries.\nAt the time, budget cuts had forced many branches to eliminate weekend hours. Mr. Levy saw the contest as a way for people to show city leaders how much they valued libraries and to express their appreciation to those who work in them. The contest was sponsored by the Charles H. Revson Foundation and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation and awarded a total of $170,000 to 11 winning libraries, including $20,000 to the Inwood branch.\nMr. Levy, the chairman of Revson\u2019s board of trustees, recalled that his first job, at age 14, was at the Brighton Beach library in Brooklyn, where he borrowed all his books. Four days a week, he would help check out books, collect fines and troll the aisles to make sure all the edges of the books were neatly lined up, climbing on stools to reach the upper shelves. \u201cIt was a dream of mine to be wealthy enough to build a library and buy books,\u201d he said.\nThe recent gains by libraries have delighted Christian Zabriskie, a librarian and executive director of Urban Librarians Unite, an advocacy and education group that organizes an annual \u201cread-in,\u201d in which people take turns reading nonstop for 24 hours, to support the libraries.\n\u201cIn New York City, there is somebody using library materials every second, every day of the year,\u201d Mr. Zabriskie said. \u201cIt\u2019s showing that libraries are the fabric of society.\u201d"}, {"text": "A Homecoming, and a Triumph, for Hillary Clinton in New York\n2016-04-20T01:55:07.000Z\nShe danced the merengue in Washington Heights. She slammed down a mean game of dominoes in East Harlem.\nAnd in the East Village the day before the New York primary, Hillary Clinton broke her long-held rule of not eating in front of the news media by digging into an ice cream concoction named the Victory.\nMrs. Clinton seemed, for the first time in a rocky and unpredictable Democratic race, relaxed. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so great about being back here now for this primary,\u201d she said at Mikey Likes It Ice Cream, where the owner had named the dessert in her honor. \u201cI get to go to a lot of the places that I love. I get to meet new people and see people I\u2019ve known for a long time.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton has had dramatic highs and crushing lows in her political career and in this campaign. But since she first ran for office 16 years ago, New York has always been the state that loved her back, and on Tuesday it delivered one of her biggest boosts yet toward becoming the first woman to capture the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for president.\n\u201cToday, today, you proved once again, there\u2019s no place like home,\u201d she told a jubilant crowd of more than 2,500 at the Sheraton New York hotel in Midtown after taking the stage to the song \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d by Alicia Keys and Jay Z.\n\u201cIn this campaign, we\u2019ve won in every region of the country, from the North to the South to the East to the West,\u201d Mrs. Clinton added. \u201cBut this one is personal.\u201d\nHer New York triumph was an echo of her victory in 2008, when she defeated Barack Obama by 17 points. But this year the New York primary came later and, after a string of victories by Senator Bernie Sanders in smaller states, had far more bearing on the direction of the race. With two-thirds of the delegates now pledged, Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders by more than 200.\nOn Monday, when asked whether a significant win in New York would mean that she had effectively locked up the nomination, Mrs. Clinton, over a bubble tea in Flushing, Queens, said cautiously, \u201cYou know, I never count any chickens before they hatch.\u201d\nBut a few hours later, surrounded by an adoring downtown crowd, she was counting her chickens. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to do really well,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at an L.G.B.T. community center in Greenwich Village. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to wrap up the Democratic nomination.\u201d\nThe crowd erupted in chants of \u201cHillary! Hillary!\u201d\nRealizing that she may have slipped and assumed the air of inevitability that has let Mr. Sanders play the part of Goliath-slayer, Mrs. Clinton quieted the raucous supporters. \u201cBut! But. But, I\u2019m not taking anything for granted,\u201d she added, before listing a bevy of forthcoming primaries she said she would work hard to win.\nBut none of the remaining states hold the psychological weight of New York, where in 1999 Mrs. Clinton first dipped her toe into making the transition from presidential spouse to political force.\nOvercoming the inconvenient facts that she was born in a Chicago suburb and spent most of her adult life in Little Rock, Ark., and Washington, Mrs. Clinton dived into retail politics and \u201clistening tours\u201d with voters, working to prove that she was not a carpetbagger. The Clintons vacationed upstate in Skaneateles in 1999, and that fall they bought a $1.7 million five-bedroom Dutch colonial in Chappaqua.\ntranscript\nNA\n\u201cShe made New York her home and has been a real workhorse here,\u201d said Peter Romanoff, 49, an advertising executive in Briarcliff Manor who voted for Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday.\nIn the two weeks since her April 5 loss in Wisconsin, Mrs. Clinton ran a classic street-level campaign to win New York. As Mr. Sanders stuck largely to a strategy of holding large rallies, drawing tens of thousands to Washington Square Park and Prospect Park, Mrs. Clinton echoed her first Senate campaign and kept many of her appearances targeted and intimate.\nAnd for a candidate sometimes criticized as aloof and wooden, Mrs. Clinton, in New York, seemed carefree, or as carefree as a cautious presidential candidate can be.\nOn Friday, as Mr. Sanders visited Vatican City, Mrs. Clinton toured an apartment in the Edward Corsi Houses, an affordable-housing complex for older adults in East Harlem.\nShe wiggled her shoulders and threw up her arms when she bested a trio of men playing dominoes at the complex\u2019s recreation center. \u201cYou play good! Oh, my God,\u201d one of the men exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m taking dominoes to the White House!\u201d a swaggering Mrs. Clinton replied.\nMrs. Clinton has performed especially strongly with African-American voters, a demographic that was largely missing from the recent contests that Mr. Sanders won but is a force in New York.\n\n12 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nMrs. Clinton spoke at three black churches in Brooklyn one Sunday, beginning her remarks with the same refrain: \u201cThis is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.\u201d\nShe squeezed in among Bangladeshi and Pakistani voters at the Jackson Diner in Queens, met with Mexican carwash employees who had recently gone on strike, and eyed a heaping slice of strawberry cheesecake at Junior\u2019s in Brooklyn. \u201cI learned early on not to eat in front of all of you,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here just pining. Pining for a bite!\u201d\nBy Monday, Mrs. Clinton, sensing that her lead in the polls had solidified, exuded the confidence to risk an unflattering food photo, and ate.\n\u201cI was going to take it to go, but it was, like, in front of me and I had to start eating it,\u201d she said as she dug into the Victory sundae.\nAides say New York, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record, relationship and ease with voters here, can serve as a blueprint for what they hope to show the rest of the country in subsequent primaries and the general election. The campaign ran a dozen ads in New York, more than in any state since New Hampshire. Many of them celebrated the city\u2019s diversity and took aim at the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, for his comments about immigrants, Muslims and women.\nThere have been mishaps in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s coming-home tour. It took five swipes of a MetroCard before she got through a turnstile to get the No. 4 train in the Bronx, and she took part in a racially tinged skit with Mayor Bill de Blasio.\nBut after Mrs. Clinton voted on Tuesday at Douglas G. Grafflin Elementary School in Chappaqua, where she first saw her name on the ballot in 2000, the scattered rain that had been falling just minutes before had stopped. The clouds had parted.\n\u201cI love New York,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, squinting in the bright primary-day sun."}, {"text": "Donald Trump, Delhi, Theresa May: Your Monday Briefing\n2016-11-06T20:40:14.000Z\nGood morning. \nWe\u2019re trying something new for our readers in Asia and Australia: a morning briefing to jump-start your day. \nWhat do you like?

Trump and giving the Republican Party its first victory in a presidential race here since 1988.\nIn Macomb County, just north of Detroit, where the term \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d was coined after white autoworkers abandoned the party for Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, Mr. Trump captured 53.6 percent of the vote, compared with 47.6 percent statewide, according to preliminary results. Many of his supporters here were blue-collar Obama voters who saw modern-day Republicans as out of touch with their interests until Mr. Trump, with his brash outsider message, came along.\nChris Vitale, a longtime Chrysler employee and United Auto Workers member, supported Barack Obama twice, as did his union and his county. But on Tuesday, Mr. Vitale rejected the U.A.W.\u2019s choice, Hillary Clinton, and voted with gusto for Mr. Trump.\n\u201cThe Republicans that generally get run are anti-manufacturing, anti-Midwest,\u201d said Mr. Vitale, 44, of St. Clair Shores, explaining why he rejected Mitt Romney in 2012 and Senator John McCain in 2008. \u201cMr. Trump understood our problems right off the bat, without being told by anyone.\u201d\nMacomb County\u2019s autoworkers were hardly alone in gravitating toward Mr. Trump. Patricia Meadows, a retired waitress, voted for Mr. Obama in 2012 because she liked him, she said, and was hopeful about his health care law. But this time around, Ms. Meadows had no use for Mrs. Clinton or any candidate who had spent time in the nation\u2019s capital. Mr. Trump was the lesser of two evils because he was \u201cnot so political,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think everybody in Washington needs a kick in the rear,\u201d Ms. Meadows, 68, said on Thursday as she ate fried fish at a diner in Warren, a weathered city at the county\u2019s southern end. \u201cAnd I think Washington needs to be done with the Clintons.\u201d\nShe added, however, that she hoped Mr. Trump would not \u201cdo away with the health care\u201d \u2014 Mr. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2014 as he had promised on the campaign trail. Her daughter had obtained subsidized insurance coverage through the law for $50 a month.\n\u201cI think he was bluffing,\u201d Ms. Meadows said with a frown.\nMayor James R. Fouts of Warren said Trump supporters here were especially motivated by Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to overturn or overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they blame for the loss of American manufacturing jobs to Mexico. All year, Mr. Trump has attacked Ford Motor Company in particular for planning to move all of its small car production to Mexico.\nNoting that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also criticized free trade agreements when he ran against Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary race, Mr. Fouts said that some who normally vote Democrat in Macomb County had initially supported Mr. Sanders and migrated to Mr. Trump only after Mrs. Clinton became the Democratic nominee.\n\u201cThere were a significant number of Sanders people who made the transition to Trump,\u201d said Mr. Fouts, whose office is nonpartisan. \u201cBernie might have won here; Joe Biden might have won. But Hillary was never going to be the candidate to convince people around here that she was going to make a difference in their lives.\u201d\nMr. Fouts voted for Mr. Obama twice. But this time he rejected both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump for a third-party candidate \u2014 which one, he would not say.\nThe last time the county backed a Republican presidential candidate was in 2004.\nMr. Trump may also have energized a segment of Macomb County voters who had not bothered to participate in the 2012 election. Voter turnout in the county was 4 percent higher this year, according to preliminary results, with 67 percent of registered voters casting ballots. On the other hand, some of the state\u2019s most heavily Democratic counties, including Wayne, home to Detroit, and Genesee, home to Flint, saw less turnout than four years ago.\nAmanda Rogers, a bartender in Warren, sat out the 2012 election but hustled to the polls to vote for Mr. Trump. Her boyfriend and her brother voted for the first time in their lives, she said. Ms. Rogers, 34, was motivated in part by what she saw as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lenient stance on immigration.\n\u201cWe are drowning right now,\u201d she said. \u201cOur vets are homeless. There\u2019s one out of every five American children starving right now. And Clinton wants to open the floodgates and let everybody else in.\u201d\nMs. Rogers, who said she had \u201cloved Bill Clinton as a president\u201d and found Mr. Obama \u201call right,\u201d added: \u201cThere\u2019s people who\u2019ve been here 12 years who don\u2019t even care to learn the language but want to reap all the benefits of this country: food stamps, free health care, Section 8 housing, welfare checks. People are sick of that, especially in Macomb County.\u201d\nMuslims from places like Yemen and Bangladesh are the most visible immigrants here. Just south of Macomb County is Hamtramck, which in one generation went from overwhelmingly Polish Catholic to majority Muslim. In Macomb, the City of Sterling Heights, home to a large Ford plant, is facing a federal lawsuit after rejecting a proposed mosque last year.\nMr. Trump held a rally last Sunday in Sterling Heights, where he elicited boos against Mrs. Clinton when he said she wanted \u201cvirtually unlimited immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world,\u201d and would \u201cimport generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and your communities.\u201d\nMacomb County, though still largely white, is becoming more diverse: 82.3 percent of its 865,000 residents were white in 2015, according to the Census Bureau, down from 85.4 percent in 2010. The black population grew to 11.4 percent, from 8.6 percent. About 10 percent of the population is foreign born.\nMany here also complain that poverty and crime are growing. As Macomb helped assure Mr. Trump\u2019s victory on Election Day, it also played a major role in the defeat of a local ballot initiative that would have taxed its residents, and those of four neighboring counties, to build a public transportation system connecting Detroit and its suburbs.\nJason Powrozek, 18, a high school senior from New Baltimore, on the more affluent north side of the county, said he had voted against the transportation measure because \u201cI just felt it would speed up the transport of drugs up here from the inner city.\u201d A first-time voter, he had volunteered for at the county Republican headquarters and went to New York for the Trump campaign\u2019s election night party.\n\u201cHe tells it like it is,\u201d Jason said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe speaks what people don\u2019t want to say because it\u2019s politically incorrect.\u201d\nMr. Trump also spoke on Halloween at Macomb Community College.\nFrank Pitcher, 49, who lives in Sterling Heights and has worked at its Ford plant for 23 years, went to the Trump rally there and said he was surprised at how many of his co-workers he saw.\n\u201cI took some pictures with people there and posted on my Facebook because I wasn\u2019t going to hide how I was voting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of where I stand.\u201d"}, {"text": "Dance Listings for Nov. 4-10\n2016-11-04T00:04:57.000Z\nA selected guide to dance performances in New York City.\nFull reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance.

She is an elderly, dignified Japanese woman, retired as a nurse and a midwife, impeccably dressed in a beige linen blazer in the sweltering Tokyo summer heat. Late in World War II, during the spring of 1945, she was 16 years old, put to work at a military factory in the port city of Yokohama, just south of Tokyo. During one of the United States\u2019 incendiary bombing raids, she recalls huddling in a bomb shelter all night, terrified, watching the inferno of wooden houses all around. When she emerged into a scorched wasteland the next morning, with the ground so hot it melted her shoes, she saw the dead: \u201cThey were all black, all burned.\u201d\nSeventy years after the end of the war, Utsumi met me in central Tokyo last August to tell her story. Remarkably, she had never discussed her terrible experiences with anyone. \u201cWhen I was leaving the house this morning,\u201d she said, \u201cand told my son I\u2019d be in an interview about the war, my son asked, \u2018You were in the war?\u2019\u200a\u201d\nThis kind of stoic quietude may seem odd, even unhealthy, to Americans, accustomed to ventilating the most mundane experiences, with no incident too banal to be rehashed. But respect for such forbearance is at the heart of David Rieff\u2019s insightful and humane new book.\n\u201cIn Praise of Forgetting\u201d is about our collective memories: how we remember our national histories and argue about our shared past. Rieff contends that these collective remembrances are self-serving, often fraudulent and frequently dangerous. Sometimes, he thinks, we would be better off simply forgetting the grudge-filled chronicles and getting on with living our lives. He admires the suggestion of a Northern Irish writer that the next memorial to Irish history should be \u201craising a monument to Amnesia, and forgetting where we put it.\u201d\nRieff recoils at the conceit that memorialization is a moral and political duty, as well as a personal one in \u201cour therapeutic age.\u201d To the contrary, he says, remembering is ultimately futile, since all societies will \u2014 like the mortal individuals who make them up \u2014 eventually crumble to dust. To those who hope that remembering the Holocaust might help avert future genocides, he retorts that this is \u201cmagical thinking,\u201d pointing to subsequent extermination campaigns in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Rwanda.\nInstead, he warns that all too often, collective memory \u201chas led to war rather than peace .\u2008.\u2008. and to the determination to exact revenge rather than commit to the hard work of forgiveness.\u201d For Rieff, national remembrances are almost always political, sometimes imposed by victorious armies, at other times drummed up by manipulative politicians seeking to fabricate an epic past to legitimize their present-day intentions. He provides a depressing abundance of examples where toxic memories fuel atavistic hatred: among Iraqis; Israelis and Palestinians; radical Islamists across the globe; and Hindu chauvinists rallied by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.\nThis is no abstract dread for Rieff, a distinguished journalist known for eviscerating American and European failures in Bosnia and later for thoughtfully questioning the value of international humanitarian organizations. Having been an eyewitness to Yugoslavia\u2019s collapse, he understands the grotesque realities of ethnic strife and power politics with stark clarity. He disgustedly recalls visiting a Serb nationalist politician in Belgrade who, as the war raged in Bosnia, venerated the Serbian guerrillas of World War II, while one of his aides portentously handed Rieff a piece of paper reading \u201c1453\u201d \u2014 the year when the Ottoman Empire conquered Orthodox Constantinople.\nWorse, Rieff worries that memory could not just spark violence, but prolong it. In order to end a war, or get a dictator to yield power to democrats, it\u2019s often necessary to negotiate with murderous leaders who will demand their own amnesty \u2014 blotting out their own past cruelties to assure future peace. (Nuremberg, the preferred precedent of human rights lawyers, is almost always the wrong example. It was only after a hard-won unconditional victory that the Allies could put Nazi Germany\u2019s rulers on trial, but most wars don\u2019t end so decisively.) While Rieff would prosecute war criminals whenever feasible, he rejects the legalistic \u201cabsolutism\u201d of those human rights activists who insist on justice above peace or other worthwhile political goals. He prudently warns that Chile\u2019s return to democracy could have been scuttled by a Spanish warrant for the arrest of the military dictator Augusto Pinochet. And in Bosnia, he convincingly argues that the injustice of a Dayton peace agreement that spared the bloodstained Slobodan Milosevic was still far better than continuing a ruinous war.\nRieff makes a powerful case for reconciliation and compromise, and exposes how politicized our nationalist histories are. Lucidly deploying historical examples and literary references, he himself seems to have forgotten nothing. But in a book packed with pugnacious argument, he only implicitly offers rules for when to remember and when to forget. It\u2019s a delicate matter asking victimized peoples to turn their backs on their grievances; Japanese rightists only further offend Koreans by proclaiming that they need to get over their wartime suffering. And the pursuit of justice, while risky, doesn\u2019t always derail peace processes: The Dayton peace deal proceeded even though a United Nations war crimes tribunal had indicted the Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.\nNo absolutist himself, Rieff isn\u2019t against all remembrance. He believes that we are morally obligated to remember the Holocaust, and praises war crimes trials and truth commissions in Europe, Latin America and South Africa. He vigorously argues that there is a duty to debunk whitewashing about the Armenian genocide, British and French colonial massacres, Imperial Japan\u2019s sexual enslavement of women from Korea and other Asian nations, and the Srebrenica massacre. (The fact that Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London, is defiantly promoting the crackpot slur that Hitler was somehow a kind of Zionist \u201cbefore he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews\u201d demonstrates that some history lessons are still necessary.)\nIt\u2019s one thing for people to settle and move on; it\u2019s another to get them to forget. Although Mao Zedong\u2019s regime worked to normalize China\u2019s relationship with postwar Japan, including discreetly fixing the blame for World War II on a small clique of militarists, today\u2019s Chinese leadership has had little difficulty in whipping up a broader popular rage against Japan. After Croat fascists slaughtered Serbs and Jews in World War II, Yugoslavia\u2019s postwar Communist dictatorship nevertheless promoted an amnesiac \u201cbrotherhood and unity.\u201d Yet the bad old memories lingered long enough to provide nationalist tinder for Milosevic to exploit in the 1990s. Not all of us have the grace of Keiko Utsumi.\nRieff\u2019s book feels painfully relevant for today\u2019s sour populist mood. As powerful leaders in China, Russia, India, Japan and elsewhere are energetically promoting their own fractured takes on their history, he punctures their pretensions. Donald J. Trump\u2019s chest-thumping version of America\u2019s 20th-century experience \u2014 \u201cWe saved the world\u201d and then \u201cwe saved the world again\u201d \u2014 is unusual only in its brainlessness. This rich book provides a field guide to a more decent politics of forgiveness, in which Trump and Trumpism may one day be mercifully forgotten too."}, {"text": "India to Change Its Decades-Old Reliance on Female Sterilization\n2016-02-20T23:02:35.000Z\nMAHENDRAGARH, India \u2014 This is what family planning in India often looks like: Women in their 20s, mostly farmers\u2019 wives, gather at dawn on the stairs of a district hospital. Hours later, a surgeon arrives. His time is short. He asks the women to sit in a row on the floor of the operating room and then, in operations lasting a few minutes apiece, uses a laparoscope to sever their fallopian tubes, ensuring they will never again bear a child.\nFor decades, India has relied on female sterilization as its primary mode of contraception, funding about four million tubal ligations every year, more than any other country. This year, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take a major step toward modernizing that system, introducing injectable contraceptives free of charge in government facilities. The World Health Organization recommends their use without restriction for women of childbearing age.\nNew birth control options have long been advocated by international organizations, among them the United States Agency for International Development and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They say Indian women \u2014 often worn out, anemic and at higher risk of death because they bear children young and often \u2014 urgently need methods to delay or space pregnancies.\nThe number of lives touched by such policies is enormous and growing. India will soon surpass China as the world\u2019s most populous nation, and by 2050 it is expected to gain 400 million new citizens, more than the population of the United States.\nParadoxically, here in India, the keenest opposition to these newer methods of birth control \u2014 ones seen in the West as empowering women to control their fertility \u2014 has come from some women\u2019s activist groups that distrust the safety of these methods and believe that profit-hungry Western pharmaceutical companies are pushing them. Despite growing evidence of the safety of the injectables and their increasingly widespread use across South Asia, these groups have continued to oppose them. And it is Mr. Modi\u2019s socially conservative Bharatiya Janata Party that has broken with decades of resistance to injectables.\nThe shift in policy has come in part because the government is less concerned about opposition from civil society groups, most of them more closely aligned with the previous ruling party, the Indian National Congress. Officials were also spurred by a medical disaster in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh, where 13 women died in 2014 after undergoing tubal ligation at a high-volume government \u201csterilization camp.\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was incumbent on the government to provide it as a choice,\u201d said C. K. Mishra, additional secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, of the contraceptive Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate, or DMPA, which has been used in the private sector since 1993. Still, the method will be introduced gingerly, limited at first to select district hospitals and medical colleges and then expanded next year to hospitals throughout the country. Implanted contraceptives may follow.\n\u201cWe want to be very careful,\u201d Mr. Mishra said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to put a single step wrong.\u201d\nIn the context of India\u2019s recent history, it is no wonder officials have been risk-averse and advocates mistrustful. In 1975, the government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi led an aggressive campaign, in some cases forcing young or childless men to undergo vasectomies to meet quotas. More than six million sterilizations were performed, igniting a widespread protest movement.\nMore than a decade later, when India began exploring the public use of injectable contraceptives, activist groups filed cases with the country\u2019s Supreme Court seeking to ban the drugs, contending that they had not been proved safe and could be used coercively.\nThe court forwarded the matter to India\u2019s Drug Technical Advisory Board, which in 1995 allowed private use to continue but recommended against offering them in government clinics. The decision was not revisited for 20 years, even as use of the method became widespread in neighboring Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.\nOpponents contend that India\u2019s health infrastructure is too weak to regulate use of the drugs, monitor side effects or ensure that patients have given informed consent. India\u2019s government spends just over 1 percent of its gross domestic product on public health, compared with around 3 percent in Russia and China and 8 percent in the United States.\n\u201cInvariably these new methods are tried on women who have no infrastructure to fall back on, who have no other resources to go for private health care,\u201d said Navsharan Singh, a senior program specialist at the International Development Research Center, which is financed by the government of Canada. She said the current plan, to deliver the drugs through major hospitals, improved the prospects for follow-up.\nSome opposition is tinged with ideology, with critics tracing American support for population control back to a Cold War era when they say birth control was seen as a way to combat poverty and to stop the spread of Communism by curbing chronic poverty. Mohan Rao, a professor of social sciences at Jawaharlal Nehru University and longtime opponent of injectables, said the government would have introduced them years ago were it not for India\u2019s \u201cmass-based women\u2019s organizations.\u201d He added, \u201cThey had a clear analysis of what is imperialism and what imperialism does to populations in third-world countries.\u201d\nIn 2010, K. Sujatha Rao, then the union secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in the Congress-led government, recommended lifting the ban on injectable contraceptives. But she left her post shortly thereafter, she said, and \u201cbecause of civil society pressure, when I left, the government didn\u2019t push it at all.\u201d\nThe atmosphere around injectable contraceptives began to shift after Mr. Modi\u2019s party took over in May 2014, and it gained momentum after the Chhattisgarh catastrophe, about six months later. Last year, \u201cAll the stars aligned,\u201d said Dr. Jyoti Vajpayee, a gynecologist who oversees family planning programs here for the Gates Foundation.\n\u201cThis government has come back in a majority, so they can afford to take risks,\u201d she said.\nShe and others had long sought to convince officials that existing options \u2014 male and female sterilization, the pill, IUDs and condoms \u2014 were insufficient for millions of Indian women who marry in their late teens and spend years carrying back-to-back pregnancies.\nResearch has shown that, globally, 30 percent of maternal deaths and 10 percent of child deaths could be prevented if women spaced their pregnancies two years apart.\nAt a meeting in August, the Drug Technical Advisory Board recommended that DMPA be included in the family planning program, saying 20 years of private use and studies of similar drugs by the Indian Council for Medical Research had established that they were safe to introduce without a pilot program.\nDr. C. N. Purandare, past president of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India and a proponent of the drugs, praised the government for what he called \u201ca bold step.\u201d\nNot that the traditional method is being phased out. At a recent sterilization camp about 90 miles west of Delhi, a time-honored system was chugging along.\nThe women here, many of whom had traveled from their villages, said that they were eager to go for \u201cthe operation,\u201d and that the cash incentive of 1,400 rupees, about $20, had not affected their decision. They had been urged on by outreach workers who had accompanied them to the camp, older women from their own villages.\nThese women are paid 1,000 rupees for each patient with two or fewer children who comes in for sterilization and 240 rupees for each patient with three or more. They admitted that there were drawbacks to sterilization, especially for young women who might someday want to have another child.\n\u201cWe have to tell them a lot of things to convince them,\u201d said Sudesh Wati, 50.\nYoung women often listen to the outreach workers.\n\u201cAfter she spoke to me, I made up my mind that in today\u2019s times, nobody wants more than two children,\u201d said Krishna Yadav, 35, gesturing at an amiable gray-haired woman standing nearby. \u201cShe has been telling me this for the last two months.\u201d\nAsked about injectable contraceptives, the women mostly looked blank. They had never heard of them.\nIn any case, said Lalit Sharma, a nurse who trains outreach workers, when a new method comes online, women will almost certainly accept it.\n\u201cWhatever method it might be,\u201d he said, \u201cif the government implements it, they blindly trust it.\u201d"}, {"text": "Students and the Middle East Conflict\n2016-08-03T09:00:27.000Z\nWhat some see as a celebration of culture through food, others see as a political statement, and an offensive one at that. Just slip an Israeli flag on a toothpick.\nTo the Tufts chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, last fall\u2019s Taste of Israel was appropriation, pure and simple.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Palestinian students on this campus would see it as \u2018cultural\u2019 if they were to walk in and see flags of Israel all over the food their grandmother used to cook before she was evicted from her village,\u201d said Nic Serhan, an S.J.P. member who is part Arab, part African-American.\nAs students sampled pomegranate seeds, hummus, falafel and pita, Mr. Serhan and fellow protesters strode into the event carrying signs reading \u201cTaste of Israeli Occupation,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t dip into apartheid\u201d and \u201cFresh from stolen Palestinian land.\u201d Then they passed out chocolates with anti-Israel sentiments on the wrappers and asked: \u201cDo you want the real truth about Israel?\u201d\nThis was not the biggest or loudest such protest at Tufts, a private university of some 12,000 students just outside of Boston. But it was the last straw. Whenever Friends of Israel or Hillel staged a lecture or event, it seemed, S.J.P. was there. There had been die-ins (students had to step over bodies on red cloths signifying blood) and checkpoints (mock Israeli soldiers conducted security checks around campus). Friends of Israel had already requested campus security at programs, but after the food festival they filed a complaint with Tufts\u2019s judicial affairs office.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bullying masquerading as social justice,\u201d Anna Linton, co-president of the club, told me.\nMr. Serhan countered: \u201cProtests are supposed to be disruptive in nature.\u201d\nWhen it comes to the Middle East on campus, the environment is increasingly uneasy and even hostile. Many universities are grappling with how to balance students\u2019 right to protest with Jewish students\u2019 fears that their culture is under attack. Some students say they are ostracized when they show support for Israel, while Palestinian activists talk of being labeled \u201cterrorists,\u201d and finding their photos and names posted on canarymission, a website that tracks professors and students who, it says, promote \u201chatred of the United States, Israel and Jews.\u201d S.J.P. members insist they are anti-Israel, not anti-Semitic \u2014 a debatable distinction to those who cannot separate the state of Israel from their Jewish identity.\nWhile a majority of Americans, 54 percent, say they side with Israel and its struggles against terrorism, sympathy for the Palestinians\u2019 cause has been rising, according to a Pew Research Center study released in May. The most significant increase is among millennials, to 27 percent from 9 percent in 2006. Images of the separation barrier running through the occupied West Bank, which Israel built to thwart Palestinian suicide bombings and shootings, have helped shift sentiments. Activists see parallels with apartheid in South Africa.\nS.J.P., founded in 2001 at the University of California, Berkeley, has become the leading pro-Palestinian voice on campus. (Jewish Voice for Peace is another student group critical of Israel.)\nA national organization was established in 2010 to connect chapters\u2019 work, including annual conferences and speaking tours. There are now roughly 170 chapters, about 55 more than in 2014, according to conference organizers and a report by the Anti-Defamation League. The Tufts chapter, which has a core group of 25 members, is a significant player in this movement. It hosted the 2014 conference, which drew more than 500 attendees and sparked protests from Jewish alumni who objected to the university\u2019s allowing the conference on campus.\nJeffrey Summit, executive director of Tufts Hillel, has watched sentiment against Israel rise during his 37 years on campus. \u201cOur country is so polarized,\u201d the rabbi said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do something different here.\u201d\nThat something is not to discourage protests, said Celene Ibrahim, Tufts\u2019s Muslim chaplain, but to encourage students to converse about the complex arguments that divide them. But first they need to become comfortable with each other. She and Rabbi Summit have been working to bring both sides together in the same room.\nAfter the Taste of Israel brouhaha, Rabbi Summit and students in Hillel established the Visions of Peace initiative. Leaders from Hillel and the Muslim Students Association teamed to organize a day in April that would include attending each other\u2019s religious services and a talk by a Palestinian activist and a Jewish settler in the occupied West Bank. In September, students would be able to meet families who had lost loved ones in the conflict and are united on peace efforts. Chaplain Ibrahim also is planning a Jewish-Muslim women\u2019s retreat.\nThe chaplain is careful to note that the division on campus isn\u2019t necessarily a Muslim-Jewish one: Jews, Christians and Hindus as well as Muslims are members of S.J.P. chapters. Tufts is roughly a quarter Jewish, but there are only a few hundred Muslim students. Most come from South Asia and may not have a stake in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Indeed, the Muslim Students Association has taken no stance on the conflict or S.J.P. And some members of Friends of Israel actively lobby against Israel\u2019s policies toward the West Bank and Gaza.\n\u201cThis is one of the stereotypes I\u2019m trying to undo,\u201d Chaplain Ibrahim said. \u201cWhat does it mean to be pro-Israel? There\u2019s a lot of nuance around it.\u201d\nMr. Serhan, a rising senior, has participated in numerous S.J.P. actions and marched in a Black Lives Matter protest on campus. He does not identify with a particular religion. His parents are Christian. His mother, from New Orleans, is black; his father was born in Kuwait. Mr. Serhan began advocating for Palestinians while taking a freshman course on peace and justice, when he heard an S.J.P. member speak about what Palestinians lost when Israel became a state in 1948. He said he is passionate about protesting any event or lecture celebrating Israel.\nHe reached into his backpack to pull out his kaffiyeh, draping the scarf around his neck as he headed out of a cafe for a panel discussion on cultures affected by colonization, part of national Israeli Apartheid Week. As we walked across campus, he described how a Tufts student called him and two other activists \u201cterrorists\u201d because they were wearing kaffiyehs, the iconic symbol of Yasir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader.\nWhat exactly does S.J.P. want? During its first national conference, in 2011 at Columbia, S.J.P. created a mission statement that called for the boycott, divestment and sanctioning of Israel and its products (causes the B.D.S. movement is named for); for an end to Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank; and for dismantling the separation barrier. In answer to charges that S.J.P. fosters anti-Semitism, members point to this mission directive: Chapters must be vigilant against \u201chomophobia, sexism, racism, bigotry, classism, colonialism, and discrimination of any form.\u201d It condemns terrorism.\n\u201cCriticism of Israel is a criticism of a state,\u201d said Amahl Bishara, a Palestinian-American professor of anthropology at Tufts. \u201cI don\u2019t see any blurred lines there.\u201d\nTo leaders of Jewish organizations, those lines are frequently blurred. They equate supporting the B.D.S. movement to supporting Hamas and the destruction of their homeland. They point to S.J.P.-sponsored speakers who have compared Israelis to Nazis yet defend those who have committed random attacks of violence against Israelis.\nLeonard Saxe, director of the Maurice and Marilyn Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University, led a survey of 3,199 Jewish students and recent graduates from some 100 universities. A quarter said they had been blamed for actions of Israel. Nearly three-fourths had been exposed to at least one anti-Semitic statement in the previous year.\nLast year at the University of California, Davis, vandals spray-painted swastikas on a Jewish fraternity house, and in March, protesters marched to the front of a classroom and loudly chanted, \u201cIsrael is an apartheid state.\u201d The guest speaker was an Israeli diplomat whose topic was the art of diplomacy\nConcerned about a swell in incidents, the Zionist Organization of America in 2014 coordinated a letter to 2,500 college and university presidents asking them to protect Jewish students from anti-Semitism, specifically from what it called S.J.P.\u2019s \u201charassment and intimidation tactics.\u201d And in December, Mark G. Yudof, former president of the University of California system, helped create the Academic Engagement Network. The group has some 275 members, mostly faculty, on about 110 campuses working in opposition to the B.D.S. movement. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see B.D.S. become stronger because, 20 years from now, these students will be judges, heads of Congress,\u201d Mr. Yudof told me. \u201cWe have to respond now to maintain the historical relationship with Israel.\u201d\nIn March, the University of California adopted a statement condemning anti-Semitism and \u201canti-Semitic forms of anti-Zionism.\u201d Stanford\u2019s student government later approved a similar resolution. Opponents object to such resolutions as anti-Arab and attempts to curtail free speech.\n\u201cIt is not the place of the president, the chancellor or the former chancellor to tsk-tsk the students because they don\u2019t like the style of debate,\u201d said Liz Jackson, a lawyer with Palestine Legal, which formed in 2012 to work with activists.\nLawyers who advise S.J.P. members facing disciplinary charges say that First Amendment rights are routinely ignored when Israel is the subject, and that universities are trying to intimidate members into silence.\nNortheastern University\u2019s chapter was suspended for the remainder of the school year after its members slipped 600 strongly worded mock eviction notices under dorm room doors to mirror the eviction of Palestinians. The notices reminded some of the expulsion of Jews during the Holocaust. And after various incidents at the City University of New York, including the disruption of a faculty meeting at Brooklyn College, several state lawmakers began an effort to get S.J.P. chapters expelled, even though a broad coalition of activists had caused the disruption. They did not succeed. But in February, the Zionist Organization of America sent a letter to CUNY asking for a public condemnation of S.J.P. for promoting anti-Semitism and creating a \u201chostile campus environment\u201d for Jewish students on at least four CUNY campuses.\nFriends of Israel, in its complaint to Tufts administrators, said that the Taste of Israel protest had victimized students and violated university policy, including one called Working With One Another. They wanted to meet with S.J.P. leaders and a mediator.\n\u201cThey can push back on our belief and opinions of Israel, but they actually have to hear us out first,\u201d Itamar Ben-Aharon, president of the club, said after a meeting in which members discussed current events, competed in a trivia quiz on Israel and boned up on how to counter criticism during Israeli Apartheid Week.\nS.J.P. declined mediation after a string of unproductive exchanges, saying they had not intimidated students and saw no need for university involvement, and besides, debate is encouraged at its events. Friends of Israel, fearing an escalation in hostility, dropped its complaint this past spring. The university would not comment on the incident. But Mary Pat McMahon, a dean of student affairs, posited this challenge: \u201cHow do we foster learning and students working together even when it\u2019s unlikely common ground will come any time soon?\u201d\n\u2022\nRabbi Hanan Schlesinger, in a knitted kipa and gray beard that reached his chest, spoke first at the Visions of Peace day in April, strolling back and forth with a microphone before some 40 attendees in the Interfaith Center; a map of Israel was projected on a screen.\n\u201cHow could it be for 33 years I lived in an area where there were nine Palestinians for every Israeli and I never met a Palestinian?\u201d Rabbi Schlesinger asked, almost shouting the question, as if admonishing his younger self. Some 40 years ago, he had left New York to live in a Jewish settlement on the occupied West Bank. Settlers and Palestinians spoke different languages, practiced different religions and lived under different laws. \u201cUnder these circumstances,\u201d he said, \u201cthere will be ignorance, stereotypes, and if you add in the violence, of course there\u2019s going to be fear and anger toward the other for killing us.\u201d\nHis fear faded after attending a dinner of Palestinians and Jewish settlers organized by Roots, an effort based in the West Bank to achieve peace with nonviolence. He grew to realize that \u201cour triumph was their tragedy,\u201d and went on to lead Roots with Ali Abu Awwad, who co-founded the initiative in 2014.\nMr. Awwad took his turn on the stage. He told the audience in a soft, impassioned voice that his father became a refugee when his village was depopulated in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. His mother was a P.L.O. leader and beaten in front of him in their home. \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to teach someone how to hate in that situation,\u201d he said.\nHe was arrested twice during uprisings and would spend four years in prison. In 2000, he was wounded in the knee in a drive-by shooting by an Israeli settler. A few months later, his older brother was killed by an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint. \u201cHow many Israelis have to die to bring justice?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe only justice I can think of is to have him back, and that won\u2019t happen.\u201d\nThen, bereaved Jewish families came to offer solace to his family. \u201cFor the first time, I saw an Israeli crying. You don\u2019t see Jewish tears at checkpoints. I couldn\u2019t even imagine that Jewish people had tears.\u201d\nScanning the students in the room, Mr. Awwad criticized S.J.P. and divestment supporters for refusing to enter into dialogue with Jewish groups because they felt it legitimized Israel. Both sides lay claim to the land. Both sides have been victimized. He implored the students not to focus on which side was right. \u201cI spent nights of my life hoping Israel will disappear and explode,\u201d he said. Now he was in a different place, working for peace.\nAfter the talk, Rabbi Schlesinger said he was disappointed at how few Muslims were in the room. All told, some 250 students showed up for at least one of the day\u2019s events; only about two dozen were Muslim, but half of them took Hillel up on the invitation to attend the Jewish prayer service. Some were entering Hillel\u2019s center for the first time, \u201cand that\u2019s the crossing of a threshold,\u201d said Chaplain Ibrahim.\nMost S.J.P. members saw Visions of Peace as an attempt to mollify their group and vowed to skip it. Leah Muskin-Pierret, who is Jewish, was the sole S.J.P. attendee at the talk. Her voice rising and quickening, she told me she found much of it infuriating. She was embarrassed by an American Jewish settler wanting dialogue about Israel. She wished the focus had been on the daily hardships faced by Palestinians under Israeli occupation.\nMr. Ben-Aharon appreciated the frank talk but had doubts. Roots was idealistic. Opposing sides would not suddenly work together. And every time the campus experiences an uptick in tension, the answer is the same: Start a new initiative.\nBefore the dinner, as part of interfaith storytelling in one of Hillel\u2019s prayer spaces, Nazifa Sarawat told a circle of fellow students and clergy members how she had arrived in New York City as a toddler from Bangladesh. She and her family had had little exposure to other religions, so she saw non-Muslims as the \u201cother.\u201d\nOne of the day\u2019s organizers, she wanted more collaboration, and with Hillel the key player, she worried about a power imbalance. Maybe students at the grass-roots level should be in charge, she said. Maybe a Mideast culture group should form and partner with Israeli clubs.\nFrom the clerics\u2019 perspective, the day was a beginning. \u201cHere, people are listening to one another,\u201d Rabbi Summit said. \u201cOn so many college campuses, opposing sides are just shouting.\u201d\nAt the dinner that closed the program, after students led the group in blessings over the challah, Chaplain Ibrahim, wearing a hijab that shimmered in the light, stood up and described the sensation she had during the Sabbath service.

Kaspersky \u2014 the stocky, garrulous, 50-year-old founder and chief executive of the global computer security company \u2014 begins to catalog possible threats: The computerized elevator you just left is vulnerable to cyberattacks, as are your smartphone and smartcar. Your bank, without question. Your electricity and water supplies could be at risk. Cybercriminals grow smarter, bolder and more elusive every year.\n\u201cWe are living in the middle cyberage, the dark ages of cyber,\u201d said Mr. Kaspersky, whose modest corner office with glass walls overlooks a stretch of canal and a boat club. He has longish salt-and-pepper hair, a trim beard and a ruddy, tanned complexion. \u201cRight now, it is more functionality, more technology, more services, but not enough security.\u201d\nKaspersky Lab is most famous for being the home of the brainy geek squad that exposed Stuxnet and Flame, the American-Israeli cyberweapons that disrupted Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nMr. Kaspersky and his company find themselves at the forefront of the battle against cybergangs, one of the largest emerging threats, for two rather simple reasons, he said: \u201cRussian software engineers are the best; unfortunately Russian cybercriminals are the best, as well.\u201d\nHacking methods developed in the Russian-speaking world are going global, suggesting a thriving black market in malicious code. \u201cThey don\u2019t just hack the victims, they trade the technology to other gangs,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are hundreds of victims, in the United States and Asia.\u201d\nOne gang alone is believed to have stolen up to $1 billion from banks, mainly in Russia, in 2013 and 2014. And this month, Kaspersky Lab experts helped Russia catch its largest hacking gang yet \u2014 50 people were arrested and accused of stealing $45 million since 2011. Investigators now believe the North Korean government hacked an international financial messaging system in February in an effort to drain $1 billion from the central bank of Bangladesh. They managed to get $81 million before the Federal Reserve Bank of New York became suspicious and cut off the transaction.\nAfter banks, commodities are a big new target. Hackers manipulate supply records, disguising surpluses to sell. \u201cWe now have reports that it is massive, it is everywhere,\u201d said Mr. Kaspersky, who speaks colorful English with a Russian accent.\nMr. Kaspersky is something of an anomaly in Russia, a businessman who built a global brand from scratch, using brains and persistence. His firm is among the most successful international computer security operations in the world, with offices in 32 countries, about 400 million people using its software (by its own estimate) and high-profile advertising campaigns, like its sponsorship of Ferrari\u2019s Formula One team.\nHowever, given the tense relations between Russia and the West, Kaspersky Lab is fighting a rear-guard battle along with combating cybercrime: allaying concerns that a Russian security company can be trusted to protect confidential data stored online by Western companies and individuals.\nSome of the questions are rooted in Mr. Kaspersky\u2019s past \u2014 even in Russia, where the company and its founder generate both pride and suspicion.\nMr. Kaspersky was born in 1965 in Novorossiysk, on the Black Sea, to an engineer father and a mother working in the national archives. His mother nurtured his early aptitude for mathematics and, after the family moved to Moscow, he blossomed into a prodigy.\nAfter he placed second in a major Russian math contest at age 14, he was recruited by the prestigious Kolmogorov Physics and Mathematics School, a boarding school run by Moscow State University that fosters high school math whizzes.\nMr. Kaspersky went on to a K.G.B.-sponsored university education intended to transform mathematicians into cryptologists, and pictures of him in a K.G.B. uniform are readily available online. \u201cI was not good enough to become a true cryptologist,\u201d he said, laughing.\nInstead, he turned to software engineering, becoming the go-to guy in the Red Army for computer problems. \u201cI wrote the code for the Soviet military,\u201d he said.\nHe published an early book on computer viruses and founded Kaspersky Lab in 1997 with his first wife, Natalya. (He married three times and has four children.)\nThere is a strong sense in Russia that no company, particularly no computer security company, could succeed without Kremlin support, and Russian tech experts invariably refer to two episodes that fed mistrust.\nMr. Kaspersky once advocated requiring an individual passport for web access, an idea the Kremlin encouraged, although he has come to focus on controlling access only to sites of high national security interest, like utilities. Government critics also found Kaspersky Lab slow to react during protests in 2011, when numerous opposition websites collapsed under a severe criminal attack widely attributed to the Russian government.\nIn December, Mr. Kaspersky raised questions by signing his first cooperation agreement with a major state-run Chinese enterprise. Some Russian internet experts saw that as proof of choosing sides, becoming the anti-West cybercop and endorsing the Chinese model of a highly filtered internet.\nMr. Kaspersky said his China contract was simply a matter of capitalizing on its need for better security, especially since he sees Russian malware emerging there.\nOthers said he had to make his peace with the system \u2014 or leave. \u201cHe decided to accept the rules and to stay here,\u201d said Andrei Soldatov, the co-author of \u201cThe Red Web,\u201d a book documenting the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to transfer ubiquitous Soviet surveillance techniques onto the web. \u201cHe is part of the Russian tradition of engineers who really believe in order.\u201d\nMr. Kaspersky said he stayed in Russia for its skilled software engineers. He and others attribute their prowess to a Russian educational system that, while less regimented than in Soviet times, still nurtures elite math skills. Widespread hacking is partly rooted in the tradition of not paying a kopeck for anything that could be grabbed free off the web, like software or movies.\nMr. Kaspersky appears in self-effacing nerd mode around Kaspersky Lab headquarters, busing his own cafeteria tray and riding the elevator downstairs to smoke outside like everybody else, despite the vast balcony outside his office.\nHe claims not to know his net worth, which Forbes recently estimated at $1.1 billion, putting him at 66th among Russia\u2019s top 200 richest people. He wears a Swatch and usually flies commercial airlines. In addition to Formula One, he underwrites various quirky or scientific projects \u2014 including the excavation of the mysterious Minoan civilization of Akrotiri, on the Greek island of Santorini \u2014 and he delights in exploring remote spots in eastern Russia, the American West and New Zealand, among other places.\n\u201cI want to be not only a very professional, very correct, very good security company,\u201d he said. \u201c I also want to be an unusual company.\u201d\nMr. Kaspersky works as his brand\u2019s high-profile envoy, spinning around the globe seemingly at the speed of the lights on his cyberthreat map. His travels last year included 116 flights and included more than 50 presentations. He documents every step on a blog translated into nine languages.\n\u201cYou wonder if he is ever asleep or ever at home,\u201d said Anton Nossik, a Russian tech pioneer and journalist, noting that the entrepreneur maintains a particularly sunny disposition online for someone selling the need to fight crime.\nWhere Mr. Kaspersky breaks out of the nerd mold is with his brash, booming presence at large corporate events.\n\u201cHe loves to be in the spotlight,\u201d said Aleksandr Plushev, who covers tech for the Echo of Moscow radio station. \u201cHe is a very bright, funny, smart and open-minded person, with his own opinion. A little bit crazy, like almost all very talented people.\u201d\nHundreds of Kaspersky employees converge on Moscow twice a year: for the company birthday party in July (when Mr. Kaspersky often serves as the M.C. for a talent contest), and for a New Year\u2019s Eve celebration.\nThe venues sometimes reflect his impish sense of humor. One year, he chartered a train to Uryupinsk, a town about 435 miles southeast of Moscow whose name the Russians use to signify \u201cthe middle of nowhere.\u201d\nPhotography is a favorite pastime of his, and he was thrilled when the magazine GQ Russia recently recommended his Instagram account as \u201centicing and not banal.\u201d\nThat closely reflects his take on web security, as well. \u201cIt is getting much more complicated,\u201d he said, \u201cand at the same time much more interesting.\u201d"}, {"text": "Around Town for April 1-7\n2016-03-31T20:36:08.000Z\nA listing of discussions, film screenings, cultural activities and walking tours in New York City.\nInformation on events for possible inclusion in Spare Times should be sent to weekend@nytimes.com by Friday at 5 p.m. for publication the following week.

But it is also a glimpse into how fashion related to the public and private lives of New York families in the late 1800s.

Neil Genzlinger, in his New York Times review of the show, wrote: \u201cWhat\u2019s most interesting about the exhibition, though, is the way it places Vikings within the evolving world. It includes, for instance, a shell found on Gotland, the Swedish island, that came from the waters off distant Cyprus, because one thing Vikings were good at was getting around.\u201d 226 West 44th Street, Manhattan, 866-987-9692, discoverytsx.com.\nIntrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum: \u2018On the Line: Intrepid and the Vietnam War\u2019 (through Sept. 1) Visitors familiar with this museum are likely to be well aware of its flight deck, perhaps even some of its wartime history.

Zachary Woolfe, in his review of the exhibition for The New York Times, wrote: \u201cAudio and video clips of the cycle, distributed generously through the installation, open up the memorabilia and scores like air in a balloon, endowing mere paper with reminders of the boldness and loftiness that so astonished Wagner\u2019s early audiences.\u201d 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-685-0008, themorgan.org.\nMuseum of the City of New York: \u2018New York\u2019s Yiddish Theater: From the Bowery to Broadway\u2019 (through July 31) Yiddish theater was once a thriving part of Jewish life on the Lower East Side.

Wasps buzzed in their midst, looking for something sweet and sticky on which to land.\nIt was a familiar scene to fans of \u201cThe Great British Bake Off.\u201d The episode in progress, part of a holiday series that will air in the United States in December, was being shot at Pinewood Studios in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, outside London.\nThe news would soon break that the shockingly popular baking competition was sold away from BBC to the glitzier and deeper-pocketed Channel 4. The two punning hosts, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, and the elegant and deeply knowledgeable octogenarian judge, Mary Berry, would all quit in allegiance to the BBC, while the remaining judge, Paul Hollywood, would agree to continue with the show.\nA riotous British media to-do would ensue: Would the show survive without Mary, Sue and Mel, and did Channel 4 really just pay 75 million pounds for Paul Hollywood and a tent?\nBut that was all to come. For the moment, the only source of suspense was the yeast.\nIn the six years it has been on the air, \u201cThe Great British Bake Off\u201d has fundamentally changed the way the British regard baking, dessert-eating and even their own culture of sweets. The \u201cBake Off Effect,\u201d as it is known, has manifested in a resurgence in home baking, a noticeable increase in the quality of baked goods sold all over the country, and a growing number of people pursuing careers as professional pastry chefs.\nJust as Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay increased the allure of British chefs, Ms. Berry and Mr. Hollywood have reinvigorated the bakers. It\u2019s a golden age for baking in Britain, both for pastries and for their sweet-toothed fans.\nMoreover, the bake-off, with its multicultural roster of contestants, has put forward a contemporary vision of Britishness that emphasizes diversity and inclusiveness.\nAlthough the premise of the show is overtly nostalgic \u2014 all of the baking is done outside in a tent hung with cheery Union Jack bunting, alluding to the tradition of a village festival \u2014 the contestants are a culturally and ethnically mixed group.\ntranscript\nN/A\nThere was Norman Calder from Portknockie, Scotland, with his haggis pie; Tamal Ray, an anesthesiologist of Indian descent from Hertfordshire, who used syringes to infuse syrup into pastries; and Jane Beedle, a garden designer from London, who perfected the lemon poppy seed drizzle cake. And, most prominently, there was Nadiya Hussain, the Season 6 winner, who was born in Luton to a family of Bangladeshi immigrants and who wears a hijab. Ms. Hussain triumphed with creations like cayenne gingerbread and cream puff towers in bubble gum and peppermint flavors.\nAbout 8,000 bakers apply for each season. After sorting out the best of the bunch, the producers then narrow down that group to arrive at a mix that represents a range of ages, races and professions from different parts of Britain.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of the superficiality you usually see in television casting in that we aren\u2019t necessarily choosing people with the biggest personalities,\u201d said Richard McKerrow, a founder of Love Productions, which produces the show. \u201cThe show is one of the most uncynical and enjoyable looks at people. You\u2019re looking at a bus driver, a builder, a doctor, just as long as they are great bakers.\u201d\nBack in her dressing room behind the tent, Ms. Berry said that the main reason for the show\u2019s success is that baking holds a universal, wholesome appeal.\n\u201cYou have whole families from all different cultures and across the generations, the grannies, the babes in arms, everyone, who can sit down to watch it and know that there will be no swearing, that it\u2019s a family show,\u201d she said. \u201cThe children especially love it because it\u2019s full of brandy snaps and other sweet things that they can\u2019t wait to run home after school and have a go at making themselves.\u201d\nNobody expected a baking competition to become one of the top-rated shows on British television, reaching its peak audience of 15 million viewers with the Season 6 finale last year. (The most recent three seasons of the show began airing in the United States in 2014 on PBS as \u201cThe Great British Baking Show\u201d because \u201cBake-Off\u201d is a trademark of Pillsbury .)\nIt did, however, come at a time when British cuisine over all had reached a high point. Restaurants all over the country were rethinking what it meant to serve British food, both by looking outward at international ingredients and influences, and inward, going back to artisanal traditions and classic but neglected recipes.\nWhat made that thrilling was the mixing of flavors and references, the likes of black pudding and partridge (beware of buckshot) sitting next to the scallops in XO sauce and the guindilla peppers on the menu at Brawn restaurant in London.\nDesserts, however, hadn\u2019t been keeping up for the most part, remaining resolutely stodgy and \u201cContinental\u201d \u2014 tiramis\u00f9 and chocolate mousse cakes \u2014 at fancy restaurants, and generally uninspired at bakeries and tea shops. Before the bake-off, it was nearly impossible to find classic British sweets like Victoria sponge sandwiches, Eccles cakes and Bakewell tarts unless you or your granny made them at home.\nAs recently as 2005, when the American pastry chef Claire Ptak started Violet Cakes as a stall in the Broadway Market in East London, most British cake shops were rather unremarkable, as she recalled.\n\u201cYou could find British cakes in twee little tea shops with lace doilies and such, but they were often dry,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThere was a lot of stale cake going on back then.\u201d\nBut that all changed after the show first aired in 2010. \u201cThe same stale sponges wouldn\u2019t do anymore,\u201d Ms. Ptak said. \u201cEveryone became excited and interested in trying new things, whether it was spelt flour, orange blossom water or star anise.\u201d\nAs the show\u2019s audience grew steadily, interest in home baking had a marked renaissance. Masses of people who had never held a whisk were now convinced that making marzipan-covered princess cakes was the most fulfilling way they could spend their weekend.\nNoting an uptick in sales of baking supplies, supermarkets and baking supply stores have been quick to respond by expanding their offerings. After the gingerbread episode aired, Hobbycraft, a crafts, baking and arts supply store, reported a 30 percent increase in the sale of icing piping tools. And Waitrose supermarkets reported that baking tray purchases increased a staggering 881 percent since the series began.\nZoe Tew, who manages the Mrs King\u2019s Pork Pies stall at Borough Market in London, said that for a longtime committed home baker like herself, this greater interest in home baking was both good and bad.\n\u201cThe good bit is that supermarkets have doubled the size of their baking sections,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I find it annoying because baking, that\u2019s always been my thing. Now it\u2019s everybody\u2019s thing.\u201d\nCherish Finden, the executive pastry chef of the Langham Hotel in the West End and a judge on the BBC spinoff, \u201cBake Off: Cr\u00e8me de la Cr\u00e8me,\u201d which focuses on professional pastry chefs, has been struck by her customers\u2019 increasingly perceptive insights into the confections she serves for the hotel\u2019s afternoon tea.\n\u201cA lot of people who come in really appreciate flavors in a more conscious way,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can evaluate the acidity and balance in a pastry, and understand how the yuzu blends with the chocolate. Then they want to go home and try baking it themselves. Even home bakers who might have stuck with Eton mess in the past are trying their hands at macarons.\u201d\nShe\u2019s also seen more interest in careers in pastry from younger people, who have been requesting apprenticeships in ever-growing numbers since the show aired.\nHobbyists hoping to deepen their baking skills are finding help in weekend classes. Bread Ahead bakery in London offers a Great British Baking Workshop, which gives lessons in potato farl from Northern Ireland and fruit and tea loaf from Wales.\n\u201cWe used to call it the Celtic baking class,\u201d said Matthew Jones, the bakery\u2019s founder, \u201cbut after the success of the show, we rebranded.\u201d\nIn a way, rebranding is at the very soul of \u201cThe Great British Bake Off,\u201d a reconsideration of everything that British baking can be. Chetna Makan, a semifinalist in Season 5 who moved from Mumbai to Kent in 2004, charmed the audience with her inspired use of fenugreek, cardamom and turmeric.\n\u201cEvery week I tried to bake something with flavors that maybe Mary and Paul hadn\u2019t tasted,\u201d she said. \u201cI really wanted them to fall in love with what I made.\u201d\nMs. Makan called being on the show \u201cthe opposite of \u2018Brexit.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so different from the picture \u2018Brexit\u2019 painted, that the British want their nation back and that they want us out,\u201d she said.\nThat\u2019s not how it actually feels, Ms. Makan said, both in the tent and outside of it.\n\u201cIt was the most welcoming, warm place, that showed unity and love among the competitors,\u201d she said. \u201cThe \u2018Bake Off\u2019 has had such a positive effect on people\u2019s lives, certainly for the people on the show, but also for the people watching.\u201d\nRecipes: Lemon Drizzle Cake | Victoria Spongecake"}, {"text": "Feeling Let Down and Left Behind, With Little Hope for Better\n2016-05-25T09:00:40.000Z\nNORTH WILKESBORO, N.C. \u2014 Kody Foster had finished his Wednesday afternoon shift at the warehouse where he earns $12.50 per hour. Normally, he would be packing himself into his Ford Focus, with its Bernie Sanders sticker and plaque with the number 48, in honor of the stock-car racer Jimmie Johnson.\nBut this week, Mr. Foster, 26, couldn\u2019t get the Ford\u2019s check engine light to turn off, and the dealership told him that fixing it would cost $1,000, which he didn\u2019t have. So instead, he borrowed his sister\u2019s ancient red minivan, with its sliding door that doesn\u2019t shut right.\nHe drove along River Road, the hillsides lush and tangled with kudzu, then up Main Street in this faltering Appalachian town, the largest in a county that has seen its factory jobs wither, its Nascar track shutter and its homegrown business \u2014 Lowe\u2019s, the home-improvement chain \u2014 move its headquarters to a Charlotte suburb in 2003.\nMr. Foster\u2019s destination, wedged between a pizza parlor and the opioid addiction clinic, was the Tapering Vapor, a bare-bones e-cigarette shop and makeshift lounge that serves as his modest oasis, a place to catch a mild nicotine buzz and let a world of worry float away on banks of big, cloying, candy-flavored clouds.\nIn an America riddled with anxieties, the worries that Mr. Foster and his neighbors bring through the doors of the Tapering Vapor are common and potent: Fear that an honest, 40-hour working-class job can no longer pay the bills. Fear of a fraying social fabric. Fear that the country\u2019s future might pale in comparison with its past.\nWilkes County, with a population of nearly 69,000, has felt those stings more than many other places. The textile and furniture industries have been struggling here for years, and the recession and the loss of the Lowe\u2019s headquarters have helped drive down the median household income. That figure fell by more than 30 percent between 2000 and 2014 when adjusted for inflation, the second-steepest decrease in the nation, according to an analysis of census data by the Pew Charitable Trusts.\nStill, the regulars at the Tapering Vapor \u2014 overwhelmingly white, mostly working class and ranging from their 20s to middle age \u2014 provide a haze-shrouded snapshot of an anxious nation navigating an election year fueled by disquiet and malaise.\nMr. Foster drove past the old Key City furniture plant; the original business was killed off by cheap imports and the Great Recession. The new tenant, a legal moonshine maker called the Copper Barrel Distillery, was proudly hawking bottles of the product that had once been the not-so-secret shame of this place \u2014 as well as $19.99 ball caps, made in Bangladesh, emblazoned with the distillery\u2019s logo.\nHe parked next to the addiction clinic, with a discreet sign that read, \u201cMountain Health Solutions.\u201d Just a few hours earlier, it had been the busiest business on the block.\nThe Tapering Vapor was almost empty save for Andrew Taylor, the manager. He stood behind the counter under a Guy Fawkes mask, the universal symbol of protest and disaffection, and near the dry-erase board listing dozens of flavors for sale. The names suggested fantasia and abundance: Summer Melon, Broken Neon, Caramel Latte, Unlimited Power.\nThe two friends greeted each other with a joke borrowed from a popular Vine video. Mr. Taylor, 22, blew out a cloud that smelled like orange cheesecake.\nMoments later, another customer, Karen Chapman, came in carrying an oversize handbag. She ordered a bottle of nicotine-laced liquid flavored like dark chocolate and tobacco.\nShe said she had quit smoking cigarettes in March, soon after her favorite character on the reality television show \u201cMob Wives,\u201d Angela Raiola, died of cancer. Ms. Chapman, 47, said she had two master\u2019s degrees and was currently holding six part-time jobs \u2014 a mix of clerical, academic and online work, none of which provided health insurance.\n\u201cThis is not the life I saw for myself,\u2019\u2019 she said.\nNow Mr. Foster was at work at the counter, his eyes locked in concentration under his ball cap. He was building a custom heating coil for the kind of powerful vapor-delivery device he and his friends prefer: a walkie-talkie-size gadget called a vaporizer, or a mod. It was a complicated procedure, involving an electric drill and a spool of 36-gauge alloy wire.\nMr. Foster has always had a knack for building. Before the recession, his father built fancy mountain retirement homes here. Now retirees were nosing around the North Carolina mountains again, and his father was building again. Sometimes Mr. Foster pitches in.\nBut this afternoon, as he sucked on a mod loaded with a banana-strawberry concoction, he was trying not to think about the trouble he was in. About how he messed up by buying the little white Ford off the showroom floor in 2012; the $265 monthly payments were killing him.\nHow his Verizon bill inched close to $300 the month before because he lost track of how much video he had streamed.\nHow he, his wife and their 4-year-old son were living at his mother-in-law\u2019s place after the landlord sold the house they had been renting for $400 per month. How even a two-bedroom trailer in a crummy neighborhood around here was going for $600 per month. \u201cMore than I can handle,\u201d he said.\nAnd how his second child was due in July.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just me. There are other people in similar boats,\u201d Mr. Foster said. He acknowledged that maybe he was to blame for some if it. Maybe he should have stayed in college. Maybe he should have kept better track of his cellphone\u2019s data plan.\nBut in his America, he said, it seemed that just a few bad choices could doom anybody who wasn\u2019t born with Donald Trump money. \u201cIf you make just one poor decision,\u201d he said, \u201cthen you\u2019re screwed.\u201d\nMr. Foster\u2019s social life is the Tapering Vapor. And it is his online chatter with friends and strangers while he is immersed in the virtual worlds of games like Battlefield and Grand Theft Auto V on his PlayStation. The Internet means that few ideas are exotic anymore, even in a place like this, and Mr. Foster has been evangelizing to friends and co-workers lately on behalf of the documentary \u201cZeitgeist: Addendum.\u201d Mr. Foster had watched it online and was intrigued by its critique of international capitalism and its banking and monetary systems.\nMr. Foster likes Mr. Sanders\u2019s promise of universal health care, and his pledge to make tuition free at public colleges and universities. His dream, which seems distant now, is to one day return to school and study marine biology.\nHis support for Mr. Sanders makes him an outlier in largely conservative Wilkes County. Mr. Trump won the March 15 Republican primary here with 47 percent of the vote, garnering more than twice the votes of Hillary Clinton, who won the Democratic primary.\nAmong those who chose Mr. Trump was Mr. Taylor, a native of western North Carolina who never knew the world before the North American Free Trade Agreement or the Internet. He is a gamer and amateur musician. He attends Baptist Bible study and owns a throwback \u201cLegend of Zelda\u201d T-shirt. He plays bluegrass and the White Stripes.\nAnd though globalization provides him with his preferred instruments of leisure \u2014 a foreign-made Xbox and a cheap, sturdy Japanese acoustic guitar \u2014 he is also one of globalization\u2019s discontents.\nOn the whole, Mr. Taylor agrees with Mr. Trump that the United States, particularly places like Wilkes County, received raw deals from the trade pacts that began with the passage of Nafta. Some of the textile and furniture industry remains here. But it is not like it was. Or at least the way people tell him it was.\nHe has long been skeptical of big government, and the way government works generally. It did not help that the Food and Drug Administration announced greater regulation of the e-cigarette industry this month. He figured it would soon put little shops like this one out of business.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be worse than anybody else up there,\u201d Mr. Taylor said of Mr. Trump. If nothing else, he said, \u201cHe\u2019d be somewhat more interesting to watch things unfold under.\u201d\nLike many others here, both successful and not, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Foster are united in their belief that they are living among the ruins of a lapsed golden age.\nThe post-World War II success story that people once told about themselves here was captured in a 1948 promotional film, uploaded to YouTube by the State Archives of North Carolina, called \u201cThis is Progressive Wilkes County.\u201d It shows the locals of that era bustling on now-sleepy downtown thoroughfares here and in Wilkesboro, the smaller sister city across the Yadkin River, as shopkeepers offered pies and pastries, men\u2019s suits and prescription drugs.\n\u201cEvery day is Saturday in these thriving mountain towns,\u201d a narrator says.\nToday, Michael A. Cooper, Jr., 30, a lawyer who grew up in North Wilkesboro, compares the county to a Jenga tower whose pieces scattered when the old industries pulled out. The methamphetamine phenomenon crested here two or three years ago, but the labs continue to flourish among its 754 square miles of hollows and low mountains. Perhaps even more prevalent are prescription drugs \u2014 particularly opioids like Oxycodone and Opana.\nMr. Cooper is a rare young white-collar professional who stayed in town. Many of his clients are people he went to high school with and are now in trouble over drugs or caught in the tangle of family court and dead-end jobs. It doesn\u2019t surprise him that Mr. Trump\u2019s message resonates.\n\u201cIf there were winners or losers in America in this century, they were the losers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking to people who haven\u2019t won in 30 years, and now somebody is telling them they\u2019re going to win again.\u201d\nMr. Trump is popular here for a number of reasons. The county is 93 percent white, but from 1990 to 2014, the Hispanic population there grew from 360 people to 4,154, according to census figures. On a Wednesday in March, Brona Wood, 58, a maintenance worker at the county courthouse, came in to the Tapering Vapor for a bottle of liquid called Fruity Juice. If Mr. Trump is elected, she said, \u201cThe Mexicans is going to stop coming in here and taking everybody\u2019s jobs.\u201d\nEddie Settle, the chairman of the County Commission, was giving a driving tour of the county a few days before the March primaries when a pickup truck adorned with a Confederate flag passed by. It is a common sight here, Mr. Settle said, though he argued that the Confederate symbol has less to do with racism than an ingrained suspicion of those in power. He said the same dynamic explained Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal: \u201cIt\u2019s not because he\u2019s Donald Trump. It\u2019s because he\u2019s anti-establishment.\u201d\nAs part of his tour, Mr. Settle drove by the large chicken processing plant in Wilkesboro, operated by Tyson Foods. Pay on the production line ranges from $10 to just under $14 per hour. It employs about 2,800 people.\nOut on Route 421, near the bustling Wilkesboro Walmart, the highway is lined with common American chains \u2014 Sonic, Chik-fil-A, Dollar Tree, Hardee\u2019s, Taco Bell, Sally Beauty Supply \u2014 a sign of the area\u2019s low-wage jobs. The county\u2019s unemployment rate was almost 15 percent in February 2010. In April, it was 5.4 percent, about the same as the national rate.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have an unemployment problem here,\u201d said Jim Smoak, the chairman of the Wilkes Economic Development Corporation. \u201cWe have a wage problem.\u201d\nEven before Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, government and business leaders here had concocted a plan for making Wilkes County great again. They introduced advanced engineering and computer training in high schools, and at the community college, they added computer controlled lathes and mills and a programmable practice production line \u2014 all to train future workers for the Kia or Hyundai plant or other big manufacturing facility the county hopes to lure. So far, no luck.\nSome of the clientele at the Tapering Vapor have made their own luck, working hard and earning a measure of economic security. Others are just getting by.\nBilly Williams, 30, walked in wearing an oversize football jersey, with a front tooth conspicuously missing, and asked for a strawberry-raspberry liquid called Beetlejuice. He said he had been working a few hours a week at a restaurant across the river. It was not as many hours as he\u2019d like, but he said it was the best work he could find, given his felony cocaine conviction from many years ago.\nKim Shumate, 58, walked in, looking for a replacement part for her mod. She quit smoking cigarettes after her house went into foreclosure in 2012. That was after Lowe\u2019s, at the height of the recession, stopped contracting with her husband\u2019s company, which had built the interiors of new stores.\nMs. Shumate cries when she thinks about her old house, with its big porch and its trails through the woods. So she tries not to think about it at all.\nLonnie Ramsay, 45, walked in looking for help. He described a nasty falling-out with his girlfriend and said he just wanted to get home to a nearby city. But he only had $25 to his name. He said he had been making $10 an hour at a factory.\nOne Friday afternoon someone brought a pair of virtual reality goggles hooked up to a laptop to the shop. Mr. Foster exhaled a cloud that smelled like a Popsicle. He said he had been reading up on the idea, explored in the \u201cZeitgeist\u201d movie, of a \u201cresource-based economy\u201d \u2014 a system in which, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no money and everything is controlled by computers and resources are equally distributed and there\u2019s no ownership or anything like that.\u201d\n\u201cThe system we have now is going to collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd technology, the automation process, is going to keep taking over and over.\u201d\nThat, he said, would free up people to do what they wanted.\nChris Lentz, 36, a worker for a utility company in a pair of mud-caked boots, frowned and asked, \u201cIf people were just given everything they ever needed, then what\u2019s the point of going to work?\u201d\nAnd so it went: the thick, sweet haze; the frustrations, diversions and digital toys; and the sense, in this jagged, hyperconnected moment, that everything is possible, or nothing is.\nMr. Foster took a turn with the virtual reality goggles, and put himself on a roller coaster. His body squirmed and bounced on the sofa as he rounded and flew down the virtual tracks until he became queasy, and said he\u2019d had enough."}, {"text": "How One of the Deadliest Hajj Accidents Unfolded\n2016-09-06T02:56:12.000Z\n"}, {"text": "How a Secretive Branch of ISIS Built a Global Network of Killers\n2016-08-03T09:01:27.000Z\nBREMEN, Germany \u2014 Believing he was answering a holy call, Harry Sarfo left his home in the working-class city of Bremen last year and drove for four straight days to reach the territory controlled by the Islamic State in Syria.\nHe barely had time to settle in before members of the Islamic State\u2019s secret service, wearing masks over their faces, came to inform him and his German friend that they no longer wanted Europeans to come to Syria. Where they were really needed was back home, to help carry out the group\u2019s plan of waging terrorism across the globe.\n\u201cHe was speaking openly about the situation, saying that they have loads of people living in European countries and waiting for commands to attack the European people,\u201d Mr. Sarfo recounted on Monday, in an interview with The New York Times conducted in English inside the maximum-security prison near Bremen. \u201cAnd that was before the Brussels attacks, before the Paris attacks.\u201d\nThe masked man explained that, although the group was well set up in some European countries, it needed more attackers in Germany and Britain, in particular. \u201cThey said, \u2018Would you mind to go back to Germany, because that\u2019s what we need at the moment,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sarfo recalled. \u201cAnd they always said they wanted to have something that is occurring in the same time: They want to have loads of attacks at the same time in England and Germany and France.\u201d\nThe operatives belonged to an intelligence unit of the Islamic State known in Arabic as the Emni, which has become a combination of an internal police force and an external operations branch, dedicated to exporting terror abroad, according to thousands of pages of French, Belgian, German and Austrian intelligence and interrogation documents obtained by The Times.\nThe Islamic State\u2019s attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 brought global attention to the group\u2019s external terrorism network, which began sending fighters abroad two years ago. Now, Mr. Sarfo\u2019s account, along with those of other captured recruits, has further pulled back the curtain on the group\u2019s machinery for projecting violence beyond its borders.\nWhat they describe is a multilevel secret service under the overall command of the Islamic State\u2019s most senior Syrian operative, spokesman and propaganda chief, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani. Below him is a tier of lieutenants empowered to plan attacks in different regions of the world, including a \u201csecret service for European affairs,\u201d a \u201csecret service for Asian affairs\u201d and a \u201csecret service for Arab affairs,\u201d according to Mr. Sarfo.\nReinforcing the idea that the Emni is a core part of the Islamic State\u2019s operations, the interviews and documents indicate that the unit has carte blanche to recruit and reroute operatives from all parts of the organization \u2014 from new arrivals to seasoned battlefield fighters, and from the group\u2019s special forces and its elite commando units. Taken together, the interrogation records show that operatives are selected by nationality and grouped by language into small, discrete units whose members sometimes only meet one another on the eve of their departure abroad.\nAnd through the coordinating role played by Mr. Adnani, terror planning has gone hand-in-hand with the group\u2019s extensive propaganda operations \u2014 including, Mr. Sarfo claimed, monthly meetings in which Mr. Adnani chose which grisly videos to promote based on battlefield events.\nBased on the accounts of operatives arrested so far, the Emni has become the crucial cog in the group\u2019s terrorism machinery, and its trainees led the Paris attacks and built the suitcase bombs used in a Brussels airport terminal and subway station. Investigation records show that its foot soldiers have also been sent to Austria, Germany, Spain, Lebanon, Tunisia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia.\nWith European officials stretched by a string of assaults by seemingly unconnected attackers who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, Mr. Sarfo suggested that there may be more of a link than the authorities yet know. He said he was told that undercover operatives in Europe used new converts as go-betweens, or \u201cclean men,\u201d who help link up people interested in carrying out attacks with operatives who can pass on instructions on everything from how to make a suicide vest to how to credit their violence to the Islamic State.\nThe group has sent \u201chundreds of operatives\u201d back to the European Union, with \u201chundreds more in Turkey alone,\u201d according to a senior United States intelligence official and a senior American defense official, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence.\nMr. Sarfo, who was recently moved out of solitary confinement at his German prison because he is no longer considered violent, agrees with that assessment. \u201cMany of them have returned,\u201d he said. \u201cHundreds, definitely.\u201d\nThe first port of call for new arrivals to the Islamic State is a network of dormitories in Syria, just across the border from Turkey. There, recruits are interviewed and inventoried.\nMr. Sarfo was fingerprinted, and a doctor came to draw a blood sample and perform a physical examination. A man with a laptop conducted an intake interview. \u201cHe was asking normal questions like: \u2018What\u2019s your name? What\u2019s your second name? Who\u2019s your mom? Where\u2019s your mom originally from? What did you study? What degree do you have? What\u2019s your ambition? What do you want to become?\u2019\u201d Mr. Sarfo said.\nHis background was also of interest. He was a regular at a radical mosque in Bremen that had already sent about 20 members to Syria, at least four of whom were killed in battle, according to Daniel Heinke, the German Interior Ministry\u2019s counterterrorism coordinator for the area. And he had served a one-year prison sentence for breaking into a supermarket safe and stealing 23,000 euros. Even though the punishment for theft in areas under Islamic State control is amputation, a criminal past can be a valued asset, Mr. Sarfo said, \u201cespecially if they know you have ties to organized crime and they know you can get fake IDs, or they know you have contact men in Europe who can smuggle you into the European Union.\u201d\nThe bureaucratic nature of the intake procedure was recently confirmed by American officials after USB drives were recovered in the recently liberated Syrian city of Manbij, one of the hubs for processing foreign fighters.\nMr. Sarfo checked all the necessary boxes, and on the third day after his arrival, the members of the Emni came to ask for him. He wanted to fight in Syria and Iraq, but the masked operatives explained that they had a vexing problem.\n\u201cThey told me that there aren\u2019t many people in Germany who are willing to do the job,\u201d Mr. Sarfo said soon after his arrest last year, according to the transcript of his interrogation by German officials, which runs more than 500 pages. \u201cThey said they had some in the beginning. But one after another, you could say, they chickened out, because they got scared \u2014 cold feet. Same in England.\u201d\nBy contrast, the group had more than enough volunteers for France. \u201cMy friend asked them about France,\u201d Mr. Sarfo said. \u201cAnd they started laughing. But really serious laughing, with tears in their eyes. They said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about France.\u2019 \u2018Mafi mushkilah\u2019 \u2014 in Arabic, it means \u2018no problem.\u2019\u201d That conversation took place in April 2015, seven months before the coordinated killings in Paris in November, the worst terrorist attack in Europe in over a decade.\nWhile some details of Mr. Sarfo\u2019s account cannot be verified, his statements track with what other recruits related in their interrogations. And both prison officials and the German intelligence agents who debriefed Mr. Sarfo after his arrest said they found him credible.\nSince the rise of the Islamic State over two years ago, intelligence agencies have been collecting nuggets on the Emni. Originally, the unit was tasked with policing the Islamic State\u2019s members, including conducting interrogations and ferreting out spies, according to interrogation records and analysts. But French members arrested in 2014 and 2015 explained that the Emni had taken on a new portfolio: projecting terror abroad.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Emni that ensures the internal security inside Dawla\u201d \u2014 the Arabic word for state \u2014 \u201cand oversees external security by sending abroad people they recruited, or else sending individuals to carry out violent acts, like what happened in Tunisia inside the museum in Tunis, or else the aborted plot in Belgium,\u201d said Nicolas Moreau, 32, a French citizen who was arrested last year after leaving the Islamic State in Syria, according to his statement to France\u2019s domestic intelligence agency.\nMr. Moreau explained that he had run a restaurant in Raqqa, Syria, the de facto capital of the group\u2019s territory, where he had served meals to key members of the Emni \u2014 including Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the on-the-ground commander of the Paris attacks, who was killed in a standoff with the police days later.\nOther interrogations, as well as Mr. Sarfo\u2019s account, have led investigators to conclude that the Emni also trained and dispatched the gunman who opened fire on a beach in Sousse, Tunisia, in June, and the man who prepared the Brussels airport bombs.\nRecords from French, Austrian and Belgian intelligence agencies show that at least 28 operatives recruited by the Emni succeeded in deploying to countries outside of the Islamic State\u2019s core territory, mounting both successful attacks and plots that were foiled. Officials say that dozens of other operatives have slipped through and formed sleeper cells.\nIn his own interactions with the Emni, Mr. Sarfo realized that they were preparing a global portfolio of terrorists and looking to fill holes in their international network, he said.\nHe described what he had been told about the group\u2019s work to build an infrastructure in Bangladesh. There, a siege by a team of Islamic State gunmen left at least 20 hostages dead at a cafe last month, almost all of them foreigners.\nMr. Sarfo said that for Asian recruits, the group was looking specifically for militants who had emerged from Al Qaeda\u2019s network in the region. \u201cPeople especially from Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia \u2014 they have people who used to work for Al Qaeda, and once they joined the Islamic State, they are asking them questions about their experiences and if they have contacts,\u201d he said.\nIn his briefings with the German authorities, and again in the interview this week, Mr. Sarfo raised the possibility that some of the recent attackers in Europe who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State\u2019s leader during their assaults might have a more direct link to the group than officials believe.\nMr. Sarfo explained that the Emni keeps many of its operatives underground in Europe. They act as nodes that can remotely activate potential suicide attackers who have been drawn in by propaganda. Linking them are what Mr. Sarfo called \u201cclean men,\u201d new converts to Islam with no established ties to radical groups.\n\u201cThese people are not in direct contact with these guys who are doing the attacks, because they know if these people start talking, they will get caught,\u201d he said of the underground operatives.\n\u201cThey mostly use people who are new Muslims, who are converts,\u201d he said. Those \u201cclean\u201d converts \u201cget in contact with the people, and they give them the message.\u201d And in the case of some videotaped pledges of allegiance, the go-between can then send the video on to the handler in Europe, who uploads it for use by the Islamic State\u2019s propaganda channels.\nThe intelligence documents and Mr. Sarfo agree that the Islamic State has made the most of its recruits\u2019 nationalities by sending them back to plot attacks at home. Yet one important region where the Emni is not thought to have succeeded in sending trained attackers is North America, Mr. Sarfo said, recalling what the members of the branch told him.\nThough dozens of Americans have become members of the Islamic State, and some have been recruited into the external operations wing, \u201cthey know it\u2019s hard for them to get Americans into America\u201d once they have traveled to Syria, he said.\n\u201cFor America and Canada, it\u2019s much easier for them to get them over the social network, because they say the Americans are dumb \u2014 they have open gun policies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say we can radicalize them easily, and if they have no prior record, they can buy guns, so we don\u2019t need to have no contact man who has to provide guns for them.\u201d\nSince late 2014, the Islamic State has instructed foreigners joining the group to make their trip look like a holiday in southern Turkey, including booking a return flight and paying for an all-inclusive vacation at a beach resort, from which smugglers arrange their transport into Syria, according to intelligence documents and Mr. Sarfo\u2019s account.\nThat cover story creates pressure to keep things moving quickly during the recruits\u2019 training in Syria, and most get a bare minimum \u2014 just a few days of basic weapons practice, in some instances.\n\u201cWhen they go back to France or in Germany, they can say, \u2018I was only on holidays in Turkey,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sarfo said. \u201cThe longer they stay in the Islamic State, the more suspicious the secret service in the West gets, and that\u2019s why they try to do the training as quickly as possible.\u201d\nMr. Sarfo\u2019s facility in both German and English \u2014 he studied construction at Newham College in East London \u2014 made him attractive as a potential attacker. Though the Emni approached him several times to ask him to return to Germany, he demurred, he said.\nEventually, Mr. Sarfo, perhaps because of his burly build \u2014 6-foot-1 and around 286 pounds when he arrived in Syria, though he has lost weight since then \u2014 was drafted into the Islamic State\u2019s quwat khas, Arabic for special forces.\nThe unit only admitted single men who agreed not to marry during the duration of their training. In addition to providing the offensive force to infiltrate cities during battles, it was one of several elite units that became recruiting pools for the external operations branch, Mr. Sarfo said.\nAlong with his German friend, he was driven to the desert outside Raqqa.\n\u201cThey dropped us off in the middle of nowhere and told us, \u2018We are here,\u2019\u201d he said, according to the transcript of one of his interrogation sessions. \u201cSo we\u2019re standing in the desert and thought to ourselves, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d When the two Germans looked more closely, they realized there were cavelike dwellings around them. Everything above ground was painted with mud so as to be invisible to drones.\n\u201cShowering was prohibited. Eating was prohibited, too, unless they gave it to you,\u201d Mr. Sarfo said, adding that he had shared a cave with five or six others. Even drinking water was harshly rationed. \u201cEach dwelling received two cups of water a day, put on the doorstep,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the purpose of this was to test us, see who really wants it, who\u2019s firm.\u201d\nThe grueling training began: hours of running, jumping, push-ups, parallel bars, crawling. The recruits began fainting.\nBy the second week, they were each given a Kalashnikov assault rifle and told to sleep with it between their legs until it became \u201clike a third arm,\u201d he said, according to his interrogation transcript.\nThe punishment for failing to keep up was harsh. \u201cThere was one boy who refused to get up, because he was just too exhausted,\u201d Mr. Sarfo told the authorities. \u201cSo they tied him to a pole with his legs and his arms and left him there.\u201d\nHe learned that the special forces program involved 10 levels of training. After he graduated to Level 2, he was moved to an island on a river in Tabqa, Syria. The recruits\u2019 sleeping spots now consisted of holes in the ground, covered by sticks and twigs. They practiced swimming, scuba diving and navigating by the stars.\nThroughout his training, Mr. Sarfo rubbed shoulders with an international cadre of recruits. When he first arrived at the desert campus, he ran laps alongside Moroccans, Egyptians, at least one Indonesian, a Canadian and a Belgian. And out on the island, he learned of similar special units, including one called Jaysh al-Khalifa, or the Army of the Caliphate.\nA 12-page criminal complaint indicates that the Islamic State tried to recruit at least one American into that unit, but he declined to enroll.\nThe man, Mohamad Jamal Khweis, a 26-year-old from Alexandria, Va., traveled to Syria in December, only to be captured by Kurdish troops in Iraq in March. In his debriefing with the F.B.I., he explained that early on, he was approached by members of the unit. \u201cDuring his stay at this safe house, representatives from Jaysh Khalifa, a group described by the defendant as an \u2018offensive group,\u2019 visited the new ISIL recruits,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cThe representatives explained that their group was responsible for accepting volunteers from foreign countries who would be trained and sent back to their countries to conduct operations and execute attacks on behalf of ISIL. The group\u2019s requirements, among other things, were that recruits had to be single, would train in remote locations, must be free of any injuries and had to stay reclusive when returning to their home countries.\u201d\nAs he progressed through the special forces training, Mr. Sarfo became closer with the emir of the camp, a Moroccan, who began to divulge details about how the Islamic State\u2019s external operations effort was structured, he said. Mr. Sarfo learned that there was one outsize figure behind the group\u2019s strategies and ambitions. \u201cThe big man behind everything is Abu Muhammad al-Adnani,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe is the head of the Emni, and he is the head of the special forces as well,\u201d Mr. Sarfo added. \u201cEverything goes back to him.\u201d\nBorn in the town of Binnish in northern Syria, Mr. Adnani is said to be 39, and is the subject of a $5 million bounty from the State Department\u2019s Rewards for Justice program. But details about his life remain a mystery. There are very few available photos of him, and the one used on the State Department\u2019s website is years old.\nMr. Sarfo explained that when recruits to the special forces finished all 10 levels of training, they were blindfolded and driven to meet Mr. Adnani, where they pledged allegiance to him directly. Mr. Sarfo was told that the blindfolds stayed on the whole time, so that even Mr. Adnani\u2019s best-trained fighters never know what he looks like.\nTo the world, Mr. Adnani is better known as the official spokesman of the Islamic State, and the man who put out a global call this year for Muslims to attack unbelievers wherever they were, however they could.\n\u201cAdnani is much more than just the mouthpiece of this group,\u201d said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington who tracks the group\u2019s leadership. \u201cHe is heavily involved in external operations. He is sort of the administrative \u2018yea\u2019 or \u2018nay\u2019 at the top of the pyramid,\u201d who signs off on attack plans, the details of which are handled by his subordinates.\nDuring his time in Syria, Mr. Sarfo was contacted by other German fighters who wanted him to be an actor in a propaganda film aimed at German speakers. They drove to Palmyra, and Mr. Sarfo was told to hold the group\u2019s black flag and to walk again and again in front of the camera as they filmed repeated takes. Syrian captives were forced to kneel, and the other German fighters shot them, showing an interest only in the cinematic effect.\nOne turned to Mr. Sarfo immediately after killing a victim and asked: \u201cHow did I look like? Did I look good, the way I executed?\u201d\nMr. Sarfo said he had learned that videos like the one he acted in were vetted by Mr. Adnani himself in a monthly meeting of senior operatives.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a vetting procedure,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce a month they have a shura \u2014 which is a sitting, a meeting \u2014 where all the videos and everything that is important, they start speaking about it. And Abu Muhammad al-Adnani is the head of the shura.\u201d\nMr. Sarfo said he had started doubting his allegiance to ISIS during his training, after seeing how cruelly they treated those who could not keep up. Making the propaganda video provided his final disillusionment when he saw how many times they recorded each scene in the five-minute film. Back in Germany, when he had been inspired by similar videos, he had always assumed they were real, not staged.\nHe began plotting his escape, which took weeks and involved sprinting and crawling in a field of mud before crossing into Turkey. He was arrested at Bremen Airport, where he landed on July 20, 2015, and he voluntarily confessed. He is now serving a three-year term on terrorism charges.\nAmong the Islamic State\u2019s innovations is the role of foreigners, especially Europeans, in the planning of attacks.\nMr. Sarfo\u2019s account agrees with investigation documents and the assessments of terrorism experts, who say that French and Belgian citizens like Mr. Abaaoud are more than just operatives and have been given managing roles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a creative and interesting operational road map, to be able to lean on someone like Abaaoud, who has his own network abroad,\u201d said Jean-Charles Brisard, chairman of the Center for the Analysis of Terrorism in Paris. \u201cThey gave him the autonomy regarding tactics and strategy, even if the operation as a whole still needs a green light from the Islamic State\u2019s leadership.\u201d\nLooking at the current leaders of the Emni, investigators have homed in on two in particular. They go by the aliases Abu Souleymane, a French citizen, and Abu Ahmad, described as Syrian. Both are considered top lieutenants of Mr. Adnani, according to the senior American defense official and senior intelligence official.\nThe two men play a direct role in identifying fighters to be sent overseas, in choosing targets and in organizing logistics for operatives, including paying for smugglers to get them to Europe and, in at least one case, sending Western Union transfers, according to European intelligence documents.\nA glimpse into the possible role of Abu Souleymane came from one of the hostages held by suicide bombers inside the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in November.\nAfter gunning down dozens of concertgoers, two of the suicide bombers retreated into a hallway with a group of hostages, forcing them to sit against the windows as human shields, said the hostage, David Fritz-Goeppinger, 24. In the two-and-a-half-hour standoff that ensued, Mr. Fritz heard one of the bombers ask the other, \u201cShould we call Souleymane?\u201d\nThe second operative appeared annoyed that the first had asked the question in French, and ordered him to switch to Arabic.\n\u201cI immediately understood that, yes, this was the individual, maybe not the individual who had organized the attack, but who held a place in the hierarchy above them,\u201d Mr. Fritz said in a telephone interview. His testimony is also included in a detailed, 51-page report by France\u2019s antiterrorism police. \u201cThey were absolutely, like soldiers,\u201d awaiting orders, he said.\nSouleymane, whose full nom de guerre is Abu Souleymane al-Faransi, or Abu Souleymane the Frenchman, is believed to be a French national in his 30s who is of either Moroccan or Tunisian ancestry, according to Ludovico Carlino, a senior analyst with IHS Conflict Monitor in London. Mr. Carlino says he believes that Souleymane was promoted to be the top terrorism planner for Europe after Mr. Abaaoud\u2019s death.\nA snapshot of the other senior leader, Abu Ahmad, appears in the account of a man who investigators have concluded was supposed to be part of the team of Paris attackers: an Algerian named Adel Haddadi. Mr. Haddadi said he and another member of the team, a former Lashkar-e-Taiba member from Pakistan named Muhammad Usman, were separated from two other attackers after they reached Greece by boat.\nMr. Haddadi, 28, and Mr. Usman, 22, were eventually arrested in a migrant camp in Salzburg, Austria. The two men sent alongside them became the first suicide bombers to detonate their vests outside the Stade de France during the November attacks.\nAfter arriving in Syria and being routed to the international dormitory there in February 2015, Mr. Haddadi worked as a cook in Raqqa for months before a member of the Emni came to see him, according to French and Austrian investigation documents.\n\u201cOne day, a Syrian came into the kitchen to see me and said that someone called Abu Ahmad wanted to see me,\u201d Mr. Haddadi was quoted as saying in the Austrian record of his interrogation. He was driven to a five-story building, where another Syrian holding a walkie talkie radioed Abu Ahmad. They waited for hours before the Syrian got orders to drive the recruit to the next location. In the street, a Saudi man wearing all white was waiting, and asked Mr. Haddadi to go on a walk.\nAfter 300 yards, they reached an empty apartment building and sat down. \u201cI was scared, I wanted to leave, but he talked the whole time,\u201d Mr. Haddadi told the authorities.\n\u201cHe said only positive things about me, that Daesh trusted me and that I now needed to prove myself worthy of that trust. He said that Daesh was going to send me to France,\u201d Mr. Haddadi added, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cThe details, he said, I would get them once I arrived in France.\u201d\nSometime after that, Abu Ahmad arrived. Mr. Haddadi described him as a Syrian man between 38 and 42 years old, slim with a long, black beard, and dressed all in black. He was, Mr. Haddadi said, \u201cthe giver of orders.\u201d\nAbu Ahmad brought Mr. Haddadi together with three other potential attackers, with the last man, Mr. Usman, being introduced just a day before they all set out for Europe. Mr. Haddadi and two of the other men were native Arabic speakers, and Mr. Usman spoke enough Arabic to communicate with them, the interrogation documents said.\nThe day of their departure, Abu Ahmad came and gave them his Turkish cellphone number, instructing them to store it in their phone as \u201cFF,\u201d to avoid registering a name. He gave Mr. Haddadi $2,000 in $100 bills, and they were driven to the Turkish border. A man met them in Turkey to take their photographs, and returned with Syrian passports. Another smuggler arranged their Oct. 3 boat trip to Leros, Greece.\nAll of these logistical steps, as well as Western Union money transfers, were organized by Abu Ahmad, one of the senior lieutenants running the Islamic State\u2019s efforts to export terror. Until his arrest in December, Mr. Haddadi remained in touch with Abu Ahmad through messages on Telegram and via text messages to his Turkish number, according to the investigation record.\nAbu Ahmad\u2019s Turkish number was found somewhere else, too: written on a slip of paper in the pants pocket of the severed leg of one of the suicide bombers at the Stade de France."}, {"text": "In India, a Small Band of Women Risk It All for a Chance to Work\n2016-01-30T13:00:09.000Z\nOn a humid, sweaty, honking afternoon last summer, two women were making their way through the court complex in the north Indian city of Meerut, searching for the office of the subdivisional magistrate.\nThey walked past the purveyors of stamp papers and affidavits, typists clickety-clacking on stools, barristers-at-law in flapping gowns, pillars of wadded files bound in twine.\nIt is fair to say that these two did not belong. They had the swaying walk of village women \u2014 half-duck, half-ballerina \u2014 who have spent their lives balancing bundles of firewood on their heads. When they entered the office of a criminal defense lawyer, in the sweat-stained broom closet where he receives clients, they were at first so conscious of their low status that they tried to sit on the floor.\nThey were engaging his services because they wanted to work. They lived 10 miles away, in a small settlement where, for generations, begging had been the main source of income. A few weeks earlier, the male elders of their caste had decreed that village women working at nearby meat-processing factories should leave their jobs. The reason they gave was that women at home would be better protected from the sexual advances of outside men. A bigger issue lay beneath the surface: The women\u2019s earnings had begun to undermine the old order.\nIt came as a surprise when seven of the women, who had come to rely on the daily wage of 200 rupees, about $3, refused to stop. The women would have to, the men said, blocking the lane with their bodies. They did not expect the women to go to the police.\nIt would have been impossible \u2014 this appeal to the distant, abstract power of the Indian state \u2014 if the women had not been so angry.\nGeeta, the younger of the two, was born angry. Even as a child, if her siblings took her portion of food, she was apt to throw everyone\u2019s dinner into the dirt. \u201cA real bastard-woman,\u201d one neighbor called her, eyes widening with admiration.\n\u201cLet their ladies sit and cook for them,\u201d Geeta would hiss to her friend Premwati, as they walked together past their neighbors. \u201cOur husbands are with us.\u201d\nPremwati was a more cautious sort. In the tradition of their caste, the Nats, a person challenging a community punishment could offer a defense at trial by picking up a red-hot piece of iron and walking five steps toward the temple. If her hands burned, she was guilty, and would be placed in a hole in the ground until she confessed.\nThey had wandered into dangerous territory, she and Geeta. She knew that. When evening fell in the village of Peepli Khera, Premwati would crouch over her clay stove, rolling chapatis in and out of the embers, and survey the forces arrayed against them. Too poor to afford a house with a door, she lay at night under a thatched roof, listening for the footsteps of people she could not see.\nLast summer, as they fought to remain in the work force, Geeta and Premwati made up a small part of a big economic puzzle.\nIn India, women\u2019s participation in the labor force stands at around 27 percent, lower than any other country in the G-20, except for Saudi Arabia. Standard models suggest that a lucky confluence of factors \u2014 economic expansion, rising education levels and plummeting fertility \u2014 would draw women swiftly into India\u2019s economy.\nInstead, the opposite is happening: From 2005 to 2012, women\u2019s participation rates slid to 27 percent from 37 percent, largely because rural women were dropping out of the work force. Of 189 countries studied by the International Labour Organization, India ranks 17th from the bottom.\nThis is terrible news for India, as it strains to become a competitive producer for world markets. Economists have put forward two theories to explain the decline. The first is that India\u2019s boom has created jobs in segments that are generally not accessible to women, like construction. The second has to do with culture: Unless their choices are dictated by destitute poverty, Indian families seek the status that comes from keeping women at home.\nThe Nat families were just crossing that threshold, and many things were changing. Premwati and Geeta could feel the grip of the local moneylenders loosening; the taste of independence made them bold. In this way, over five months last spring and summer, the unstoppable force of economic need met the immovable object of social control.\nThe cost of remaining in the work force, they discovered, was very high.\nAt 10 o\u2019clock on a morning in May, Geeta and Premwati wrapped fried bread in plastic bags and set off on foot toward the meat-processing factories. It was blindingly hot, and stray dogs and buffaloes lay in strips of shade on either side of the road.\nTo save the 5-rupee, or 7-cent, fare for an auto-rickshaw, they walked the whole dusty distance, nearly an hour from their small community of Nats, who are Hindus, through the Muslim neighborhoods that surround the factories. They kept their dupattas pulled all the way down over their faces, following the medieval tradition of purdah, or veiling, but men in skullcaps lingered in the doorways anyway, gawking.\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d one of the men yelled, breaking the silence.\n\u201cGeeta,\u201d came the reply, bell-clear.\nThe two met as young wives, taken away from their home villages and deposited among strangers in Peepli Khera. Geeta, who had barely hit puberty, landed in the grip of a mother-in-law who believed that drinking tea made a girl greedy for extra helpings of food.\nSo Geeta would sneak over to see Premwati, who made buckets of tea, watery and sweet. Geeta was scrawny and mouthy. She tended to alienate women \u2014 maybe it was the way she called them fat buffaloes \u2014 but Premwati calmly allowed Geeta\u2019s insults to bubble over her. Geeta returned the favor by stomping over and intervening whenever Premwati\u2019s husband beat her.\n\u201cIt has become a habit to take a beating,\u201d Geeta said one day, scowling.\nIn this way, Geeta had carved out a role for herself as the bossiest woman in the village. No one beat her. \u201cHer husband is like a chicken \u2014 if she tells him to get up, he will get up!\u201d chuckled the chief in the town where she grew up.\nAs the women approached the factories that morning, they pulled their scarves over their faces against the smell, a stomach-turning odor that wafts off tallow-rendering vats and suggests rotting meat. Over the last five years, with the market for flash-frozen buffalo meat booming in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and China, India had quietly become the world\u2019s largest meat exporter. The factories outside Meerut were expanding.\nFor this reason, about five years earlier, Geeta and her friends had been drawn into the labor force, supplementing their husbands\u2019 seasonal earnings as wedding-band musicians. Inside the boundary walls of the factories, they broke rocks into rubble and carried cement mix in shallow pans, balanced on the crowns of their heads, to stonemasons building interior walls. Some washed meat pans; some assembled cartons; some carried bricks.\nGeeta and Premwati found the work boring, and also terrifying. The women of their community live by rules: If an older man approaches, they cannot sit on any surface above the ground, so it is not unusual to see them suddenly slither down off cots and chairs. They are forbidden to have physical contact with men from outside the community, with the exception of physicians or bangle sellers.\nAt first they went to work with their stomachs knotted with fear that a strange man might grab their hand. At this prospect, even Geeta\u2019s nerve collapsed. Once, while carrying a load of mud at a factory that crushes bones for animal feed, she slipped and fell into a 10-foot trench, her leg buckling beneath her. But when the factory\u2019s clerk, a Muslim, reached a hand down to help her up, she jerked away, as if his touch would scald her.\nShe lay there in the mud, at the bottom of the ditch, until Premwati arrived to help her clamber out.\nAs the weeks passed, though, their fears ebbed. At the construction sites, they watched migrant workers from Nepal and Bangladesh, buyers who flew in from China, and the sons of the factory owners, roaring in and out in BMWs and Audis.\nAt night, returning home, they withdrew sweaty, folded bills from their blouses. A hollow-eyed woman named Pooja announced, with some surprise, that her husband and mother-in-law had stopped beating her. \u201cWhen you earn money,\u201d she said, \u201cyou are of some use to them.\u201d As for Geeta, it became clear to her that the men swarming around the factory grounds were not making sexual advances.\n\u201cWhen you start working, your heart opens up,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you\u2019re not scared anymore.\u201d\nAt this point, the women began to make changes to their appearance. Geeta took note when the other workers recoiled from her, and began to wash twice a day, with soap. She bought seven-foot lengths of cotton, the brighter the better, and paid tailors to stitch it into billowing pants.\nPremwati, whose husband spent most days stretched out drunk on his rope cot, felt, for the first time in years, that she was standing on solid ground. With her earnings she married off three children. One last son needed settling. Then she could exhale.\nGeeta\u2019s plans were wilder, more improbable. Though she had never been taught letters or numbers, she worked her cellphone constantly, using a system of vigorous trial and error. In the financial cooperative that the village women had formed, pooling their resources and extending loans, she proved to be an excellent, if frightening, debt-collector. She began making payments into a life insurance policy with such a generous payout that she sometimes daydreamed, a little wistfully, about her husband\u2019s untimely death.\nShe took advances on her salary, which were interest-free, rather than patronizing the local moneylenders.\nThen, last spring, she attracted attention by building a second house for herself, of rosy, freshly kilned brick, abutting the compound of Roshan, the village\u2019s most powerful man.\nWhen Roshan, the Nat chief in Peepli Khera, is ready to perform an exorcism, he starts out by asking a coy question: \u201cDo you want to see the real drama?\u201d\nThen he trembles. His eyes roll back, he arches his tongue against his teeth like the goddess Kali, who communicates to him through a string of wooden beads that he holds up to his ear, as if it were a cellphone. Nat families who are mistrustful of hospitals \u2014 that is, nearly all of them \u2014 come from miles away to see Roshan, who claims to be able to evict the jinns that have inhabited their bodies.\nAsked how many of his patients survive, he barks laughter. \u201cHow do I know that? If they survive, they survive.\u201d\nIn the half-light of evening, Roshan surveys the settlement, his chest thrown out. He has the high cheekbones of his nomadic ancestors, who made a living walking tightropes to entertain the Mughal courts. His lips are speckled and plump as cuts of liver. This is his dominion \u2014 about 40 miles northeast from Delhi as the crow flies, but far from the modern world.\nVillagers live in a few dozen houses arranged around a whitewashed temple. A plaque notes that the temple was built by Roshan\u2019s family, though no one needs to be reminded, and anyway, only two adults here know how to read. No one uses a surname or knows his or her age. One man, asked how old he thought he was, responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have any teeth left, and I am about to go.\u201d\nOn a recent morning, a woman named Usha, her leg shrunken from polio, held a 4-month-old baby who was suffering from vomiting and diarrhea. His limbs were wasted, and he looked up with the slow, narcotic gaze of a very old man. His vertebrae pressed sharply out of the parchment skin of his back. He was too weak to cry.\nThree of Usha\u2019s children had already died. The three who had survived infancy were sitting on the ground near her, eating dry toast from a plastic bag. One was so hungry that he grabbed a raw, half-peeled potato, speckled with rot, out of her hand, and bit into it. When a passing neighbor asked why they were so dirty, she grimaced.\n\u201cWe are poor people,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cWe were born in dirt, we live in dirt, we will die in dirt.\u201d\nRoshan\u2019s proudest moment occurred decades ago, when a police officer, sniffing for bribes, made the mistake of venturing into the square and grabbing his cousin by the neck. Roshan, then a young man, picked up an ax handle and hit the officer hard in the face. Since then, he likes to say, the police have not found occasion to come here. A boundary had been demarcated: This is a place beyond the reach of the state.\nWith the arrival of the factories, that boundary had begun to disappear. Roshan\u2019s village was being swallowed by an expanding city. He forbade the women in his own family to work at the factories, but watched with distaste as his neighbors left in the morning. He looked back with nostalgia at the time when the Nats supported themselves by begging.\n\u201cLife was much better 20 years back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a nice society. Now women are going out and meeting strange men.\u201d\nIn the spring of last year, after Geeta built her new house, Roshan\u2019s son Dharmender began observing her with special interest. He noted her new outfits, the way she came home \u201cwith the crease in her clothes still visible.\u201d He scanned her friends\u2019 faces for traces of makeup. He shared his suspicion that they worked at an air-conditioned site.\nTheir work, he said, had a whiff of immorality.\n\u201cThey have everything: Clothes to wear. Enough to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would they need to work? They still have husbands. It\u2019s not just insulting to them, it\u2019s insulting to the whole village.\u201d\nIt was difficult to say where the rumor started. It concerned Geeta\u2019s neighbor Pinki, who had fair skin and a little girl\u2019s high, fluting voice. She was married with one child and worked at one of the new construction sites, breaking rocks with a hammer. Some reported that Pinki had been seen riding on a strange man\u2019s motorcycle, others that a man from the construction site had shown up at her family home.\nIn May, Roshan vanished into the temple to present the matter to his most trusted authority: the goddess Kali. After a long conversation over the magic necklace, he emerged saying that the goddess had shared a piece of disturbing news. Women in the village, he said, were engaged in prostitution.\n\u201cIf Kali tells us this person is wrong,\u201d he said, \u201cthis person is wrong.\u201d\nRoshan wrapped his head in the stained turban that marked him as the chief, and for more than an hour, as the smell of heat and dung filled the square, the men of the village debated what to do. The problem, Roshan said, went beyond Pinki, to the general question of what went on when their women disappeared into the factories.\nHis younger brother was in full agreement: Female employment, he said, \u201chas spread like wildfire\u201d and was hurting the reputation of the village. A third elder, their cousin, observed that his own wife worked at a factory, adding 5,000 rupees a month to the 1,800 he earned in a wedding band, but that there was an important difference between these income flows. \u201cMy money,\u201d he said, \u201cis the money that is earned with respect.\u201d\nIt was decided: The village\u2019s women would stop working.\nGeeta gathered a war council on the floor of her house. They were a party of seven, including Premwati, Pinki and another neighbor, Rekha. Geeta\u2019s proposal was to ignore Roshan\u2019s ban. If their female neighbors were willing to quit their jobs, it was only out of fear. The fear would fade, maybe in a month, maybe in two. In the meantime, she told her friends, they had the full support of the Indian government.\nThe government she had in mind was a Muslim politician named Jahiruddin Mewati, who had served as chief of the village of Peepli Khera until a few years earlier, and who was running again in the fall.\nMr. Mewati\u2019s furred belly peeks out of the bottom of his dress shirt, and he has Tourette\u2019s syndrome, so he emits a stream of grunts and tics. In the middle of a conversation, he slammed his hand with great force on the table, exclaiming, \u201cI am on the side of the truth! I am not worried about votes! I am the true servant of the people, because injustice has been done!\u201d\nMr. Mewati\u2019s study of politics, especially the tactics of the British Raj, had persuaded him that there was much to be gained \u2014 specifically, votes \u2014 by inserting himself into local controversies. With all adult men and women counted, there are about 150 votes in the Nat community, nothing to sneeze at in a district where elections are won by a margin of 20 or 30. When Geeta appeared in his reception area, a collection of plastic chairs arranged under a tree, he smelled opportunity.\n\u201cNobody can stop them from going to work,\u201d he said staunchly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a Taliban here. It\u2019s a democracy.\u201d\nHeartened, the women decided they would simply leave for work in the morning. Except, when they did, their neighbors were standing there, telling them to stop.\n\u201cOn 18.05.2015 at 9:00 A.M. I was going for work,\u201d reads the report filed at the police station in Kharkhauda, signed with Pinki\u2019s thumbprint and written in the hand of their sponsor, Mr. Mewati.\n\u201cThese people started saying that we were told not to go to the factory, because bad things are happening at the factory. These people became angry and started abusing me and they threatened to kill me. I request you to lodge my report and take legal action.\u201d\nShe added, for good measure, \u201cthese people can beat me at any time.\u201d\nThe station officer, Manoj Kumar Singh, took her complaint with a grain of salt. He had seen versions of this drama playing out in other hamlets where young women were leaving for work. The old, patriarchal order was dying in rural India, dying slowly, and releasing toxic bursts as it did.\n\u201cThat may be the cause of this whole trouble, that they are losing control,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cThese old practices are going away.\u201d\nWhen word got out that the women had gone to the police, Roshan\u2019s son Dharmender was the one sent to tell them how they would be punished. He stood in the lane and yelled it over the wall, using the old phrase \u201cHookah-pani bandh,\u201d a sanction that dates back to medieval times, when sharing a water-pipe packed with tobacco was the prerogative of adult men in rural India. From this point forward all seven women would be outcasts \u2014 symbolically denied the hookah, as well as pani, water, from a shared pump.\nGeeta, Premwati and their friends tried to wrap their heads around it. As children they had heard of the rite of ostracism \u2014 it was used to frighten them into obedience \u2014 but they had never seen it imposed. At first they found ways to adjust, avoiding a confrontation with their neighbors by sticking to the lanes and handpumps that had been constructed with government money.\nA few days passed before the finger of the punishment touched them. Geeta\u2019s teenage niece greeted the girl next door and watched her glide by wordlessly, like a ghost. Rekha dialed the numbers of relatives, one after the other, and when she told them what had happened to her and spoke the phrase \u201chookah-pani,\u201d they hung up.\nThen a wedding was held at the home of a neighbor of Geeta\u2019s. There was a bus full of well-wishers, rice and dal for families who converged from a constellation of villages. The outcasts could hear the music from their homes.\nA delegation had come from Geeta\u2019s home village, and it included her mother, Anguri. Geeta remembered her tenderly massaging her legs before sending her away to be married. She thought she was around 10. She had seen her on rare occasions since then.\nGeeta offered her mother a glass of water. She refused. Geeta offered her tea. She refused. Geeta invited her in. She refused.\n\u201cI feared that if I drank it they would declare me an outcast,\u201d her mother said later. \u201cWe have no outcasts here. In our community, the elders are supreme.\u201d\nGeeta\u2019s mother began to weep, right there in the road. Then she turned her back and returned to the neighbor\u2019s house.\nGeeta liked to think of herself as hardened, but this took her by surprise. \u201cShe always loved me before this dispute,\u201d she said.\nUnwilling to cry in front of the neighbors, Geeta turned, walked into her own house, closed the door, and wept.\nDharmender was astounded that the seven women persisted in going to work. The rest of the village\u2019s women spent their days collecting firewood, and by mid-July, the piles had grown into towering, tangled masses that threatened to topple over. In the mornings, when Geeta and her friends left for the factories, men lined the roadway and jeered. \u201cAre you going to star in a pornographic movie?\u201d one of them called out.\nThe whole thing was strange, Dharmender said. The women had been offered a deal, allowing them back in the community if they confessed to \u201cimmoral acts\u201d and paid a fine, but they had refused it. Ostracism was such a severe punishment that dissenters usually relented within 24 hours, paying whatever fine the elders demanded. Geeta and her friends had already lived as outcasts for three months. \u201cWho,\u201d he wondered aloud, \u201cwould be willing to suffer so much?\u201d\nThe women, too, were in uncharted territory. Every two weeks, they made a trip to the magistrate\u2019s court in Meerut to renew a restraining order that the police had recommended, which would impose a 50,000-rupee fine on anyone who resorted to violence.\nTheir lawyer, Mohammed Yusuf Siddiqui, had rarely sat across his desk from such nervous clients. In his practice, it was not unusual to see state justice conflict with caste justice. One of his clients, who had appealed to court in order to obtain a divorce, had been assigned a punishment by his village council, to spit on the ground and then lick the spit.\nStill, there was something unusual about these women, who signed each document with a thumbprint. Mr. Siddiqui watched them curiously.\n\u201cThey know nothing about court procedure,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never ask me questions. They just say one thing: \u2018We are not wrong. We are not wrong. We are not wrong.\u2019\u201d\nPremwati, it turned out, had not fully reckoned how much she had to lose. Earlier in the year, she had managed to arrange a marriage for the second of her sons, a muscular teenager named Bhima. She had found a way to secure a bride without going deeper into debt, enrolling him in a mass wedding sponsored by the government to ease the financial burden on poor families.\nUnder the circumstances, Bhima was braced for disappointment, but the girl Premwati had found was, improbably, a beauty: her eyes large and luminous, brows arched like a film star. Bhima was boggled with love.\nBy late July, two months after Premwati was ostracized, that small victory had curdled. The girl, Puja, now an outcast by virtue of her marriage, was not allowed to attend her brother\u2019s wedding, and she was wild with anger, crouching on the ground and murmuring to herself. She glowered at Bhima if he so much as put his arm around her. In the evenings, he began to beat her, energetically enough that the neighbors heard.\nOne hot night, Puja\u2019s father swaggered into the family\u2019s courtyard, a flask of Besto whiskey and a toy revolver tucked into his waistband, and announced that he was going to take his daughter back to her home village. He lifted one foot and kicked a chunk out of the mud wall that marked the edge of Premwati\u2019s homestead.\n\u201cAll these problems are caused by one woman. I don\u2019t want to say her name right now,\u201d he said, and turned his bleary gaze to Premwati.\nJust like that, the young bride was gone. Puja dressed up on the morning of her departure, putting on the rhinestone-studded kitten-heeled sandals she had worn at her wedding. They kicked up a cloud of dust as she disappeared down the road.\nPremwati seemed deflated. The monsoon rains had brought down the wall of her hut in a lumpy mass, and when night fell, clouds of mosquitoes moved in. Now her son, withdrawn into a lovesick funk, blamed her for the breakup of his marriage. She looked exhausted. \u201cI have worked so hard,\u201d she said. \u201cBut still there is always trouble in the house.\u201d\nRoshan had followed the sequence of events with satisfaction. These women, he said, were trying to show that they could exist without the community. When he heard that the girl was gone, he smiled.\n\u201cSlowly, slowly, they will understand our power,\u201d he said.\nAround the hearths of the Nat women, the ones who had agreed to resign their jobs, pressure was building. They wanted to be loyal to the community elders but by September, stripped of the 200 rupees a day that had been supporting their families, they were running out of money.\nGeeta\u2019s neighbor, an imposing woman known as Big Suman, surveyed the homesteads one by one with the experienced eye of a general. She had disapproved of Geeta\u2019s rebellion, but she grumbled about having to give up her income. One morning, a moneylender stormed down the lane, bellowing, \u201cGive me my money or I will take your bicycle!\u201d\nOn one of her rounds, Big Suman spotted something peculiar: A widow with grown children was trudging back from the nearest town with a sack of flour balanced on her head. Big Suman did a double-take. She knew what begging looked like. This was an activity \u2014 \u201cspreading your hands before strangers\u201d \u2014 that the Nats were trying to leave behind.\nThe widow\u2019s story was what she expected. She had run out of flour two days earlier. The thought of going deeper into debt terrified her, so she did not want to approach Roshan, who would lend money but charge interest. She wept, and then she went to beg.\nThat morning, Big Suman decided the time had come to end it. She visited all the women who had resigned from the factories, stopping by at times when they would not be overheard by Roshan. They agreed that they would break into small groups, leaving when the men slept, and take their case to the one person who could clear the way for them to work again.\nWhen Mr. Mewati, the Muslim politician from down the road, saw the crowd of women enter his courtyard, he perked up. Local elections were two months away and he was feeling lively, like a bear coming out of hibernation. Several days later, at 7:30 one September morning, he bumped down the road in his decrepit Maruti Gypsy jeep, its suspension squeaking as it hit ruts in the road.\nHe moved with purpose. His shirt was clean and crisply ironed. He parked the Gypsy in front of Roshan\u2019s homestead, and a series of Mr. Mewati\u2019s male cousins unfolded themselves from the back seat, assuming positions in Roshan\u2019s yard. The two headmen sat down on a rope cot, exchanging compliments.\n\u201cI am with you with all my heart,\u201d Mr. Mewati said.\n\u201cI know you are,\u201d Roshan said.\n\u201cEven if I die, I will support you,\u201d Mr. Mewati said.\n\u201cI can die, but I cannot fight against you,\u201d Roshan said.\nMr. Mewati assembled the villagers and informed them that the Indian Constitution guaranteed equality under the law. Women could not be prevented from working, and Geeta and her friends should be forgiven. Then he withdrew 3,000 rupees in folded bills from his pocket, enough to cover the fine for Geeta\u2019s disobedience, and handed it to Roshan.\n\u201cTake care of this mess,\u201d he said.\nThe machinery of compromise cranked into motion. Roshan\u2019s brother sprinkled sugar on the ground outside the temple, reversing the rite of ostracism. Geeta and her friends lined up and their neighbors embraced them gingerly, barely grazing one another with their arms. Geeta gathered the women to celebrate, and a shoe dangled on a pole above her house, in an ancient symbol of contempt for her accusers.\nThe matter was unfinished. Some tension flickered in the night. Dharmender, livid at his father\u2019s lenience, grabbed Roshan by the shoulders and tried to shove him out of the town square.\n\u201cYour mind is not working,\u201d he said.\nIt was late at night, two nights later, that the police stationed at Kharkhauda received a report of violence from the village of Peepli Khera.\nThe officer on duty was Subinspector Ankit Chauhan, a babyfaced 28-year-old. Striding down the center lane into the settlement, heavy loops of khaki braid hanging from each shoulder, the subinspector noted that there were few men present, only a gaggle of women who had, he deduced, spent the last hours exchanging terms of abuse. He recalls examining \u201cscratches and bruises,\u201d nothing serious.\nFinally, because he saw the necessity for some kind of action, he detained a short, excitable man, one of several who had been named in a complaint from Geeta, a female resident of the village.\nHe then gathered the villagers and reminded them that it was necessary to embrace modern life. Subinspector Chauhan recorded this encounter as a constructive, civil one. Then, satisfied that he had performed his duty, he got back into his service vehicle and left the village.\nThose who remained could hear the familiar sound as the police car bumped away down the rutted dirt road. Chup chup chup chup chup.\nAt night, the settlement is engulfed in darkness, oceans of darkness.\nThe electricity flickers on for a few hours a night, creating pools of light from single bulbs suspended inside each house. Beyond that, for miles around, there are only crickets, stars and sugar cane fields.\nJackals, gray and ghostly, dart in and out of the croplands.\nWhen the sound of the police car had become faint enough, Dharmender and his brothers and his cousins and uncles came back out of the sugar cane field.\nPremwati watched them advancing across the village square, some two dozen men closing in. When bricks began to fly, she and her friends ducked inside a house and braced their bodies against the door. Seated on the floor by the light of a candle, Premwati could see the faces of her neighbors, some pressed up against the grill on a window: Those she loved, those in her family, those she had known since childhood.\n\u201cThey have put a black mark on us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will stay as long as we live together.\u201d\nPinki, whose 4-year-old daughter was trapped outside with the crowd, had begun to sob.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018By morning you will come out,\u2019\u201d Pinki recalled. \u201cThey said, \u2018We will sit here all night for you.\u2019\u201d\nKarim Khan, a Muslim neighbor, rushed over from his sundries shop when he heard about the melee, certainly more excitement than he had gotten from the Nat village in a long time.\n\u201cThose women peed their pants from fear and it was running out onto the floor,\u201d he chortled. \u201cThey peed their pants! All these men were standing outside and banging on their doors, abusing them. They knew if they fought again, they would be killed.\u201d\nInside the tiny house, Geeta\u2019s friends watched as she dialed the cellphone again and again that night. But the government was not available. Mr. Mewati remained in his compound, about a mile away. He claimed later that his phone\u2019s battery had died and he had been unable to receive calls.\nSubinspector Chauhan, for his part, was not in a hurry to return to this corner of his precinct twice in the same night. He found the reports of serious injury to be dubious. Where the Nats were concerned, he reasoned, injuries could be caused by any number of things.\n\u201cThese people are all drunkards,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are so drunk that even if you push one of those guys into a drain, he will fall down. These women try to exaggerate, they say, \u2018This person attacked us, that person attacked us.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Siddiqui, their defense lawyer, saw no need to report the incident to the magistrate who had issued the restraining order. Sometimes, he said, it is better to allow a community to settle its own differences rather than initiate a laborious investigation. Anyway, he added, the police are very busy.\n\u201cThis is a country with 1.4 billion people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police can\u2019t stand behind every single person.\u201d\nThe women were alone. When it became clear that Geeta\u2019s friends were securely barricaded, Dharmender gathered a few men and made his way to the other end of the village.\nCoursing through him, he explained later, was a certain kind of anger that he associated with being part of a mob. He had felt it before; it is gone after 15 minutes. But for that period, anger can make ordinary men strong enough to flip over a truck. Geeta had already called the police, and Dharmender saw no further reason to avoid violence.\nGeeta\u2019s husband, Sanjay, was in his undershirt at a neighbor\u2019s house, watching a television serial, the children asleep under mosquito nets. When he looked up he saw that the door was blocked by bodies. He recalls the sight of his niece, slumped beside a drain, crying, and a heavy blow to the back of his head, and then nothing.\nDharmender felt pity as he beat Geeta\u2019s husband: Sanjay was a poor boy, a decent boy. It was not his fault.\n\u201cIf he was a bad person, we would feel O.K. that he had gotten hurt. But he\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Dharmender said. But the beating was necessary, he said, with a heavy sigh. \u201cUntil someone gets hurt, people don\u2019t learn.\u201d\nThe crowd dispersed some time later, leaving Sanjay unconscious in a pool of blood, with a deep cut on his arm, a slit snaking across a cheekbone, and a red knot on his forehead. His neighbors recalled seeing him lying unconscious on a woodpile. The police, when they finally arrived, recommended that he be taken to the hospital.\nSanjay would spend five days in a hospital bed. He had always been a small and quiet man, but when he returned to the village, he was somehow smaller and quieter. He took to slipping in and out in the half-light, trying to avoid crossing paths with the men who had beaten him.\n\u201cAnyone who has beaten you in the night can do it again,\u201d he said.\nGeeta, too, had lost her swagger. When people asked about Sanjay, she told them that he had fallen off the roof. She denied that she had been trapped in the house with the other women. She was no longer eager to boast about her campaign against the village council.\n\u201cThey are powerful,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are stronger. They beat us up like dogs.\u201d\nOn the day Sanjay was discharged, Roshan was lounging with his male relatives on a rope cot outside the temple. The heat was soporific, and beside them, two buffaloes nosed through a pile of dung, quietly grunting.\nAll told, it had been an expensive night, Roshan said. To avoid criminal charges, he had had to pay 3,000 rupees for Sanjay\u2019s medical care and an additional 4,000 to ensure there would be no investigation. But it was worth it, they all agreed.\nEven Roshan\u2019s concession \u2014 allowing the women of the village to return to work in the factories \u2014 had turned out in his favor. Though the Nat women had headed out almost immediately, nearly all of the factories were now shuttered: China had closed its markets to Indian meat, and Brazil\u2019s currency had declined so sharply that its meat was now cheaper than Indian buffalo.\nSo that was that. No one was hiring.\nRoshan could not help preening a little. \u201cSee, in our community, a woman is a woman and a man is a man,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what it is here. Women have lower status and men have higher status.\u201d If any more women propose to challenge that principle, he said, \u201cwe will quietly, politely tell them this is not a good thing.\u201d\nAnd that night, as the sun slipped down over the sugar cane, Roshan and the others laughed and laughed."}, {"text": "Spare Times for Children Listings for Nov. 4-10\n2016-11-04T00:33:38.000Z\nA select guide to cultural events for children, teenagers and families.\n\u2018AMERICA TO ZANZIBAR: MUSLIM CULTURES NEAR AND FAR\u2019 (continuing) You have to look hard for positive representations of the Muslim world in popular culture, and even harder for a way to make it accessible to the youngest Americans.

That will be the mandate at this first family event of the season at Jazz at Lincoln Center, which will introduce Count Basie (1904-84) to young listeners. Born William James Basie, this towering bandleader was known for melding jazz and blues in a way that made swing a driving force in music. Wynton Marsalis will lead the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra in this narrated, interactive hourlong exploration of Basie\u2019s work; young fans and musicians are invited to take their instruments and arrive 45 minutes early for preconcert workshops. At 1 and 3 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jazz.org.\nFIRST SATURDAY FAMILY WORKSHOP: CELEBRATE DIWALI (Saturday) Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, honors something that\u2019s worth celebrating all year long: the triumph of good over evil. This program at the Staten Island Museum will teach about the holiday as it investigates the museum\u2019s latest exhibition, \u201cInfinite Compassion: Avalokiteshvara in Asian Art.\u201d (Avalokiteshvara is a prominent Buddhist deity.) After visiting the show, children will make art with Diwali themes. 1000 Richmond Terrace, Building A, Livingston, 718-727-1135, statenislandmuseum.org.\nFIRST SATURDAYS FOR FAMILIES: \u2018HEAP OF COSTUMES\u2019 (Saturday) Halloween may be over, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t still have a lot of fun dressing up. This free program, part of the First Saturdays series at the New Museum, will encourage children 4 to 12 to explore the ideas in the exhibition \u201cMy Barbarian: The Audience Is Always Right,\u201d in which the three artists known collectively as My Barbarian use performance to investigate social issues. Families are asked to bring clean discarded Halloween costumes, which will be piled on the show\u2019s floor. Young participants will choose unmatched pieces from the heap to assemble into new and unfamiliar characters; accessories will be provided. Then some dramatic fun begins. From 10 a.m. to noon, 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, 212-219-1222, newmuseum.org; space is limited, first come first served.\n\u2018FRANKENSTEIN\u2019 (Friday through Sunday) In this new musical, recommended for theatergoers 9 and older, a young explorer rescues a crazed and obsessive old man who turns out to be, yes, Victor Frankenstein. With a score by Michael Sgouros (played by a live chamber ensemble) and book and lyrics by Brenda Bell, this show from Be Bold Productions leads the audience through Frankenstein\u2019s memories of his dark experiment with human creation.

But it\u2019s been sweetened in this version by Nicolas Coppola, artistic director of Puppetworks. Based on the Brothers Grimm version and performed by marionettes, this adaptation stars a witch named Rosina Sweettooth, who\u2019s more silly then menacing. The production, which includes folk songs from Humperdinck\u2019s opera, gives Rosina her just deserts by transforming her into a dessert: a cookie. (Through Dec. 18.) At 12:30 and 2:30 p.m., Puppetworks, 338 Sixth Avenue, at Fourth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, 718-965-3391, puppetworks.org.\n\u2018I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE\u2019 (through Dec. 31) It will be a long time before young visitors to the Children\u2019s Museum of Manhattan can vote \u2014 and even longer before they can run for office. But they can practice doing both at this new interactive exhibition, timed to coincide with the height of the presidential campaign. The show offers numerous historical documents signed by presidents (and some by first ladies), as well as a reproduction of a voting booth and a child-size Oval Office desk at which those aspiring to future leadership can pretend to sign papers. They can also design their own presidential seals and campaign buttons.

Teenage performers from the Pied Piper Children\u2019s Theater will enact the story, which involves two couples and includes conspiracy, mistaken identity, a disrupted wedding, false accusations of infidelity and a faked death. And, of course, much ado about love. (Through Nov. 13.) Fridays at 7 p.m., Saturdays at 3 and 7 p.m., Sundays at 4 p.m., Holy Trinity Church, 20 Cumming Street, near Dyckman Street, Inwood, 212-544-2976, brownpapertickets.com/event/2641516; piedpipertheatre.com.\nPRESERVATION DETECTIVES: \u2018PRESIDENTS DON\u2019T HAVE TO EAT VEGETABLES\u2019 (Tuesday) Indeed they don\u2019t. And at this program, children can find out which one famously hated broccoli, along with other intriguing facts about past commanders in chief. Part of the Preservation Detectives series at the Museum at Eldridge Street, a restored 1887 synagogue where many immigrants worshiped, this Election Day event will keep visitors ages 4 through 10 entertained while school is out, and the older generation is voting. It will include a reading of Judith St. George\u2019s book \u201cSo You Want to Be President?,\u201d a workshop in making patriotic crafts and a chance for young people to cast presidential ballots of their own. From 1 to 2:30 p.m., 12 Eldridge Street, between Canal and Division Streets, Lower East Side, 212-219-0302, eldridgestreet.org/visit/family; reservations required.\n\u2018STINKYKIDS THE MUSICAL\u2019 (Saturday) Britt Menzies, author of the StinkyKids book series, based the stories\u2019 characters on her own children \u2014 not because they smelled bad but because, like a lot of little stinkers around the world, they tended to be mischievous. Vital Theater Company has revived Sammy Buck and Daniel S. Acquisto\u2019s musical adaptation, which closes on Saturday and centers on a wad of gum in the hair and a lot of other tangles. At 1 p.m., Theater at Blessed Sacrament, 152 West 71st Street, Manhattan, 212-579-0528, vitaltheatre.org.\n\u2018STONE SOUP\u2019 (Saturday and Sunday) In this old folk tale, a lot of cooks don\u2019t spoil the broth; they enrich it. Literally Alive Children\u2019s Theater has revived its version of the fable, which unfolds during the American Revolution, when a pair of hungry but wily soldiers persuade villagers to add ingredients to their odd but delectable recipe. The musical, by Michael Sgouros and Brenda Bell, is preceded by an hourlong arts workshop, in which children will help make quilts to be donated to Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals across the country. Continuing the theme of sharing, the production is also accepting donations of canned goods to be given to the charity City Harvest. (Through Nov. 13.) Saturday at 3 p.m.; Sunday at 11 a.m.; workshop one hour before curtain; Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, at Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, 212-352-3101, literallyalive.com/shows/stonesoup.html.\n\u2018THAT PHYSICS SHOW\u2019 (Saturday and Sunday) Dave Maiullo doesn\u2019t use cards, sleight of hand or magic wands to achieve startling effects onstage; he just relies on Newton\u2019s laws. Mr. Maiullo, for years a physics support specialist at Rutgers University, is the wizard behind this 90-minute Off Broadway show, which includes segments on motion, momentum, vacuum, friction, density and sound. Expect lots of liquid nitrogen \u2014 and lots of surprises. (The run is open-ended.)

This new 3-D Imax film at the American Museum of Natural History explores the frozen beauty of the Arctic and how both animal species and humans have adapted to its wilderness. Directed by David Lickley, the documentary includes interviews with scientists and Inuit leaders and examines how, as climate change accelerates, this region has become as fragile as it is fierce. Hourly, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (the 11:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. showings are not in 3-D), Central Park West and 79th Street, 212-769-5200, amnh.org.\nWORLD CULTURE FESTIVAL: EPIC STORIES  (Saturday) A world culture festival is a tall order, but every society on earth has something in common with every other society: They all tell tales. Hence the theme of this new family festival at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which will offer global narratives in the form of performances, art workshops and demonstrations. The highlights range from dance celebrations of Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Lights, to a presentation of Tom Stoppard\u2019s \u201cThe Fifteen Minute Hamlet.\u201d Attendees can also learn to write hieroglyphs like the Egyptians, weave like the makers of medieval tapestries and make pop-up books based on world myths.

Since he bought the business three years ago, its work force has grown to 40 from 15.\nBut those jobs will be in jeopardy if President-elect Donald J. Trump follows through on his combative promises to punish countries he deems guilty of unfair trade.\nMr. Trump secured the White House in part by vowing to bring manufacturing jobs back to American shores. The president-elect has fixed on China as a symbol of nefarious trade practices while threatening to slap 45 percent punitive tariffs on Chinese imports.\nBut many existing American manufacturing jobs depend heavily on access to a broad array of goods drawn from a global supply chain \u2014 fabrics, chemicals, electronics and other parts. Many of them come from China. At Mr. Reid\u2019s factory, imports account for roughly two-thirds of the cost of making a recliner chair.\nIn short, Mr. Trump\u2019s signature trade promise, one ostensibly aimed at protecting American jobs, may well deliver the reverse: It risks making successful American manufacturers more vulnerable by raising their costs. It would unleash havoc on the global supply chain, prompting some multinationals to leave the United States and shift manufacturing to countries where they can be assured of buying components at the lowest prices.\n\u201cIf you do this tomorrow, you would have a lot of disruption,\u201d said Susan Helper, an economist at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. \u201cThe stuff that China now makes and the way they make it, it\u2019s not trivial to replicate that.\u201d\nMr. Reid takes pride in using American products. His designers here in Michigan dreamed up his sleek recliner. Local hands construct the frames using American-made steel, then affix molded foam from a factory in nearby Grand Rapids. They staple upholstery to hunks of wood harvested by timber operations in Wisconsin. They do all this inside a former heating and cooling equipment factory that shut down a decade ago when the work shifted to Mexico.\nBut the fabric for Mr. Reid\u2019s seats arrives from China. So do the electronics in the \u201cmagic box\u201d that enables moviegoers to control the recliner. Ditto, the plastic cup holders and the bolts and screws that hold the parts together. The motor is the work of a German company that makes it in Hungary, almost certainly using electronics from China.\nTrade has contributed to economic growth, but changing dynamics have also prompted concerns about lost jobs and the trade deficit. But when something is manufactured in the United States, it is often made up of parts from around the world.\nMr. Reid estimates that a 45 percent tariff on Chinese wares would raise the costs of making a recliner here by 20 percent.\nTariffs would give his factory an edge against American competitors that import even more from China. But his company would be vulnerable to competitors in Mexico, Colombia and Australia. They would be free to draw on China\u2019s supply chain and sell their wares into the American market unhindered.\n\u201cOur chair would be priced out of the market,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cIf it impacts our sales, that puts jobs at risk.\u201d\nTrade experts dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs as campaign bluster that will soon give way to pragmatic concerns about growth and employment. Between 1998 and 2006, the imported share of components folded into American manufacturing rose to 34 percent from 24 percent, according to one widely cited study.\nInternational law also limits the scope of what the Trump administration can do. Under the rules of the World Trade Organization, the United States cannot willy-nilly apply tariffs. It must develop cases industry by industry, proving that China is damaging American rivals through unfair practices.\nTalk of across-the-board tariffs is \u201cpure theater,\u201d said Marc L. Busch, an expert on international trade policy at Georgetown University in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to do. It violates the rule of law.\u201d\nBut Mr. Trump has suggested taking the extraordinary step of abandoning the W.T.O. to gain authority to dictate terms. His successful strong-arming of Carrier, the air-conditioner company, which agreed to keep 1,000 jobs at a plant in Indiana rather than move them to Mexico, attests to his priorities in delivering on his trade promises.\nThe people advising Mr. Trump on trade have records of advocating a pugnacious response to what they portray as Chinese predations.\nThere is Dan DiMicco, the former chief executive of the American steel giant Nucor, who has long advocated punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. There is Peter Navarro, a senior policy adviser and co-author of a book titled \u201cDeath by China: Confronting the Dragon \u2014 A Global Call to Action.\u201d\nIn an email on Friday, Mr. Navarro, the Trump transition team\u2019s economic adviser, said that imposing steep tariffs on China was an essential step to begin to address the American trade deficit with China, which reached $365 billion last year. He blamed Chinese trade practices for \u201cdestroying entire industries, hollowing out entire communities\u201d and \u201cputting millions out of work.\u201d\nBut Mr. Navarro also cast the threat of tariffs as an opening gambit in a refashioning of trade positions.\n\u201cTariffs are not an end game but merely one of several negotiating tools to bring our trade back into balance,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Trump\u2019s administration would do so \u201cin a measured way.\u201d\nMr. Navarro\u2019s co-author, Greg Autry, a professor at the University of Southern California, said he assumed the Trump camp was dead serious about its threats to impose tariffs on China. The goal is to force manufacturers to come back to the United States as a condition of selling into the American market.\nA full-on trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies would cost American jobs in the immediate term, Mr. Autry said, but eventually millions of new ones would be created as the United States again hummed with factory work.\n\u201cWe moved our supply chain to Asia in about two decades,\u201d he said. \u201cYou certainly can do it in the U.S. a whole lot faster. It\u2019s going to take a few years, but it\u2019s going to be a much better America.\u201d\nEven if factory work does return to the United States, though, that is unlikely to translate into many paychecks. As automation spreads, robots are primed to secure most of the jobs.\nAt Mr. Reid\u2019s factory, talk of a bountiful future through trade barriers resonates as dangerous nonsense. Mr. Reid has a business to run in the here and now. His customers are waiting for product. He must be able to tap the supply chain.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just turn your ship around and bring that stuff back,\u201d he said.\nIn threatening tariffs, Mr. Trump is wielding a blunt instrument whose impacts are increasingly easy to evade by sophisticated businesses with operations across multiple borders. The geography of global trade is perpetually being redrawn.\nIn China, factory owners, casting a wary eye on Mr. Trump, are accelerating their exploration of alternative locales with lower-wage workers across Southeast Asia and even as far away as Africa.\nIn Vietnam, entrepreneurs are preparing for a potential surge of incoming investment from China should Mr. Trump take action.\nIn Europe, factories that sell manufacturing equipment to China are watching to see if Mr. Trump will unleash trade hostilities that will damage global growth.\n\u201cMoney and goods will always find their way, regardless of what barriers you put up,\u201d said Ernesto Maurer, chairman of SSM, a Swiss maker of textile machinery that operates a factory in China. \u201cYou just make it more difficult and more expensive.\u201d\nIn the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, Jiang Jiacheng exudes confidence that China will continue to serve as the factory floor for the world \u2014 with tariffs or otherwise.\nHis company, the Guangzhou Shuqee Digital Tech Company, makes movie chairs, exporting about 20 percent of its wares to the United States. It is an exemplar both of China\u2019s manufacturing prowess and of the conditions that make it a competitive threat.\nMr. Jiang pays his factory workers $290 a month. They work six days a week. Lax environmental rules allow him to dispose of pollutants cheaply.\nThe total cost of making one of his best-selling products, a cloth-lined movie chair, runs $72. He sells it for $116 to wholesalers who export to the United States.\nBack in September, Mr. Jiang gathered with other Chinese movie chair manufacturers to discuss the alarming statements coming from Mr. Trump. The consensus view was not to worry.\n\u201cOnce he takes up the post, he will certainly return things to the normal state,\u201d Mr. Jiang said.\nStill, he has a backup plan. Even before President Trump entered the lexicon, Mr. Jiang was exploring a transfer of some of his work to lower-cost places like Vietnam.\nHis company would not be the first to make the journey.\nA dozen years ago, the United States Commerce Department accused China of dumping wooden bedroom furniture at below cost. It imposed protective tariffs.\nFor Lawrence M. D. Yen, who had a furniture factory in southern China, that was the impetus to move to Vietnam. Labor costs were cheaper.\nToday, Mr. Yen\u2019s company, Woodworth Wooden Industries, operates a factory in Cu Chi, on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, a district best known for the elaborate tunnels used by Vietcong guerrillas in their battles against American forces.\nThis former hive of combat is now the workplace for 5,000 people making sofa beds, recliner chairs and bedroom furniture. Three-fourths of the products are destined for the United States, including Las Vegas casino resorts like Mandalay Bay and the MGM Grand.\nWoodworth\u2019s plant churns out more than 10,000 three-seater sofas each month. This year, the company opened a second Vietnam factory.\nArithmetic gives Mr. Yen confidence that Mr. Trump\u2019s talk will be muted by the realities of the marketplace. Brands that deliver factory-made goods to American retailers have leaned heavily on Asian suppliers to secure low prices.\nIn pledging to bring manufacturing back, Mr. Trump is effectively pitting the interests of a relatively small group of people \u2014 those who work in factories \u2014 against hundreds of millions of consumers.\n\u201cThe retail industry now employs an awful lot more people than apparel industries ever did,\u201d said Pietra Rivoli, a trade expert at Georgetown.\nSeven years ago, the Obama administration accused China of unfairly subsidizing tires. It imposed tariffs reaching 35 percent. A subsequent analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank, calculated the effect: Some 1,200 American tire-making jobs were preserved, but American consumers paid $1.1 billion extra for tires. That prompted households to cut spending at retailers, resulting in more than 2,500 net jobs lost.\nThe TAL Group claims to make one of every six dress shirts sold in the United States. It produces finished goods for Brooks Brothers, Banana Republic and J. Crew, operating 11 factories worldwide. If Mr. Trump places tariffs on China, the company will accelerate its shift to Vietnam, said TAL\u2019s chief executive, Roger Lee.\nIf that trade is disrupted, the work would flow to other low-cost countries like Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. Mr. Lee can envision no situation in which the physically taxing, monotonous work of making garments will go to the United States.\n\u201cWhere are you going to find the work force in the U.S. that is willing to work at factories?\u201d Mr. Lee said.\nHorgen, a Swiss village on the shores of Lake Zurich, seems far removed from the gritty industrial zones of Asia. With its gingerbread homes and mountain views, it looks more like a resort.\nBut Horgen is home to SSM, a company that has become an important supplier to Asia. Its machines turn polyester and other synthetic fibers into custom-designed threads. If the rise of textiles in Asia has been a gold rush, this Swiss company has been among those cashing in by making the picks and shovels.\nWorkers at the factory earn roughly 6,000 Swiss francs ($5,940) a month \u2014 some 10 times what SSM pays its workers at its Chinese factory. It makes its most sophisticated components in Switzerland and at another plant in Italy. It uses China for lower-grade machines.\nThe company sells virtually all of its products abroad, chiefly in Asia. It buys metal parts from the Czech Republic and Poland, electronic components from Malaysia, and electric motors from an American company that makes them at a factory in India. Another American company supplies software.\n\u201cThere is not a single machine that we have that we are able to build with materials from one country,\u201d said Mr. Maurer, the SSM chairman.\nIf the United States were to impose trade barriers on China, that might slow Chinese demand for Swiss-made textile machinery. That would potentially reduce Swiss purchases of American goods and services.\nBut Mr. Maurer struggles to see how this would create any jobs in the United States. The American textile industry is small and increasingly dominated by robots. The rest of the world holds billions of hands willing to work cheaply.\n\u201cSomeone else will pick up the business,\u201d Mr. Maurer said. \u201cThese markets are very fast.\u201d\nBut the textile and apparel trades are relatively simple businesses. If the cost of making trousers becomes less appealing in China, a room full of sewing machines in Cambodia can quickly be filled with low-wage seamstresses.\nIndustries involving precision machinery are not so easily reassembled somewhere else. An abrupt change to the economics would devastate factories that could not quickly line up alternative suppliers.\nAmerican automakers are especially dependent on the global supply chain. Between 2000 and 2011, the percentage of imported components that went into exported American-made vehicles grew to 35 percent, from 24 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nAt EBW Electronics in Holland, Mich., workers in lab coats tend boxy soldering machines as they make circuitry for LED lights that go into cars. It buys tiny parts and slots them into circuit boards, which are sold to major automakers. Some 80 percent of the components are imported from China.\nEven that number fails to capture the degree to which the company \u2014 and its 240 workers \u2014 depend on unfettered trade.\nPat LeBlanc, the chairman, pointed to a nib of metal on a circuit board. The silicon was extracted at a plant in Minnesota, then processed into a thin wafer at another factory in Massachusetts. The wafer was shipped to China for testing, cut into pieces at another Chinese factory, and then delivered to the Philippines for a chemical process. Then it went back to China to be put onto a reel that can be inserted into soldering machines here in Michigan.\n\u201cIt literally is a global supply chain,\u201d Mr. LeBlanc said.\nMr. Reid, the owner of the theater seating company, could not imagine having to buy everything from American suppliers.\nBuying upholstery domestically would raise his fabric costs as much as 40 percent.\n\u201cAll the componentry, all the cords, it all comes from China,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you could ever get all of that made in the United States. Some of these industries have just been abandoned.\u201d\nHe wandered into the paint shop, where a worker was spraying chair backs. He picked up a can of paint and read the label: \u201cMade in the U.S.A., with Global Materials.\u201d"}, {"text": "The Human Toll of Terror\n2016-07-27T03:37:59.000Z\n"}, {"text": "Transcript of the Republican Presidential Debate in Florida\n2016-03-11T05:28:59.000Z\nFollowing is a transcript of the Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.\nTAPPER: Live from the Bank United Center on the campus of the University of Miami, this is the CNN Republican Presidential debate.

If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz?\nCRUZ: Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West. He was 18. He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth. This election, this debate is not about insults. It\u2019s not about attacks. It\u2019s not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It\u2019s about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they\u2019re voting. They\u2019re voting out of enthusiasm. They\u2019re voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before \u2014 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old \u2014 never voted before. We\u2019re taking people from the Democrat Party. We\u2019re taking people as independents, and they\u2019re all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It\u2019s very exciting. I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we\u2019re going to beat them soundly. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Thank you. Thank you. Let\u2019s begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election. There have been some real differences expressed in \u2014 on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s, the front runner\u2019s, signature issues is ending what he calls \u201cdisastrous trade deals\u201d in order to bring jobs back to America. Governor Kasich, I\u2019d like to start with you. You\u2019ve been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years. Critics say these deals are great for corporate America\u2019s bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs. How do you respond to the criticism that you\u2019ve been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?\nKASICH: Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we\u2019re sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it. But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I\u2019ve been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don\u2019t turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, \u201cOh, America was right,\u201d and people are out of work. The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker. But we don\u2019t want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don\u2019t want to see that happen. Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they\u2019re a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up. And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. I understand their plight. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you\u2019ve brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico. Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses? TRUMP: Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I\u2019m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We\u2019re allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries \u2014 the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it\u2019s very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete. So I will take advantage of it; they\u2019re the laws. But I\u2019m the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you\u2019re, quote, \u201cgenerally very much in favor of free trade.\u201d More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?\nRUBIO: No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We\u2019re 5 percent of the world\u2019s population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things. The problem is we\u2019re a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can\u2019t export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world. There are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It\u2019s allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it\u2019s created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia. On the other hand, you\u2019ve seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position. Why should these voters who don\u2019t like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?\nCRUZ: Actually that\u2019s incorrect. There are two different agreements. There\u2019s TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we\u2019re getting killed in international trade right now. And we\u2019re getting killed because we have an administration that\u2019s doesn\u2019t look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We\u2019re driving jobs overseas. And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I\u2019ll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well. And you\u2019ve got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is, what\u2019s the solution? It\u2019s easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things. Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I\u2019ve introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Let\u2019s talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers. Let\u2019s go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen.\nDINAN: Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers. Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements. You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. Doesn\u2019t this program take jobs away from Americans?\nRUBIO: If it\u2019s being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program, you have to prove not only that you\u2019re not replacing Americans, but that you\u2019ve tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again. The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don\u2019t understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire \u2014 Disney or some other company hires this company. What they\u2019re basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they\u2019re employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it. It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.\nDINAN: Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this. (APPLAUSE) You\u2019ve \u2014 in the \u2014 in the context of illegal immigration, you\u2019ve called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured.RUBIO: Correct.\nDINAN: Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you\u2019ve talked about are solved.\nRUBIO: Well first, I think \u2014 well, I\u2019d be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don\u2019t think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American. If there\u2019s an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that\u2019s in violation of the law. And what I\u2019m explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not \u2014 what they are doing is they are eliminating the job. They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn\u2019t replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they\u2019re hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It\u2019s a loophole they\u2019ve figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way. (APPLAUSE)\nDINAN: Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next. Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, \u201clower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers\u201d. He\u2019s calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. Wouldn\u2019t that help workers in the U.S.?\nKAISCH: Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn\u2019t be standing here. I\u2019d be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn\u2019t have immigration. Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can\u2019t have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we \u2014 I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration. I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can\u2019t continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home. And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they\u2019ve been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days. But let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget. We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we\u2019ll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I\u2019ve used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I\u2019ve been governor\nDINAN: Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you. Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like.\nTRUMP: I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it\u2019s something that I frankly use and I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use it. We shouldn\u2019t have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it\u2019s very important to say, well, I\u2019m a businessman and I have to do what I have to do. When it\u2019s sitting there waiting for you, but it\u2019s very bad. It\u2019s very bad for business in terms of \u2014 and it\u2019s very bad for our workers and it\u2019s unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read. And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he\u2019s the only one that\u2019s going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what\u2019s going on. We have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we\u2019re rushing into things, and we\u2019re just \u2014 we\u2019re leading with the chin. (BELL RINGS) We\u2019re leading with people that don\u2019t know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I\u2019d say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.\nDINAN: Senator Cruz, I want to bring you in very quickly on this. (APPLAUSE)\nDINAN: The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers. What should the right level be?\nCRUZ: Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we\u2019re bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn\u2019t working. And then on top of that, we\u2019ve got a system that\u2019s allowing in millions of people to be here illegally. And the answer to that, I\u2019ve laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We\u2019re going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We\u2019re going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we\u2019re going to do that. We\u2019re going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws. (APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: We\u2019re going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know how to do it. It\u2019s that we\u2019re lacking the political will. Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this. The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.\nCRUZ: We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country. We need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country. (APPLAUSE)\nThe New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio, did you want to weigh in?\nRUBIO: Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren\u2019t actually workers at all. They are just coming in primarily based on family connection. And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system. The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don\u2019t have skills. When my parents came, they had a very limited education. My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. And I\u2019m grateful every day that America welcomed them. But today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don\u2019t have skills is very difficult. We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards. The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have? What business are you going to open? What investment are you going to make? What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States? (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy. The United States has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world. American students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading. Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster. What are your specific objections to Common Core?\nTRUMP: Education through Washington, D.C. I don\u2019t want that. I want local education. I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great. And it was very interesting, I was with Dr. Ben Carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is... (APPLAUSE)\nTRUMP: We were talking. We spoke for over an hour on education. And he has such a great handle on it. He wants competitive schools. He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy. But charter schools work and they work very well. So there are a lot of things. But I\u2019m going to have Ben very involved with education, something that\u2019s an expertise of his.\nTAPPER: OK. But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards. So when you say \u201ceducation by Washington, D.C.,\u201d what do you mean?\nTRUMP: You\u2019re right, Jake. But it has been taken over by the federal government. It was originally supposed to be that way. And certainly sounds better that way. But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what\u2019s happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases. Now in some cases they would be. But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, you have called opposition to Common Core hysteria. What is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you?\nKASICH: Well, look, all I\u2019m in favor of in Ohio is high standards. First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states. OK, I\u2019ve been working on this for many, many years. Secondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards. And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately. They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum. Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state. Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids? We need to start connecting them to the real world. We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago. We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs. Frankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be. So let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards. That\u2019s what it is in the state of Ohio. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: So, Senator Cruz, let me bring you in. You object to Common Core. Governor Kasich says it\u2019s local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards. What\u2019s wrong with that?\nCRUZ: Common Core is a disaster. And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day. (APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it\u2019s easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core. Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that. (APPLAUSE) Beyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments. And let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships. And give every child \u2014 African American, Hispanic \u2014 every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Let\u2019s move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida. Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country. There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they\u2019re very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations. Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.\nBASH: Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable. For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans. So, what should the new retirement age be? And how much will those benefits be cut?\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say that you\u2019re right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare. One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. I\u2019m against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother. And we don\u2019t have to make any changes for them. But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,\u201d they\u2019re not being honest with you. Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents. For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I\u2019m supposed to retire, I\u2019d have to retire at 68. If I were still in the Senate, I\u2019d be one of the youngest people there. (LAUGHTER) If I\u2019ve made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better. Medicare Advantage does that now. These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire. (APPLAUSE)\nBASH: Senator, the question was specific though. You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?\nRUBIO: Well, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t answer that part. So the thing is that my \u2014 my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time. But again I\u2019m talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We\u2019re years away from retirement. For people that are on it now, we don\u2019t have to change it at all. If we don\u2019t do anything, we will have a debt crisis. It\u2019s not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt. That\u2019s \u2014 all of it will be eaten up by that. That\u2019s a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis. (APPLAUSE)\nBASH: Mr. Trump, you don\u2019t want to raise the retirement age, and you also don\u2019t want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans. But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I\u2019ve watched them very intensely, even though it\u2019s a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They\u2019re leaving it the way it is. In fact, they want to increase it. They want to actually give more. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re up against. And whether we like it or not, that is what we\u2019re up against. I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant. TRUMP: And it\u2019s my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is. You have 22 years, you have a long time to go. It\u2019s not long in terms of what we\u2019re talking about, but it\u2019s still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP... I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody\u2019s ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a national tragedy. We\u2019re at zero, we\u2019re not doing anything. We\u2019ve lost our jobs. We\u2019ve lost everything. We\u2019re losing everything. Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We\u2019re going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business. (APPLAUSE)\nBASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump. You\u2019re talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you\u2019re talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent. So how would you find that other $147 million?\nTRUMP: Because they don\u2019t cover most of the subjects. We\u2019re the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We\u2019re going to have a stronger military, much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take \u2014 every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing. We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea. We have so many places. Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. We are going to be in a different world. We\u2019re going to negotiate real deals now, and we\u2019re going to bring the wealth back to our country. We owe $19 trillion. We\u2019re going to bring wealth back to our country. (APPLAUSE)\nBASH: Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security?\nRUBIO: No. And I \u2014 and I think you\u2019ve outlined why. The numbers don\u2019t add up. You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we\u2019re going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that\u2019s the end of your campaign. In Florida, you can\u2019t talk about that, but people know that it\u2019s the truth here in Florida. Fraud is not enough. Certainly, let\u2019s wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won\u2019t add up. You already gave those numbers. The second point is on foreign aid. I hear that all the time as well. I\u2019m against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it\u2019s less than 1 percent of our federal budget. The numbers don\u2019t add up. The bottom line is we can\u2019t just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I\u2019m going to get at fraud and abuse. Let\u2019s get rid of fraud, let\u2019s get rid of abuse, let\u2019s be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you\u2019re going to have to make up. And here\u2019s the thing. If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis. Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare. Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it. It is one of the major issues confronting America. It\u2019s barely been asked in any of these debates. And we\u2019d better deal with or we\u2019re going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster. (APPLAUSE)\nBASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio says your numbers don\u2019t add up. What\u2019s your response? Senator Rubio says that your numbers don\u2019t add up. What\u2019s your response, Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: Well, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s saying that. Look, I\u2019m just saying very simply we have a country that I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I\u2019ve been going over budgets and looking at budgets. We don\u2019t bid things out. We don\u2019t bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry. They don\u2019t go out to bid. They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store. That\u2019s what they\u2019re paying. And the reason is they have a fantastic lobby. They take care of all of the senators, the Congressmen. They have great power and they don\u2019t bid out. The military is never properly bid. When we go out to military bids, it\u2019s not properly bid. And the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don\u2019t want, only because that particular company has political juice, OK? I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. Nobody is going to be taking care of me. I don\u2019t want anybody\u2019s money. I will tell you something. We\u2019re going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government. We\u2019re going to save a fortune. (APPLAUSE)\nBASH: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz, you advocate allowing younger workers to put some of their Social Security taxes into personal accounts. What do you say to critics who say that market volatility means that this is a disastrous proposal?\nCRUZ: Well, number one, we need to see responsibility. Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it\u2019s irresponsible. And any politician that doesn\u2019t step forward and address it is not being a real leader. We need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security. (APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: And as president, what I will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever. Every benefit will be protected to the letter. But for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids. (APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: And one of the things that is critically important. Listen, we\u2019ve got lots of challenges in the world. But the answer can\u2019t just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away. You have to understand the problems. You have to have real solutions. It\u2019s like government spending. It is very easy. Hillary Clinton says she\u2019ll cut waste, fraud and abuse. If only we had smarter people in Washington, that would fix the problem. You know what? That is the statement of a liberal who doesn\u2019t understand government is the problem. (APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: Here\u2019s my philosophy. The less government, the more freedom. The fewer bureaucrats, the more prosperity. And there are bureaucrats in... (BELL RINGS) ... Washington right now who are killing jobs and I\u2019ll tell you, I know who they are. I will find them and I will fire them.\nBASH: Did you justice just compare Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton on this issue?\nCRUZ: I will let Donald speak for himself. But I will say, there\u2019s a reason, in my campaign I\u2019ve laid out a very, very specific spend and cut plan, $500 billion. I\u2019ve specified five major agencies that I would eliminate, 25 programs. And Dana, you know why political candidates don\u2019t do that? Because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you. When you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked. Let\u2019s talk for example back in Iowa the first primary. When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide. You can\u2019t take on ethanol in Iowa. And my opponents on this stage not only didn\u2019t do the same. They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare. (BELL RINGS) If we\u2019re going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you\u2019ve got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs I\u2019ll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer. (APPLAUSE)\nBASH: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump, would you like to respond?\nTRUMP: Yes. If you look back to Iowa, Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit. He did and \u2014 at the end. Not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well. And you know, I think everybody knows that. It was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change.\nBASH: Senator Cruz?\nCRUZ: Listen, if you are fed up with Washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington? It\u2019s easy to have language, I\u2019m fed up with the corruption in Washington. But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment, it\u2019s very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington. When I stood up and led the fight against Obamacare, Washington was furious and attacked me, but I did it because I was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare. (APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: When I led the fight against amnesty, it\u2019s because I was standing with the people... (BELL RINGS) ... against Washington. And if you want to tell people you\u2019re going to stand against Washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington?\nBASH: OK. Mr. Trump, I\u2019ll let you respond because he mentioned you but then I\u2019m going to move to Governor Kasich. Go ahead.\nTRUMP: Well, that\u2019s fine. First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty. So there\u2019s no question about that. And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there\u2019s nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe. And Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected Senator in Washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me. And there\u2019s nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions. I would say this. We\u2019re all in this together. We\u2019re going to come up with solutions. We\u2019re going to find the answers to things. And so far I cannot believe how civil it\u2019s been up here. (APPLAUSE)\nBASH: Governor Kasich, let\u2019s get back to Social Security. You told a voter in New Hampshire to quote, \u201cGet over cuts to Social Security benefits\u201d because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there. Why is cutting Social Security payments the solution?\nKASICH: Well, first of all, we hear about taking on Washington. I took on Washington and I won. I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress, the chairman of the budget committee. We paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt. We also balanced the budget four years in a row. And we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then. I also had a plan in 1999 to save Social Security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have Social Security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. Now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous.KASICH: I have a plan to fix it that doesn\u2019t even require raising the retirement age. If you\u2019ve had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you\u2019ll still get it. It will just simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they\u2019ll get their full benefit. That\u2019s the way it will work. And we don\u2019t have to monkey around with the retirement age. And how do I know that? I\u2019ve done all this before. This is not a theory. Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? Yes. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to cut them. It means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st Century. So not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington, but when I went to Ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we\u2019re $2 billion in the black. Our credit is strong. We\u2019re up 400,000 jobs. And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again. And I will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor. Let\u2019s take a broader look at the Republican Party now. Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition. How are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader? What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016?\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, I don\u2019t really think that. I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people. We are more inclusive. And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it\u2019s, again, the biggest story. You look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening. I am different in one primary respect, and that\u2019s trade. I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals. The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs. You look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed. So that\u2019s that. But I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country. The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don\u2019t do it because we don\u2019t play the game. and the only way we\u2019re going to be able to do it is we\u2019re going to have to do taxes unless they behave. If you don\u2019t tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we\u2019re going to continue to lose businesses and we\u2019re going to continue to lose jobs. And if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up. It has gone down. And I think that\u2019s why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I\u2019m saying.\nTAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz... (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: ... Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote. Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party. What do you think is wrong with that vision?\nCRUZ: Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade. He\u2019s right about the problems. But his solutions don\u2019t work. So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods. Now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019ll be tonight. But I\u2019ll tell you what happens. You know, we\u2019ve seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression. And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent. But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs. A much better solution that works is the tax plan I\u2019ve laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs. Fix the problem and that\u2019s what\u2019s missing from what Donald says. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump, we\u2019ll give you a chance to respond.\nTRUMP: The 45 percent tax is a threat. It was not a tax, it was a threat. It will be a tax if they don\u2019t behave. Take China as an example. I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China. They can\u2019t. China won\u2019t let them. We talk about free trade. It\u2019s not tree free trade, it\u2019s stupid trade. China dumps everything that they have over here. No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews (ph), no anything. We can\u2019t get into China. I have the best people, manufacturers, they can\u2019t get in. When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax. The 45 percent is a threat that if they don\u2019t behave, if they don\u2019t follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn\u2019t have to be 45, it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.(APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz?\nCRUZ: Jake, let me be clear what Donald just said. He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat. And mind you, you are paying the tax. It\u2019s not China that pays the tax. It\u2019s you, the working men and women. So ask yourself at home: How is this helping you? If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can\u2019t pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to jack \u2014 I\u2019m going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing.\u201d That hurts you. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem. Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America.\nTAPPER: OK.\nTRUMP: Jake, I have to say \u2014 honestly, it\u2019s just the opposite. What will happen if they don\u2019t behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants. Instead of in China, we\u2019ll build them here. And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we\u2019re being ripped off. And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now. So we\u2019ll build our factories here and we\u2019ll make our own products. And that\u2019s the way it should be done. And the way we\u2019ve been doing it for the last long period of time is our country \u2014 our country is in serious, serious trouble. It\u2019s a bubble and it\u2019s going to explode, believe me.\nTAPPER: All right. We\u2019re going to take a very quick break. When we come back, we\u2019ll have much more of this Republican presidential debate from the University of Miami right after this. Stay with us.(APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nTAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida. Mr. Trump, let me start with you. Last night, you told CNN quote, \u201cIslam hates us?\u201d Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims.\nTRUMP: I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them.\nDINAN: Do you want to clarify the comment at all?\nTRUMP: Well, you know, I\u2019ve been watching the debate today. And they\u2019re talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam. But I will tell you this. There\u2019s something going on that maybe you don\u2019t know about, maybe a lot of other people don\u2019t know about, but there\u2019s tremendous hatred. And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper. (APPLAUSE)\nDINAN: Senator Rubio, your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, said in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s comment last night, I\u2019m sorry \u2014 Senator Jeff Flake, I apologize. Your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment, Republicans are better than this. Do you agree?\nRUBIO: Well, let me say, I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say. The problem is, presidents can\u2019t just say anything they want. It has consequences, here and around the world. (APPLAUSE)\nRUBIO: And so let me give you one. Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh. It\u2019s a very tough place to be a missionary. It\u2019s Muslim. And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them. And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well. And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn\u2019t like Muslims. So this is a real impact. There\u2019s no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world. I can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you\u2019re going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world you\u2019re going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims. (APPLAUSE)\nRUBIO: And they love America. And as far as I know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military. Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America. No matter what their religious background may be.\nDINAN: Mr. Trump? (APPLAUSE)\nTRUMP: Marco talks about consequences. Well, we\u2019ve had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and could have been the White House. There have been a lot of problems. Now you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want. I don\u2019t want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems. We have a serious, serious problem of hate. (APPLAUSE)\nTRUMP: There is tremendous hate. There is tremendous hate. Where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means. Let me go a step further. Women are treated horribly. You know that. You do know that. Women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad. (BELL RINGS) Now I will say this, there is tremendous hatred. The question was asked, what do you think? I said, there is hatred. Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently. And everybody would say, oh, isn\u2019t that wonderful.\nDINAN: Mr. Trump, thank you.\nTRUMP: We better solve the problem before it\u2019s too late.\nDINAN: Senator Rubio? (APPLAUSE)\nRUBIO: Well, here we go. See, I\u2019m not interested in being politically correct. I\u2019m not interested in being politically correct. I\u2019m interested in being correct. (APPLAUSE)\ntranscript\nTK\nRUBIO: And in order to be correct on this issue, here\u2019s the bottom line. We do work. There is \u2014 Islam has a major problem on its hands. It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized. And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people. There is no doubt about that. It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other \u2014 with Muslims, who do not \u2014 who are not radicals. We\u2019re going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom. We\u2019re going to have to work with the Saudis. We\u2019re going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms. We\u2019re going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS.(BELL RING)\nRUBIO: It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them. And so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct. We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization.\nTAPPER: Thank you, Senator. (APPLAUSE) Governor Kasich, do you think Islam hates us?\nKASICH: No, I don\u2019t. I think there is a sect of, you know, this radical Islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today. There isn\u2019t any question. And that\u2019s why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don\u2019t have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction. But look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. The fact is that if we\u2019re going to defeat ISIS, we\u2019re going to have to have these countries. And they are Egypt. And they are Saudi Arabia. And they are Jordan. And they are the Gulf states. And we\u2019re going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey. And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe. The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just \u2014 they can\u2019t believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith. Look, the people who represent radical Islam, they want to destroy everything that we\u2019re about and other Muslims who don\u2019t share their view. But at the end of the day, we\u2019ve got to bring the world together, the civilized world. And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody.\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich. Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about something else you\u2019ve said during the course of this campaign. You said that the U.S. has to, quote, \u201ctake out\u201d the families of terrorists. When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions, you said, quote, \u201cSo they can kill us, but we can\u2019t kill them?\u201d It is against federal, military and international law to target civilians. So how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists, while also abiding by the law?\nTRUMP: Let me go back to the other just for a second. In large mosques, all over the Middle East, you have people chanting \u201cdeath to the USA.\u201d Now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me. As far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law \u2014 this all started with your question on water boarding. We have a law that doesn\u2019t allow right now water boarding. They have no laws. They have no rules. They have no regulations. They chop off heads. They drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead. And we\u2019re working on a different set of parameters. Now, we have to obey the laws. Have to obey the laws. But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad. We better expand our laws or we\u2019re being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us. They are laughing at us, believe me. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio, would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists?\nRUBIO: No, of course not. And we don\u2019t have to in order to defeat terrorists. The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward. It\u2019s difficult to do, but it has to be done. When I\u2019m president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung. They\u2019re going to be expanded. And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists. And then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because \u2014 because Barack Obama is gutting our military. He\u2019s going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II, and the smallest Navy in a century, and the smallest Air Force we\u2019ve ever had. We are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them. And if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they\u2019re not going to have the right to remain silent. And they\u2019re not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan. They\u2019re going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we\u2019ll do so legally. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz, you\u2019ve talked about changing the rules of engagement in battle against ISIS. Would that include targeting the families of suspected terrorists?\nCRUZ: No, of course not. We\u2019ve never targeted innocent civilians and we\u2019re not going to start now. But listen, Jake, I understand. People are scared and for seven years, we\u2019ve faced terrorist attacks and President Obama lectures Americans on Islamophobia. That is maddening. But the answer is not simply to yell, \u201cChina bad, Muslims bad.\u201d You\u2019ve got to understand the nature of the threats we\u2019re facing and how you deal with them. And yes, it is true there are millions of radical Islamic terrorists who seek to kill us. We need a president, commander in chief focused on fighting them.CRUZ: And I\u2019ll tell you, frankly one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal. I think that\u2019s a mistake. The Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us. I\u2019ll give you another example, dealing with Islamic radical terrorism. On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. As president, I will not be neutral. And let me say this week, a Texan, Taylor Force. He was an Eagle Scout, he was a West Point graduate, he was an Army veteran. He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel, and I don\u2019t think we need a commander in chief... (BELL RINGS) ... who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel. (APPLAUSE)\nHEWITT: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump. we\u2019re going to come to you in a second, but wait. I want to go to Hugh Hewitt, who has questions on this exact line of subject.\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump, I want to follow-up on the quote that Senator Cruz used. You said you would want to be, quote, \u201csort of a neutral guy\u201d. He did mention Taylor Force. He was a West Point graduate, he was a war hero. He was a Vanderbilt graduate student. He was killed in a Palestinian terror attack near Tel Aviv, many others were killed. And the Israeli government says the Palestinian authority is inciting this. Do you still want to stay neutral when the Palestinian authority is inciting these attacks.\nTRUMP: First of all, there\u2019s nobody on this stage that\u2019s more pro Israel than I am. OK. There\u2019s nobody. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: I am pro-Israel. (BOOING)\nTRUMP: I was the grand marshall, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day Parade down 5th avenue. I\u2019ve made massive contributions to Israel. I have a lot of \u2014 I have tremendous love for Israel. I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish, OK? And two grandchildren that are Jewish. (APPLAUSE)\nTRUMP: But I will tell you, I think if we\u2019re going to ever negotiate a peace settlement, which every Israeli wants, and I\u2019ve spoken to the toughest and the sharpest, they all want peace, I think it would be much more helpful is \u2014 I\u2019m a negotiator. If I go in, I\u2019ll say I\u2019m pro-Israel and I\u2019ve told that to everybody and anybody that would listen. But I would like to at least have the other side think I\u2019m somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. Maybe we can get a deal. I think it\u2019s probably the toughest negotiation of all time. But maybe we can get a deal done.\nHEWITT: Senator Trump... (CROSSTALK)\nTRUMP: And, by the way, just so you understand, as far as Iran, I would have never made that deal. I think it\u2019s maybe the world deal I\u2019ve ever seen. I think it\u2019s the worst deal I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated. I will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they\u2019ve ever behaved in their lives, which is probably unlikely. That deal will be broken.\nHEWITT: Thank you Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio.\nCRUZ: You know, we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country. The reason we are friends and allies with Israel is they are a liberal Democratic country that share our values, they\u2019re our strongest ally in the region. We get billions in intelligence resources, billions in military resources. And the Palestinian Authority that Donald, along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they want to treat neutrally, the same as Israel. The Palestinian Authority is in a unity government with Hamas, a terrorist organization. They pay the families of these terrorists who murder people. And this is exactly the moral relativism Barack Obama has. And the answer is not scream, all Muslims bad. Let me give you an example of a Muslim for example, we ought to be standing with, President el-Sisi of Egypt, a president of a Muslim country who is targeting radical... (BELL RINGS) ... Islamic terrorist. HEWITT: Senator Rubio.\nCRUZ: He\u2019s hunting them down and stomping them.\nHEWITT: Thank you.\nCRUZ: Our focus needs to be on keeping this country safe.\nHEWITT: I want to go back to the Israeli government\u2019s assertion that the Palestinian Authority is inciting the convulsion of violence. Do you agree.\nRUBIO: Well, that\u2019s undeniable. First of all, they\u2019ve said, they\u2019ve encouraged people to do so. And you\u2019ve seen the speeches of the Palestinian Authority president how glorious this is that they\u2019re doing these sorts of things. But let me go back for a moment. The policy Donald has outlined, I don\u2019t know if he realizes, is an anti-Israeli policy. Maybe that\u2019s not your intent but here\u2019s why it is an anti-Israeli policy. There is no peace deal possible with the Palestinians at this moment. There just isn\u2019t. (APPLAUSE)\nRUBIO: Because there\u2019s no one to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with Hamas, an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state. Every time that Israel has turned over territory of any kind, be is Gaza, or now in Judea and Sumaira, it is used as a launching pad to attack Israel. And that\u2019s what will happen again. These groups are not interested in a deal with Israel. What they are interested in is ultimately removing the Jewish state and occupying its entire territory. (BELL RINGS) So maybe in 30 years the conditions will exist, but they do not exist now.\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump, and then I\u2019ll come to you Senator Kasich.\nRUBIO: And To have a president forcing the Israelis to the table is harmful to the Israeli and emboldens Israel\u2019s enemies. HEWITT: Thank you senator. (APPLAUSE) Mr. Trump a response and then we\u2019ll go to Governor Kasich.\nTRUMP: If I become president of the United States, one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one, protection of Israel, but also seeing if a deal can be made, the toughest deal, the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look, no matter how hard you look. But I would like to give it a shot. Very, very pro-Israel, nobody more pro-Israel. But I would love to give it a shot. And I have to tell you this, Hugh. I have friend, Israelis, non-Israelis, people from New York City that happen to be Jewish and love Israel, and some are very tough people, every single one of them, they know it\u2019s tough, but every single one of them wants to see if we could ever have peace in Israel. And some believe it\u2019s possible. It may not be, in which case we\u2019ll find out. But it would be a priority if I become president to see what I could do.\nHEWITT: Governor Kasich, do you agree the Israeli government that the Palestinian Authority is inciting this violence? KASICH: Well, there\u2019s no question. They were saying that the Israelis intended to go to the Dome of the Rock. And I mean, when you think about this, thank goodness we work with Israelis to give them the Iron Dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in. Could you imagine living in like Miami here and having people shooting missiles in? Secondly, there was just an article the other day, Hugh, that I know you\u2019re familiar with the Israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the Palestinians now, Hamas in particular, is digging these tunnels trying to get under Israel. They\u2019re coming at them from above, they\u2019re trying to come at them under the ground. And I just have to tell you this, I don\u2019t believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution. And I think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do. I believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the Israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the Middle East in regard to Israel. (APPLAUSE)\nHEWITT: Thank you, Governor. Senator Cruz, I want to stay in the region. Just this week the head of U.S. Central Command, General General Lloyd Austin, essentially said it\u2019s going to take a lot more troops on the ground to fix \u2014 to end the ISIS threat in Syria and Iraq. From the beginning of this campaign, you have said you will follow the judgment of military commanders in the Pentagon. So here\u2019s the commander saying we need a lot more troops on the ground. Will you follow that advice and inject Americans again into what is in essence is metastasizing Sunni-Shia civil war?\nCRUZ: We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS. And that\u2019s needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment. Right now we\u2019re not using a fraction of the tools that we have. We\u2019re not using our overwhelming air power. We\u2019re not arming the Kurds. Those need to be the first steps. And then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out. But, you know, a question that actually Jake asked, and I\u2019m glad to come back to it now, is rules of engagement. We have right now our troops engaged in combat but President Obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back. They\u2019re not able to fight. They\u2019re not able to defend themselves. They\u2019re not able to kill the enemy. And I have got to tell you, Hugh, I think that is wrong. It is immoral. And I give my word to every soldier, sailor, and airman, and marine, and every wife and husband, every son and daughter, every mother and father, that will end in January 2017. (APPLAUSE)\nHEWITT: Governor Kasich, if it takes 20,000 or 30,000, if the Pentagon says that\u2019s what needs to be done, will you follow their advice?\nKASICH: Hugh, I\u2019ve said all along and laid out my foreign policy, I\u2019m going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said I was the best to be commander-in- chief. I spent 18 years on the Defense Committee, Armed Services, and then I was in the Pentagon with Donald Rumsfeld after 9/11, in and out for a couple of years. We absolutely have to win this with a coalition. Arabs have to be with us. The Europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer \u2014 is as close as it is to us. And in addition to that, you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground. And you bring all the force you need. It has got to be \u201cshock and awe\u201d in the military-speak. Then once it gets done, and we will wipe them out, once it gets done, it settles down, we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that\u2019s what it takes.\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump, more troops? TRUMP: We really have no choice. We have to knock out ISIS. We have to knock the hell out of them. We have to get rid of it. And then come back and rebuild our country, which is falling apart. We have no choice.\nHEWITT: How many... (CROSSTALK)\nTRUMP: I would listen to the generals, but I\u2019m hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. We have to knock them out fast. Look, we\u2019re not allowed to fight. We can\u2019t fight. We\u2019re not knocking out the oil because they don\u2019t want to create environmental pollution up in the air. I mean, these are things that nobody even believes. They think we\u2019re kidding. They didn\u2019t want to knock out the oil because of what it\u2019s going to do to the carbon footprint. We don\u2019t fight like we used to fight. We used to fight to win. Now we fight for no reason whatsoever. We don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re doing.(APPLAUSE)\nTRUMP: So, the answer is we have to knock them out. We have to knock them out fast. And we have to get back home. And we have to rebuild our country which is falling apart.\nTAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Let\u2019s turn from current conflicts to those who have served in conflicts. Senator Rubio, according to a V.A. study, of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day, 17 of them have no connection to the V.A. The V.A. believes that this lack of connection is one of the reasons for this tragically high suicide rate. What specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need?\nRUBIO: Well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that\u2019s struggling with the V.A. my brother is a veteran. He\u2019s struggling with the V.A. The other day, we heard this horrible story. It was a headline in USA Today, and it said, \u201cCalls to the V.A. Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail.\u201d Well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen \u2014 one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide. And they happened to call him back the day after he died. People need to be held accountable for this. One of the things I\u2019m proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way, and I\u2019ll give him credit \u2014 Bernie Sanders was a part of this \u2014 we passed a V.A. accountability bill. And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren\u2019t doing a good job. Senior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn\u2019t working. The problem is no one\u2019s being held accountable. Even after we passed that law, no one\u2019s been fired for no outreach. No one\u2019s been fired for calls going to the voicemail. No one\u2019s been disciplined. No one\u2019s been demoted. When I\u2019m president of the United States, if you work at the V.A. and you are not doing a good job, you will be fired from your job at the V.A. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, the Veterans Affairs Department is one of the biggest line items in the domestic budget. As part of its attempt to cut costs, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives just voted to try to reduce spending in the post-9/11 GI Bill. Should veterans\u2019 benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit?\nKASICH: I don\u2019t \u2014 I haven\u2019t seen the provisions of that bill, Jake. My initial instincts are no. And let me just say about the V.A. When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one. Number two, the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured. It needs to be downsized and spread out. It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans. And secondly, the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans\u2019 service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job. And when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they\u2019re our golden employees. No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America.\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich. (APPLAUSE) Let\u2019s turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida. Just over a week from now, President Obama will visit Cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba. Two of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States. Let\u2019s go back to my colleague Dana Bash.\nBASH: Senator Rubio, Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba. The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well. So why are President Obama, Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong?\nRUBIO: Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change. But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government. Today, it has not. The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made \u2014 after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime. It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone. They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there. They\u2019ll put a puppet figure forward as their new president. And nothing will change for the Cuban people. There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights. In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening. The only thing that\u2019s changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently. And we asked nothing in return. Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma. And by no means is Burma a perfect country. But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings. When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening. And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body. He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return. And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions. It\u2019s harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing.(APPLAUSE)\nBASH: Mr. Trump, you said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. You said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. Why do you agree with President Obama and disagree with what Senator Rubio just said?\nTRUMP: Well, I don\u2019t really agree with President Obama. I think I\u2019m somewhere in the middle. What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making \u2014 as usual with our country, we don\u2019t make good deal. We don\u2019t have our right people negotiating, we have people that don\u2019t have a clue. As an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody\u2019s talking about it and they\u2019ll end up signing a deal and then we\u2019ll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion. All that stuff has to be agreed to now. We don\u2019t want to get sued after the deal is made. So I don\u2019t agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be \u2014 should take place. After 50 years, it\u2019s enough time, folks. But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that\u2019s going to happen. This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations. So I want to do something, but it\u2019s got to be done intelligently. We have to make good deal.\nBASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. But just to be clear, Mr. Trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them?\nTRUMP: I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba\u2019s favor. Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba\u2019s favor. It the same way as the Iran deal. We never walked \u2014 we never \u2014 all we do is keep giving. We give and give and give.\nBASH: But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it. Which would it be? In Havana.\nTRUMP: I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States. (APPLAUSE)\nRUBIO: All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate. It\u2019s the same building. So it could just go back to being called a consulate. We don\u2019t have to close it that way. Second of all, I don\u2019t know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they\u2019re going to lose. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) Third, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal. I\u2019ll tell you what the good deal now, it\u2019s already codified. Here\u2019s a good deal \u2014 Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes (ph) and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal (ph) Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs. And you know what? Then we can have a relationship with Cuba. That\u2019s a good deal. (APPLAUSE)\nBASH: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Senator Cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba?\nCRUZ: Yes, I would. And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters. When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy? When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. There\u2019s a real difference between us. Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they\u2019re doing. The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective. I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn\u2019t be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us. (APPLAUSE)\nCUBA: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar. I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us. And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear. And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it\u2019s got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States. As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal. That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country. It is a disaster. So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it\u2019s a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated. So don\u2019t try to put it on me like it\u2019s wonderful, like I love it.\nBASH: Senator Cruz, your response?\nCRUZ: Well, look. I\u2019ll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008. And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry. CRUZ: And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better. No. We don\u2019t just need smarter people in government. We need leaders that are protecting American interests. (APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: And when it comes to Iran, Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion. That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us. We need a commander in chief that understands our enemies... (BELL RINGS) ... understands and doesn\u2019t give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security. (APPLAUSE)\nTRUMP: I was against the giving of the money at all cost. I said don\u2019t negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back. If the prisoners don\u2019t come back early \u2014 three years ago. One of the longest negotiations I\u2019ve ever seen, by the way. If they don\u2019t come back early, I was saying don\u2019t negotiate. They come back early. What you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions. What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal. Cause that deal is a disaster. Ted, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators. But that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States.\nBASH: Thank you Mr. Trump. Let\u2019s refocus this back on Cuba. Governor Kasich, a pair of entrepreneurs from Alabama and North Carolina have just received approval to build the first U.S. factory in Cuba, making tractor for small farms. This is a direct result of President Obama\u2019s policy in Cuba that we\u2019ve been talking about. If you were elected would you encourage more U.S. companies to do business like that in Cuba?\nKASICH: No, I wouldn\u2019t. Listen, I think the problem with the administration, if you talk to our friends around the world, they say what is America doing? You know, you don\u2019t support us, we can\u2019t figure out where you are. You won\u2019t arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine, we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people. You had a red line in Syria. You walked away from it. You refused to fund the Syrian rebels, you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile. And then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal. Look, I know in human nature sometimes there\u2019s a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends. And you know what happens when you do that? You make a terrible mistake. You need to support your friends, you need to hold your enemies out here... (APPLAUSE)\nKASICH: ... and you need to negotiate tough deals. The fact is, they need to understand who we are. The Chinese understand. They don\u2019t own the South China Sea. They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we\u2019ll take out their systems. We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid. We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you\u2019re either with us or you\u2019re against us. We\u2019re not rattling a sword. You\u2019re not our enemy but we\u2019re not going to put up with this nonsense any longer. And a strong America is what the entire world is begging for. Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world. (BELL RINGS) When I\u2019m president, they\u2019re going to know exactly where we are because we\u2019re coming back.\nTAPPER: Thank you governor. Thank you governor. While we\u2019re discussing the issues of importance to Floridians, I reached out to the Republican mayor of Miami, Tomas Regalado, to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening. Mayor Regalado told me, quote, \u201cClimate change means rising ocean levels, which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. It\u2019s an every day reality in our city. Will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it?\u201d Unquote. Senator Rubio, the Miami mayor has endorsed you. Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it?\nA coalition of Republicans is banking on a scenario in which Donald J. Trump fails to reach the 1,237 delegates required to secure the party\u2019s nomination before its July convention, creating a potential opening for another nominee as the delegates vote on the convention floor.\nRUBIO: Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing. (APPLAUSE)\nRUBIO: There\u2019s never been a time when the climate has not changed. I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it? So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it\u2019s caused by two things. Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp. And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation. And I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there\u2019s no such thing. (APPLAUSE)\nRUBIO: On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass. There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he\u2019s forcing down our throats on the war on coal. Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that? Americans are going to pay the price of that. The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living.RUBIO: The businesses who are going to leave America because it\u2019s more expensive to do business here than anywhere else. And you know what passing those laws would have \u2014 what impact it would have on the environment? Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels. So, I am in favor of a clean environment. My children live in South Florida. My family is being raised here. I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy.\nTAPPER: So just to clarify, Senator Rubio, Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the Republican mayor of Miami, he\u2019s saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change. When you talk to him, because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he\u2019s wrong?\nRUBIO: I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that. If we pass \u2014 if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment. Sea level would still rise. All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons. One, because America is not a planet. It\u2019s a country. And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut. Here\u2019s what he will immediately \u2014 and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend \u2014 but here\u2019s what he\u2019s going to immediately going to start hearing from. He will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power. That cost will be passed on to working families. I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, what would you say to the mayor of Miami?\nKASICH: Well, I \u2014 I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don\u2019t think it has to be a, you know, either you\u2019re for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you\u2019re not going to have any jobs. The fact is, you can have both. In our state, we\u2019ve reduced emissions by 30 percent. But let me tell you also what we\u2019re trying to do. We want all the sources of energy. We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it. We believe in natural gas. We believe in nuclear power. And you know what else I believe in? I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter. Now, it doesn\u2019t mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don\u2019t know how much humans actually contribute. But it is important we develop renewables. Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world. So the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another.\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor. Senator Cruz, I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world. Senator Cruz, Colin Powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the U.S. abroad. He said, quote, \u201cforeigners of the world looking at this are distressed.\u201d Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States?\nCRUZ: Of course it does. And we\u2019ve seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world. This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks. Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America. Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on. I\u2019ll tell you, when I travel abroad, when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, \u201cit is hard to be friends with America; we can\u2019t count on America; America doesn\u2019t stand with us.\u201d And that is a disgrace. But the good news is, Jake, we\u2019ve seen this before. We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter. And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight. It\u2019s worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. (APPLAUSE) And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as I will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies. That\u2019s why on day one, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal because the Ayatollah Khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Thank you, Senator.TAPPER: Mr. Trump, some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators. You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China\u2019s massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, you\u2019ve said: \u201cWhen the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength.\u201d How do you respond...\nTRUMP: That doesn\u2019t mean I was endorsing that. I was not endorsing it. I said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength. And then they kept down the riot. It was a horrible thing. It doesn\u2019t mean at all I was endorsing it. As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia. I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you. I mean, for Russia, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m endorsing Putin.\nTAPPER: But the word strong obviously is a compliment... (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: ... and many people would look at what the Chinese leaders have done and what Putin is doing as atrocities. TRUMP: I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany. Germany is a disaster right now. So I used to think that. (APPLAUSE)\nTRUMP: And strong doesn\u2019t mean good. Putin is a strong leader, absolutely. I could name many strong leaders. I could name very many very weak leaders. But he is a strong leader. Now I don\u2019t say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact.\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, when you were a member of Congress, you were outspoken about the Tiananmen Square massacre. What do you think?\nKASICH: I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids. And when that guy stood in front \u2014 that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government. (APPLAUSE)\nKASICH: Now I will tell you, I don\u2019t believe that we need to make China an enemy. They are a competitor. But I want to go back to three things they should do. We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he\u2019s doing, number one. Number two, they need to realize they don\u2019t own the South China Sea. And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea. And thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we\u2019re going to have to beef up the cyber command. And they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid. But if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems. The president has not given the cyber command that authority. I will. And when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can\u2019t manipulate their currency. That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with. And if I saw them doing it, I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich. We\u2019re going to take another quick break. When we come back, we\u2019ll have more of the Republican presidential debate from Miami, Florida, right after this. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida. Mr. Trump, I want to start with you in this block. Earlier today, a man was arrested and charged with assault after sucker- punching a protester in the face at your rally in Fayettville, North Carolina. This is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies. Today, Hillary Clinton, your potential general election opponent, clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign. She said, quote, \u201cthis kind of behavior is repugnant. We set the tone for our campaigns, we should encourage respect, not violence.\u201d Do you believe that you\u2019ve done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged?\nTRUMP: I hope not. I truly hope not. I will say this. We have 25 (thousand), 30,000 people \u2014 you\u2019ve seen it yourself. People come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest \u2014 in some cases \u2014 you know, you\u2019re mentioning one case, which I haven\u2019t seen, I heard about it, which I don\u2019t like. But when they see what\u2019s going on in this country, they have anger that\u2019s unbelievable. They have anger. They love this country. They don\u2019t like seeing bad trade deals, they don\u2019t like seeing higher taxes, they don\u2019t like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated. And I know \u2014 I mean, I see it. There is some anger. There\u2019s also great love for the country. It\u2019s a beautiful thing in many respects. But I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake.\nTAPPER: Some of your critics point to quotes you\u2019ve made at these debates \u2014 at these rallies including February 23rd, \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face,\u201d referring to a protesters. February 27th, \u201cin the good ol\u2019 days, they\u2019d have ripped him out of that seat so fast.\u201d February 1st, \u201cknock the crap out of him, would, you? Seriously, OK, just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.\u201d (APPLAUSE)\nTRUMP: We have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things. They are swinging, they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people. And we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people, not only the loudness, the loudness I don\u2019t mind. But doing serious damage. And if they\u2019ve got to be taken out, to be honest, I mean, we have to run something. And it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s usually the municipal government, the police because I don\u2019t have guards all over these stadiums. I mean, we fill up stadiums. It\u2019s usually the police \u2014 and, by the way, speaking of the police, we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job. (APPLAUSE) So we should pay \u2014 we should truly give our police. They\u2019re incredible people, we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz, are you concerned at all that these kind of scenes potentially hurt the Republican party for the general election?\nCRUZ: Listen, I think for every one of us, we need to show respect to the people. We need to remember who it is we\u2019re working for. You know, we\u2019ve seen for seven years a president who believes he\u2019s above the law, who behaves like an emperor, who it is all about him and he forgot that he\u2019s working for the American people. And let me \u2014 let me ask, turn the camera our here. How many of y\u2019all feel disrespected by Washington?(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: Washington isn\u2019t listening to the people. And that\u2019s the frustration that is boiling over. And we need to nominate and elects a president who remembers, he works for the people. You know, at Donald\u2019s rallies recently, he\u2019s taken to asking people in the crowd to raise their hand and pledge their support to him. Now, I got to say to me, I think that\u2019s exactly backwards. This is a job interview. We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around. (APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: And the only hand raising I\u2019m interested in doing is on January 20, 2017 raising my hand with my left hand on the... (BELL RINGS) ... bible and pledging to the American people to preserve, protect and defend the constitution of United States.\nTAPPER: Thank you senator. Mr. Trump, if you\u2019d like to respond.\nTRUMP: It shows the total dishonesty of the press. We were having \u2014 on a few occasions, again massive crowds. And we\u2019re talking and I\u2019m saying who is going to vote on Tuesday? Who is going to vote? The place goes crazy. Then I say, hey, do me a favor. Raise your right hand. Do you swear you\u2019re going to vote for Donald Trump? Everyone\u2019s laughing, we\u2019re all having a good time. That\u2019s why I have much bigger crowds than Ted, because we have a good time at mine. (APPLAUSE)\nTRUMP: But we\u2019re all having a good time and the next day, on the Today Show and a couple of other place, not too many. Because when you look at it, everyone\u2019s smiling, laughing. Their arms are raised like this. They had pictures, still pictures of people and they tried to equate it to Nazi Germany. (BELL RINGS) It is a disgrace. It was a total disgrace. And I\u2019ve had reporters, people that you know, come up to me and said that \u2014 what they did on the Today Show was a disgrace. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, do you worry about the scenes of violence at some of these rallies affecting the Republican party\u2019s chances in November?\nKASICH: Well, I worry about the violence at a rally period. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, elections are important but the unity of this country really matters. Jake, here\u2019s what I think is happening. There are people out there who are worried about their jobs. They\u2019re worried that somebody is going to come in and tell them they\u2019re out of work and they\u2019re 54 years old and they don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to get another job, a man and a woman. Maybe they\u2019re worried about a trade deal. They\u2019re worried about the fact that their wages haven\u2019t gone up. They\u2019re worried that their kids went to college and the promise was, you go to college, you get a job, things are going to be great. They went to college, they rang up debt and they\u2019re still living in their parents\u2019 basement. People are uptight. Our seniors are worried they\u2019re going to lose their Social Security. There\u2019s two ways to treat it. You can either prey on that and be negative about it, or you tell people that these things can be fixed. If we\u2019re Americans rather than Republicans and Democrats, we get together, we can solve all of these problems. We can provide financial security, we can drive the wages up, we can get kids jobs with a more robust economy. (BELL RINGS) And you know what? They want to help solve these problems right where they live and I\u2019ll give them the power to do it.\nTAPPER: Thank you governor. Senator Rubio? I know you want to say something.\nRUBIO: I do. A couple of points. The first is, I\u2019m concerned about violence in general in this society. And by the way, the first people that are facing that violence are our law enforcement officers. And they deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks for everything they do for us. On the issue of anger. Yes, people are angry. Of course they\u2019re angry. Every institution in America has been failing us for the better part of 20 years or 30 years. But leadership is not about using the anger, leadership is about using the anger to motivate us, not to define us. But to motivate us to take action. Being here in Miami is special. My grandfather lived with us most of his life while I was growing up. And he would sit on the porch of our home and tell me all kinds of stories and things I learned about history. My grandfather was born in 1899 before there were airplanes in the sky. One night in the summer of 1969, he watched a man set foot on the moon. (BELL RINGS) You know what he said when he saw that? He said Americans can do anything. Americans can do anything. There is no problem before us we cannot solve and we can solve it if we come together in a serious way, in this generation.\nTAPPER: Thank you senator.\nRUBIO: And embrace all of the principles that made us great.\nTAPPER: Thank you senator. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: The math suggests that it possible that not one of you will reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates before the Republican convention, which would mean a contested convention. Let\u2019s go back to Salem Radio\u2019s Hugh Hewitt.\nHEWITT: Thank you Jake. Governor Kasich, the math and the maps say that you can only become the nominee if in fact there is a contested convention. If we arrive on the shores of Lake Erie, Donald Trump has the most delegates. Why shouldn\u2019t the person with the most delegates, even if it\u2019s not a majority of delegates, be the nominee?\nKASICH: Well, first of all, let\u2019s not \u2014 you know, math doesn\u2019t tell the whole story in politics. The great thing about politics, the reason why we watch it is because what\u2019s true today is not necessarily true tomorrow. So let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Secondly, look, when you went to school up there in Salem, Ohio, OK.KASICH: If you got an 86, you got a B. Because everybody else had an 84 didn\u2019t mean you got an A. So you just have to win enough delegates to be the nominee. And frankly, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to get a convention like that. But if we do, I was at one in 1976 as a wee lad and supported Ronald Reagan and actually worked directly with him. He tried valiantly. He lost. Gerald Ford won. The party was united. Gerald Ford served the country great by pardoning Richard Nixon. He lost the election probably because of that, but he put America first. And we were healed as a party. So, look, you have to earn the delegates in order to be picked. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen because we still have about half the delegates to be selected. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be a very interesting thing to see how it all turns out as we move forward over the next couple of weeks. (APPLAUSE)\nHEWITT: Thank you, Governor. Mr. Trump, if you arrive in Cleveland with a plurality and the most, but not a majority, is it legitimate for someone else to emerge from that convention the nominee? And if so, would you support that person? TRUMP: I think that what should happen, getting back maybe a little bit to your first question, I think that whoever \u2014 first of all, I think I\u2019m going to have the delegates. OK? I think. Let\u2019s see what happens. (APPLAUSE) But if somebody doesn\u2019t have the delegates, and I guess there\u2019s two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment. But if \u2014 no, that\u2019s just \u2014 by the way, that is not meant to be a criticism. That\u2019s just a mathematical fact. OK? If two of us get up there, I would say this, if \u2014 if Marco, if the governor, if Ted had more votes than me in the form of delegates, I think whoever gets to the top position as opposed to solving that artificial number that was by somebody, which is a very random number, I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win. That\u2019s what I think.\nHEWITT: Senator Cruz, if you \u2014 if you overtake Donald Trump at the convention, what will you do to take his very passionate supporters and keep them from bolting the convention and sabotaging the fall election?\nCRUZ: Well, look, there are some folks in Washington...\nTRUMP: Make me president. (APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: Donald, you are welcome to be president of the Smithsonian. (APPLAUSE) You know, there are some in Washington who are having fevered dreams of a brokered convention. They are unhappy with how the people are voting and they want to parachute in their favored Washington candidate to be the nominee. I think that would be an absolute disaster and we need to respect the will of the voters. (APPLAUSE) It\u2019s one of the reasons why in the course of this election \u2014 listen, everyone up here has worked very hard. But Donald is right, there are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination, Donald and myself. At this point, I have roughly 360 delegates. He has about 100 more than I have. We have at this point beaten Donald in eight separate states all over the country geographically, from Maine to Alaska, from Kansas to Texas, all over this country we have beaten him. And so for the people at home, if you\u2019re one of the 65, 70 percent of Republicans who recognizes that if we nominate Donald Trump, Hillary wins. That\u2019s why the media wants him to be the nominee so much. If you recognize that, then I want to invite you if you\u2019ve supported other candidates, come and join us. We are seeing candidates coming together and uniting. It\u2019s why Carly Fiorina endorsed me yesterday. It\u2019s why Mike Lee endorsed me today. I ask everyone to come together. Let\u2019s stand together and let\u2019s beat Hillary Clinton in November.\nHEWITT: All right. Thank you, Senator. (APPLAUSE) Mr. Trump, then to Senator Rubio.\nTRUMP: You know, I listen and I watch Ted on television and when he speaks, and he\u2019s always saying, \u201cI\u2019m the only one that beat Donald in six contests; and I beat him.\u201d But I beat him in 13 contests. He never mentions that. (APPLAUSE) And let me just tell you another little fact, little minor fact. I have about a 1.6 million votes during this primary season, more votes than Ted. The other thing is, I beat Hillary, and I will give you the list, I beat Hillary in many of the polls that have been taken. And each week, I get better and better. And believe me, I haven\u2019t even started on her yet.\nHEWITT: Senator Rubio?\nRUBIO: Let me tell you what this election is about for me. And I get all the delegate math and all that debate. Let me tell you what\u2019s about for me. On Tuesday night, I didn\u2019t do as well, obviously, as I wanted to. And I was a little bit disappointed when I got home. And my wife told me a story that night, which is the reason why I can get up the next day and keep fighting. There\u2019s a gentleman here in South Florida who just got out of surgery. And his doctors told him he needs to be home resting. But every afternoon, he takes his little aluminum chair and he sits outside of an early polling center and holds a sign that says \u201cMarco Rubio.\u201dRUBIO: Because for him, I symbolize all the sacrifices that his generation made so their children could have a better life than themselves (APPLAUSE) That gentleman has not given up on me and I am not going to give up on him. I am going to work tirelessly every single day \u2014 (APPLAUSE) ... because this election is too important. What\u2019s at stake is the future of this country. And I believe \u2014 I believe that at the end of this process this nation will make the right choice because I\u2019ve always believed that God has blessed America, that God\u2019s hand is upon this country and that its greatest days are yet to come. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Thank you, Senator. Let\u2019s send it back to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen?\nDINAN: Mr. Trump, one of your biggest selling points is that you are largely self-funding your campaign, and you argue your opponents are controlled by their special interest donors. Will you maintain your pledge not to take outside contributions throughout the general election?\nTRUMP: I have not made that decision yet. I will make a decision on that, but I have not made that decision. My decision was that I would go through the entire primary season and I have turned down probably $275 million worth. I have many, many friends that come up all day long, $5 million, $10 million, I\u2019m turning down money. I feel sort of foolish to be honest with you. I don\u2019t know if I get any credit for it but I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. And other than \u2014 and by the way, other than very small donations where people are sending in $200, $15, $20, and we have some of that, but it\u2019s not a large amount. No, I\u2019m self-funding my campaign, and the reason is that I\u2019ve been in this business a long time and I was on the other side \u2014 until eight months ago I was on the or side. I made massive contributions, large contributions to politicians, both Democrats and Republicans. I was liked by everybody, which is an important thing. I will say this \u2014 people control special interests, lobbyists, donors, they make large contributions to politicians and they have total control over those politicians. I don\u2019t want anybody to control me but the people right out there. And I\u2019m going to do the right thing. (APPLAUSE)\nDINAN: Senator Cruz, I want to come to you. The vast majority of Republicans, and voters overall, agree with Mr. Trump that candidates are beholden to people and groups who donate to their campaigns. Do you deny that those big donors do have influence?\nCRUZ: Well look, absolutely. And one of the things we\u2019re so frustrated about is the corruption, what I\u2019ve called the Washington cartel. It\u2019s career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests. And listen, Donald told you for 40 years he\u2019s been sitting at that table using his money to buy influence, supporting liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, but also supporting the Republican establishment and funding their effort to crush the Tea Party. And now his argument is after four decades of being part of that influence buying, after Hillary Clinton spending decades being part of that influence selling, that suddenly he will change. But the interesting point is tonight he hasn\u2019t pointed to a single special interest he\u2019s willing to take on. He didn\u2019t take on Wall Street when he supported the TARP bailout in Wall Street. He won\u2019t take on ethanol. And my campaign, by contrast, was funded by 1.1 million contributions all over this country.\nDINAN: Thank you, Senator. I want to go to Mr. Trump...\nCRUZ: $62 at tedcruz.org.\nDINAN: ... for a response. Thank you, Senator.\nCRUZ: That\u2019s who you\u2019ve got to be accountable to, the people.\nTRUMP: Ted was given to PACs. I mean, PACs \u2014 you know, these super PACs are a disaster, by the way, folks. Very corrupt. It\u2019s going to lead to lots of disasters. But Ted has super PACs and you have to look at the people that are giving to those super PACs, number one. It\u2019s very important to do that. There is total control of the candidates, I know it better than anybody that probably ever lived. And I will tell you this, I know the system far better than anybody else and I know the system is broken. And I\u2019m the one, because I know it so well because I was on both sides of it, I was on the other side all my life and I\u2019ve always made large contributions. And frankly, I know the system better than anybody else and I\u2019m the only one up here that\u2019s going to be able to fix that system because that system is wrong.\nDINAN: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Rubio, I want to come to you with a question. At the last debate, you mocked Mr. Trump for being flexible. With so much gridlock in Washington, how can you expect to lead the country and get things done if you aren\u2019t willing to show flexibility?\nRUBIO: Well, I think you can be flexible about ideas, you shouldn\u2019t be flexible about your principles. About when it comes to ideas and working with people, I have a record of having done that. Listen, on the issue of higher education, I\u2019m the only one that continually talks about student loan debt because I owed over $100,000 of student loan debt. So I know this is a major issue. And all my ideas that deal with higher education are bipartisan. The VA Accountability Act that I passed I did it on a \u2014 on a bipartisan basis. The sanctions that I helped \u2014 that I imposed on Hezbollah I did it on a bipartisan basis. The Girls Count Act that deals with human trafficking, we did that on a bipartisan basis. RUBIO: But I also want to be frank. There are issues we\u2019re going to have to have an election over. When it comes to repealing and replaces Obamacare, that\u2019s not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to reducing the tax burdens on Americans, that\u2019s not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy,that\u2019s probably not going to be bipartisan. There are issues we can work together on and we should, but there are fundamental issues about the proper role of government. And on those issues, I will fight anyone who wants to expand government, raise taxes, or weaken our military. (APPLAUSE)\nDINAN: All right. Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond, but specifically you talked about flexibility and one of the examples you gave was the height of the border fence. What are some of the other issues on which you\u2019re willing to show flexibility?\nTRUMP: It depends on what comes up. You never know. It depends on what comes up. Look, look, we had a great president, Ronald Reagan. We had Tip O\u2019Neill, speaker. And what do we do, we take these two men that are very, very different men, they got along, they had relationships, and they got things, and very beautifully. Nobody is complaining about the deals that Ronald Reagan made. And he made it with Tip O\u2019Neill. We need to have people get together and work good deals out, good deals out from our standpoint. And I\u2019ll tell you this, it can be done. We don\u2019t want to continue to watch people signing executive orders because that was not what the Constitution and the brilliant designers of this incredible document had in mind. We need people that can make deals and can work, because right now in Washington there\u2019s total, absolute gridlock.\nDINAN: Thank you. I want to go to Governor Kasich on this issue of flexibility, sir.\nKASICH: Well, look, my record speaks for itself. What I talk about tonight is not a theory. These are things that I\u2019ve done. I was there when we reformed the Pentagon on a bipartisan basis to give control to the commanders in the field and force the services to work together. I was the chief architect, along with Senator Domenici, of the last time we balanced the budget and the first time since we walked on the moon. I was there when I worked on the welfare reform in Washington. And we got it done and we eliminated the entitlement on welfare, I then went to Ohio and took Ohio from a basket case, working in a bipartisan basis to reform many things, including the Cleveland public schools, working with a Democratic mayor. My problem isn\u2019t that people don\u2019t know this. They say, well, what does that mean? Does that mean you\u2019re too easy? Well, let me tell you, when we did the balanced budget, we cut the capital gains tax, we provided a family tax credit, we shrunk the government. In my state, the state of Ohio, has the smallest government in the state of Ohio in 30 years. Conservative principles will work. But show respect to the other side. One final thing, in regard to Social Security, we will not get that done alone. We will have to have some responsible Democrats who will come in to fix the problem of Social Security. I know how to do it because I\u2019ve done it and I\u2019ll do it again. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor. We have time for one last break. We\u2019ll be right back after this.(APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nTAPPER: And we\u2019re back with the Republican presidential debate, just five days before the next primary elections. It is time now for closing statements. Candidates, you will each have one minute. And we\u2019ll start with Governor Kasich.\nKASICH: Well, I\u2019d like to say to all of you, the American people, I have run an unwavering, positive campaign for president of the United States. I have tried to be positive in such a way as to show my record, my accomplishments, my vision. And I wanted to raise the bar in presidential politics so our kids can take a look at the way you can run for president and you will someday maybe be president of the United States. Sometimes being positive isn\u2019t all that interesting, but it\u2019s very interesting to my family, my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country and I will continue to run a positive campaign. I can fix the problems in Washington, I\u2019ve done it before. And, in fact, I want to turn power, money and influence back to you, the American people, so that you can be in the schools and on the streets fighting drugs and dealing with the issues of poverty. We can do this together. Allow me to take care of the federal issues when I send the power back and the money and the influence to you and you can strengthen our nation and our neighborhoods and our families. That\u2019s where the spirit and strength of America is. But ask the people \u2014 my friends in Illinois and of course, my beloved Buckeyes to consider me on Tuesday and, please, let me have your vote. God bless. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio.\nRUBIO: It\u2019s great to be here, back at home in Miami. It\u2019s hard to believe that just two decades ago, my father was just a bartender working in the city. And now his son stands on this stage, here, as a candidate for the highest office in the land. My parents never wanted me to go into politics or in particular or anything else. They just wanted me to have the opportunity to live out all the dreams they once had for themselves. And that was possible because America is a special country. But that was not an accident. America is great because each generation before us did what needed to be done. They solved their problems, they confronted their challenges. They embraced their opportunities. And for over two centuries, each generation has left the next better off. And now the moment has arrived for our generation to do our part. And I\u2019m telling you tonight, if you vote for me, here in Florida and everywhere across this country on Tuesday, when I\u2019m elected president, this generation will do it\u2019s part. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that our children inherit from us, what we inherited from our parents, the single greatest nation in the history of all of mankind. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz.\nCRUZ: What an incredible nation we have, that the son of a bartender and the son of mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman, can all stand on this stage, competing and asking for your support.CRUZ: In just a few months, one of us is going to stand on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton. And the choice we are making today is who will best defend our values? Who will best defend your values and fight for you? I have to tell you, I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton and say, \u201cMadam Secretary, you are asking for a third term of a failed administration. You are asking for millions more to remain in stagnant jobs; for millions more steelworkers to be out of work; for wages to remain low; for young people not to have a future.\u201d We can do better. We can instead repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, unleash millions of jobs, defend the Bill of Rights, defend the Second Amendment and religious liberty, stand with our cops and our firefighters and our soldiers, and we can keep America safe. That\u2019s the choice I will put to her this fall. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: Thank you very much. The Republican Party has a great chance to embrace millions of people that it\u2019s never known before. They\u2019re coming by the millions. We should seize that opportunity. These are great people. These are fantastic people. These are people that love our country. These are people that want to see America be great again. These are people that will win us the election and win it easily. These are people that once the election is won will be able to put Supreme Court justices up that will do a fabulous job. Because let me tell you, if we lose this election, you\u2019re going to have three, four or maybe even five justices and this country will never, ever recover. It will take centuries to recover. So I just say embrace these millions of people that now for the first time ever love the Republican Party. And unify. Be smart and unify. (APPLAUSE)\nTAPPER: And that concludes this 12th Republican presidential debate. We want to thank the candidates, the Republican National Committee, the University of Miami and, of course, each of you for watching. I\u2019m Jake Tapper. Our coverage continues right now with Anderson Cooper. Anderson?"}, {"text": "Wonder and Worry, as a Syrian Child Transforms\n2016-12-17T14:19:21.000Z\nTORONTO \u2014 As soon as Bayan Mohammad, a 10-year-old Syrian refugee, arrived here last winter, she began her transformation. In her first hour of ice-skating, she managed to glide on her own. She made fast friends with girls different from any she had ever known. New to competitive sports, she propelled herself down the school track so fast that she was soon collecting ribbons.\nBayan glued herself to the movie \u201cAnnie,\u201d the ballet \u201cCinderella\u201d and episodes of \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d all stories of metamorphosis. As her English went from halting to chatty, she ticked off everything she hungered to do: An overnight school trip. Gymnastics lessons. Building a snowman \u2014 no, a snow-woman.\n\u201cI just want to be Canadian,\u201d she said.\nThe volunteers resettling her family \u2014 a group of teachers, pediatricians and other friends and neighbors spurred by devastating images of young refugees and casualties of war \u2014 watched Bayan with wonder. Her parents, Abdullah and Eman Mohammad, a former grocery store owner and a nurse from a rural village, felt both pride and alarm.\nComing to Canada with their four children, they had braced themselves for the hostility that so many refugees were encountering around the world, including just across the border, where Donald J. Trump warned of the threat posed by Syrian refugees. Instead, they found a national movement to aid them.\nAs Syria shattered, everyday citizens, called private sponsors, were adopting the newcomers, donating their time and thousands of dollars to help guide them through their first year. The volunteers attended to the family\u2019s every need: an apartment, doctors, tips on finding a mosque and halal food. The sponsors even applied to bring other family members to Canada \u2014 and still they wanted to know what more they could do.\nThe Mohammads were astonished and grateful. But over 10 months, the relationship was reshaping the family, rewriting roles and rules they had always followed. Abdullah and Eman found their marriage on new ground, the fundamental compact between them shifting. Bayan, their oldest child, was going from girl to adolescent, Middle Eastern to North American all at the same time. She was the one most likely to remember their now-obliterated life in Syria. On some days, her parents believed that she could meld her old and new identities; on others, they feared her Syrianness was being erased.\nIf the family had landed in Munich or Minneapolis, they would have encountered new cultural dilemmas, too. But Canada\u2019s unusual private sponsorship system made them especially acute, because it was so intimate. The Canadians and Syrians were in and out of one another\u2019s homes for tutoring, computer lessons or celebrations. They shared parental tasks like communication with teachers, since the Mohammads spoke little English. \u201cWhat they gave us, a brother wouldn\u2019t even give to his own brother,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said.\nStill, when one sponsor took the children to a ballet performance, Bayan twirled her way home and then begged for lessons \u2014 which would involve revealing outfits that would make her parents uncomfortable. The sponsors invited the children to make gingerbread houses and sing carols. Did saying yes mean that the strict Muslim family would be celebrating a Christian holiday?\n\u201cSponsorship brings the tension between East and West so close,\u201d said Sam Nammoura, a Syrian-Canadian refugee advocate in Calgary, Alberta.\nThe Mohammads had left Syria and then Jordan to safeguard their children \u2014 but once they arrived here, they were bewildered by what they found. Why were teenagers here allowed to stay out past midnight? Did children move away from home at 18 and never look back? How much control did parents even have?\n\u201cEvery day I have this dilemma,\u201d Mrs. Mohammad said. \u201cAm I letting the kids do the right thing?\u201d\nIn October, Bayan craved one item above all on her wish list: to join her school\u2019s overnight trip. For three days at the end of the month, the whole fifth grade would travel to an island in Toronto\u2019s harbor, exploring, conducting science experiments and sleeping in dorms.\n\u201cI want to go but my dad said no,\u201d Bayan said over a family lunch of chicken and stuffed cabbage rolls.\nHer parents felt their children belonged at home; they had never been on a sleepover.\n\u201cI want to go!\u201d Bayan repeated. \u201cI\u2019m sad because my best friends are going.\u201d By Canadian or American standards, she was being polite: no eye-rolling or accusations.\nBut in Syria, children are bound to respect the authority of their parents, even in adulthood. The rule had governed the Mohammad family for generations, backed up by relatives, friends, an entire culture. Within months of arriving in Canada, Bayan shocked her parents by beginning to question their decisions out loud.\n\u201cShe\u2019s stronger now, here, and she tries to express herself more than in Syria,\u201d her mother explained.\nBayan knew she had a quiet ally at the lunch table that day: Kerry McLorg, the organizer of the sponsor group. Meticulous and restrained, Ms. McLorg never wanted to push the Mohammads, and when they asked for her advice, she tended to answer with clinical distance, lest her own preferences show.\nBut she knew Bayan yearned for the adventure. She and the other sponsors saw it as another step in the girl\u2019s integration into Canada. Her two children had gone on the trip years ago and still talked about the traditions \u2014 visiting a lighthouse, telling ghost stories.\n\u201cEvery kid in Toronto does this,\u201d Ms. McLorg had told Bayan\u2019s parents when they had asked. \u201cAcademically, it\u2019s not important. But socially, it is very important.\u201d\nMr. Mohammad told Bayan again: No trip. He was not an immigrant who set out to adapt to a new world; he was a refugee trying to hold on to what had been ripped from him. \u201cWe\u2019re forced to be here,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said later. \u201cWe\u2019re happy, but we\u2019re forced to be here.\u201d\nHe still had a shot at preserving the identity he wanted for Bayan, but he and his wife would have to be vigilant, willing to deny their daughter some of what she wanted.\n\u201cI will do this for her,\u201d he said. \u201cGod help us.\u201d\nOnly one thing about Canada seemed to disconcert Bayan: its types of families she had never seen or even imagined. She was troubled by the concept of divorce, by classmates whose parents lived in separate homes. \u201cMy mom and dad, they will not do that,\u201d she declared.\nThe Mohammads were from a particularly conservative village in Daraa Province. Their union was arranged by their families and governed by clear tenets. Back home, Eman Mohammad, 36, did not leave the house without asking her husband\u2019s permission. She did not socialize with men who were not relatives. Women in the village did not drive. Against the odds, and Abdullah\u2019s initial reluctance, she had worked as a nurse, one of only a few women in her circle to be employed outside the home after having children.\nNow she was far more at home in Canada than he was. She attended her first modern dance performance, thrilled by the surprise and emotion. When her husband, 36, turned down a supermarket job this summer, unsure of what kind of work he wanted, she joked that she would take it. She was determined to get certified as a nurse again, even though that would require years of language instruction and coursework.\nMeanwhile, she found new purpose: helping lead a therapy group for Syrian women coping with trauma and displacement. Standing in front of a whiteboard, she peppered her presentations with motivational statements: \u201cNothing is impossible.\u201d \u201cWhen we work, we are helping society around us, not ourselves alone.\u201d She earned about 70 Canadian dollars for each weekly session.\nBeing in Canada \u201copened new doors for me that I didn\u2019t even know existed,\u201d Mrs. Mohammad said.\nHer husband, however, was having difficulty. In Syria, he co-owned a grocery store and two butcher shops, and had been the unquestioned head of the household. Now the sponsors were helping support his family, along with government subsidies. While his wife went to one of the therapy groups, he took care of Bayan and the younger children, and he had been helping in the kitchen.\n\u201cSometimes I feel weak doing these things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s job.\u201d He told himself that spending more time with his children would draw them closer.\nBayan had ambitions for her father: to learn to swim, to drive, to buy a car with six seats. \u201cI dream, like, all the time we have a big house and a pool,\u201d she said.\nBut Mr. Mohammad was nowhere near finding work that could support a family of six in an expensive city, and he felt torn about whether he should continue to study English full time or just get the best job he could. \u201cI feel lost,\u201d he had said. Because his wife\u2019s language skills were better, he sometimes was left out of conversations. (The Mohammads asked not to be identified by their full surnames, because they feared reprisals against relatives still in Syria. This article uses part of their family name.)\nIf Syria heals, Mr. Mohammad said, he definitely wants to go back.\nHis wife countered: \u201cMy future and my kids\u2019 future is in this country.\u201d\nThen they laughed. The marriages of many Syrians who had come to Canada were far more strained, they knew, the traditional arrangements difficult to replant on new soil. Mrs. Mohammad\u2019s counseling groups were filled with women whose husbands had turned bitter at the changed circumstances. Some wives were finally reporting years of domestic abuse.\nThe Mohammads tried to mitigate their differences with kindness. She found ways to telegraph respect for her husband\u2019s authority \u2014 before buying a new dress, she texted him a photo and the price for approval. For fortitude with child care duties, he turned to Islamic teachings about the value of helping one\u2019s wife. The two had long conversations about a new favorite word, \u201cflexibility.\u201d\nEven as Eman Mohammad craved opportunities for herself, she was not sure how much freedom she wanted for Bayan. In Syria, the path was restrictive but clear. If the war had never happened, she would already be wearing a head scarf and attending a girls\u2019 school. Most girls in her village married at 14 or 15, though the Mohammads would have waited until at least 18. Even if she pursued university there, she would not go on unsupervised dates, get offered a beer at a party, or live alone.\nNow that she was in Canada, her mother felt, there was no longer a map for her daughter\u2019s life. \u201cI want to try everything here,\u201d Bayan said.\nOn the day of the school trip, with her classmates off on Toronto Island in a freezing rain, the family moved on to their next cultural debate.\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of Halloween?\u201d Mrs. Mohammad asked. The holiday was four days away.\nBayan burst with answers. It was about being frightened in a fun way, she said, dressing as skeletons and ghosts. \u201cIt has to be something scary,\u201d she explained. She wanted to wear a devil costume.\nOne of the sponsors had already arranged to take them trick-or-treating. But what Mrs. Mohammad had heard about the holiday made her dubious. Her children would celebrate death and horror, after they had escaped the real thing? Should she worry that her daughter wanted to dress as a symbol of evil? Did Canadians really believe in people coming back from the dead?\nJust then, Ms. McLorg arrived at the family\u2019s apartment with a giant pumpkin for the children to carve. Bayan had asked Ms. McLorg to join them for the coming trick-or-treat date, but the sponsor did not realize how Mrs. Mohammad felt.\nMs. McLorg was trying to introduce Canadian customs without imposing on the family\u2019s own. \u201cThey should not have to change their essence in order to become Canadian,\u201d Ms. McLorg said later. In fact, the country officially encourages new arrivals to maintain their own culture.\nIn the end, they all celebrated Halloween. Another sponsor hosted them for dinner and cookies: long slivers of shortbread with red icing and almond nails, meant to look like bloody fingers. Ms. McLorg arrived in a pink bunny suit. On the costume question, Bayan and her mother had reached a middle ground: a zombie princess.\nAbdullah Mohammad headed home early; Bayan pleaded to stay later. Her mother surveyed the spiderwebs and chains lacing the street, watching her children merge into the flowing highway of trick-or-treaters.\nTwo weeks later, Mrs. Mohammad and her two daughters were propelled into a local Walmart by Bayan\u2019s sheer force of will. She longed for a pair of sparkly purple sneakers, and begged, nagged and nearly cried until her mother agreed.\nAs they navigated the aisles, mother and daughters looked like members of two different families. Mrs. Mohammad wore her head scarf, neck-to-toe gown and shawl, while the girls were in leggings and skinny jeans.\nThe question about when Bayan would start covering her head loomed over her and her parents. As they were in Canada, her mother was willing to postpone it until seventh grade.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Bayan yelled when she overheard her mother talking about it. She looked ugly with her head covered, she thought. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in grade nine \u2014 maybe,\u201d she said.\nBut the next day, Bayan and her mother slipped inside a building a few blocks from their apartment, where the 10-year-old kicked off the brand-new sneakers and knelt. Her mother draped a thin scarf over her daughter\u2019s head, expertly folding, tucking and pinning until it covered her hair without a strand showing.\nThis was Islamic school at the mosque, a new fixture of Bayan\u2019s Sundays. For several hours, she studied written Arabic, verses of the Quran and Islamic values with other children. It was the only activity of hers that the sponsors had not been involved in planning; that day, they were taking the rest of the family to a Santa parade, which Bayan was disappointed to miss.\nSunday mornings were a compromise between Bayan and her parents: the single time each week, for now, that she would cover her head.\nFor the main lesson that day, the teacher, Maimoonah Ali, an 18-year-old whose parents came to Canada as refugees from Eritrea, passed out colored Popsicle sticks and instructed the students to snap them. The sound of splintering wood filled the room. \u201cSometimes there are tests in life,\u201d she told the children. \u201cAnd sometimes they break us.\u201d\nThen she collected the remaining sticks into a tight bundle. One by one, the students strained and failed to break them. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really difficult to break things when they\u2019re all together, right?\u201d Ms. Ali asked. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly like us.\u201d\nBut it was not clear how much the class was going to do to help secure Bayan\u2019s Syrian identity. In English, she could read at \u201cCat in the Hat\u201d level, but her Arabic reading was worse, because the war had interrupted her schooling. Bayan was supposed to repeat the verses that a classmate was saying that day, but her partner did not speak Arabic, and Bayan could barely understand her. She was the only Syrian in the school.\nOther classmates\u2019 parents came from Algeria, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Mali. Half the population of Toronto is foreign-born, a reflection of Canada\u2019s openness to immigrants. In her apartment building, Bayan has friends whose families are from Israel and China.\nWhen her father picked her up, she could not take off her hijab fast enough. During lunch at home, as she chatted in English, he interjected: \u201cArabic!\u201d She continued in a mix of both.\nWhen she talked about the stick exercise, her father gave a look of recognition. \u201cI was Bayan\u2019s age when they told me the same story,\u201d he said.\nTheir childhoods seemed so disconnected from one another\u2019s. The family left Syria when Bayan was 7 or 8 \u2014 they had foundered in Jordan before coming to Canada \u2014 and her memories of the home where her family had lived for three generations were dimming.\nShe could picture playing hide-and-seek with her cousins by the fountain and grapevines in the courtyard, and recall the way an adjacent garden produced enough mint for the whole neighborhood. But Bayan and her sister could no longer agree on how many olive trees stood there: 20? 100? (Eight, their mother said.)\nAfter the Mohammads left Syria, the house next door was shelled or bombed and collapsed on their own home. It was ruined now, the second story gone. The sponsors helped them use Google Maps to try to find what was left, but no one could quite pinpoint it.\n\u201cI love that house,\u201d Bayan had said a few days before.\nSuddenly, her confidence and determination kicked in.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to build it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy siblings. All of us.\u201d"}, {"text": "Runners-Up From Our Third Annual Student Editorial Contest\n"}]
