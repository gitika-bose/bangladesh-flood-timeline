    "text": "Toll from Bangladesh cyclone reaches 3,100\n2007-11-19T05:00:00.000Z\nThe number of people left dead after the powerful cyclone that swept through Bangladesh last week rose Monday to 3,100, the government said, and the United Nations estimated that a million people had been left homeless, many of them in remote areas without predictable food supplies.\nThe Bangladesh Red Crescent had warned Sunday that the number of dead could conceivably be between 5,000 and 10,000, and other groups said Monday they would not be surprised by such a tally. But the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Monday that reports from officials who had been to the most affected areas led the organization to expect that the final toll would be in line with the government's official assessment.\nThe officially confirmed death toll from the cyclone reached 3,113, said Lieutenant Colonel Main Ullah Chowdhury, a spokesman of the army, according to The Associated Press. He added that 3,322 are injured and 1,063 missing.\nHe said reports were finally reaching the capital, Dhaka, from the storm-ravaged areas, which had been largely isolated because roads had been washed out and telephone lines had been knocked down, The AP reported.\n\"What we are seeing on the ground is not as horrifying,\" said Devendra Tak, a senior regional spokesman for the federation, who spoke from Khulna, a town in southern Bangladesh, after visiting some of the worst affected districts the furious cyclone had hit last week as it packed winds of 240 kilometers, or 140 miles, an hour. \"We don't see the level of destruction that we had feared earlier.\"\nTak said thousands of fishermen who had been missing along the coastal areas and presumed dead had begun to turn up in their villages.\n\"We are very optimistic that the overall disaster will not be on a very high level,\" Tak said by telephone.\nOther relief agencies said that they were waiting for a fuller picture to emerge and that the final death toll could still be significantly higher. Usha Mishra, a senior adviser at the UN World Food Program, said that food supplies had been severely disrupted, and that there was risk of famine.\nShe said the program had begun to distribute some food, including high energy biscuits.\nBut she said more serious emergency operations were being considered, including broader food distribution and rebuilding of homes.\n\"Shelter is the big need right now,\" she said. \"One million people have been turned homeless.\"\nShe said the cyclone had devastated farming land that had already been severely damaged by earlier flooding in August.\n\"We do face a prospect of some remote areas not getting some\" supplies, she said. \"We might see starvation in some areas.\"",

    "text": "Cyclone Sidr wreaks havoc in Bangladesh\n2007-11-16T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Packing winds of over 100 miles an hour, the furious cyclone that swept across the low-lying watery edges of southern Bangladesh late Thursday downed trees, sent mobile telephone towers crashing and swept away mud and thatch homes.\nThe government's acting secretary for disaster management, Ayub Mian, told reporters at a press conference in Dhaka that at least 350 people had been killed, while a private television station estimated the death toll to have crossed 500.\nLong vulnerable to nature's fury, Bangladesh stands to suffer even more from extreme weather events like this as a result of human-induced climate change, scientists say. It was too early for government officials and independent relief workers to quantify the total scale of damage, though it was clear that by Bangladeshi standards, the impact would likely be relatively low.\nIn 1991, a tropical storm claimed roughly 140,000 lives. Bangladeshi relief agencies have since then developed early warning systems and storm shelters to help people evacuate before disaster strikes.\nThe Associated Press reported that 650,000 people had moved out of their homes.\nThe storm weakened by Friday. Still, it brought distress to some of the most vulnerable people on Earth.\nPreliminary reports from the fragile delta regions of the Bay of Bengal indicated that rivers had swelled so high that water punched through mud embankments and washed away paddy and vegetable fields, ruining the year's earnings for peasants who live off of those lands.\nIn one district, called Shatkhira, according to local journalists, roughly 5,000 mud homes collapsed back into the ground. Local relief workers for Caritas, the Catholic relief agency, reported that an entire island in Barisal district was submerged under at least six feet of water and houses were blown away by winds.\nEven the capital, Dhaka, though not directly in the path of the storm, felt its punch. Electricity towers were down, darkening the entire country for several hours overnight, and much of Dhaka remained without power for most of the day Friday, which also pinched the water supply.\nRelief and rehabilitation efforts are likely to be a crucial test for the army-backed caretaker government in charge of Bangladesh.\nThe Indian side of the Bay of Bengal delta was largely spared. Government officials there estimated that 100,000 people had left their homes in search of safety, and while some trees and roofs had been blown away on the deltaic islands known as the Sunderbans, no casualties were reported and people had already begun returning home.\nThe United Nations Development Program, in pressing world leaders to take immediate steps to address climate change, argues that the increased frequency of droughts, floods and storms stands to hit the world's poor hardest and exacerbate poverty in places like Bangladesh. The agency is due to come out with details in its annual Human Development Report later this month.\nJulfikar Ali Manik contributed reporting from Dhaka.",

    "text": "After cyclone, Bangladesh faces political storm\n2007-11-26T05:00:00.000Z\nDHAKA \u2014 The political storm that preceded nature's latest assault on this country still swirls overhead.\nNearly a year into an army-backed state of emergency, basic freedoms remain suspended, a sweeping anti-corruption drive has stuffed the jails with some of Bangladesh's most influential business leaders and politicians and a fragile economy is tottering under the pressure of floods at home and rising oil prices abroad.\nThe soaring cost of food is potentially the most explosive challenge facing the military-backed government that has run this country since Jan. 11, when, after debilitating political protests, scheduled elections were scrapped and emergency law was imposed.\nClimbing inflation was compounded by an unusually harsh monsoon, which destroyed food crops along the flood plains in July. Then, the cyclone on Nov. 15 destroyed acres of rice paddy, ruined the shrimp farms that dot the southern coast and, according to the World Food Program, left roughly 2.3 million people in need of urgent food aid.\nCyclone relief is now the government's most pressing test, including averting famine and outbreaks of disease and ensuring that aid distribution is perceived to be fair and without corruption. The government estimates that six million people were affected by the storm.\n\"This is going to be the real defining challenge for them,\" Rehman Sobhan, the chairman of the Center for Policy Dialogue, an independent research group based in Dhaka, said of the administration. \"A huge effort is going to be required.\"\nBangladesh is among the world's poorest nations, with a Muslim-majority population of more than 140 million and nearly half of its youngest children suffering from malnutrition. Polls indicate that even before the cyclone, confidence in the government was declining.\nThe way the ordinary Bangladeshi is being pinched every day was on stark display the other day in a working-class quarter of Dhaka called Begunbari, a crowded warren of tenements amid the roar of factories that supply cheap clothes for sale abroad.\nAbdul Aziz, 63, a security guard who was buying vegetables at the local market, quietly confessed that even with three grown daughters working in the garment industry, his family was finding it harder to put enough food on the table.\nOn this afternoon, he bought half as many winter beans as he had hoped to and one small head of cauliflower instead of two. Those purchases, along with the staple rice and lentils, would have to feed his family of seven.\n\"We will make do,\" he said. \"Everyone will have a little bit.\"\nA tailor who serves the neighborhood said his business had plummeted from about 50 orders a day to barely a couple. Few can afford new clothes when the basics - onions, oil, cauliflower - have become so much costlier.\nFiroza Begum, the wife of a civil servant, said the government had failed to curb food prices, even as she gave it credit for cracking down on graft.\n\"They have caught some corrupt people - we can see that,\" she said. \"But we also want them to reduce prices of our daily needs, so we can somehow manage our households.\"\nShe said that she had all but given up buying milk and meat for her family because they were too expensive.\nIn her neighborhood, Election Commission workers were going door to door that afternoon taking names and addresses so they could compile a fresh list of those eligible to vote.\nFakhruddin Ahmed, the civilian leader of the country's caretaker administration, has promised national elections by the end of 2008. But exactly how soon elections will take place and under what circumstances remain mysteries, considering that several major politicians are in jail or in exile.\nThe leaders of the two top political parties, Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and Hasina Wazed of the Awami League, are in custody on various graft and extortion charges. Whether they will be allowed to take part in the election is anyone's guess.\nUnder emergency rule, the press is prohibited from publishing anything deemed \"provocative,\" and political activity is banned, including demonstrations. Holding a political meeting outdoors is punishable by up to five years in prison.\nThe restrictions were loosened slightly in September when indoor political meetings were allowed to resume, but only with permission from the police and with no more than 50 people in attendance.\nAccording to a monthly public perception survey by a consortium of civil society organizations called the Election Working Group, the share of Bangladeshis who expressed high confidence in the caretaker government fell between March and September, while the share of those who had low confidence sharply increased. This was true of respondents from \"ordinary\" and \"elite\" socioeconomic groups.\nIn the latest survey, conducted in face-to-face interviews in late September, the rising price of essential commodities was identified as the biggest concern. Even as the government got good marks for cracking down on corruption, respondents were divided about whether the government had any bearing on their daily lives: 42 percent said they were \"better off\" but about the same percentage said they were \"worse off or that there has been no change in their personal situation.\"\nThe government's anti-corruption crusade continues to be seen as a turning point for Bangladesh, which has consistently ranked at the bottom of the annual Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index.\nBank accounts have been frozen. Luxury cars have been impounded by the state or hidden indoors by their owners for fear they will be taken. Nearly 100 prominent politicians and businesspeople have been taken in for questioning, and an unknown number of people have been detained without charge, which is legal under the new emergency laws.\nA little more than a dozen have been convicted by anti-corruption courts and how quickly, or fairly, the other cases will be tried is unclear.\nIf entrenched corruption was seen as damaging the economy, the crackdown has also sent shocks through the private sector. The government appears to be retreating from its initial wide sweep and has recently released some detainees.\n\"Informally, the government wants some sort of reassurance for the business community that they will be allowed to function,\" said Akbar Ali Khan, a retired senior government official. He declined to grade the government's overall performance - criticizing the government is now a punishable offense - except to say that it was vital for the government to prepare for elections and restore business leaders' confidence in the country.\n\"The economic problems are very serious and acute,\" he said. \"These will have to be addressed with more vigor.\"\nAbdul Awal Mintoo, the chairman and chief executive of Miltimode Group, was among the most prominent millionaires taken into custody in May on a vague charge of destabilizing the government, then released six months later.\nMintoo said that while he was in custody he was interrogated less about his own assets than about what evidence he could furnish against Hasina, the Awami League leader and a former prime minister with whom Mintoo was friendly.\nA naturalized U.S. citizen, Mintoo returned to his native Bangladesh 27 years ago and established a number of businesses, from dealing in agricultural seeds to real estate. He estimates his assets in Bangladesh to be $30 million.\nMintoo, 58, insists that he did not bribe anyone in government in exchange for contracts. But he concedes that he did what he says everyone else has long had to do in this country: grease the wheels of politics and government to get basic things done, including installing a telephone line and getting imported machine parts out of customs.\nIf that were the grounds for his arrest, he said, then \"50 million people, every adult male\" should be arrested.\n\"It's aimless what they're doing,\" he said of the government in an interview, adding that he planned to divest himself of his investments in the country slowly.\n\"I'm not sure how this will end up. I don't want to take a risk and live in uncertainty. If you take blood out of the arteries,\" he added, \"it just paralyzes.\"\nThe only charge pending against Mintoo accuses him of extorting about $700 from a private citizen. Mintoo laughed at the charge, saying it was too paltry a sum for him to demand of anyone.",

Ferries were flung ashore like toy boats.\nAid organizations said they feared that food shortages and contaminated water could lead to widespread problems if people remain stranded.\nStorms batter impoverished, low-lying Bangladesh every year, often killing large numbers of people.\nThis time a government early warning program saved a vast number of lives, Renata Dessallien, the UN Development Program's resident coordinator said in a statement.\nHowever, property damage was massive. Many evacuees who returned home Saturday found their bamboo-and-straw huts flattened.\n\"We survived, but what we need now is help to rebuild our homes,\" said Chand Miah, a resident of the small island of Maran Char.\nAn estimated 2.7 million people were affected and 773,000 houses were damaged, according to the Ministry of Disaster Management. Roughly 250,000 cattle and poultry perished, and crops were destroyed along huge swaths of land.\nThe U.S. government has provided $2.1 million in initial emergency relief, according to the White House press secretary, Dana Perino. She said that the amphibious assault ships Essex and Kearsage were en route to Bangladesh to help with relief operations, and that the United States would airlift 35 tons of nonfood items such as plastic sheeting, hygiene kits and other supplies.",

    "text": "Water woes plague Bangladesh village hit by cyclone\n2007-11-21T05:00:00.000Z\nKANAINAGAR, Bangladesh \u2014 To the naked eye, it looks like Cyclone Sidr barely grazed this village. Most of the houses are standing. No one has died. The trees are not even decapitated, as they are in so many hamlets swallowed by the storm.\nBut in this part of the world, where life revolves around water, look more closely and see how the storm has fouled so much of everyday life. Paddy fields are waterlogged. Shrimp ponds are full of rotting debris. Women worry about what their children will drink once their pots of rainwater run out. Not enough water, too much water, dirty water. Water bedevils everyone.\nAid was trickling across the cyclone zone Wednesday, nearly a week after the disaster, also reaching this village, where a long line of supplicants were given sacks of rice, lentils and salt.\nThe country's neighbors - allies and rivals - seemed to fall over themselves to offer charity and succor. Pakistan, the country's former ruler, against whom Bangladesh fought a bitter war of independence in 1971, announced that it would send two military planes with medical supplies and blankets. India, for its part, said an air force cargo plane would arrive Thursday with 38 tons of relief materials.\nTwo U.S. Navy vessels were on their way and were expected to reach the area with helicopters as early as the end of the week. Saudi Arabia pledged $100 million earlier this week, the largest of all, until the World Bank on Wednesday offered $250 million. Whether and how soon the pledged support will materialize is a mystery.\nNeither the government nor aid agencies yet had an estimate on how much money was needed to meet the humanitarian need, except for a World Food Program assessment that found that $30 million would be needed just for the next three months of food.\nThe UN resident representative for Bangladesh, Renata Lok Dessallien, said food, water and shelter were the immediate relief needs, which were all the more acute for cyclone victims who were already poor, likely to be malnourished and vulnerable to disease.\nCyclone Sidr has cut a wide and debilitating swath through southern Bangladesh. The government estimates 4 million people were affected, and the full scope of its impact may not be truly felt for many weeks to come. By the Bangladesh Army's latest count, 3,167 people have died.\nSunita Mondol, 15, was already feeling its toll. She stood at the side of her family's pond Wednesday morning and found no more than two tiny shrimp clinging to her net. On a normal morning, she would haul a full basket and take it to the market to sell. But the storm had spoiled the pond, shaking the leaves and branches off of the trees and polluting the water, so much so that the shrimp died and floated belly-up. On the first morning after the storm, she and her family pulled up 6 kilograms, or 13 pounds, of dead fish. Most of it was thrown away.\nFamilies like hers, who make their living from selling the fish and shrimp they cultivate in their ponds, expect to feel the economic pinch of the cyclone for months to come. Every family in this village has a small pond. House after house complained that their ponds had been fouled.\nIn Pinjira Begum's two big ponds, she estimated that half her fish were floating belly-up, which meant that her daily earnings plummeted by nearly half. The moneylender came to her home last Saturday to collect his weekly payment.\n\"We told him we didn't have money to buy rice for the children,\" she said. She gave him half of what she owed. He cursed her and left, she said.\nSouthern Bangladesh is one of the world's most productive shrimp production areas, and shrimp is one of the country's largest exports to the United States.\nThe lucky ones here had some rainwater left in their traditional earthen pots. Those whose water had run out, or whose pots were broken, had to drink the pond water, which had turned salty from sea water and began to stink because of putrefying leaves.\nA rickshaw puller down the road wondered aloud how long it would be until dysentery struck. Even without a cyclone, he said, water brings a constant specter of disease. In the hot months, when the rainwater stores run out and the ponds start drying up, the people of Kanainagar suffer skin rash, dysentery and diarrhea.\n\"Water is our main problem,\" said Alamgir Hossain. \"People get too sick to work and still they have to buy medicine.\"\nAcross the Mongla River, Mohammed Nantu Mian worked feverishly to salvage what the water had not wrecked. His paddy field was flooded, just two weeks before the harvest was due. He had managed to drain some of the water by cutting channels in his fields. He hired workers to cut what paddy had not yet rotted. He figured a third of his crop was gone.\nNormally, Mian said, he sold half of what he produced, saving the rest for his own family and for seed next year. This year, he said, he could hope to feed his family, and not much more.",

    "text": "Poor in India hard hit by floods\n2007-08-16T05:00:00.000Z\nMALINAGAR, India \u2014 Losing everything he owns has become a routine disaster for Shankar, 25, a landless laborer in the northeastern state of Bihar, who this month saw his home and belongings destroyed in some of the worst floods to hit north India in decades.\n\"This is the third time I've lost my house in the rains,\" he said, standing in water, peering into the shell of his home, hopeful of salvaging something from the ruins. \"This year the rains were worse, and the waters are deeper. But in the end it's the same. I have nothing left.\"\nOnly the roof of his thatch house was visible above the muddy green waters that turned his village of Malinagar into a lagoon two weeks ago. Beneath the rippling surface, the straw walls have slipped over and his stock of grain for the winter, his clothes, furniture and children's possessions are slowly rotting.\nThe monsoon rains in India are a democratic force. When the skies open, the water pours on the homes of rich and poor alike. But after the deluge, the poor always suffer most.\nBihar is the most backward state in India, barely touched by the soaring growth and new economic confidence of the major cities. Yet there are gradations within this poverty, and sub-classes of richer and poorer co-exist. The richer residents of Malinagar still have their homes, made from sturdy brick and concrete. Some managed to shelter on their flat roofs, when the flood came at the start of the month. The poorer, living in shacks without electricity, at the exposed edges of the village, had to flee to roughly made shelters on higher land.\nThose with a few hundred rupees to spare were able to buy plastic sheeting from the market, which they slung between bamboo poles to protect their families against the lashing rain. Others had only the scant cover offered by saris and stitched-together sacks. The most ill-prepared huddled beneath plantain leaves. Later they witnessed their own flimsy homes sink beneath the waters, disintegrating in the currents.\nThis week the flood began receding, replaced by a stinking, stagnating sludge, but villages remain cut off, and many of those houses that have re-emerged are uninhabitable. Hundreds of thousands of people are still sheltering beneath bed sheets along the raised highways crisscrossing the state, just inches away from the traffic, which grinds past, splattering them with mud. Life cannot yet begin again for most of the 14 million that the United Nations estimates have been affected by the crisis in Bihar.\nUnicef officials said Thursday that about 2,800 people in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan have died since the monsoon season began from drowning, waterborne illnesses, snakebites or hunger. But for most, the real endurance test is just beginning. With crops destroyed and fields bloated with water, there will be no agricultural work for millions of landless laborers here for many months, leaving them to rely on the sporadic support of aid agencies and government relief organizations. Unicef said it was concerned by the prospect of worsening child malnutrition.\nIn a certain light, in the lull between the storms, Malinagar becomes a mirage of watery beauty. Beyond the shells of drowned houses, the floodwaters from the burst Bagmati River stretch as far as the eye can see. A month ago, the lake was a parched wheat field. Now village girls sit like mermaids, combing their hair, half-submerged beneath the calm lake waters, cooling themselves; children shriek with excitement as they splash by the shores.\nBut Shankar, who goes by only one name, finds nothing to rejoice at. He is familiar with the deprivation that follows the flood. His wife and two daughters, 6 and 1, live on the wages he earns as a laborer in the fields.\n\"There is no work, so there is no money,\" he said. \"I'm worried about how the children will eat. Even now we are eating dry bread with salt. It's very sad for the children to live like that.\"\nThe village leader, Vijay Sharma, said those with the least to lose had lost the most. \"The richer villagers have ways of working things out. The poorest will not get any work for months more. I don't know how they are going to survive,\" he said.\nAt a national level, the plight of these flood victims attracts little compassion. Early this month, when the United Nations declared these floods the worst in living memory, the miserable condition of the 31 million affected in India was widely covered internationally but was neither front-page news in Delhi newspapers nor featured on national news channels. Instead, bulletins were dominated by the sentencing of a Bollywood star to jail. In one paper, flood coverage was restricted to a short piece on animals being evacuated from a wildlife park.\nSuch apathy is not unusual. English-language newspapers in India often neglect the suffering of the rural poor, more preoccupied with the triumphs of the emerging India than the familiar stories of extreme hardship experienced by hundreds of millions of Indians living on the land.\nEven within the government, attempts to implement a national flood prevention policy have been half-hearted. The official Web site for the Water Resources Ministry states that a National Flood Commission was established in 1976 to draw up a \"coordinated\" and \"scientific\" approach to the problem, but added: \"Though the report was submitted in 1980 and accepted by government, not much progress has been made in the implementation of its recommendations.\"\nSaifuddin Soz, the Indian water resources minister, said that the suggestions of a more recent 2004 task force on flood prevention had also not been implemented because of funding shortages. He said he was hopeful that more resources might be granted as a result of the severe flooding this year. \"Once the crisis is over I will be calling on the cabinet to create a national commission for flood management,\" he said.\nAmong the homeless, waiting for the waters to dry up, there was less optimism.\nAcross Bihar, memories remain fresh of Gautam Goswami, a government official named as one of \"Asia's heroes\" by Time magazine for his \"brilliant\" coordination relief operations after the 2004 floods, who later was accused of embezzling $2 million in flood relief money. The state's reputation for official corruption is well-entrenched, and local journalists question whether money allocated for repairing the river banks was ever spent.\nVictims say the government response this year was slow. When the floods broke, the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, was touring Mauritius. When he returned a week later he was pelted with stones by flood victims, furious at his extended absence. This week there was rioting at two distribution camps in Bihar as the homeless fought for food aid. The police beat one flood survivor to death.\nManohar Paswan, 45, stared across the water at the rubble that used to be his house, his head shaven out of respect for the youngest of his seven children, a 6-month-old boy, Nitish, who died a week ago Thursday after being bitten by one of the poisonous snakes that thrive in the floodwaters. Marooned, there was no way of getting help and Nitish soon died. Now, with no prospect of work, Paswan is concerned at how his family will eat in the months to come.\n\"Government help is nowhere to be seen,\" he said.",

    "text": "Spared Cyclone\u2019s Worst, Area Still Suffers\n2007-11-22T05:00:00.000Z\nKANAINAGAR, Bangladesh, Nov. 21 \u2014 To the naked eye, this looks like a village that Cyclone Sidr barely grazed. Most of the houses are standing. No one has died. The trees are not even decapitated, as they are in so many hamlets swallowed by the storm.\nBut in this part of the world, where life revolves around water, look more closely and see how the storm has fouled so much of everyday life. Rice fields are waterlogged. Shrimp ponds have rotted. Women worry what their children will drink once their pots of rainwater run out. Not enough water, too much water, dirty water. Water bedevils everyone.\nAid began to trickle in across the cyclone zone on Wednesday, nearly a week after the storm. In this village, a long line of supplicants received sacks of rice, lentils and salt, and the country\u2019s neighbors, allies and rivals seemed to fall over themselves to offer charity and succor.\n Pakistan, the country\u2019s former ruler, which Bangladesh fought a bitter war of independence against in 1971, announced that it would send two military planes full of medical supplies and blankets. India said that an air force cargo plane would arrive Thursday with 38 tons of aid.\nTwo United States Navy vessels were en route and expected to arrive with helicopters within days. Saudi Arabia pledged $100 million early this week, the largest amount, until the World Bank offered $250 million on Wednesday. Whether and how soon the pledged support will materialize is a mystery.\nNeither the government nor aid agencies had an estimate on how much money was necessary to meet the humanitarian need, but a World Food Program assessment found that $30 million would be required for food just for the next three months. The United Nations resident representative for Bangladesh, Renata Lok Dessalien, said food, water and shelter were the immediate needs, and were all the more acute for cyclone victims who were already poor, likely to be malnourished and vulnerable to disease.\nCyclone Sidr cut a wide and debilitating swath through southern Bangladesh. The government estimates that four million people have been affected, and the full scope of its impact may not be felt for many weeks. By the Bangladeshi Army\u2019s latest count, 3,167 people have died.\nIn Kanainagar, near Dhaka, the capital, Sunita Mondol, 15, was feeling the cyclone\u2019s toll. She stood at the side of her family\u2019s pond Wednesday morning and found no more than two tiny shrimps clinging to her net. On a normal morning, she would haul in a full basket and take it to the market to sell. \nBut the storm had spoiled the pond, shaking the leaves and branches from the trees and fouling the water, so much that the shrimps died and floated belly up. On the first morning after the storm, Sunita and her family pulled up more than 13 pounds of dead fish. They threw most away.\nFamilies like hers, who make their living from selling the fish and shrimps they cultivate in their ponds, expect to feel the economic pinch of the cyclone for months. Every family in this village has a small pond, and family after family complained of theirs having been fouled.\nHalf of the fish in Pinjira Begum\u2019s two big ponds floated belly up, which meant that her daily earnings plummeted by nearly half. The moneylender came to her home last Saturday for his weekly payment. \u201cWe told him we didn\u2019t have money to buy rice for the children,\u201d she said. She gave him half of what she owed. He cursed her and left.\nSouthern Bangladesh is one of the world\u2019s most productive shrimp hubs. Shrimp is one of the country\u2019s largest exports to the United States.\nThe lucky ones here had rainwater left in their traditional earthen pots. Those whose water had run out, or whose pots had broken, had to drink the pond water, which had turned salty from seawater and had begun to stink from putrefying leaves.\nA rickshaw puller down the road wondered aloud how long it would be until dysentery struck. Even without a cyclone, he said, water brings a constant specter of disease. \nIn the hot months, when the rainwater stores run out and the ponds start drying up, the people of Kanainagar suffer rashes, dysentery and diarrhea. The cyclone made a chronic concern potentially acute. \n\u201cWater is our main problem,\u201d said Alamgir Hossain. \u201cPeople get too sick to work, and still they have to buy medicine.\u201d\nAcross the Mongla River, Muhammad Nantu Mian worked feverishly to salvage what the water had not wrecked. His rice field was flooded, just two weeks before the harvest was due. The stalks were blown down like scarecrows by the brute wind. He had drained some of the water by cutting channels in his fields. He hired workers to cut what rice stalks had not yet rotted. He figured a third of his crop was gone.\nNormally, Mr. Mian said, he sold half of what he produced, saving the rest for his own family and for next year\u2019s seeds. This year, he said, he could reasonably hope to be able to feed his family, and not much more.",

    "text": "After the Deluge, the Reality of Deprivation\n2007-08-22T04:00:00.000Z\nMALINAGAR, India \u2014 Losing everything he owns has become a routine disaster for Shankar, a landless laborer in the northeastern state of Bihar who saw his home and belongings destroyed in some of the worst floods to hit the north of India in decades. \n \u201cThis is the third time I\u2019ve lost my house in the rains,\u201d he said, standing in the water and peering into the shell of his home, hopeful of salvaging something from the ruins. \u201cThis year the rains were worse, and the waters are deeper. But in the end it\u2019s the same. I have nothing left.\u201d\nOnly the thatch roof of his house was visible above the muddy waters that turned his village of Malinagar into a lagoon in August. Beneath the rippling surface, the straw walls had caved in and his stock of grain for the winter, clothes, furniture and possessions were slowly rotting. \n The monsoon rains in India are a democratic force. When the skies open, the water pours on the homes of rich and poor alike. But after the deluge, the poor always suffer most. \nOn Aug. 16, Unicef officials said that about 2,800 people in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan had died since the monsoon season began, from drowning, waterborne illnesses, snakebites or hunger. \nBut for survivors, the real endurance test is just beginning. With crops destroyed and fields bloated with water, there will be no agricultural work for millions of landless laborers here for months, leaving them to rely on the sporadic support of aid agencies and government relief organizations. Unicef said it was concerned about the prospect of worsening child malnutrition. \nBihar is the least developed state in India, barely touched by the booming growth and new economic confidence of the major cities. Yet there are gradations within this poverty, and subclasses of richer and poorer. \nThe wealthier residents of Malinagar still have their homes, made from sturdy brick and concrete. Some managed to find shelter on their flat roofs when the flooding began here at the beginning of August. The poorer, living in shacks without electricity at the exposed edges of the village, had to flee to roughly made shelters on higher ground. \n The floodwaters began receding in mid-August, replaced by a stinking, stagnant sludge, but villages remained cut off, and many of those houses that have re-emerged are uninhabitable. Hundreds of thousands of people are sheltered beneath bed sheets along raised highways, just inches away from the traffic, which grinds past, splattering them with mud. Life cannot yet begin again for most of the 14 million people that the United Nations estimates have been affected by the crisis in Bihar. \n In certain lights, in the lull between storms, Malinagar becomes a mirage of watery beauty. Beyond the shells of flooded houses, the waters from the burst Bagmati River stretch as far as the eye can see. In July, the lake was a parched wheat field. Now village girls sit like mermaids, combing their hair, half-submerged in the calm waters; children shriek with excitement as they splash along the shore. \n But Shankar, who goes by only one name, finds nothing to rejoice about. The 25-year-old is familiar with the deprivation that follows the flood. His wife and two daughters, 1 and 6 years old, live on the wages he earns as a laborer in the fields. \n \u201cThere is no work, so there is no money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about how the children will eat. Even now we are eating dry bread with salt. It\u2019s very sad for the children to live like that.\u201d \n The village leader, Vijay Sharma, said those with the least to lose had lost the most. \u201cThe richer villagers have ways of working things out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe poorest will not get any work for months more. I don\u2019t know how they are going to survive.\u201d \n At a national level, the plight of these flood victims arouses little compassion. In early August, when the United Nations declared the floods the worst in living memory, the miserable condition of the 31 million people affected in India was covered internationally but was neither front-page news in New Delhi newspapers nor featured on national news channels. Instead, bulletins were dominated by the sentencing of a Bollywood star to jail.\n Such apathy is not unusual. Newspapers in India often neglect the suffering of the rural poor, more preoccupied with the triumphs of the emerging India than with the familiar stories of extreme hardship experienced by hundreds of millions of Indians living on the land. \n Even within the government, attempts to implement a national flood prevention policy have been halfhearted. Saifuddin Soz, the Indian water resources minister, said he hoped that more resources might be granted as a result of the severe flooding this year. \u201cOnce the crisis is over I will be calling on the cabinet to create a national commission for flood management,\u201d he said. \n Among the homeless, waiting for the waters to dry up, there was little optimism. Manohar Paswan, 45, stared across the water at the rubble that used to be his house, his head shaven out of respect for the youngest of his seven children, a 6-month-old boy, Nitish, who died in the second week of August, bitten by one of the poisonous snakes that thrive in the floodwaters. Marooned, there was no way of getting help. Now, Mr. Paswan is concerned about how his family will eat. \u201cGovernment help is nowhere to be seen,\u201d he said. ",

Germany swung from its driest April since country-wide observations started in 1901 to its wettest May on record. And torrential rains have followed weeks of severe drought in northern Bulgaria - officials said Tuesday that at least seven people have been killed in floods.\nMozambique suffered its worst floods in six years in February, followed by a tropical cyclone the same month. Flooding of the Nile River in June caused damage in Sudan.\nIn May, Uruguay had its worst flooding since 1959.\nIn June, the Arabian Sea had its first documented cyclone, which touched Oman and Iran.\nTemperatures also strayed from the expected this year. Records were broken in southeastern Europe in June and July, and in western and central Russia in May. In many European countries, April was the warmest ever recorded.\nArgentina and Chile saw unusually cold winter temperatures in July while South Africa had its first significant snowfall since 1981 in June.\nThe World Meteorological Organization and its 188 member states are working to set up an early warning system for extreme weather events. The agency also wants to improve monitoring of the impacts of climate change, particularly in poorer countries that are expected to bear the brunt of floods.\nAs exceptionally heavy rains continued to cut a wide swath of ruin across northern India, a top UN official warned Tuesday that climate change could destroy vast swaths of farmland in the country, ultimately affecting food production and adding to the problems of already desperate peasants, The New York Times reported from New Delhi.\nEven a small increase in temperatures, said Jacques Diouf, head of the Food and Agricultural Organization, could push down crop yields in the world's southern regions, even as agricultural productivity goes up in the north. A greater frequency of droughts and floods, one of the hallmarks of climate change, the agency added, could be particularly bad for agriculture.\n\"Rain-fed agriculture in marginal areas in semi-arid and sub-humid regions is mostly at risk,\" Diouf said. \"India could lose 125 million tons of its rain-fed cereal production - equivalent to 18 percent of its total production.\" That is a sign of the steep human and economic impact of extreme weather in India.",

The United Nations estimated that a million people had been left homeless, many of them in remote areas without predictable food supplies.\nThe Bangladesh Red Crescent Society warned Sunday that the number of dead could conceivably be 5,000 to 10,000, and the United Nations World Food Program said yesterday that it would not be surprised by such a tally. But yesterday the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said that reports from its officials who had been to the hardest-hit areas led the organization to expect a final toll in line with the government\u2019s official assessment.\n\u201cWhat we are seeing on the ground is not as horrifying,\u201d said Devendra Tak, a senior regional spokesman for the federation, who spoke from Khulna, a town in southern Bangladesh, after visiting some of the districts that took the worst pounding from the cyclone, which had winds of more than 100 miles an hour. \u201cWe don\u2019t see the level of destruction that we had feared earlier.\u201d \nMr. Tak said thousands of fishermen who had been missing along the coastal areas and presumed dead had begun to turn up in their villages. \u201cWe are very optimistic that the overall disaster will not be on a very high level,\u201d Mr. Tak said by telephone. \nThe United Nations said that it was waiting for a fuller picture to emerge and that the final death toll could still be significantly higher. Usha Mishra, a senior adviser at the United Nations World Food Program, said food supplies had been severely disrupted, creating a risk of famine.\nShe said the program had begun to distribute food and that more serious emergency operations were being considered, including broader food distribution and rebuilding of homes. \u201cShelter is the big need right now,\u201d she said. \u201cOne million people have been turned homeless.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s officially confirmed death toll from the cyclone reached 3,113, said Lt. Col. Main Ullah Chowdhury, a spokesman for the army, according to The Associated Press. ",

    "text": "In Bangladesh, picking through the pieces\n2007-11-20T05:00:00.000Z\nKHATACHIRA, Bangladesh \u2014 The wind whipped through the sky. The river swelled above the tree line. And in a flash, Mamataz Begum's youngest child, barely 2 years old, was swept from her arms, as a tidal wave smashed through the fragile mud homes of this village and scooped up everything in its watery arms.\nIn this hamlet on the southernmost fringe of Bangladesh, cut by rivers that empty into the Bay of Bengal, nothing was spared by the cyclone that ripped through here last Thursday. Barely a single house was standing; they were all made of mud and they simply collapsed into the earth. The meager food stocks of the village had washed away. Fishing boats and nets, a principal source of income here, were gone. The paddies had filled up with brackish water, which meant there would be no harvest.\nOn Tuesday, animal carcasses, stinking and bloated, lay scattered along the river bank. There was no drinking water left. A small bag of food from the government, the sole aid so far for this village of about 1,000 families, had run out.\nThe people of Khatachira are a testament to the bittersweet blessings of the latest natural calamity to befall Bangladesh. Relatively speaking, the death toll from the cyclone was small \u2014 nearly 3,500 according to latest official count, roughly double the death toll of Hurricane Katrina but far less than the 140,000 killed in 1991 after the last cyclone hit Bangladesh. In large measure, that was because of an early warning system that had announced the storm and had urged people to head to shelters.\nBut in claiming relatively few lives, it left many more people in utter ruin. The government estimates that about 4 million people have been affected.\n\"The crisis is just beginning,\" said Suman Islam, humanitarian assistance coordinator with the aid agency Care, which had sent its first relief assessment team here Tuesday afternoon. \"We have saved lives. But now, the challenge is the same.\"\nIn Khatachira, near the edge of the Sunderbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, villagers have so far buried 57 of their own, nearly half of them children under age 10. Many probably died because they could not swim or cling to trees. On Tuesday morning another body, that of a local woman, was found in the bush of a neighboring village; she had yet to be brought home for burial. All but seven people had been accounted for.\nAn old man who lost his entire family was searching for the bodies of his two grandchildren. Another old man said his granddaughter, age 8, was still missing. A woman with a hideous gash on her right foot \u2014 from a piece of tin roofing that fell and sliced her skin \u2014 said four in her family had been killed, and five were left to carry on.\nThe nearest cyclone shelter was about two and a half miles away, and it had swelled well past capacity by the time most people in this village were ready to evacuate. One woman even went to the shelter, went home after it seemed that the storm was not coming, and was killed.\n\"See over there, that was our house,\" said Muhammad Himayat, pointing at an open stretch of paddy. The house is gone, along with two dozen goats, two cows and three fishing boats that together were the family's livelihood. \"It is all river now.\"\nThis is what the villagers said among themselves:\n\"Where's Salem?\" one man asked.\n\"He lost his son,\" someone responded.\n\"Has the grandson been found?\"\n\"No.\"\nScientists studying climate change in this part of the world say they expect extreme weather, including cyclones and powerful tropical storms, to rise in frequency here. And the United Nations has increasingly warned of the high toll these disasters exact on the poor.\nThe survivors of Cyclone Sidr are among the poorest of the poorest, in one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world.\nDysentery was the next demon that aid workers were guarding against. In this watery land, clean drinking water is in short supply. There are only a few water wells. The ponds, from which many villagers get their drinking water, are contaminated with rotting leaves and animals. Toilets are rare, and the practice of defecating in the fields makes it much easier for disease to spread.\nThe government has appealed for international aid and in a rare gesture, opened its visa gates to foreigners, including journalists. Officials said relief workers and the military had reached the last remaining pockets of the devastated areas on Tuesday, Reuters reported.\nBut food supplies remained woefully inadequate. \"Hundreds of hands go up to grab just one food packet,\" said a relief worker in the Patuakhali district.\nDonor countries have pledged $142 million in emergency aid. The United Nations World Food Program has distributed nearly 100 tons of high-energy biscuits, and was to begin delivering rice on Friday. The United States has offered two C-130 transport planes and two amphibious naval vessels with helicopters.\nBut delivering aid to places like Khatachira is not easy. Getting here means a long drive, crossing a narrow river whose only ferry has been destroyed, driving through a fetid market town that smells of dead flesh and taking a two-hour boat ride along the Baleshwar River, afloat with dead goats and ducks.\nAlong the journey, one can see evidence of life limping back. A village government office, relatively untouched, has placed its documents on the front porch to dry. A remote college had its roof and walls blown off, but someone has neatly arranged the desks. The roads had been cleared of fallen logs. Banana trees and palms lay crumpled, like victims of an all-night brawl.\nThe day after the cyclone, villagers here had hoisted red flags at the edge of the hamlet. Aid workers had been slow to arrive but those who had were besieged by villagers, who knew that only in narrating their losses could they expect to gain anything.\nOn the edge of the water, near a tree whose roots were barely hanging onto the earth, stood a couple of cooking pots \u2014 remnants of Mamataz Begum's kitchen. Her son's body had washed up in another village, and they brought his corpse here. Her other children survived. Her husband broke his leg as he swam through the waves.\nOn Tuesday, she was still dazed, and had no idea where the family's next meal would come from.\n\"If God will feed us, we will eat,\" she said.",

    "text": "Bearing Aid, U.S. Vows to Tread Lightly in Bangladesh\n2007-11-24T05:00:00.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh, Nov. 23 \u2014 As an American warship with more than 3,000 troops arrived off the coast of Bangladesh to help deliver food, water and medicine to the most remote corners of this cyclone-battered country, United States military officials took pains on Friday to say they would not take any steps that might seem intrusive.\nSpeaking to reporters, Adm. Timothy J. Keating, the commander of American forces in the Pacific, said American troops would work alongside Bangladeshi troops and make joint decisions about where American military assets would be helpful.\n\u201cThis is not a U.S.-only operation; it\u2019s in support of Bangladeshi operations,\u201d he said at a news briefing after meeting with Bangladeshi Army officials here in Dhaka, the capital. \u201cWe are not just going to come storming ashore.\u201d\nThe approach illustrated how tricky it has become for American troops to deliver even humanitarian aid to a friendly Muslim-majority nation.\nThe Bangladeshi Army\u2019s chief of general staff, Maj. Gen. Sina Ibn Jamali, acknowledged that there was \u201csensitivity\u201d to American military involvement in the nation\u2019s relief operations. He said the Americans had been invited because his own military-backed government lacked the aircraft, in particular, to distribute aid swiftly to areas that needed it most. \n\u201cThey will be working with us, uniform and uniform,\u201d the general said.\nThe Associated Press reported that members of a small Islamist group, Hizb ut-Tahrir, protested the American military presence after Friday Prayer at Dhaka\u2019s largest state-run mosque. \nThe American vessel, Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship equipped with 20 helicopters and three landing craft that can maneuver in coastal areas, was stationed Friday about 30 miles off the southern coast of Bangladesh.\nUnited States military officials said that only a handful of American troops would be on Bangladeshi soil at any time, with most marines and Navy personnel staying aboard the Kearsarge and coming ashore to deliver supplies. Admiral Keating said the troops would stay as long as they were needed. \nA second American ship was on its way, packed mostly with supplies. The Americans said they expected to start delivering aid as early as Saturday.\nThe Kearsarge arrived as aid workers warned of an imminent risk of water-borne disease from the Nov. 15 cyclone and, eventually, a worsening of childhood malnutrition, which already hovers around 48 percent, according to Unicef.\nAlthough the cyclone\u2019s death toll was put at nearly 3,200, according to Bangladeshi Army officials, with 1,700 more people still missing, the government estimated that the storm had affected more than six million Bangladeshis by destroying homes, fields and fish ponds.\nThe Bangladeshi military continued to ferry food and clothing to the cyclone zone. On Friday afternoon, a Russian-made Mi-17 helicopter made its last run to a small town called Nalcity, where the cyclone had uprooted tall trees, blown off tin roofs and flattened acres of rice fields.\nThe birds scattered and the dust blew furiously as the helicopter descended, bearing dried dates and biscuits as well as saris and lungis, the basic clothing for Bangladeshi women and men.",

    "text": "Death toll at 2,300 in Bangladesh cyclone\n2007-11-18T05:00:00.000Z\nBARGUNA, Bangladesh \u2014 Hungry survivors scrambled for food Sunday as rescue workers cleared fallen trees and twisted roofs from roads to reach remote villages after a cyclone battered Bangladesh, leaving more than 2,300 dead and thousands homeless.\nRelief officials warned that the death toll could jump as rescuers reach more isolated areas.\nTeams from international aid organizations worked with army troops in a massive rescue effort that attracted help from around the world. But relief items - tents, rice, water - were slow to reach many survivors.\nThe death toll from Tropical Cyclone Sidr, the worst storm to hit the country in a decade, rose to at least 2,300 as officials made contact with coastal regions that had been cut off by the storm, said Selina Shahid of the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management.\nThe Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, warned that the toll could hit 10,000 once rescuers reached outlying islands.\nMuhammad Abdur Rob, chairman of the society, said the estimate came from the assessments of thousands of volunteers taking part in the rescue operations across the battered region.\nOn the devastated coast, rescue workers struggled to reach many survivors.\n\"I've been here waiting for hours for something to eat,\" said Asad Ali, a 45-year-old farmer in Barguna, one of the hardest-hit districts. \"What I've got so far are a few cookies. Not enough.\"\nHe said he received the cookies from a helicopter dropping packages of food. The aircraft have attracted mobs of people swarming below every time one is spotted.\nGovernment officials defended the relief efforts and expressed confidence that authorities are up to the task.\n\"We have enough food and water,\" said Shahidul Islam, the top official in Bagerhat, a battered district close to Barguna. \"We are going to overcome the problem.\"\nThe disaster management secretary, Aiyub Bhuiyan, met Sunday with representatives from the United Nations and international aid groups to discuss the emergency response.\nThe government said it had allocated $5.2 million in emergency aid for rebuilding houses. Many foreign governments and international groups have pledged to help, including the United States, which offered $2.1 million and the United Nations, which promised $7 million. The United States also plans to ship 35 tons of nonfood items such as plastic sheeting and hygiene kits, said the White House press secretary, Dana Perino.\nMany evacuees crowded onto ferries and trudged down sludge-filled roads to return home for the first time since the storm hit Thursday.\n\"I have had no news of my family since Wednesday, as the mobile phones are down,\" said Golam Rasul, who was traveling to see his mother and brother in Bagerhat district.",

They also carried the same picture of President Hu Jintao visiting Kazakhstan and a piece about China deepening cooperation with its neighbors, laid out identically.\n\"It's like going back 30 years,\" remarked one Beijing journalism professor, who asked not to be identified.\nA military offensive in the southern Philippines may prompt Al Qaeda-linked militants to sow terror elsewhere in the country, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo warned Tuesday, saying she had ordered the military and police to bolster security.\nU.S.-backed troops used artillery to bombard Muslim rebel strongholds on Basilan Island on Sunday, a day after 15 marines were killed in a fierce clash, officials said. The military said that about 40 Abu Sayyaf insurgents were killed in the fighting, including two commanders who allegedly took part in the beheadings last month of 10 marines on Basilan.\nClasses and exams were postponed in Bangladesh's biggest university on Tuesday after about 100 students were injured overnight in a campus battle with security forces, officials and witnesses said.\nThe violence erupted Monday evening after the students protested against the presence of army troops at a stadium at Dhaka University during a sports event, they said. The troops assaulted some protesters, fueling unrest that soon spread across the 40,000-student campus. Hundreds of police officers rushed in, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the witnesses said. The students hit back with sticks and stones.\nTOKYO: The police and aviation officials began examining the charred shell of a China Airlines jet in southern Japan on Tuesday. The plane exploded Monday just seconds after the 165 people aboard escaped. The inquiry has so far focused on a theory that a fuel leak from the right engine may have caused the explosion.",

    "text": "Bangladeshis in Queens Say Their Trust in a Countryman Cost Them \n2007-10-30T04:00:00.000Z\nThe promises and politeness were too much for Khurshid Anwar to resist.\nHe was told that an investment of tens of thousands of dollars could be spun into millions. That despite his poor credit history and low income, home ownership was a realistic possibility. \nMr. Anwar, 51, might have been a bit na\u00efve, but he says he had no reason to mistrust the man who was courting him, Jacob Milton. After all, Mr. Milton, 41, was a fellow immigrant from Bangladesh, who called Mr. Anwar a big brother, visited his home, and gave him food and even a job.\nMr. Anwar says he did not know that Mr. Milton had approached many of his countrymen with the same friendly flair, and that many would eventually have the same complaint: that they had been defrauded. \n\u201cHe plays with everybody,\u201d Mr. Anwar said during an interview at the home in Woodside, Queens, that he bought through Mr. Milton.\nMr. Milton was arraigned in State Supreme Court in Queens on Oct. 16 on several counts, including identity theft, scheming to defraud and grand larceny involving at least four people. Prosecutors also charged Nira Niru, another Bangladeshi immigrant, with helping Mr. Milton in his activities, at a mortgage office Mr. Milton managed in Jackson Heights.\nMr. Milton\u2019s lawyer, Sally Butler, said yesterday that the entire story had not yet been told, but she declined to comment further. Mr. Milton, who is still in police custody, is scheduled to appear in court today for a status conference. \nSince the initial complaint against Mr. Milton and Ms. Niru, about 30 people, most of them Bangladeshi, have come forward to accuse Mr. Milton of defrauding them, according to Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. \nProsecutors say that they are not surprised and that the case underscores an all-too-common trend, of immigrants who prey on their own. \n\u201cI think it is indeed prevalent,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a case of the victims trusting individuals who share the same backgrounds and the same ethnicity as they do. These are people that they feel comfortable with.\u201d Though Mr. Anwar is not part of the initial complaint against Mr. Milton, he has gone to the police and he has a suit pending against Mr. Milton, accusing him of failing to repay $65,000 he had given him to invest in real estate. \nThe latest prosecution follows two other cases in which people from Bangladesh have been accused by prosecutors in Queens of stealing from their countrymen, for whom Jackson Heights, with its many Bangladeshi stores and restaurants, is a cultural center.\nIn March, the Queens district attorney\u2019s office charged a woman with defrauding three Bangladeshi real estate investors of more than $600,000 in cash and property. In April, 10 Bangladeshis operating a mortgage company with offices in Forest Hills and Jackson Heights were charged with participating in a plan to defraud several lenders. \nMr. Brown said it was important to emphasize that the issue was not unique to the Bangladeshi community, a point echoed by community leaders. \n\u201cEvery country has good people and bad people,\u201d said Dilafroz Ahmed, the president of a group called the Bangladesh Society. \u201cThe bad portion is very nominal.\u201d \nThere were more than 24,000 Bangladeshis living in New York City last year, with most of them, nearly 13,500, living in Queens, according to the Census Bureau. \nMr. Milton, a resident of Port Washington in Nassau County, was fairly well known in the Bangladeshi community, in part because he was the host of a Bangladeshi talk show on local-access cable television. \nAccording to court papers, he had two aliases, Sabbirul Haque Talukder and Mohammed Saber, under which he owned multiple homes. Ms. Niru also had multiple aliases, the authorities say. \nMr. Anwar met Mr. Milton more than three years ago through a friend he often visited in the building where Mr. Milton worked. Mr. Anwar said that Mr. Milton quickly befriended him, visiting his home and sometimes bringing him food. He said Mr. Milton told him he resembled his older brother, so they referred to each other as brothers.\n\u201cHe came to my house and he\u2019s talking like a family member,\u201d Mr. Anwar said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m your family. Don\u2019t worry. I make you profit. I give you money.\u2019\u201d\nIn August 2004, Mr. Anwar said, he wrote an initial check for $10,000 to Mr. Milton to invest for him in real estate. Mr. Anwar, who owned a South Asian video store in Jackson Heights that was about to go out of business, said he had been promised lucrative returns. \nAt the same time, Mr. Anwar said, Mr. Milton talked him into buying a house. He said Mr. Milton told him that for a fee of $25,000 he could take care of Mr. Anwar\u2019s credit issues and get him a house with no down payment. Mr. Anwar said that in addition to that fee, Mr. Milton asked for $40,000 in closing costs, and Mr. Anwar bought the two-family home for $600,000 in November 2004.\nA few months later, Mr. Anwar said, Mr. Milton offered him a job at a new mortgage office Mr. Milton was opening in Jackson Heights. Mr. Anwar said that Mr. Milton paid him very little and that he never saw any of the money he was promised for his real estate investments. So he quit the job after three months and stopped dealing with Mr. Milton. \nMr. Anwar is currently unemployed. His wife works at a Duane Reade drugstore and his 19-year-old son delivers pizza, but the family income is not enough to keep up mortgage payments on the house, which they are now trying to sell. They get by on credit cards and loans from family members, he said.\n\u201cThe bad thing is we trust too much,\u201d said Nasima Khatun, Mr. Anwar\u2019s wife, referring to Bangladeshi people.\nMr. Anwar, who said he had been a journalist in Bangladesh and fled to the United States in 1998 after his editor was murdered, said he was especially quick to trust Mr. Milton because they were from the same country. \u201cI am sad,\u201d Mr. Anwar said, \u201cbecause I lost everything. I lost my house. I lost my money.\u201d\nSeveral other Bangladeshis who have dealt with Mr. Milton described similar solicitations. They said that he would lure them with dreams of becoming millionaires, treat them to food and call them family members. Most of them, like Mr. Anwar, were on unstable financial footing when they met him.\nBut one of them, Mohammed Zaman of Woodside, proved to be a tough sell. He said that after he had been working for Mr. Milton for about two months, Mr. Milton told him that instead of paying him he wanted to buy several houses in his name, sell them and share the profits. At that point, Mr. Zaman said, he quit. \n\u201cI don\u2019t trust him from the beginning,\u201d said Mr. Zaman. 45. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t make any deal.\u201d",

Kalapara is in Patuakhali District, one of the areas hardest hit by Cyclone Sidr this month.\nAt least two people remained missing, Yunus said, adding that rescuers were not expecting to find any survivors under the slab in the river, which is 6 meters, or 20 feet, deep.\n\"We'll continue our operations,\" he said by telephone from Kalapara.\nThe collapse of the bridge was the latest blow to the already impoverished region of southern Bangladesh where survivors of the Nov. 15 cyclone, which killed more than 3,100 people and destroyed more than 450,000 homes, were struggling to restart their lives.\nAid workers' attempts to deliver critical supplies and medical services were already hampered after roads and communications routes were blocked or destroyed by debris from the storm.\nThe U.S. Navy was assisting in the relief efforts.\nThe amphibious assault ship Kearsarge, carrying about 20 helicopters and relief supplies, was docked off the country's coast as naval officers made arrangements to deliver large aid packages to the battered region, and another, the Essex, was due to arrive in coming days, said a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, Amy Vrampas.\nOfficers were dispensing medical assistance from a clinic aboard the Kearsarge, said Lieutenant Colonel Main Ullah Chowdhury of the Bangladeshi Army.\nThe cyclone destroyed many wells, and clean water supplies were necessary to prevent the spread of cholera and severe diarrhea. On Friday, the U.S. Navy delivered 11,300 liters, or 3,000 gallons, of drinking water to hard-hit Barisal District. \"We've been told that water was the most crucial,\" Vrampas said.\nBangladesh has received pledges of international aid of more than $500 million, including $250 million from the World Bank.\nThe authorities would distribute 15 kilograms, or more than 30 pounds, of rice per month to each of an estimated 2.5 million people left destitute by the storm, many in crowded relief camps, starting Dec. 1, said Tapan Chowdhoury, the government's adviser on food and disaster management. The program will last at least four months, he said.\nKelly Stevenson, the Bangladesh director of Save the Children, estimated that more than half of the region's rice crop was destroyed, which could leave up to three million people hungry in coming months.\nThe official death toll from the cyclone stood at 3,199, said Major A.B.M. Nowroz Ehsan, a spokesman for the army, which is coordinating the relief and rescue work.\nThe Disaster Management Ministry said 1,724 people were missing and 28,188 people had been injured. It said the cyclone destroyed 458,804 houses and partially damaged another 665,529.\nA boat carrying about 100 people - possibly being ferried by human traffickers - sank Sunday off a southern Bangladesh island bordering Myanmar waters, leaving at least one person dead, a police official said, The Associated Press reported from Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.\nThe wooden fishing boat went down near St. Martin's Island, about 120 kilometers, or 75 miles, south of Cox's Bazar, a coastal resort town, said the local police chief, Banaj Kumar Majumdar.",

    "text": "Death toll at 2,300 in Bangladesh cyclone\n2007-11-18T05:00:00.000Z\nBARGUNA, Bangladesh \u2014 Hungry survivors scrambled for food Sunday as rescue workers cleared fallen trees and twisted roofs from roads to reach remote villages after a cyclone battered Bangladesh, leaving more than 2,300 dead and thousands homeless.\nRelief officials warned that the death toll could jump as rescuers reach more isolated areas.\nTeams from international aid organizations worked with army troops in a massive rescue effort that attracted help from around the world. But relief items - tents, rice, water - were slow to reach many survivors.\nThe death toll from Tropical Cyclone Sidr, the worst storm to hit the country in a decade, rose to at least 2,300 as officials made contact with coastal regions that had been cut off by the storm, said Selina Shahid of the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management.\nThe Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, warned that the toll could hit 10,000 once rescuers reached outlying islands.\nMuhammad Abdur Rob, chairman of the society, said the estimate came from the assessments of thousands of volunteers taking part in the rescue operations across the battered region.\nOn the devastated coast, rescue workers struggled to reach many survivors.\n\"I've been here waiting for hours for something to eat,\" said Asad Ali, a 45-year-old farmer in Barguna, one of the hardest-hit districts. \"What I've got so far are a few cookies. Not enough.\"\nHe said he received the cookies from a helicopter dropping packages of food. The aircraft have attracted mobs of people swarming below every time one is spotted.\nSquatting on a muddy field with his wife, Ali said their only child, a 5-year-old girl, was crushed and killed beneath their toppled thatched hut.\nGovernment officials defended the relief efforts and expressed confidence that authorities are up to the task.\n\"We have enough food and water,\" said Shahidul Islam, the top official in Bagerhat, a battered district close to Barguna. \"We are going to overcome the problem.\"\nThe disaster management secretary, Aiyub Bhuiyan, met Sunday with representatives from the United Nations and international aid groups to discuss the emergency response.\n\"The donors wanted to know about our plan and how they can come forward to stand by the victims,\" Bhuiyan told reporters.\nThe government said it had allocated $5.2 million in emergency aid for rebuilding houses. Many foreign governments and international groups have pledged to help, including the United States, which offered $2.1 million and the United Nations, which promised $7 million. The United States also plans to ship 35 tons of nonfood items such as plastic sheeting and hygiene kits, said the White House press secretary, Dana Perino.\nMany evacuees crowded onto ferries and trudged down sludge-filled roads to return home for the first time since the storm hit Thursday.\n\"I have had no news of my family since Wednesday, as the mobile phones are down,\" said Golam Rasul, who was traveling to see his mother and brother in Bagerhat district.\nMany survivors returned to find their bamboo-and-straw huts flattened, their roofs missing, their crops ruined.\n\"We tied the corners of our tin roof to coconut trees with ropes, so it wouldn't fly away but our kitchen was destroyed and many trees around fell,\" said Shafiqul Islam, who works at a roadside gas station near Madaridpur, another hard-hit coastal district.\nThanks to an effective early warning system, at least 1.5 million coastal villagers fled to shelters before the storm.",

    "text": "Averting water wars in Asia\n2007-06-26T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 The sharpening Asian competition over energy resources has obscured another danger: Water shortages in much of Asia are becoming a threat to rapid economic modernization.\nWater has emerged as a key issue that could determine if Asia is headed toward cooperation or competition. No country would influence that direction more than China, which controls the Tibetan plateau, the source of most major rivers of Asia.\nTibet's vast glaciers and high altitude have endowed it with the world's greatest river systems. Its rivers are a lifeline to the world's two most-populous states - China and India - as well as to Bangladesh, Burma, Bhutan, Nepal, Cambodia, Pakistan, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. These countries make up 47 percent of the global population.\nYet Asia is a water-deficient continent. Although home to more than half of the human population, Asia has less fresh water - 3,920 cubic meters per person - than any continent other than the Antarctica.\nThe looming struggle over water resources in Asia has been underscored by the spread of irrigated farming, water-intensive industries and a growing middle class that wants high water-consuming comforts like washing machines and dishwashers. Household water consumption in Asia is rising rapidly, although several major economies there are acutely water-stressed.\nThe specter of water wars in Asia is also being highlighted by climate change and environmental degradation in the form of shrinking forests and swamps that foster a cycle of chronic flooding and droughts. The Himalayan snow melt that feeds Asia's great rivers could be accelerated by global warming.\nWhile intrastate water-sharing disputes have become rife in several Asian countries - from India and Pakistan to Southeast Asia and China - it is the potential interstate conflict over river-water resources that should be of greater concern.\nThis concern arises from Chinese attempts to dam or redirect the southward flow of river waters from the Tibetan plateau, starting point of the Indus, the Mekong, the Yangtze, the Yellow, the Salween, the Brahmaputra, the Karnali and the Sutlej Rivers. Among Asia's mighty rivers, only the Ganges starts from the Indian side of the Himalayas.\nThe uneven availability of water within some nations has given rise to grand ideas - from linking rivers in India to diverting the fast-flowing Brahmaputra northward to feed the arid areas in the Chinese heartland. Interstate conflict, however, will surface only when an idea is translated into action to benefit one country at the expense of a neighboring one.\nAs water woes have intensified in its north owing to intensive farming, China has increasingly turned its attention to the bounteous water reserves that the Tibetan plateau holds. It has dammed rivers, not just to produce hydropower but also to channel the waters for irrigation and other purposes, and is presently toying with massive inter-basin and inter-river water transfer projects.\nAfter building two dams upstream, China is building at least three more on the Mekong, stirring passions in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. Several Chinese projects in west-central Tibet have a bearing on river-water flows into India, but Beijing is reluctant to share information.\nHaving extensively contaminated its own major rivers through unbridled industrialization, China now threatens the ecological viability of river systems tied to South and Southeast Asia in its bid to meet its thirst for water and energy.\nThe idea of a Great South-North Water Transfer Project diverting river Tibetan waters has the backing of President Hu Jintao, a hydrologist. The first phase of this project calls for building 300 kilometers of tunnels and channels to draw waters from the Jinsha, Yalong and Dadu rivers, on the eastern rim of the Tibetan plateau.\nIn the second phase, the Brahmaputra waters may be rerouted northward, in what be tantamount to the declaration of water war on lower-riparian India and Bangladesh. In fact, Beijing has identified the bend where the Brahmaputra forms the world's longest and deepest canyon just before entering India as holding the largest untapped reserves for meeting its water and energy needs.\nThe future of the Tibetan plateau's water reserves is tied to ecological conservation. As China's hunger for primary commodities has grown, so too has its exploitation of Tibet's resources.\nAnd as water woes have intensified in several major Chinese cities, a group of ex-officials have championed the northward rerouting of the Brahmaputra waters in a book titled, \"Tibet's Waters Will Save China.\"\nLarge hydro projects and reckless exploitation of mineral resources already threaten Tibet's fragile ecosystems, with ore tailings from mining operations beginning to contaminate water sources.\nWhile China seems intent on aggressively pursuing upstream projects on interstate rivers, the forestalling of water wars demands a cooperative Asian framework among basin states to work toward common ownership of the resources.\nBrahma Chellaney, a professor of strategic studies at the privately funded Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, is the author, most recently, of \"Asian Juggernaut: The Rise of China, India and Japan.\"",

    "text": "Tracing a poison's global path back to China\n2007-05-06T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW YORK \u2014 A syrupy poison, diethylene glycol, is an indispensable part of the modern world, an industrial solvent and prime ingredient in antifreeze.\nIt is also a killer. And the deaths, if not intentional, are often no accident.\nThe kidneys fail first. Then the central nervous system begins to misfire. Paralysis spreads, making breathing difficult, then often impossible without assistance. In the end, most victims die.\nMany of them are children, poisoned at the hands of their unsuspecting parents.\nOver the years, the poison has been loaded into all varieties of medicine - cough syrup, fever medication, injectable drugs - a result of counterfeiters who profit by substituting the sweet-tasting solvent for a safe, more expensive syrup, usually glycerin, commonly used in drugs, food, toothpaste and other products.\nToxic syrup has figured in at least eight mass poisonings around the world in the past two decades. Researchers estimate that thousands have died. In many cases, the precise origin of the poison has never been determined. But records and interviews show that in three of the last four cases it was made in China, a major source of counterfeit drugs.\nPanama is the most recent victim. Last year, government officials there unwittingly mixed diethylene glycol into 260,000 bottles of cold medicine - with devastating results. Families have reported 365 deaths from the poison, 100 of which have been confirmed so far. With the onset of the rainy season, investigators are racing to exhume as many potential victims as possible before bodies decompose even more.\nThe Panama death toll leads directly to Chinese companies that made and exported the poison as 99.5 percent pure glycerin.\nForty-six barrels of the toxic syrup arrived via a poison pipeline stretching halfway around the world. Through shipping records and interviews with government officials, The New York Times traced this pipeline from the Panamanian port of Colon, back through trading companies in Barcelona and Beijing, to its beginning near the Yangtze Delta in a place local people call \"chemical country.\"\nThe counterfeit glycerin passed through three trading companies on three continents, yet not one of them tested the syrup to confirm what was on the label. Along the way, a certificate falsely attesting to the purity of the shipment was repeatedly altered, eliminating the name of the manufacturer and previous owner. As a result, traders bought the syrup without knowing where it came from, or who made it.\nWith this information, the traders might have discovered - as The New York Times did - that the manufacturer was not certified to make pharmaceutical ingredients.\nAn examination of two poisoning cases last year - in Panama and earlier in China - shows how Chinese safety regulations have lagged behind its growing role as low-cost supplier to the world. It also demonstrates how a poorly policed chain of traders in country after country allows counterfeit medicine to contaminate the global market.\nLast week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned drug makers and suppliers in the United States \"to be especially vigilant\" in watching for diethylene glycol. The warning did not specifically mention China, and it said there was \"no reason to believe\" that glycerin in America was tainted. Even so, the agency called for all glycerin shipments to be tested for diethylene glycol and said it was \"exploring how supplies of glycerin become contaminated.\"\nA Chinese company is already being accused by the U.S. authorities of exporting wheat gluten with an industrial chemical, melamine, that ended up in pet food and animal feed. Washington recently banned imports of Chinese-made wheat gluten after it was linked to pet deaths in the United States.\nBeyond Panama and China, toxic syrup has caused mass poisonings in Haiti, Bangladesh, Argentina, Nigeria and twice in India.\nIn Bangladesh, investigators found poison in seven brands of fever medication in 1992, but only after countless children died. A Massachusetts laboratory detected the contamination after Dr. Michael Bennish, a pediatrician who works in developing countries, smuggled samples of the tainted syrup out of the country in a suitcase.\nBennish, who investigated the Bangladesh epidemic and helped write a 1995 article about it for BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal, said that given the amount of medication distributed, deaths \"must be in the thousands or tens of thousands.\"\n\"It's vastly underreported,\" Bennish said of diethylene glycol poisoning. Doctors might not suspect toxic medicine, particularly in poor countries with limited resources and a generally unhealthy population, he said, adding, \"Most people who die don't come to a medical facility.\"\nThe makers of counterfeit glycerin, which superficially looks and acts like the real thing, but generally costs considerably less, are rarely identified, much less prosecuted, given the difficulty of tracing shipments across borders. \"This is really a global problem, and it needs to be handled in a global way,\" said Dr. Henk Bekedam, the World Health Organization's top representative in Beijing.\nSeventy years ago, medicine laced with diethylene glycol killed more than 100 people in the United States, leading to the passage of the toughest drug regulations of that era and the creation of the modern Food and Drug Administration.\nThe agency has tried to help in poisoning cases around the world, but there is only so much it can do.\nWhen at least 88 children died in Haiti a decade ago, agency investigators traced the poison to the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, but their attempts to visit the suspected manufacturer were repeatedly blocked by Chinese officials, according to internal U.S. State Department records. Permission came more than a year later, but by then the plant had moved and its records were destroyed.\n\"Chinese officials we contacted on this matter were all reluctant to become involved,\" the U.S. Embassy in Beijing wrote in a confidential cable. \"We cannot be optimistic about our chances for success in tracking down the other possible glycerin shipments.\"\nThe New York Times found records showing that the same Chinese company implicated in the Haiti poisoning also shipped about 50 tons of counterfeit glycerin to the United States in 1995. Some of it was later resold to another American customer, Avatar, before the deception was discovered.\n\"Thank God we caught it when we did,\" said Phil Ternes, chief operating officer of Avatar, a Chicago-area supplier of bulk pharmaceuticals and nonmedicinal products.\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it was unaware of the shipment.\nIn China, the government is vowing to clean up its pharmaceutical industry, in part because of criticism over fake drugs flooding the world markets. In December, two top drug regulators were arrested on charges of taking bribes to approve drugs. As well, 440 counterfeiting operations were closed down last year, the World Health Organization said.\nBut when Chinese officials investigated the role of Chinese companies in the Panama deaths, they found that no laws had been broken, according to an official of the Chinese drug enforcement agency. Chinese drug regulation is \"a black hole,\" said one trader who has done business through CNSC Fortune Way, a company in Beijing that investigators say was a crucial conduit for the Panama poison.\nIn this environment, Wang Guiping, a tailor with a ninth-grade education and access to a chemistry book, found it easy to enter the pharmaceutical supply business as a middleman. He quickly discovered what others had before him: that counterfeiting was a simple way to increase profits.\nAnd then people in China began to die.\nWang spent years as a tailor in the manufacturing towns of the Yangtze Delta. But he did not want to remain a common craftsman, people who knew him said. He set his sights on trading chemicals, a business rooted in the many small chemical plants that have sprouted in the region.\n\"He didn't know what he was doing,\" Wang's older brother, Wang Guoping, said in an interview. \"He didn't understand chemicals.\"\nBut he did understand how to cheat the system.\nWang Guiping, 41, realized he could earn extra money by substituting cheaper, industrial-grade syrup - not approved for human consumption - for pharmaceutical grade syrup. To trick pharmaceutical buyers, he forged his licenses and laboratory analysis reports, records show.\nWang later told investigators that he figured no harm would come from the substitution, because he initially tested a small quantity.\nHe did it with the expertise of a former tailor. He swallowed some of it. When nothing happened, he shipped it.\nOne company that used the syrup beginning in early 2005 was Qiqihar No. 2 Pharmaceutical in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. A buyer for the factory had seen a posting for Wang's syrup on an industry Web site.\nAfter a while, Wang set out to find an even cheaper substitute so he could increase his profit even more, according to a Chinese investigator. In a chemical book, he found what he was looking for: another odorless syrup - diethylene glycol. At the time, it sold for 6,000 yuan, or $780, to 7,000 yuan a ton, while pharmaceutical-grade syrup cost 15,000 yuan, according to the investigator.\nWang did not taste-test this second batch of syrup before shipping it to Qiqihar Pharmaceutical, the government investigator said, adding, \"He knew it was dangerous, but he didn't know that it could kill.\"\nThe manufacturer used the toxic syrup in five separate drug products: ampules of Amillarisin A for gall bladder problems; a special enema fluid for children; an injection for blood vessel diseases; an intravenous pain reliever; and an arthritis treatment.\nIn April 2006, one of the finest hospitals in southern China, in Guangzhou, began administering Amillarisin A. Within a month or so, at least 18 people had died after taking the medicine, though some had already been quite ill.\nWang was arrested last spring and remains in custody as the authorities decide whether he should be put to death. The Qiqihar drug plant that made the poisonous medicine has been closed, and five employees are being prosecuted for causing \"a serious accident.\"\nRenwick McLean and Brent McDonald contributed reporting.",

    "text": "Suffering survival in Bangladesh\n2007-11-20T05:00:00.000Z\nKHATACHIRA, Bangladesh \u2014 The wind whipped through the sky. The river swelled above the tree line. And in a flash, Mamataz Begum's youngest child, barely 2 years old, was swept from her arms, as tidal waves smashed through the fragile mud homes of this village and scooped up everything in its watery arms.\nIn this hamlet, on the southernmost fringe of the delta, in the mouth of nature's constant fury, nothing was spared. Barely a single house was standing; they were all made of mud and they simply collapsed back into the earth.\nThe meager food stocks of the village had washed away. Fishing boats and nets, a principal source of income here, were gone. The paddy fields had filled up with brackish water, which meant there would be no harvest. Animal carcasses, stinking and bloated, lay scattered along the river bank. There was no drinking water left. By Tuesday morning, a bag of food from the government had run out.\nThe people of Khatachira were a testament to the bittersweet blessings of the latest natural calamity to befall Bangladesh. Relatively speaking, the death toll from last Thursday's cyclone was small - about 3,000, according to official count, which is roughly double the death toll of Hurricane Katrina, but far less than the 140,000 killed during the last Bangladeshi cyclone, in 1991 - in large measure because of an early warning system that announced the storm and urged people to head to storm shelters. But in claiming relatively few lives, it also left so many more people in utter ruin.\n\"The crisis is just beginning,\" said Suman Islam, humanitarian assistance coordinator with the aid agency, Care, which had sent its first relief assessment team here Tuesday afternoon. \"We have saved lives. But now the challenge is the same.\"\nScientists studying climate change in this part of the world say they expect extreme weather events to rise in frequency here, including cyclones and powerful tropical storms. And the United Nations has increasingly warned of the high toll that these disasters exact on the poor, including for the long term. A study in several countries prone to disaster led a UN team to conclude for instance that in India, adult women who were born during a disaster were 20 percent less likely to be educated. In Niger, children under the age of 2, who had been born during a drought, were more than twice more likely to be malnourished.\nThe survivors of Cyclone Sidr happen to be among the poorest of all, in among the poorest, most vulnerable countries in the world.\nOn the edge of the water, near a tree whose roots are barely hanging onto the earth, stood a couple of cooking pots - remnants of Mamataz Begum's kitchen. Her son's body washed up in another village, and they brought his corpse here. Her other children had survived by clinging to trees. Her husband broke his leg as he swam through the waves. She was still dazed Tuesday, nearly six days later. She had no idea where the family's next meal would come from.\n\"If God will feed us, we will eat,\" she said.\nKhatachira, a village of about 1,000 families, had buried 57 of its own so far, nearly half of them children under the age of 10, most likely because they could not swim or cling to trees. Even on Tuesday morning, a woman's body was found in the bush of a neighboring village; she was yet to be brought home for burial. All but seven people had been accounted for.\nDysentery was the next demon that aid workers were guarding against. In this watery land, clean drinking water is in short supply. There are only a few tube wells. The ponds, from which many villagers get their drinking water, are contaminated with rotting leaves and animal remains. Toilets are rare in village homes, and the practice of defecating in the fields makes it all that much easier for disease to spread.\nThe government has appealed for international aid and in a rare gesture, opened its visa gates to foreigners, including journalists. The United States has offered two amphibious naval vessels with helicopters to help the relief mission.\nHere in Khatachira, the villagers crowded around the aid agency workers, knowing that only in narrating their loss could they expect to gain anything. The day after the cyclone, they had hoisted red flags at the edge of the hamlet.\nOutsiders had been slow to reach the village. Getting here means a long drive, crossing a river whose only ferry has been destroyed, driving through a fetid market town that reeks of dead flesh and a two-hour's boat ride along the Baleshwar River, afloat with dead goats and ducks.\nAlong the journey, there is evidence of life limping back. A village government office, relatively untouched, has placed its documents on the front porch to dry. A remote college has had its roof and walls blown off, but someone has neatly arranged the college desks in neat rows under the sun. The roads had been cleared of fallen logs. Banana trees and palms lay crumpled on top of each other, like victims of an all night brawl.\nKhatachira, near the edge of the Sunderbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, was flattened. This is what the villagers said among themselves: \"Where's Salem?\" one man asked. \"He lost his son,\" someone responded. \"Has the grandson been found?\" \"No.\" An old man who lost his entire family, was still searching for the bodies of his two grandchildren. Another old man said his granddaughter, 8, was still missing.

    "text": "In Bangladesh, Picking Through the Pieces\n2007-11-21T05:00:00.000Z\nKHATACHIRA, Bangladesh, Nov. 20 \u2014 The wind whipped through the sky. The river swelled above the tree line. And in a flash, Mamataz Begum\u2019s youngest child, barely 2 years old, was swept from her arms, as a tidal wave smashed through the fragile mud homes of this village and scooped up everything in its watery arms.\n In this hamlet on the southernmost fringe of Bangladesh, cut by rivers that empty into the Bay of Bengal, nothing was spared by the cyclone that ripped through here last Thursday. Barely a single house was standing; they were all made of mud and they simply collapsed into the earth. The meager food stocks of the village had washed away. Fishing boats and nets, a principal source of income here, were gone. The paddies had filled up with brackish water, which meant there would be no harvest. \nOn Tuesday, animal carcasses, stinking and bloated, lay scattered along the river bank. There was no drinking water left. A small bag of food from the government, the sole aid so far for this village of about 1,000 families, had run out. \n The people of Khatachira are a testament to the bittersweet blessings of the latest natural calamity to befall Bangladesh. Relatively speaking, the death toll from the cyclone was small \u2014 some 3,167 according to the latest official count, roughly double the death toll of Hurricane Katrina but far less than the 140,000 killed in 1991 after the last cyclone hit Bangladesh. In large measure, that was because of an early warning system that had announced the storm and had urged people to head to shelters. \nBut in claiming relatively few lives, it left many more people in utter ruin. The government estimates that about four million people have been affected.\n \u201cThe crisis is just beginning,\u201d said Suman Islam, humanitarian assistance coordinator with the aid agency Care, which had sent its first relief assessment team here Tuesday afternoon. \u201cWe have saved lives. But now, the challenge is the same.\u201d\nIn Khatachira, near the edge of the Sunderbans, the world\u2019s largest mangrove forest, villagers have so far buried 57 of their own, nearly half of them children under age 10. Many probably died because they could not swim or cling to trees. On Tuesday morning another body, that of a local woman, was found in the bush of a neighboring village; she had yet to be brought home for burial. All but seven people had been accounted for. \nAn old man who lost his entire family was searching for the bodies of his two grandchildren. Another old man said his granddaughter, age 8, was still missing. A woman with a hideous gash on her right foot \u2014 from a piece of tin roofing that fell and sliced her skin \u2014 said four in her family had been killed, and five were left to carry on. \n The nearest cyclone shelter was about two and a half miles away, and it had swelled well past capacity by the time most people in this village were ready to evacuate. One woman even went to the shelter, went home after it seemed that the storm was not coming, and was killed. \n \u201cSee over there, that was our house,\u201d said Muhammad Himayat, pointing at an open stretch of paddy. The house is gone, along with two dozen goats, two cows and three fishing boats that together were the family\u2019s livelihood. \u201cIt is all river now.\u201d\n This is what the villagers said among themselves:\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Salem?\u201d one man asked.\n\u201cHe lost his son,\u201d someone responded.\n\u201cHas the grandson been found?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n Scientists studying climate change in this part of the world say they expect extreme weather, including cyclones and powerful tropical storms, to rise in frequency here. And the United Nations has increasingly warned of the high toll these disasters exact on the poor.\nThe survivors of Cyclone Sidr are among the poorest of the poorest, in one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. \nDysentery was the next demon that aid workers were guarding against. In this watery land, clean drinking water is in short supply. There are only a few water wells. The ponds, from which many villagers get their drinking water, are contaminated with rotting leaves and animals. Toilets are rare, and the practice of defecating in the fields makes it much easier for disease to spread. \nThe government has appealed for international aid and in a rare gesture, opened its visa gates to foreigners, including journalists. Officials said relief workers and the military had reached the last remaining pockets of the devastated areas on Tuesday, Reuters reported.\nBut food supplies remained woefully inadequate. \u201cHundreds of hands go up to grab just one food packet,\u201d said a relief worker in the Patuakhali district.\nDonor countries have pledged $142 million in emergency aid. The United Nations World Food Program has distributed nearly 100 tons of high-energy biscuits and was to begin delivering rice on Friday. The United States has offered two C-130 transport planes and two amphibious naval vessels with helicopters. \nBut delivering aid to places like Khatachira is not easy. Getting here means a long drive, crossing a narrow river whose only ferry has been destroyed, driving through a fetid market town that smells of dead flesh and taking a two-hour boat ride along the Baleshwar River, afloat with dead goats and ducks. \nAlong the journey, one can see evidence of life limping back. A village government office, relatively untouched, has placed its documents on the front porch to dry. A remote college had its roof and walls blown off, but someone has neatly arranged the desks. The roads had been cleared of fallen logs. Banana trees and palms lay crumpled, like victims of an all-night brawl. \nThe day after the cyclone, villagers here had hoisted red flags at the edge of the hamlet. Aid workers had been slow to arrive but those who had were besieged by villagers, who knew that only in narrating their losses could they expect to gain anything. \nOn the edge of the water, near a tree whose roots were barely hanging onto the earth, stood a couple of cooking pots \u2014 remnants of Mamataz Begum\u2019s kitchen. Her son\u2019s body had washed up in another village, and they brought his corpse here. Her other children survived. Her husband broke his leg as he swam through the waves. \nOn Tuesday, she was still dazed, and had no idea where the family\u2019s next meal would come from. \n\u201cIf God will feed us, we will eat,\u201d she said.

    "text": "A prayer in each corner\n2007-12-07T05:00:00.000Z\nOver a recent weekend, I attended two religious services, one at a mosque and the other at a church, and said \"amen\" to two contradictory prayers. Doing that confused me and added to my stress and depression as these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan go on and on.\nOn Friday, during the weekly Juma'a gathering in a mosque in Springfield, Viginia, a suburb of Washington, I and about 300 people repeatedly said \"amen\" to an imam as he loudly prayed: \"May Allah support the mujahedeen. May Allah defeat their enemies. May Allah support Islam and the Muslims. May Allah defeat Islam's enemies.\"\nThe following Sunday, in a nearby church, I and about 500 people said \"amen\" to the following prayer by a minister: \"Lord, protect and strengthen our soldiers in Iraq, Afghanistan and wherever they are. Guide our leaders and leaders of other nations and give them wisdom to work for peace.\"\nAn Arab friend had gone with me to the mosque after I convinced him that this might lessen his stress and depression as he, too, was psychologically affected by George W. Bush's wars. Like many Middle Easterners, he vehemently refused to go to counseling (at least that Friday I talked him out of drinking a bottle of vodka).\nWhen the imam started his \"provocative\" prayers, we were squatting on the floor in the last row, with our backs to the wall. My friend got scared and whispered in my ear, \"Isn't this guy afraid of the FBI?\" I, half-sacred and half-joking, said, \"Let's get out of here.\"\nBut we didn't leave, and we noticed that the imam was clever in the way he worded his prayer. He did not mention Iraq or Afghanistan by name. He probably didn't need to, as it was clear from the congregation's faces, accents and clothes that almost all of them were immigrants from third-world countries.\nThere wasn't a single white face. There wasn't a single woman either; women prayed in a separate room because a dominant conservative interpretation of the Koran claimed that their presence among men would distract men.\nThat was a far cry from the church, where men and women mingled. Actually there were more women than men. I sat in the back pew and in front of me sat a woman with long golden hair that became brighter when reflected by the morning sun rays that came through the high window of the church.\nThose men and women, from the way they were dressed, seemed to belong to middle and upper-middle classes. They were almost all white.\nThe minister said a prayer \"for military family members fighting in the Middle East.\" The service program named about 10 of them and selected one named Jonathan, and asked people to \"please take time to send him cards or care packages.\"\nThe program said that \"items must be able to withstand shipping and possible three weeks in transit,\" and mentioned \"lotion, soap, deodorant, toothpaste, cookies, nut-mixes, pretzels, chewing gum, hot drink mixes, fruit roll-up. . .\"\nI turned to my high-school daughter, who was sitting next to me, and said, \"This is your job.\" The following day, we went to a store and she bought some of these items, put them in a shoe box and gave me the box to take to the post office. She added a short letter to Jonathan, part of which said, \"Thanks for serving our country!\" and \"God bless you!\"\nThe next day, on my way to the post office, I thought of something else: I bought a package of coffee and put it in the box. I thought of Jonathan finding a quiet time in the midst of the turmoil in Iraq to sit down and enjoy a cup of fine coffee.\nAt the mosque, the imam had also asked for monetary donations and pointed toward a row of boxes at the entrance.\nEach box was labeled for a certain cause, like \"Flood in Bangladesh,\" \"Drought in Somalia\" or \"Earthquakes in Pakistan.\" There were also boxes for close-to-home causes, such as \"Fix Mosque's Roof\" or \"Pay Mosque's Utility Bills.\"\nThere was no box for \"mujahedeen\" (whoever and wherever they were), no requests to send them cards, soaps or cookies (or coffee). Doing this would have been a crime - supporting terrorists - punishable by prison.\nMohammad Ali Salih is an Arab journalist based in Washington. ",

    "text": "Half the world's population will live in cities next year, UN report says\n2007-06-27T05:00:00.000Z\nBy next year, more than half the world's population, or about 3.3 billion people, will live in towns and cities, a number expected to swell to almost 5 billion by 2030, according to a United Nations Population Fund report released on Wednesday.\nThe onrush of change will be particularly extraordinary in Africa and Asia, where between 2000 and 2030 \"the accumulated urban growth of these two regions during the whole span of history will be duplicated in a single generation,\" the report says.\nThis surge in urban populations, fueled more by natural increase than the migration of people from the countryside, is unstoppable, said George Martin, author of the report, \"State of World Population 2007: Unleashing the Potential of Urban Growth.\"\nCities will edge out rural areas in more than sheer numbers of people. Poverty is now increasing more rapidly in urban areas as well, and governments need to plan for where the poor will live rather than leaving them to settle illegally in shanties without sewage and other services, the United Nations says.\nIn Latin America, where urbanization came earlier than in other developing regions, many countries and cities ignored or fruitlessly tried to retard urban growth. \"Now the levels of insecurity and violence are a product of this approach,\" said Martine, a demographer and sociologist. \"People have been left to fend for themselves and have created these enormous slums.\"\nA billion people, a sixth of the world's population, already live in slums, 90 percent of them in developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 7 in 10 urban dwellers live in a slum. The region's slum population has almost doubled in just 15 years, reaching 200 million in 2005. Its urban population is already as large as North America's.\nChina, the world's most populous nation, is now at the peak of its urban transition, the report says. Urbanites will outnumber peasants within a decade. China will then have 83 cities with more than 750,000 residents, but only five with a population of more than five million, according to the report.\nIn fact, the report predicts that the bulk of the urban population growth is likely to be in smaller cities and towns, not the 20 mega-cities that dominate the public imagination. The future lies in places like Gabarone, Botswana, whose population is projected to rise to 500,000 in 2020 from 18,000 in 1971, as much as it does in chaotic, sprawling metropolises like Lagos, Nigeria.\nAmong the mega-cities with populations of more than 10 million, only Lagos and Dhaka, Bangladesh are expected to grow at rates exceeding 3 percent over the coming decade. Such super-sized cities today contain 9 percent of all urban inhabitants, while smaller cities and towns account for more than half.\n\"Many of the world's largest cities - Buenos Aires, Calcutta, Mexico City, Sao Paulo and Seoul - actually have more people moving out than in, and few are close to the size that doomsayers predicted for them in the 1970s,\" the report says.\nThe report notes that while rates of urban growth have slowed in most regions of the world, the story now lies in the scale of growth in the sheer numbers of people.\nThe first great wave of urbanization unfurled over two centuries, from 1750 to 1950, in Europe and North America, with urban populations rising to 423 million from 15 million.\nThe second wave is happening now in the developing world. The number of people living in urban areas will have grown to 3.9 billion in 2030 from 309 million in 1950. By 2030, the developing world will have 80 percent of the world's urban population.\nIf the coming population growth is helter-skelter, with inadequate services and sprawling slums, it could pollute urban water sheds with untreated sewage and contribute to rising crime and violence, Martine said. The result of that approach is already apparent in existing slums.\n\"The poor settle in the worst living space, on steep hillsides or river banks that will be flooded, where nobody else wants to live and speculators haven't taken control of the land,\" he said. \"They have no water and sanitation and the housing is terrible. And this situation threatens the environmental quality of the city.\"\nBut cities are also engines of economic growth, the report notes more optimistically. \"Cities concentrate poverty,\" it said, \"but they also represent the best hope of escaping it.\"",

    "text": "Business of Green: Is nuclear power worth the risk?\n2007-04-18T05:00:00.000Z\nThe International Herald Tribune is leading a global dialogue on how businesses and consumers are responding to climate change at our Business of Green blog.\nI've been seeing a lot of commentary lately about how nuclear power could help to solve the climate change problem. These articles usually mention how nuclear power yields virtually zero greenhouse gas emissions and how - unlike wind or solar - nuclear is ready to go and creates the same vast and steady supplies of power as traditional power stations fired by fossils fuels like gas and coal.\nYet green groups like Friends of the Earth remain hugely skeptical. They say the industry has long relied on subsidies to be affordable, and they warn of lethal accidents and a growing stockpile of materials that could be turned into nuclear weapons. Is curbing the heating of the planet more important than, say, finding long-term answers to nuclear's drawbacks?\nHere are some recent, edited entries and responses from readers.\nAs an engineer and institutional investor who has been directly involved with nuclear power through the last 30 years, it is heartening to hear environmentally conscious people having an open mind to consideration of its many advantages. Improvements in reactor type/design, fuel reprocessing, design/construction standardization and maintenance efficiency, and the potential to produce both electricity and a petroleum fuel substitute must be integrated to create a new energy industry paradigm. This is achievable, and in a reasonable time frame.\nHarry Toll,Wilton, Connecticut\nHow many people have been killed by nuclear accidents? Then ask how many people have been killed already by fossil fuel-fired plants through increased rates of asthma and associated respiratory diseases. And how many more will be killed by rapidly accelerating global warming from flooding, heat waves and so on? Nuclear power offers a medium-term solution today.\nDavid Shaproski, Leiden, Netherlands\nThere is still the problem of disposal of nuclear waste; surely funds should be available and/or taxes on nuclear power to further the research on making it less toxic for our grandchildren.\nAnn Rawson (No country given)\nPutting a ceiling on our never-ending desires, and utilizing thus- saved resources for global good - this is the only way to solve the issues we facing.\nAjith Sankar, Coimbatore, India\nWe need to look at nuclear power not as a permanent solution, but as a holding position to meet the demands of countries like the United States, China and India, until we have developed other technologies and reduced our appetite for power consumption.\nPerhaps Australia, which has not signed up to Kyoto, might like to step up to the plate and provide a recycling and waste storage capacity. Australia is awash with money made from exporting obscene amounts of uranium and coal to China, and as a nation they need to take some responsibility for all the coal they export.\nIan Walthew, France\nPaying a fee to drive car into central city\nFor the past several years, people wanting to drive into Central London during business hours have had to pay a daily fee of \u00a38, or about $16. The zone was expanded to include west London in February; the city government says that traffic in west London has decreased by more than 10 percent. Hybrid cars and cars that run on biofuels are exempt from the hefty fees. Everyone in London is affected and has had to adjust to the regulations, though grumbling is widespread. Though traffic moves better in the congestion-charge zone itself, people tend to complain it is often worse around the edges.\nMany other cities have contemplated following London's lead, from Milan to New York. Stockholm has already done so. What do you think about the concept of a congestion charge? How much would you be willing to pay for the convenience of driving your vehicle?\nThe congestion charge does not put a price on the pollution, it puts a price on congestion. You pay for your car to be there, and the price is the same whether you drive a tiny car one mile from your home outside the zone to your office inside the zone, or whether you spend the whole day having fun in your Hummer. In essence, the congestion charge removes poor drivers from the road to make way for the rich.\nJorn Madslien, London\nI have always admired London for its courage to tax car traffic in this manner. I wish more cities followed the example. I believe in public transportation. In cities there really is no need to get behind the wheel yourself. Plus, revenue from road congestion charges can be used to subsidize public transport.\nWerner Patels, Calgary, Alberta\nTraffic congestion charges would probably activate the use of public transportation. But would this only have a positive effect? You cannot promise the safety and security of the public transportation, as there will be tons of people in the rush hour, trying to squeeze in the subway.\nSo I say the fee has to become cheaper, or they should give some special benefit for people under a certain amount of income who cannot afford to pay the expensive charges. But the best idea would be the government improving public transportation, such as making more direct routes.\nDoKyung Kim, Dhaka, Bangladesh\nE-mail: green@iht.com",

Only a handful of families cling on so close to the water today, surrounded as they are by reminders of inexorable destruction: a half-broken canoe left by someone who moved away; a coconut palm teetering on a cliff; the gouged-out remnants of a family's fish pond.\nAll that stands between Mandal's home and the water is a rudimentary mud embankment, and there is no telling, he confessed, when it, too, might fall away. \"What will happen next we don't know,\" he said, summing up his only certainty.\nThe sinking of Ghoramara Island can be attributed to a confluence of disasters, both natural and human, not least the rising sea.\nIn concert with global warming, the rivers that pour down from the Himalayas and empty into the Bay of Bengal have swelled and shifted in recent decades, placing these already fragile islands, known as the Sundarbans, in the mouth of daily danger.\nA recent study by Sugata Hazra, an oceanographer at Jadavpur University in nearby Calcutta, found that during the past 30 years, about 80 square kilometers, or 30 square miles, of the Sundarbans have disappeared. More than 600 families have been displaced, according to the local government authorities. Fields and ponds have been submerged.\nGhoramara alone has shrunk to less than five square kilometers, about half its size in 1969, Hazra's study concluded. In the past 20 years, two other islands have vanished entirely.\nThe Sundarbans are among the world's largest collection of river delta islands. In geological terms, they are young and still under formation, cut by an intricate network of streams and tributaries that straddle the border between India and Bangladesh. Ever since the British settled the Sundarbans 150 years ago in pursuit of timber, the mangroves have been steadily depleted, half of the islands have lost their forest cover and the population has grown.\nToday, sea rise and deforestation threaten the Sundarbans' most storied inhabitant, the Royal Bengal tiger, which drinks these salty waters and has a peculiar appetite for human flesh. Environmental degradation also threatens the unsung human residents: Four million people live here on the Indian side of the border alone.\nCertainly, nature would have forced these islands to shift size and shape, drowning some, giving rise to others. But there is little doubt, scientists say, that human-induced climate change has made them particularly vulnerable.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global warming, spurred by the buildup of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, could raise the ocean's surface as much as 23 inches, or nearly 0.6 of a meter, by 2100. According to its latest report, made public this month, the ecology and people of this river delta system are among the most vulnerable in the world.\nClimate change is destined to make India as a whole prone to more intense rainstorms in the future, raising the risk of floods and, ultimately, bearing dangerously on agriculture, which still sustains two-thirds of the population.\nIt hardly seems to matter that Mandal and his neighbors, farmers and fishermen, are far too poor to produce much in the way of carbon emissions. They feel the assault already.\nMandal stood in his yard and pointed to the water. In his mind's eye, he could still see the two islands that have already sunk into the sea. And there, he said, on what was then the outer edge of Ghoramara, was his old house, and the paddy fields and vegetable patch that he had cultivated with his own hands. Today, there is only water.\nOver the years, as the earth cracked and fell into the water, people on Ghoramara began moving farther inland. Mandal was among them. He built himself a new house here, in what was then the safe midsection of the island. He wonders where he will move now.\nHundreds of families have already been forced into a displaced people's camp on a neighboring island, called Sagar, which itself has shrunk by four square kilometers in the past five years, according to the Jadavpur study.\nEven as India swiftly prospers, the Sundarbans have been left with little to no protection and none of the measures that wealthy low-lying countries, like the Netherlands, have undertaken to deal with the ravages of the sea.\nEvery year, at least two cyclones pound the islands; scientists say they have grown increasingly intense, though less frequent.\nThe mud embankments built over the years around these young, fragile islands are too feeble to keep away the tide. One storm and one breach can destroy a lifetime's labor on the land.\n\"Nature didn't create this place for humans to cut the forests and chase out the tigers and wildlife,\" said Tushar Kanjilal, founder of the Tagore Society for Rural Development, one of the most established nonprofit groups working on the islands. \"We are killing the Sundarbans. Our government, the people themselves, we are all together killing it. After 50 years, will they exist?\"\nYudisthir Bhuiyan fled to Sagar when, one day during the equinoctial high tide, the river surged and broke through the mud embankment that was expected to shield his village.\nHis house collapsed. The family had no time to gather belongings. They lived like refugees on the roadside until the government settled them in a small patch of land on Sagar, far from the water. Eventually, the island where his home once was vanished completely. Bhuiyan makes his living as a day laborer now.\nAt low tide, it is possible to see the mudflats that represent Ghoramara's vanishing past. At one tip of the island is a palm tree that drowns during high tide. There are embankments behind embankments, futile efforts of islanders to keep the water at bay.\nWhere once there was Bhuiyan's bustling island, called Lohachara, there is only water and a ship passing by. A new mudflat is visible now, where mangroves are beginning to sprout. Mandal regards it as his only salvation.",

    "text": "Second Powerful Quake Hits Indonesia\n2007-09-13T04:00:00.000Z\nPADANG, Indonesia, Thursday, Sept. 13 \u2014 A powerful earthquake centered near the Indonesian island of Sumatra toppled buildings on Wednesday and set off the first of several tsunami alerts. It was followed Thursday morning by a second earthquake and a series of aftershocks. \nAt least 10 people were killed and 200 injured in the first earthquake, The Associated Press reported, quoting local news accounts. The over all toll to life and property was unclear. \nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center of the Commerce Department and seismologists working in the region said tide-gauge readings showed that the first earthquake, which had a magnitude of 8.4, had generated small tsunamis that struck nearby shores, and that it might have caused some destruction along the coast. \nThe second earthquake struck about 200 miles to the northwest of the first earthquake\u2019s epicenter. The United States Geological Survey reported the second quake\u2019s magnitude as 7.8. The Indonesian government issued a new tsunami warning in the earthquake\u2019s aftermath.\nIn December 2004, a series of giant waves from a larger undersea earthquake thrashed Banda Aceh, a city at the northwestern end of Sumatra, killing 130,000 people there and tens of thousands more around the Indian Ocean. Scientists who have studied the area have warned that Bengkulu and Padang, on the Indian Ocean halfway along the 1,100-mile-long coast of Sumatra, were particularly at risk for powerful earthquakes and tsunamis as successive sections of the same shifting tectonic plates that set off the 2004 quake inevitably give way.\nBengkulu, a city of 1.2 million, was the closest large community to the two latest earthquakes. The epicenter of the first was 65 miles southwest of the city; the second was 125 miles to the northwest.\nA wave of three feet was reported to have hit Padang about 20 minutes after the first quake, said Suhardjono, an official with Indonesia\u2019s meteorological agency who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, The A.P. reported. But there had been no sightings of strong tidal waters two hours after the quake, usually the critical time for the formation of a tsunami, and the initial tsunami watch for Indonesia was lifted.\nWith small aftershocks continuing to shake Padang on Thursday, residents sat in streets and on curbs, listening to small radios as the city\u2019s mayor gave live updates. Using loudspeakers commonly used to call Muslims to prayer, local mosques relayed the broadcasts.\n \u201cWe are very stressed,\u201d said Wawan, 36. \u201cEvery time we think it\u2019s safe, another tremor rolls underneath our feet and we don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d\nThe tsunami warning center said Wednesday, after issuing a tsunami watch for the Indian Ocean, that the local authorities were responsible for making their own assessments about a potential tsunami. Tsunami alerts were issued by governments in Asian and African countries along the Indian Ocean, but the alerts were downgraded after several hours had passed without signs of a destructive wave. Within 10 hours of the first earthquake, tsunami warnings had been scaled down in India, the Seychelles and Australia. \nBut the authorities in Kenya, Tanzania and Bangladesh continued to warn residents to leave beaches and coastal areas, according to The A.P. \nIn Indonesia, the full extent of the damage was not immediately known. The initial earthquake was followed by a series of aftershocks, the strongest of which was measured at a magnitude of 6.6, Mr. Suhardjono told The A.P. \nAccording to the Indonesian Health Ministry, three people were killed in Padang, a city of 800,000, and two were killed in Bengkulu, which is closer to the epicenter. \nDamage in Padang on Thursday seemed relatively light, with one large shopping mall extensively damaged. Cracks formed in walls of the main hospital and patients were moved to tents in the parking lot, where one woman gave birth. \nThe coastal roads were almost empty as people took to higher ground for fear of tsunami. \nThe first quake struck about 6:10 p.m. local time (7:10 a.m. Eastern time), the United States Geological Survey said. \n It caused buildings to sway about 375 miles away in Jakarta, where residents were evacuated from their apartments. Phone lines and electricity were cut. \nKerry Sieh, a seismologist from the California Institute of Technology who has spent several decades studying earthquake risk around Sumatra, said he had spent the hours after the first earthquake sending e-mail messages and making calls to residents and fellow researchers, including some members of his science team who were installing instruments from a boat near the earthquake zone in recent days.\n\u201cI am concerned about their safety,\u201d he said in an e-mail message from Singapore. \u201cI have been unable to reach them via satellite phone.\u201d\nIn a separate telephone interview from Singapore on Thursday morning, Dr. Sieh said he had just received reports from friends in Padang that the second earthquake had sent waves into Padang Harbor and that people were fleeing the coast. \nDr. Sieh said he was very worried that there was more to come. The series of earthquakes, including the latest aftershock, are \u201clike ants chewing around the edges\u201d of a 240-mile-long section of fault off Padang that is overdue for a great earthquake the likes of which has not occurred along that part of the coast since 1833.\nEarlier, Dr. Sieh forwarded several e-mail reports from contacts in the region indicating that coastal flooding had occurred in the Mentawai Islands, which are along the coast northwest of the first earthquake epicenter.\n\u201cThis is now the third earthquake bigger than 8.0 that has occurred in Sumatra in the past four years,\u201d Dr. Sieh said after the Wednesday earthquake but before Thursday\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a very significant cluster of giant earthquakes.\u201d ",

    "text": "After 60 Years, Will Pakistan Be Reborn?\n2007-08-15T04:00:00.000Z\nLondon\nSIXTY years ago, British India was granted independence and partitioned into Hindu-majority India and my native nation, Muslim-majority Pakistan. It was a birth of exceptional pain.\nHanded down to me through the generations is the story of my namesake, my Kashmir-born great-grandfather. He was stabbed by a Muslim as he went for his daily stroll in Lahore\u2019s Lawrence Gardens. Independence was only a few months away, and the communal violence that would accompany the partition was beginning to simmer.\nMy great-grandfather was attacked because he was mistaken for a Hindu. This was not surprising; as a lawyer, most of his colleagues were Hindus, as were many of his friends. He would shelter some of their families in his home during the murderous riots that were to come.\nBut my great-grandfather was a Muslim. More than that, he was a member of the Muslim League, which had campaigned for the creation of Pakistan. From the start, Pakistan has been prone to turning its knife upon itself.\nYet 1947 is also remembered in my family as a time of enormous hope. My great-grandfather survived. And the birth that year of his grandson, my father, marked the arrival of a first generation of something new: Pakistanis.\nMy mother recalls a childhood of sugar and flour rations. The 1950s, she says, were a decade of a young country finding its feet. She grew up in a small town and she describes a fierce love for Pakistan felt by her and her schoolmates. Pakistan was theirs, a source of pride and identity, symbolically both a parent and, because it inspired such feelings of protectiveness, a sibling.\nIn the 1960s, my mother\u2019s family moved to Lahore, which had been the cultural and governmental center of Punjab Province before the region was ripped apart at independence. By then, Pakistan\u2019s economy had begun to boom. My parents speak of cinemas showing the latest films, colleges producing idealistic graduates, and young couples walking along the banks of the River Ravi.\nYet Pakistan\u2019s true glory at that time was the southern port of Karachi, where my uncle, then a young banker, went to live. It was, he says, a vibrant and cosmopolitan city, a place of cafes and sea breezes and visiting international flight crews; it hummed with the energy and ingenuity of millions of former refugees who had come from India.\nStill, these rosy family recollections paint an incomplete picture. For the civilian government of Pakistan had been deposed by a military coup in 1958. Gen. Mohammad Ayub Khan was a steadfast American ally against the Soviet Union and the recipient of large amounts of American weaponry and aid.\nBut deprived of democracy for much of my parents\u2019 youth, Pakistanis were unable to articulate an inclusive vision of what their country stood for. Making things worse, the country was divided in two, separated geographically by India. West Pakistan, the army\u2019s heartland, received far more than its fair share of resources. After years of mistreatment and rigged elections, East Pakistanis fought a war of independence, India took up arms on their side, and East Pakistan became the nation of Bangladesh. \nI was born in 1971, the year of this second partition, as Pakistan once again turned its knife upon itself. \nAfter the bloodshed, what was left of Pakistan was forced to ask what it stood for. Democracy was restored, and Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became wildly popular with a simple slogan: \u201cBread, clothing and a home.\u201d In other words, Pakistan existed to lessen the poverty of its citizens.\nEven I knew this slogan. At the age of two, I was reciting it on the kitchen table, standing tall as I had seen our prime minister do on television. My mother tried to get hold of me, and in my excitement I ran clear off the table, breaking my head on the kitchen floor. I still have the scar. Bhutto faired little better. He was deposed in 1977 and hanged.\nSo, like my parents before me, I was born in a democratic Pakistan but spent much of my youth in a dictatorship. And like General Ayub Khan before him, the new dictator, Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq was a steadfast American ally against the Soviet Union. But whereas General Ayub Khan had been largely secular, General Zia envisioned Pakistan as a theocratic Muslim state. It became a staging-ground for the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan and underwent a dramatic process of social engineering called Islamization.\nGrowing up in Lahore in the 1980s was unsettling. Assault rifles and heroin, byproducts of the war in Afghanistan, flooded the city. I had friends with drug problems, others who sometimes carried guns. Our parents had been able to mingle freely and go to the cinema. But we lived in a time of censorship and of women news anchors being forced to cover their heads on television. Preventing teenage boys and girls from falling in love seemed to be an official concern of the state, and avoiding police checkpoints became part of every date.\nAlthough we disliked our president, my friends and I remained fiercely patriotic. We idolized Pakistani sporting heroes in cricket, field hockey and squash. We felt a thrill of achievement when we listened to bootleg cassettes of the first Pakistani rock bands. For us, the success of anything Pakistani was a source of personal pride.\nIn 1988, shortly before I left for college in America, General Zia died in a suspicious airplane crash and civilian rule was again restored. But the democracy of the \u201990s was a disappointment, with power alternated between ineffective, feuding governments.\nAs my friends married and had children, a third generation of Pakistanis began to arrive. Like my parents\u2019 generation, and like mine, these children were born in a democracy but would spend their youth under pro-American military rule, this time under Gen. Pervez Musharraf. \nAnd now Pakistan is once again turning its knife on itself. Insurgencies simmer in the regions bordering Afghanistan, and suicide bombers have begun to kill fellow Pakistanis with increasing frequency.\nFor me personally, the 60th anniversary of independence, while worthy of note, is not of the utmost importance. My hopes are already dashing ahead and attaching themselves to the elections that are scheduled for later this year.\nOn one side are the forces of exclusion, who wish Pakistan to stand only for their kind of Pakistani. These include the political descendants of the man who stabbed my great-grandfather, the people who seek to oppress those who are clean shaven or those who toil for meager wages or those who are from provinces other than their own. But arrayed against them is something wholly new.\nPakistan now has private television stations that refuse to let the government set the news agenda. It has a Supreme Court that has asserted its independence for the first time, restoring a chief justice suspended by the president. And it has an army under physical attack from within and in desperate need of compromise with civil society.\nA 60th birthday brings with it the obligation to shed some illusions. Pakistanis must realize that we have been our own worst enemies. My wish for our national anniversary is this: that we finally take the knife we have turned too often upon ourselves and place it firmly in its sheath.",

In two years, several dozen mud houses collapsed and washed away. He stared at the water each day. He looked for cracks in his land, the first sign of breakage. He built a new boundary wall.\nThen, when danger seemed imminent, with only eight meters, or 25 feet, of land left in front of his doorstep, he decided to move. \"One day it can just wash away,\" Suleman said. On Sagar Island, the government gave him enough land for a one-room hut and a fish pond. He survives today largely on the earnings of two sons, who work in nearby Calcutta.\nThere was a time, he recalled, when his own coconut harvest was so plentiful that his wife would give the nuts freely to their neighbors. Now, he said, she has to beg for a coconut. His eyes welled up with tears.",

In two years, several dozen mud houses collapsed and washed away. He stared at the water each day. He looked for cracks in his land, the first sign of breakage. He built a new boundary wall.\nThen, when danger seemed imminent, with only eight meters, or 25 feet, of land left in front of his doorstep, he decided to move. \"One day it can just wash away,\" Suleman said. On Sagar Island, the government gave him enough land for a one-room hut and a fish pond. He survives today largely on the earnings of two sons, who work in nearby Calcutta.\nThere was a time, he recalled, when his own coconut harvest was so plentiful that his wife would give the nuts freely to their neighbors. Now, he said, she has to beg for a coconut. His eyes welled up with tears.",

They power everything from irrigation pumps to television sets, allowing growing numbers of rural villages in many poor countries to grow more crops and connect to the wider world.\nBut as the demand increases for the electricity that makes those advances possible, it is often being met through the dirtiest, most inefficient means, creating pollution problems in many remote areas that used to have pristine air and negligible emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas.\n\"There has been a mushrooming of these decentralized diesel generators,\" said Ibrahim Rehman, a rural energy expert at the Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi. While many generators are purchased initially to power irrigation pumps, they have also opened up a huge new market for television sets, which in turn creates demand for even more diesel generators.\n\"You either want clean air or television\" in many villages, said Nandita Mongia, the chief of the United Nations Development Program's regional energy program for Asia and the Pacific.

    "text": "Cricket: For India, it's do or die against Sri Lanka\n2007-03-22T05:00:00.000Z\nIndia's World Cup campaign stands on a knife-edge before its final pool stage match against Sri Lanka in Trinidad on Friday.\nIf India loses, it will almost certainly join neighbors Pakistan \u2014 ejected by Ireland \u2014 in an ignominious early exit from a competition in which it reached the final in 2003. Its only hope of salvation would be if Bangladesh, which defeated India on Saturday, fell Sunday to Bermuda, probably the weakest team in the tournament.\nAn early welcome home would not be pleasant. A mob vandalized wicket- keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni's home after the loss to Bangladesh, while pictures of other players were burned.\nIf the team wins, though, it not only would almost certainly qualify, by virtue of the superior net run rate from its hammering of Bermuda, but would be off to a flying start in the Super Eight stage. Sri Lanka has already qualified, and teams in the Super Eight take with them the result from their match against the other qualifier from their pool.\nThe two teams are close together in the middle of the International Cricket Council's world rankings, with Sri Lanka ahead by a single place and point. They last met little more than a month ago when India took a four-match series by two games to one, with one abandoned because of bad weather. But India was at home, where it performs much better, and Sri Lanka lacked its greatest weapon, the spin-bowler Muttiah Muralitharan.\nSri Lanka has looked more impressive so far. While Bangladesh comprehensively beat India, Sri Lanka slaughtered Bangladesh by 257 runs, making light of the bowlers who had dismissed India for less than 200. Sanath Jayasuriya scored his 32nd one-day international century, a total exceeded only by the 44 of Sachin Tendulkar of India, against Bangladesh.\nMuralitharan is probably the most dangerous bowler in the tournament \u2014 his one serious rival is New Zealand's Shane Bond, who relies on pace \u2014 and he has an excellent supporting cast. Lasith Malingat is the nearest thing cricket has to baseball's submarine-style pitchers, with an extraordinary, but perfectly legal, slinging bowling motion. Chaminda Vaas is a craftsman of fast-medium pace whose control and ability to make the ball swing are made still more dangerous by his left-handed delivery.\nIndians were previously more interested in five-day test matches, and their team struggled in the one-day format, winning only one of six matches in the first two World Cups. But a proliferation of one-day internationals lifted Indian appetite for the short game, generating television income that makes India the game's economic power. It remains to be seen what an early exit would do for the market value of Indian cricket and players whose status as domestic superstars makes them the richest in the game.\nDefeat could conceivably end the World Cup careers of a golden generation of Indian batsmen. Sachin Tendulkar will turn 34 on April 24, the day the first semifinal is played in Jamaica. He has said he would like to be playing in 2011, but whether his form, patchy of late, can withstand four more years of infinite national expectation is another matter. His place in Indian cricket history is secure, along with one in the record books, where his 1,796 runs in World Cup matches leave him more than 600 ahead of his nearest challenger, Ricky Ponting, the Australia captain.\nRahul Dravid, the India captain, and Sourav Ganguly, his immediate predecessor, already are 34. Their 1999 partnership of 318 runs in one day remains the largest ever in the World Cup. The victim was Sri Lanka. India, and those who would like to see a little more of this superbly gifted trio on cricket's largest stage, could do with a repetition Friday.\nPakistan wins for late coach\nInzamam ul-Haq dedicated his last match as Pakistan captain and a one-day player to Bob Woolmer, the coach who died at the tournament, after Pakistan's World Cup victory over Zimbabwe.\nPakistan, already eliminated from the competition, romped to a 93-run victory over Zimbabwe on Wednesday.\n\"This game was difficult because we had dedicated it to Bob and we said before the match, 'We are down but we will get up and give out 100 percent effort for Bob,'\" the captain said.\nZimbabwe was also eliminated.\nThe authorities are investigating Woolmer's death early Sunday. A Pakistan team official said that blood and vomit were in the coach's hotel room and that Woolmer was found by hotel staff on the floor with his mouth wide open\nWoolmer's widow, Gill, told the Indian network NDTV that after Pakistan's loss to Ireland, \"He e-mailed me the following morning. He did mention that he was really depressed and could not believe how this could have happened. The Pakistani team's poor performance affected him, as any other big tournament that he lost as a coach. He believed that what happened happened.\"\nThe police have interviewed workers at Woolmer's hotel, an assistant police commissioner, Les Green, told Radio Jamaica, while the deputy commissioner, Mark Shields, told Nationwide News Network that they were also questioning the Pakistan players and were not sure interviews would be finished by Saturday, when the team is scheduled to leave Jamaica. $@",

    "text": "From China to Panama, a Trail of Poisoned Medicine\n2007-05-06T04:00:00.000Z\nThe kidneys fail first. Then the central nervous system begins to misfire. Paralysis spreads, making breathing difficult, then often impossible without assistance. In the end, most victims die. \nMany of them are children, poisoned at the hands of their unsuspecting parents. \nThe syrupy poison, diethylene glycol, is an indispensable part of the modern world, an industrial solvent and prime ingredient in some antifreeze. \nIt is also a killer. And the deaths, if not intentional, are often no accident. \nOver the years, the poison has been loaded into all varieties of medicine \u2014 cough syrup, fever medication, injectable drugs \u2014 a result of counterfeiters who profit by substituting the sweet-tasting solvent for a safe, more expensive syrup, usually glycerin, commonly used in drugs, food, toothpaste and other products.\nToxic syrup has figured in at least eight mass poisonings around the world in the past two decades. Researchers estimate that thousands have died. In many cases, the precise origin of the poison has never been determined. But records and interviews show that in three of the last four cases it was made in China, a major source of counterfeit drugs. \nPanama is the most recent victim. Last year, government officials there unwittingly mixed diethylene glycol into 260,000 bottles of cold medicine \u2014 with devastating results. Families have reported 365 deaths from the poison, 100 of which have been confirmed so far. With the onset of the rainy season, investigators are racing to exhume as many potential victims as possible before bodies decompose even more. \nPanama\u2019s death toll leads directly to Chinese companies that made and exported the poison as 99.5 percent pure glycerin.\n Forty-six barrels of the toxic syrup arrived via a poison pipeline stretching halfway around the world. Through shipping records and interviews with government officials, The New York Times traced this pipeline from the Panamanian port of Col\u00f3n, back through trading companies in Barcelona, Spain, and Beijing, to its beginning near the Yangtze Delta in a place local people call \u201cchemical country.\u201d\nThe counterfeit glycerin passed through three trading companies on three continents, yet not one of them tested the syrup to confirm what was on the label. Along the way, a certificate falsely attesting to the purity of the shipment was repeatedly altered, eliminating the name of the manufacturer and previous owner. As a result, traders bought the syrup without knowing where it came from, or who made it. With this information, the traders might have discovered \u2014 as The Times did \u2014 that the manufacturer was not certified to make pharmaceutical ingredients.\nAn examination of the two poisoning cases last year \u2014 in Panama and earlier in China \u2014 shows how China\u2019s safety regulations have lagged behind its growing role as low-cost supplier to the world. It also demonstrates how a poorly policed chain of traders in country after country allows counterfeit medicine to contaminate the global market.\nLast week, the United States Food and Drug Administration warned drug makers and suppliers in the United States \u201cto be especially vigilant\u201d in watching for diethylene glycol. The warning did not specifically mention China, and it said there was \u201cno reason to believe\u201d that glycerin in this country was tainted. Even so, the agency asked that all glycerin shipments be tested for diethylene glycol, and said it was \u201cexploring how supplies of glycerin become contaminated.\u201d\nChina is already being accused by United States authorities of exporting wheat gluten containing an industrial chemical, melamine, that ended up in pet food and livestock feed. The F.D.A. recently banned imports of Chinese-made wheat gluten after it was linked to pet deaths in the United States.\nBeyond Panama and China, toxic syrup has caused mass poisonings in Haiti, Bangladesh, Argentina, Nigeria and twice in India. \nIn Bangladesh, investigators found poison in seven brands of fever medication in 1992, but only after countless children died. A Massachusetts laboratory detected the contamination after Dr. Michael L. Bennish, a pediatrician who works in developing countries, smuggled samples of the tainted syrup out of the country in a suitcase. Dr. Bennish, who investigated the Bangladesh epidemic and helped write a 1995 article about it for BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal, said that given the amount of medication distributed, deaths \u201cmust be in the thousands or tens of thousands.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s vastly underreported,\u201d Dr. Bennish said of diethylene glycol poisoning. Doctors might not suspect toxic medicine, particularly in poor countries with limited resources and a generally unhealthy population, he said, adding, \u201cMost people who die don\u2019t come to a medical facility.\u201d\nThe makers of counterfeit glycerin, which superficially looks and acts like the real thing but generally costs considerably less, are rarely identified, much less prosecuted, given the difficulty of tracing shipments across borders. \u201cThis is really a global problem, and it needs to be handled in a global way,\u201d said Dr. Henk Bekedam, the World Health Organization\u2019s top representative in Beijing. \nSeventy years ago, medicine laced with diethylene glycol killed more than 100 people in the United States, leading to the passage of the toughest drug regulations of that era and the creation of the modern Food and Drug Administration.\n The F.D.A. has tried to help in poisoning cases around the world, but there is only so much it can do.\n When at least 88 children died in Haiti a decade ago, F.D.A. investigators traced the poison to the Manchurian city of Dalian, but their attempts to visit the suspected manufacturer were repeatedly blocked by Chinese officials, according to internal State Department records. Permission was granted more than a year later, but by then the plant had moved and its records had been destroyed.\n\u201cChinese officials we contacted on this matter were all reluctant to become involved,\u201d the American Embassy in Beijing wrote in a confidential cable. \u201cWe cannot be optimistic about our chances for success in tracking down the other possible glycerine shipments.\u201d \n In fact, The Times found records showing that the same Chinese company implicated in the Haiti poisoning also shipped about 50 tons of counterfeit glycerin to the United States in 1995. Some of it was later resold to another American customer, Avatar Corporation, before the deception was discovered. \n\u201cThank God we caught it when we did,\u201d said Phil Ternes, chief operating officer of Avatar, a Chicago-area supplier of bulk pharmaceuticals and nonmedicinal products. The F.D.A. said it was unaware of the shipment.\nIn China, the government is vowing to clean up its pharmaceutical industry, in part because of criticism over counterfeit drugs flooding the world markets. In December, two top drug regulators were arrested on charges of taking bribes to approve drugs. In addition, 440 counterfeiting operations were closed down last year, the World Health Organization said.\nBut when Chinese officials investigated the role of Chinese companies in the Panama deaths, they found that no laws had been broken, according to an official of the nation\u2019s drug enforcement agency. China\u2019s drug regulation is \u201ca black hole,\u201d said one trader who has done business through CNSC Fortune Way, the Beijing-based broker that investigators say was a crucial conduit for the Panama poison. \nIn this environment, Wang Guiping, a tailor with a ninth-grade education and access to a chemistry book, found it easy to enter the pharmaceutical supply business as a middleman. He quickly discovered what others had before him: that counterfeiting was a simple way to increase profits. \nAnd then people in China began to die.\nCheating the System\nMr. Wang spent years as a tailor in the manufacturing towns of the Yangtze Delta, in eastern China. But he did not want to remain a common craftsman, villagers say. He set his sights on trading chemicals, a business rooted in the many small chemical plants that have sprouted in the region.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know what he was doing,\u201d Mr. Wang\u2019s older brother, Wang Guoping, said in an interview. \u201cHe didn\u2019t understand chemicals.\u201d\nBut he did understand how to cheat the system.\nWang Guiping, 41, realized he could earn extra money by substituting cheaper, industrial-grade syrup \u2014 not approved for human consumption \u2014 for pharmaceutical grade syrup. To trick pharmaceutical buyers, he forged his licenses and laboratory analysis reports, records show.\nMr. Wang later told investigators that he figured no harm would come from the substitution, because he initially tested a small quantity. He did it with the expertise of a former tailor.\nHe swallowed some of it. When nothing happened, he shipped it.\nOne company that used the syrup beginning in early 2005 was Qiqihar No. 2 Pharmaceutical, about 1,000 miles away in Heilongjiang Province in the northeast. A buyer for the factory had seen a posting for Mr. Wang\u2019s syrup on an industry Web site. \nAfter a while, Mr. Wang set out to find an even cheaper substitute syrup so he could increase his profit even more, according to a Chinese investigator. In a chemical book he found what he was looking for: another odorless syrup \u2014 diethylene glycol. At the time, it sold for 6,000 to 7,000 yuan a ton, or about $725 to $845, while pharmaceutical-grade syrup cost 15,000 yuan, or about $1,815, according to the investigator. \nMr. Wang did not taste-test this second batch of syrup before shipping it to Qiqihar Pharmaceutical, the government investigator said, adding, \u201cHe knew it was dangerous, but he didn\u2019t know that it could kill.\u201d \nThe manufacturer used the toxic syrup in five drug products: ampules of Amillarisin A for gall bladder problems; a special enema fluid for children; an injection for blood vessel diseases; an intravenous pain reliever; and an arthritis treatment. \nIn April 2006, one of southern China\u2019s finest hospitals, in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, began administering Amillarisin A. Within a month or so, at least 18 people had died after taking the medicine, though some had already been quite sick. \nZhou Jianhong, 33, said his father took his first dose of Amillarisin A on April 19. A week later he was in critical condition. \u201cIf you are going to die, you want to die at home,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cSo we checked him out of the hospital.\u201d He died the next day.\n\u201cEverybody wants to invest in the pharmaceutical industry and it is growing, but the regulators can\u2019t keep up,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cWe need a system to assure our safety.\u201d\nThe final death count is unclear, since some people who took the medicine may have died in less populated areas. \nIn a small town in Sichuan Province, a man named Zhou Lianghui said the authorities would not acknowledge that his wife had died from taking tainted Amillarisin A. But Mr. Zhou, 38, said he matched the identification number on the batch of medicine his wife received with a warning circular distributed by drug officials.\n\u201cYou probably cannot understand a small town if you are in Beijing,\u201d Zhou Lianghui said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe sky is high, and the emperor is far away. There are a lot of problems here that the law cannot speak to.\u201d \nThe failure of the government to stop poison from contaminating the drug supply caused one of the bigger domestic scandals of the year. Last May, China\u2019s premier, Wen Jiabao, ordered an investigation of the deaths, declaring, \u201cThe pharmaceutical market is in disorder.\u201d \nAt about the same time, 9,000 miles away in Panama, the long rainy season had begun. Anticipating colds and coughs, the government health program began manufacturing cough and antihistamine syrup. The cough medicine was sugarless so that even diabetics could use it.\nThe medicine was mixed with a pale yellow, almost translucent syrup that had arrived in 46 barrels from Barcelona on the container ship Tobias Maersk. Shipping records showed the contents to be 99.5 percent pure glycerin.\nIt would be months and many deaths later before that certification was discovered to be pure fiction.\nA Mysterious Illness\nEarly last September, doctors at Panama City\u2019s big public hospital began to notice patients exhibiting unusual symptoms. \nThey initially appeared to have Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a relatively rare neurological disorder that first shows up as a weakness or tingling sensation in the legs. That weakness often intensifies, spreading upward to the arms and chest, sometimes causing total paralysis and an inability to breathe.\nThe new patients had paralysis, but it did not spread upward. They also quickly lost their ability to urinate, a condition not associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9. Even more unusual was the number of cases. In a full year, doctors might see eight cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9, yet they saw that many in just two weeks. \nDoctors sought help from an infectious disease specialist, N\u00e9stor Sosa, an intense, driven doctor who competes in triathlons and high-level chess. \nDr. Sosa\u2019s medical specialty had a long, rich history in Panama, once known as one of the world\u2019s unhealthiest places. In one year in the late 1800s, a lethal mix of yellow fever and malaria killed nearly 1 in every 10 residents of Panama City. Only after the United States managed to overcome those mosquito-borne diseases was it able to build the Panama Canal without the devastation that undermined an earlier attempt by the French.\nThe suspected Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases worried Dr. Sosa. \u201cIt was something really extraordinary, something that was obviously reaching epidemic dimensions in our hospital,\u201d he said.\nWith the death rate from the mystery illness near 50 percent, Dr. Sosa alerted the hospital management, which asked him to set up and run a task force to handle the situation. The assignment, a daunting around-the-clock dash to catch a killer, was one he eagerly embraced. \nSeveral years earlier, Dr. Sosa had watched as other doctors identified the cause of another epidemic, later identified as hantavirus, a pathogen spread by infected rodents.\n \u201cI took care of patients but I somehow felt I did not do enough,\u201d he said. The next time, he vowed, would be different. \nDr. Sosa set up a 24-hour \u201cwar room\u201d in the hospital, where doctors could compare notes and theories as they scoured medical records for clues.\n As a precaution, the patients with the mystery illness were segregated and placed in a large empty room awaiting renovation. Health care workers wore masks, heightening fears in the hospital and the community.\n\u201cThat spread a lot of panic,\u201d said Dr. Jorge Motta, a cardiologist who runs the Gorgas Memorial Institute, a widely respected medical research center in Panama. \u201cThat is always a terrifying thought, that you will be the epicenter of a new infectious disease, and especially a new infectious disease that kills with a high rate of death, like this.\u201d\nMeanwhile, patients kept coming, and hospital personnel could barely keep up. \n\u201cI ended up giving C.P.R.,\u201d Dr. Sosa said. \u201cI haven\u2019t given C.P.R. since I was a resident, but there were so many crises going on.\u201d \nFrightened hospital patients had to watch others around them die for reasons no one understood, fearing that they might be next.\nAs reports of strange Guillain-Barr\u00e9 symptoms started coming in from other parts of the country, doctors realized they were not just dealing with a localized outbreak.\nPascuala P\u00e9rez de Gonz\u00e1lez, 67, sought treatment for a cold at a clinic in Cocl\u00e9 Province, about a three-hour drive from Panama City. In late September she was treated and sent home. Within days, she could no longer eat; she stopped urinating and went into convulsions. \nA decision was made to take her to the public hospital in Panama City, but on the way she stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated. She arrived at the hospital in a deep coma and later died.\nMedical records contained clues but also plenty of false leads. Early victims tended to be males older than 60 and diabetic with high blood pressure. About half had been given Lisinopril, a blood pressure medicine distributed by the public health system.\nBut many who did not receive Lisinopril still got sick. On the chance that those patients might have forgotten that they had taken the drug, doctors pulled Lisinopril from pharmacy shelves \u2014 only to return it after tests found nothing wrong. \nInvestigators would later discover that Lisinopril did play an important, if indirect role in the epidemic, but not in the way they had imagined.\nA Major Clue\nOne patient of particular interest to Dr. Sosa came into the hospital with a heart attack, but no Guillain-Barr\u00e9-type symptoms. While undergoing treatment, the patient received several drugs, including Lisinopril. After a while, he began to exhibit the same neurological distress that was the hallmark of the mystery illness.\n\u201cThis patient is a major clue,\u201d Dr. Sosa recalled saying. \u201cThis is not something environmental, this is not a folk medicine that\u2019s been taken by the patients at home. This patient developed the disease in the hospital, in front of us.\u201d\nSoon after, another patient told Dr. Sosa that he, too, developed symptoms after taking Lisinopril, but because the medicine made him cough, he also took cough syrup \u2014 the same syrup, it turned out, that had been given to the heart patient.\n\u201cI said this has got to be it,\u201d Dr. Sosa recalled. \u201cWe need to investigate this cough syrup.\u201d\nThe cough medicine had not initially aroused much suspicion because many victims did not remember taking it. \u201cTwenty-five percent of those people affected denied that they had taken cough syrup, because it\u2019s a nonevent in their lives,\u201d Dr. Motta said. \nInvestigators from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who were in Panama helping out, quickly put the bottles on a government jet and flew them to the United States for testing. The next day, Oct. 11, as Panamanian health officials were attending a news conference, a Blackberry in the room went off. \nThe tests, the C.D.C. was reporting, had turned up diethylene glycol in the cough syrup.\nThe mystery had been solved. The barrels labeled glycerin turned out to contain poison. \nDr. Sosa\u2019s exhilaration at learning the cause did not last long. \u201cIt\u2019s our medication that is killing these people,\u201d he said he thought. \u201cIt\u2019s not a virus, it\u2019s not something that they got outside, but it was something we actually manufactured.\u201d\nA nationwide campaign was quickly begun to stop people from using the cough syrup. Neighborhoods were searched, but thousands of bottles either had been discarded or could not be found. \nAs the search wound down, two major tasks remained: count the dead and assign blame. Neither has been easy. \nA precise accounting is all but impossible because, medical authorities say, victims were buried before the cause was known, and poor patients might not have seen doctors.\nAnother problem is that finding traces of diethylene glycol in decomposing bodies is difficult at best, medical experts say. Nonetheless, an Argentine pathologist who has studied diethylene glycol poisonings helped develop a test for the poison in exhumed bodies. Seven of the first nine bodies tested showed traces of the poison, Panamanian authorities said. \nWith the rainy season returning, though, the exhumations are about to end. Dr. Jos\u00e9 Vicente Pachar, director of Panama\u2019s Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, said that as a scientist he would like a final count of the dead. But he added, \u201cI should accept the reality that in the case of Panama we are not going to know the exact number.\u201d \nLocal prosecutors have made some arrests and are investigating others connected to the case, including officials of the import company and the government agency that mixed and distributed the cold medicine. \u201cOur responsibilities are to establish or discover the truth,\u201d said Dimas Guevara, the homicide investigator guiding the inquiry. \n But prosecutors have yet to charge anyone with actually making the counterfeit glycerin. And if the Panama investigation unfolds as other inquiries have, it is highly unlikely that they ever will.\nA Suspect Factory\nPanamanians wanting to see where their toxic nightmare began could look up the Web site of the company in Hengxiang, China, that investigators in four countries have identified as having made the syrup \u2014 the Taixing Glycerine Factory. There, under the words \u201cAbout Us,\u201d they would see a picture of a modern white building nearly a dozen stories tall, adorned by three arches at the entrance. The factory, the Web site boasts, \u201ccan strictly obey the contract and keep its word.\u201d \nBut like the factory\u2019s syrup, all is not as it seems. \nThere are no tall buildings in Hengxiang, a country town with one main road. The factory is not certified to sell any medical ingredients, Chinese officials say. And it looks nothing like the picture on the Internet. In reality, its chemicals are mixed in a plain, one-story brick building. \nThe factory is in a walled compound, surrounded by small shops and farms. In the spring, nearby fields of rape paint the countryside yellow. Near the front gate, a sign over the road warns, \u201cBeware of counterfeits.\u201d But it was posted by a nearby noodle machine factory that appears to be worried about competition.\nThe Taixing Glycerine Factory bought its diethylene glycol from the same manufacturer as Mr. Wang, the former tailor, the government investigator said. From this spot in China\u2019s chemical country, the 46 barrels of toxic syrup began their journey, passing from company to company, port to port and country to country, apparently without anyone testing their contents. \nTraders should be thoroughly familiar with their suppliers, United States health officials say. \u201cOne simply does not assume that what is labeled is indeed what it is,\u201d said Dr. Murray Lumpkin, deputy commissioner for international and special programs for the Food and Drug Administration.\nIn the Panama case, names of suppliers were removed from shipping documents as they passed from one entity to the next, according to records and investigators. That is a practice some traders use to prevent customers from bypassing them on future purchases, but it also hides the provenance of the product. \nThe first distributor was the Beijing trading company, CNSC Fortune Way, a unit of a state-owned business that began by supplying goods and services to Chinese personnel and business officials overseas.\nAs China\u2019s market reach expanded, Fortune Way focused its business on pharmaceutical ingredients, and in 2003, it brokered the sale of the suspect syrup made by the Taixing Glycerine Factory. The manufacturer\u2019s certificate of analysis showed the batch to be 99.5 percent pure.\nWhether the Taixing Glycerine Factory actually performed the test has not been publicly disclosed. \nOriginal certificates of analysis should be passed on to each new buyer, said Kevin J. McGlue, a board member of the International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council. In this case, that was not done.\nFortune Way translated the certificate into English, putting its name \u2014 not the Taixing Glycerine Factory\u2019s \u2014 at the top of the document, before shipping the barrels to a second trading company, this one in Barcelona.\nLi Can, managing director at Fortune Way, said he did not remember the transaction and could not comment, adding, \u201cThere is a high volume of trade.\u201d \nUpon receiving the barrels in September 2003, the Spanish company, Rasfer International, did not test the contents, either. It copied the chemical analysis provided by Fortune Way, then put its logo on it. Ascensi\u00f3n Criado, Rasfer\u2019s manager, said in an e-mail response to written questions that when Fortune Way shipped the syrup, it did not say who made it. \nSeveral weeks later, Rasfer shipped the drums to a Panamanian broker, the Medicom Business Group. \u201cMedicom never asked us for the name of the manufacturer,\u201d Ms. Criado said.\nA lawyer for Medicom, Valent\u00edn Ja\u00e9n, said his client was a victim, too. \u201cThey were tricked by somebody,\u201d Mr. Ja\u00e9n said. \u201cThey operated in good faith.\u201d\nIn Panama, the barrels sat unused for more than two years, and officials said Medicom improperly changed the expiration date on the syrup. \nDuring that time, the company never tested the product. And the Panamanian government, which bought the 46 barrels and used them to make cold medicine, also failed to detect the poison, officials said. \nThe toxic pipeline ultimately emptied into the bloodstream of people like Ernesto Osorio, a former high school teacher in Panama City. He spent two months in the hospital after ingesting poison cough syrup last September.\n Just before Christmas, after a kidney dialysis treatment, Mr. Osorio stood outside the city\u2019s big public hospital in a tear-splattered shirt, describing what his life had become. \n\u201cI\u2019m not an eighth of what I used to be,\u201d Mr. Osorio said, his partly paralyzed face hanging like a slab of meat. \u201cI have trouble walking. Look at my face, look at my tears.\u201d The tears, he said apologetically, were not from emotion, but from nerve damage.\n And yet, Mr. Osorio knows he is one of the lucky victims. \n\u201cThey didn\u2019t know how to keep the killer out of the medicine,\u201d he said simply.\nWhile the suffering in Panama was great, the potential profit \u2014 at least for the Spanish trading company, Rasfer \u2014 was surprisingly small. For the 46 barrels of glycerin, Rasfer paid Fortune Way $9,900, then sold them to Medicom for $11,322, according to records.\nChinese authorities have not disclosed how much Fortune Way and the Taixing Glycerine Factory made on their end, or how much they knew about what was in the barrels.\n\u201cThe fault has to be traced back to areas of production,\u201d said Dr. Motta, the cardiologist in Panama who helped uncover the source of the epidemic. \u201cThis was my plea \u2014 please, this thing is happening to us, make sure whoever did this down the line is not doing it to Peru or Sierra Leone or some other place.\u201d\nA Counterfeiter\u2019s Confession\nThe power to prosecute the counterfeiters is now in the hands of the Chinese.\nLast spring, the government moved quickly against Mr. Wang, the former tailor who poisoned Chinese residents. \nThe authorities caught up with him at a roadblock in Taizhou, a city just north of Taixing, in chemical country. He was weak and sick, and he had not eaten in two days. Inside his white sedan was a bankbook and cash. He had fled without his wife and teenage son.\nChinese patients were dead, a political scandal was brewing and the authorities wanted answers. Mr. Wang was taken to a hospital. Then, in long sessions with investigators, he gave them what they wanted, explaining his scheme, how he tested industrial syrup by drinking it, how he decided to use diethylene glycol and how he conned pharmaceutical companies into buying his syrup, according to a government official who was present for his interrogation. \n\u201cHe made a fortune, but none of it went to his family,\u201d said Wang Xiaodong, a former village official who knows Mr. Wang and his siblings. \u201cHe liked to gamble.\u201d\nMr. Wang remains in custody as the authorities decide whether he should be put to death. The Qiqihar drug plant that made the poisonous medicine has been closed, and five employees are now being prosecuted for causing \u201ca serious accident.\u201d\nIn contrast to the Wang Guiping investigation, Chinese authorities have been tentative in acknowledging China\u2019s link to the Panama tragedy, which involved a state-owned trading company. No one in China has been charged with committing the fraud that ended up killing so many in Panama. \nSun Jing, the pharmaceutical program officer for the World Health Organization in Beijing, said the health agency sent a fax \u201cto remind the Chinese government that China should not be selling poisonous products overseas.\u201d Ms. Sun said the agency did not receive an official reply. \nLast fall, at the request of the United States \u2014 Panama has no diplomatic relations with China \u2014 the State Food and Drug Administration of China investigated the Taixing Glycerine Factory and Fortune Way. \nThe agency tested one batch of glycerin from the factory, and found no glycerin, only diethylene glycol and two other substances, a drug official said.\nSince then, the Chinese drug administration has concluded that it has no jurisdiction in the case because the factory is not certified to make medicine.\n The agency reached a similar conclusion about Fortune Way, saying that as an exporter it was not engaged in the pharmaceutical business.\n\u201cWe did not find any evidence that either of these companies had broken the law,\u201d said Yan Jiangying, a spokeswoman for the drug administration. \u201cSo a criminal investigation was never opened.\u201d \nA drug official said the investigation was subsequently handed off to an agency that tests and certifies commercial products \u2014 the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. \nBut the agency acted surprised to learn that it was now in charge. \u201cWhat investigation?\u201d asked Wang Jian, director of its Taixing branch. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any investigation involving a glycerin factory.\u201d\nBesides, Huang Tong, an investigator in that office, said, \u201cWe rarely get involved in products that are sold for export.\u201d\nWan Qigang, the legal representative for the Taixing Glycerine Factory, said in an interview late last year that the authorities had not questioned him about the Panama poisoning, and that his company made only industrial-grade glycerin. \n\u201cI can tell you for certain that we have no connection with Panama or Spain,\u201d Mr. Wan said.\nBut in recent months, the Glycerine Factory has advertised 99.5 percent pure glycerin on the Internet.\nMr. Wan recently declined to answer any more questions. \u201cIf you come here as a guest, I will welcome you,\u201d Mr. Wan said. \u201cBut if you come again wanting to talk about this matter, I will make a telephone call.\u201d \nA local government official said Mr. Wan was told not to grant interviews.\nA five-minute walk away, another manufacturer, the Taixing White Oil Factory, also advertises medical glycerin on the Internet, yet it, too, has no authorization to make it. The company\u2019s Web site says its products \u201chave been exported to America, Australia and Italy.\u201d\nDing Xiang, who represents the White Oil Factory, denied that his company made pharmaceutical-grade glycerin, but he said chemical trading companies in Beijing often called, asking for it.\n \u201cThey want us to mark the barrels glycerin,\u201d Mr. Ding said in late December. \u201cI tell them we cannot do that.\u201d\nMr. Ding said he stopped answering calls from Beijing. \u201cIf this stuff is taken overseas and improperly used. ...\u201d He did not complete the thought. \n In chemical country, product names are not always what they seem. \n\u201cThe only two factories in Taixing that make glycerin don\u2019t even make glycerin,\u201d said Jiang Peng, who oversees inspections and investigations in the Taixing branch of the State Food and Drug Administration. \u201cIt is a different product.\u201d\nAll in a Name\nOne lingering mystery involves the name of the product made by the Taixing Glycerine Factory. The factory had called its syrup \u201cTD\u201d glycerin. The letters TD were in virtually all the shipping documents. What did TD mean? \nSpanish medical authorities concluded that it stood for a manufacturing process. Chinese inspectors thought it was the manufacturer\u2019s secret formula. \nBut Yuan Kailin, a former salesman for the factory , said he knew what the TD meant because a friend and former manager of the factory, Ding Yuming, had once told him. TD stood for the Chinese word \u201ctidai\u201d (pronounced tee-die), said Mr. Yuan, who left his job in 1998 and still lives about a mile from the factory. \nIn Chinese, tidai means substitute. A clue that might have revealed the poison, the counterfeit product, was hiding in plain sight. \nIt was in the product name.",

    "text": "Money isn't everything - Opinion - International Herald Tribune\n2007-02-13T05:00:00.000Z\nMORGAN HILL, California \u2014 \n\nMuhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank, is widely lauded for lifting millions of Bangladeshi peasants out of poverty through his micro-lending initiative. He awes his audiences with stories of how loans of just a few dollars can be life-transforming for the recipients, allowing debt-ridden villagers to free themselves from the clutches of ruthless moneylenders, or enabling small-scale entrepreneurs to get on their feet.\nYet Grameen's success has less to do with the amount of credit extended than with the accompanying behavioral changes that the bank demands of its borrowers. That is why some attempts at replicating this wonderful idea elsewhere have been less than successful.\nMalaysia, for example, has a similar program, run by the government, but its impact on poverty reduction has been unimpressive. Instead, it has bred a pile of dud loans. With the government carrying the operating costs, the program quickly acquired a bloated bureaucracy that spent more time training employees than advising borrowers, with priority for some loans going to the politically connected. The recent conviction of its top executive for corruption reflects the rot.\nMore significantly, the Malaysian initiative also failed to change negative cultural and religious perceptions on the practice of charging interest. Initially, the program camouflaged interest rates as \"service charges.\" This inability to change local cultural norms is a common problem that has lead to the failure of micro-lending elsewhere. In rural India, for example, the involvement of women in business fueled a rapid increase in divorce.\nWhen he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, Yunus said that Grameen Bank had lent nearly $6 billion over the last 30 years in loans that average $130 each. A key stipulation of the program is that its loans must be for income-producing activities, not consumption. But, perhaps more important, Grameen's borrowers also must commit to the program's \"16 decisions,\" which include family planning, educating their children, not accepting or giving dowries, and embracing \"discipline, unity, courage and hard work\" in all walks of life.\nThe emphasis on values over money is wise advice, and not just for poor Bangladeshi peasants. The success of Yunus is inspiring others to emulate the Grameen Bank's program. Various governmental agencies, nonprofit organizations and commercial entities are entering the field. There are even eBay- like enterprises linking borrowers and lenders.\nBut these well-intentioned endeavors will fail \u2014 as with the Malaysian experience \u2014 if they focus only on lending, and not on changing underlying attitudes and behavior. The Malaysian initiative could be enhanced by not linking the program to the political establishment, the main reason for its degeneration into political patronage. Lenders could also have taught their borrowers the fundamentals of running a small enterprise and used their clout to negotiate discounts on behalf of their borrowers. In one effort to help poor fishermen mechanize their boats, the bank simply provided the money. Local suppliers, on hearing of the fishermen's sudden bounty, hiked their prices, jeopardizing the economic viability of the project.\nThe most important lesson from Grameen is that cultural values, even those long entrenched, can be successfully modified. Bangladesh is a Muslim country, where concepts such as charging interest or using contraception are considered \"un-Islamic.\" Yet, by using micro-loans as a cultural stimulus as well as an economic instrument, Yunus changes the attitudes of his fellow citizens at the grass-roots level. How many Bangladeshi families have been doomed to poverty because of large families and extortionate dowries?\nThe operational details of Grameen are equally noteworthy. By requiring weekly payments, borrowers are constantly reminded of their obligations. The close relationship between borrowers and lenders means that they know exactly the consequences of non-repayments: other potential borrowers \u2014 often fellow villagers \u2014 will be deprived of their opportunities. Grameen's emphasis on behavioral changes alone may indeed be more of a help in easing people out of poverty than the money itself.\nA medical metaphor will illuminate my point. Imagine an overweight, chain-smoking couch potato seeking medical help. He is advised to lose weight, eat healthy foods, exercise regularly, quit smoking, and is then prescribed expensive medications to lower his blood pressure and cholesterol levels. He follows the advice religiously and lives to a ripe old age. When asked for the secret of his longevity, he gratefully attributes it to the miracles of modern medication. Yet had he pursued a healthy lifestyle to begin with, he would have had little need for those expensive wonder drugs.\nThe Grameen Bank miracle is in using those micro-loans as a social stimulus to effect needed changes in personal behavior and cultural values. This key point is often missed by those enthusiastic in replicating the bank's success.",

    "text": "From China to Panama, a trail of poisoned medicine\n2007-05-05T05:00:00.000Z\nThe kidneys fail first. Then the central nervous system begins to misfire. Paralysis spreads, making breathing difficult, then often impossible without assistance. In the end, most victims die.\nMany of them are children, poisoned at the hands of their unsuspecting parents.\nThe syrupy poison, diethylene glycol, is an indispensable part of the modern world, an industrial solvent and prime ingredient in antifreeze.\nIt is also a killer. And the deaths, if not intentional, are often no accident.\nOver the years, the poison has been loaded into all varieties of medicine \u2014 cough syrup, fever medication, injectable drugs \u2014 a result of counterfeiters who profit by substituting the sweet-tasting solvent for a safe, more expensive syrup, usually glycerin, commonly used in drugs, food, toothpaste and other products.\nToxic syrup has figured in at least eight mass poisonings around the world in the past two decades. Researchers estimate that thousands have died. In many cases, the precise origin of the poison has never been determined. But records and interviews show that in three of the last four cases it was made in China, a major source of counterfeit drugs.\nPanama is the most recent victim. Last year, government officials there unwittingly mixed diethylene glycol into 260,000 bottles of cold medicine \u2014 with devastating results. Families have reported 365 deaths from the poison, 100 of which have been confirmed so far. With the onset of the rainy season, investigators are racing to exhume as many potential victims as possible before bodies decompose even more.\nPanama's death toll leads directly to Chinese companies that made and exported the poison as 99.5 percent pure glycerin.\nForty-six barrels of the toxic syrup arrived via a poison pipeline stretching halfway around the world. Through shipping records and interviews with government officials, The New York Times traced this pipeline from the Panamanian port of Col\u00f3n, back through trading companies in Barcelona, Spain, and Beijing, to its beginning near the Yangtze Delta in a place local people call \"chemical country.\"\nThe counterfeit glycerin passed through three trading companies on three continents, yet not one of them tested the syrup to confirm what was on the label. Along the way, a certificate falsely attesting to the purity of the shipment was repeatedly altered, eliminating the name of the manufacturer and previous owner. As a result, traders bought the syrup without knowing where it came from, or who made it. With this information, the traders might have discovered \u2014 as The Times did \u2014 that the manufacturer was not certified to make pharmaceutical ingredients.\nAn examination of the two poisoning cases last year \u2014 in Panama and earlier in China \u2014 shows how China's safety regulations have lagged behind its growing role as low-cost supplier to the world. It also demonstrates how a poorly policed chain of traders in country after country allows counterfeit medicine to contaminate the global market.\nLast week, the United States Food and Drug Administration warned drug makers and suppliers in the United States \"to be especially vigilant\" in watching for diethylene glycol. The warning did not specifically mention China, and it said there was \"no reason to believe\" that glycerin in this country was tainted. Even so, the agency asked that all glycerin shipments be tested for diethylene glycol, and said it was \"exploring how supplies of glycerin become contaminated.\"\nChina is already being accused by United States authorities of exporting wheat gluten containing an industrial chemical, melamine, that ended up in pet food and livestock feed. The FDA recently banned imports of Chinese-made wheat gluten after it was linked to pet deaths in the United States.\nBeyond Panama and China, toxic syrup has caused mass poisonings in Haiti, Bangladesh, Argentina, Nigeria and twice in India.\nIn Bangladesh, investigators found poison in seven brands of fever medication in 1992, but only after countless children died. A Massachusetts laboratory detected the contamination after Dr. Michael Bennish, a pediatrician who works in developing countries, smuggled samples of the tainted syrup out of the country in a suitcase. Dr. Bennish, who investigated the Bangladesh epidemic and helped write a 1995 article about it for BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal, said that given the amount of medication distributed, deaths \"must be in the thousands or tens of thousands.\"\n\"It's vastly underreported,\" Dr. Bennish said of diethylene glycol poisoning. Doctors might not suspect toxic medicine, particularly in poor countries with limited resources and a generally unhealthy population, he said, adding, \"Most people who die don't come to a medical facility.\"\nThe makers of counterfeit glycerin, which superficially looks and acts like the real thing but generally costs considerably less, are rarely identified, much less prosecuted, given the difficulty of tracing shipments across borders. \"This is really a global problem, and it needs to be handled in a global way,\" said Dr. Henk Bekedam, the World Health Organization's top representative in Beijing.\nSeventy years ago, medicine laced with diethylene glycol killed more than 100 people in the United States, leading to the passage of the toughest drug regulations of that era and the creation of the modern Food and Drug Administration.\nThe FDA has tried to help in poisoning cases around the world, but there is only so much it can do.\nWhen at least 88 children died in Haiti a decade ago, FDA investigators traced the poison to the Manchurian city of Dalian, but their attempts to visit the suspected manufacturer were repeatedly blocked by Chinese officials, according to internal State Department records. Permission came more than a year later, but by then the plant had moved and its records were destroyed.\n\"Chinese officials we contacted on this matter were all reluctant to become involved,\" the American Embassy in Beijing wrote in a confidential cable. \"We cannot be optimistic about our chances for success in tracking down the other possible glycerine shipments.\"\nIn fact, The Times found records showing that the same Chinese company implicated in the Haiti poisoning also shipped about 50 tons of counterfeit glycerin to the United States in 1995. Some of it was later resold to another American customer, Avatar Corporation, before the deception was discovered.\n\"Thank God we caught it when we did,\" said Phil Ternes, chief operating officer of Avatar, a Chicago-area supplier of bulk pharmaceuticals and nonmedicinal products. The FDA said it was unaware of the shipment.\nIn China, the government is vowing to clean up its pharmaceutical industry, in part because of criticism over counterfeit drugs flooding the world markets. In December, two top drug regulators were arrested on charges of taking bribes to approve drugs. In addition, 440 counterfeiting operations were closed down last year, the World Health Organization said.\nBut when Chinese officials investigated the role of Chinese companies in the Panama deaths, they found that no laws had been broken, according to an official of the nation's drug enforcement agency. China's drug regulation is \"a black hole,\" said one trader who has done business through CNSC Fortune Way, the Beijing-based broker that investigators say was a crucial conduit for the Panama poison.\nIn this environment, Wang Guiping, a tailor with a ninth-grade education and access to a chemistry book, found it easy to enter the pharmaceutical supply business as a middleman. He quickly discovered what others had before him: that counterfeiting was a simple way to increase profits.\nAnd then people in China began to die.\nCheating the System\nWang spent years as a tailor in the manufacturing towns of the Yangtze Delta, in eastern China. But he did not want to remain a common craftsman, villagers say. He set his sights on trading chemicals, a business rooted in the many small chemical plants that have sprouted in the region.\n\"He didn't know what he was doing,\" Wang's older brother, Wang Guoping, said in an interview. \"He didn't understand chemicals.\"\nBut he did understand how to cheat the system.\nWang Guiping, 41, realized he could earn extra money by substituting cheaper, industrial-grade syrup \u2014 not approved for human consumption \u2014 for pharmaceutical grade syrup. To trick pharmaceutical buyers, he forged his licenses and laboratory analysis reports, records show.\nWang later told investigators that he figured no harm would come from the substitution, because he initially tested a small quantity. He did it with the expertise of a former tailor.\nHe swallowed some of it. When nothing happened, he shipped it.\nOne company that used the syrup beginning in early 2005 was Qiqihar No. 2 Pharmaceutical, about 1,000 miles away in the far northeastern province of Heilongjiang. A buyer for the factory had seen a posting for Wang's syrup on an industry Web site.\nAfter a while, Wang set out to find an even cheaper substitute syrup so he could increase his profit even more, according to a Chinese investigator. In a chemical book he found what he was looking for: another odorless syrup \u2014 diethylene glycol. At the time, it sold for 6,000 to 7,000 yuan a ton, or about $725 to $845, while pharmaceutical-grade syrup cost 15,000 yuan, or about $1,815, according to the investigator.\nWang did not taste-test this second batch of syrup before shipping it to Qiqihar Pharmaceutical, the government investigator said, adding, \"He knew it was dangerous, but he didn't know that it could kill.\"\nThe manufacturer used the toxic syrup in five separate drug products: ampules of Amillarisin A for gall bladder problems; a special enema fluid for children; an injection for blood vessel diseases; an intravenous pain reliever; and an arthritis treatment.\nIn April 2006, one of southern China's finest hospitals, in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, began administering Amillarisin Within a month or so, at least 18 people had died after taking the medicine, though some had already been quite sick.\nZhou Jianhong, 33, said his father took his first dose of Amillarisin A on April 19. A week later he was in critical condition. \"If you are going to die, you want to die at home,\" Zhou said. \"So we checked him out of the hospital.\" He died the next day.\n\"Everybody wants to invest in the pharmaceutical industry and it is growing, but the regulators can't keep up,\" Zhou said. \"We need a system to assure our safety.\"\nThe final death count is unclear, since some people who took the medicine may have died in less populated areas.\nIn a small town in Sichuan Province, a man named Zhou Lianghui said the authorities would not acknowledge that his wife had died from taking tainted Amillarisin A. But Zhou, 38, said he matched the identification number on the batch of medicine his wife received with a warning circular distributed by drug officials.\n\"You probably cannot understand a small town if you are in Beijing,\" Zhou Lianghui said in a telephone interview. \"The sky is high and the emperor is far away. There are a lot of problems here that the law cannot speak to.\"\nThe failure of the government to stop poison from contaminating the drug supply caused one of the bigger domestic scandals of the year. Last May, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, ordered an investigation of the deaths, declaring, \"The pharmaceutical market is in disorder.\"\nAt about the same time, 9,000 miles away in Panama, the long rainy season had begun. Anticipating colds and coughs, the government health program began manufacturing cough and antihistamine syrup. The cough medicine was sugarless so even diabetics could use it.\nThe medicine was mixed with a pale yellow, almost translucent syrup that had arrived in 46 barrels from Barcelona on the container ship Tobias Maersk. Shipping records showed the contents to be 99.5 percent pure glycerin.\nIt would be months and many deaths later before that certification was discovered to be pure fiction.\nA Mysterious Illness\nEarly last September, doctors at Panama City's big public hospital began to notice patients exhibiting unusual symptoms.\nThey initially appeared to have Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a relatively rare neurological disorder that first shows up as a weakness or tingling sensation in the legs. That weakness often intensifies, spreading upward to the arms and chest, sometimes causing total paralysis and an inability to breathe.\nThe new patients had paralysis, but it did not spread upward. They also quickly lost their ability to urinate, a condition not associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9. Even more unusual was the number of cases. In a full year, doctors might see eight cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9, yet they saw that many in just two weeks.\nDoctors sought help from an infectious disease specialist, N\u00e9stor Sosa, an intense, driven doctor who competes in triathlons and high-level chess.\nDr. Sosa's medical specialty had a long, rich history in Panama, once known as one of the world's unhealthiest places. In one year in the late 1800s, a lethal mix of yellow fever and malaria killed nearly 1 in every 10 residents of Panama City. Only after the United States managed to overcome those mosquito-borne diseases was it able to build the Panama Canal without the devastation that undermined an earlier attempt by the French.\nThe suspected Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases worried Dr. Sosa. \"It was something really extraordinary, something that was obviously reaching epidemic dimensions in our hospital,\" he said.\nWith the death rate from the mystery illness near 50 percent, Dr. Sosa alerted the hospital management, which asked him to set up and run a task force to handle the situation. The assignment, a daunting around-the-clock dash to catch a killer, was one he eagerly embraced.\nSeveral years earlier, Dr. Sosa had watched as other doctors identified the cause of another epidemic, later identified as hantavirus, a pathogen spread by infected rodents.\n\"I took care of patients but I somehow felt I did not do enough,\" he said. The next time, he vowed, would be different.\nDr. Sosa set up a 24-hour \"war room\" in the hospital, where doctors could compare notes and theories as they scoured medical records for clues.\nAs a precaution, the patients with the mystery illness were segregated and placed in a large empty room awaiting renovation. Health care workers wore masks, heightening fears in the hospital and the community.\n\"That spread a lot of panic,\" said Dr. Jorge Motta, a cardiologist who runs the Gorgas Memorial Institute, a widely respected medical research center in Panama. \"That is always a terrifying thought, that you will be the epicenter of a new infectious disease, and especially a new infectious disease that kills with a high rate of death, like this.\"\nMeanwhile, patients kept coming, and hospital personnel could barely keep up.\n\"I ended up giving CPR,\" Dr. Sosa said. \"I haven't given CPR since I was a resident, but there were so many crises going on.\"\nFrightened hospital patients had to watch others around them die for reasons no one understood, fearing that they might be next.\nAs reports of strange Guillain-Barr\u00e9 symptoms started coming in from other parts of the country, doctors realized they were not just dealing with a localized outbreak.\nPascuala P\u00e9rez de Gonz\u00e1lez, 67, sought treatment for a cold at a clinic in Cocl\u00e9 Province, about a three-hour drive from Panama City. In late September she was treated and sent home. Within days, she could no longer eat; she stopped urinating and went into convulsions.\nA decision was made to transport her to the public hospital in Panama City, but on the way she stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated. She arrived at the hospital in a deep coma and later died.\nMedical records contained clues but also plenty of false leads. Early victims tended to be males older than 60 and diabetic with high blood pressure. About half had been given Lisinopril, a blood pressure medicine distributed by the public health system.\nBut many who did not receive Lisinopril still got sick. On the chance that those patients might have forgotten that they had taken the drug, doctors pulled Lisinopril from pharmacy shelves \u2014 only to return it after tests found nothing wrong.\nInvestigators would later discover that Lisinopril did play an important, if indirect role in the epidemic, but not in the way they had imagined.\nA Major Clue\nOne patient of particular interest to Dr. Sosa came into the hospital with a heart attack, but no Guillain-Barr\u00e9-type symptoms. While undergoing treatment, the patient received several drugs, including Lisinopril. After a while, he began to exhibit the same neurological distress that was the hallmark of the mystery illness.\n\"This patient is a major clue,\" Dr. Sosa recalled saying. \"This is not something environmental, this is not a folk medicine that's been taken by the patients at home. This patient developed the disease in the hospital, in front of us.\"\nSoon after, another patient told Dr. Sosa that he, too, developed symptoms after taking Lisinopril, but because the medicine made him cough, he also took cough syrup \u2014 the same syrup, it turned out, that had been given to the heart patient.\n\"I said this has got to be it,\" Dr. Sosa recalled. \"We need to investigate this cough syrup.\"\nThe cough medicine had not initially aroused much suspicion because many victims did not remember taking it. \"Twenty-five percent of those people affected denied that they had taken cough syrup, because it's a nonevent in their lives,\" Dr. Motta said.\nInvestigators from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who were in Panama helping out, quickly put the bottles on a government jet and flew them to the United States for testing. The next day, Oct. 11, as Panamanian health officials were attending a news conference, a Blackberry in the room went off.\nThe tests, the CDC was reporting, had turned up diethylene glycol in the cough syrup.\nThe mystery had been solved. The barrels labeled glycerin turned out to contain poison.\nDr. Sosa's exhilaration at learning the cause did not last long. \"It's our medication that is killing these people,\" he said he thought. \"It's not a virus, it's not something that they got outside, but it was something we actually manufactured.\"\nA nationwide campaign was quickly begun to stop people from using the cough syrup. Neighborhoods were searched, but thousands of bottles either had been discarded or could not be found.\nAs the search wound down, two major tasks remained: count the dead and assign blame. Neither has been easy.\nA precise accounting is all but impossible because, medical authorities say, victims were buried before the cause was known, and poor patients might not have seen doctors.\nAnother problem is that finding traces of diethylene glycol in decomposing bodies is difficult at best, medical experts say. Nonetheless, an Argentine pathologist who has studied diethylene glycol poisonings helped develop a test for the poison in exhumed bodies. Seven of the first nine bodies tested showed traces of the poison, Panamanian authorities said.\nWith the rainy season returning, though, the exhumations are about to end. Dr. Jos\u00e9 Vicente Pachar, director of Panama's Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, said that as a scientist he would like a final count of the dead. But he added, \"I should accept the reality that in the case of Panama we are not going to know the exact number.\"\nLocal prosecutors have made some arrests and are investigating others connected to the case, including officials of the import company and the government agency that mixed and distributed the cold medicine. \"Our responsibilities are to establish or discover the truth,\" said Dimas Guevara, the homicide investigator guiding the inquiry.\nBut prosecutors have yet to charge anyone with actually making the counterfeit glycerin. And if the Panama investigation unfolds as other inquiries have, it is highly unlikely that they ever will.\nA Suspect Factory\nPanamanians wanting to see where their toxic nightmare began could look up the Web site of the company in Hengxiang, China, that investigators in four countries have identified as having made the syrup \u2014 the Taixing Glycerine Factory. There, under the words \"About Us,\" they would see a picture of a modern white building nearly a dozen stories tall, adorned by three arches at the entrance. The factory, the Web site boasts, \"can strictly obey the contract and keep its word.\"\nBut like the factory's syrup, all is not as it seems.\nThere are no tall buildings in Hengxiang, a country town with one main road. The Glycerine Factory is not certified to sell any medical ingredients, Chinese officials say. And it looks nothing like the picture on the Internet. In reality, its chemicals are mixed in a plain, one-story brick building.\nThe factory is in a walled compound, surrounded by small shops and farms. In the spring, nearby fields of rape paint the countryside yellow. Near the front gate, a sign over the road warns, \"Beware of counterfeits.\" But it was posted by a nearby noodle machine factory that appears to be worried about competition.\nThe Glycerine Factory bought its diethylene glycol from the same manufacturer as Wang, the former tailor, the government investigator said. From this spot in China's chemical country, the 46 barrels of toxic syrup began their journey, passing from company to company, port to port and country to country, apparently without anyone testing their contents.\nTraders should be thoroughly familiar with their suppliers, United States health officials say. \"One simply does not assume that what is labeled is indeed what it is,\" said Dr. Murray Lumpkin, deputy commissioner for international and special programs for the Food and Drug Administration.\nIn the Panama case, names of suppliers were removed from shipping documents as they passed from one entity to the next, according to records and investigators. That is a practice some traders use to prevent customers from bypassing them on future purchases, but it also hides the provenance of the product.\nThe first distributor was the Beijing trading company, CNSC Fortune Way, a unit of a state-owned business that began by supplying goods and services to Chinese personnel and business officials overseas.\nAs China's market reach expanded, Fortune Way focused its business on pharmaceutical ingredients, and in 2003, it brokered the sale of the suspect syrup made by the Taixing Glycerine Factory. The manufacturer's certificate of analysis showed the batch to be 99.5 percent pure.\nWhether the Glycerine Factory actually performed the test has not been publicly disclosed.\nOriginal certificates of analysis should be passed on to each new buyer, said Kevin McGlue, a board member of the International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council. In this case, that was not done.\nFortune Way translated the certificate into English, putting its name \u2014 not the Glycerine Factory's \u2014 at the top of the document, before shipping the barrels to a second trading company, this one in Barcelona.\nLi Can, managing director at Fortune Way, said he did not remember the transaction and could not comment, adding, \"There is a high volume of trade.\"\nUpon receiving the barrels in September 2003, the Spanish company, Rasfer International, did not test the contents, either. It copied the chemical analysis provided by Fortune Way, then put its logo on it. Ascensi\u00f3n Criado, Rasfer's manager, said in an e-mail response to written questions that when Fortune Way shipped the syrup, it did not say who made it.\nSeveral weeks later, Rasfer shipped the drums to a Panamanian broker, the Medicom Business Group. \"Medicom never asked us for the name of the manufacturer,\" Criado said.\nA lawyer for Medicom, Valent\u00edn Ja\u00e9n, said his client was a victim, too. \"They were tricked by somebody,\" Ja\u00e9n said. \"They operated in good faith.\"\nIn Panama, the barrels sat unused for more than two years, and officials said Medicom improperly changed the expiration date on the syrup.\nDuring that time, the company never tested the product. And the Panamanian government, which bought the 46 barrels and used them to make cold medicine, also failed to detect the poison, officials said.\nThe toxic pipeline ultimately emptied into the bloodstream of people like Ernesto Osorio, a former high school teacher in Panama City. He spent two months in the hospital after ingesting poison cough syrup last September.\nJust before Christmas, after a kidney dialysis treatment, Osorio stood outside the city's big public hospital in a tear-splattered shirt, describing what his life had become.\n\"I'm not an eighth of what I used to be,\" Osorio said, his partly paralyzed face hanging like a slab of meat. \"I have trouble walking. Look at my face, look at my tears.\" The tears, he said apologetically, were not from emotion, but from nerve damage.\nAnd yet, Osorio knows he is one of the lucky victims.\n\"They didn't know how to keep the killer out of the medicine,\" he said simply.\nWhile the suffering in Panama was great, the potential profit \u2014 at least for the Spanish trading company, Rasfer \u2014 was surprisingly small. For the 46 barrels of glycerin, Rasfer paid Fortune Way $9,900, then sold them to Medicom for $11,322, according to records.\nChinese authorities have not disclosed how much Fortune Way and the Taixing Glycerine Factory made on their end, or how much they knew about what was in the barrels.\n\"The fault has to be traced back to areas of production,\" said Dr. Motta, the cardiologist in Panama who helped uncover the source of the epidemic. \"This was my plea \u2014 please, this thing is happening to us, make sure whoever did this down the line is not doing it to Peru or Sierra Leone or some other place.\"\nA Counterfeiter's Confession\nThe power to prosecute the counterfeiters is now in the hands of the Chinese.\nLast spring, the government moved quickly against Wang, the former tailor who poisoned Chinese residents.\nThe authorities caught up with him at a roadblock in Taizhou, a city just north of Taixing, in chemical country. He was weak and sick, and he had not eaten in two days. Inside his white sedan was a bankbook and cash. He had fled without his wife and teenage son.\nChinese patients were dead, a political scandal was brewing and the authorities wanted answers. Wang was taken to a hospital. Then, in long sessions with investigators, he gave them what they wanted, explaining his scheme, how he tested industrial syrup by drinking it, how he decided to use diethylene glycol and how he conned pharmaceutical companies into buying his syrup, according to a government official who was present for his interrogation.\n\"He made a fortune, but none of it went to his family,\" said Wang Xiaodong, a former village official who knows Wang and his siblings. \"He liked to gamble.\"\nWang remains in custody as the authorities decide whether he should be put to death. The Qiqihar drug plant that made the poisonous medicine has been closed, and five employees are now being prosecuted for causing \"a serious accident.\"\nIn contrast to the Wang Guiping investigation, Chinese authorities have been tentative in acknowledging China's link to the Panama tragedy, which involved a state-owned trading company. No one in China has been charged with committing the fraud that ended up killing so many in Panama.\nSun Jing, the pharmaceutical program officer for the World Health Organization in Beijing, said the health agency sent a fax \"to remind the Chinese government that China should not be selling poisonous products overseas.\" Sun said the agency did not receive an official reply.\nLast fall, at the request of the United States \u2014 Panama has no diplomatic relations with China \u2014 the State Food and Drug Administration of China investigated the Glycerine Factory and Fortune Way.\nThe agency tested one batch of glycerin from the factory, and found no glycerin, only diethylene glycol and two other substances, a drug official said.\nSince then, the Chinese drug administration has concluded that it has no jurisdiction in the case because the factory is not certified to make medicine.\nThe agency reached a similar conclusion about Fortune Way, saying that as an exporter it was not engaged in the pharmaceutical business.\n\"We did not find any evidence that either of these companies had broken the law,\" said Yan Jiangying, a spokeswoman for the drug administration. \"So a criminal investigation was never opened.\"\nA drug official said the investigation was subsequently handed off to an agency that tests and certifies commercial products \u2014 the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.\nBut the agency acted surprised to learn that it was now in charge. \"What investigation?\" asked Wang Jian, director of its Taixing branch. \"I'm not aware of any investigation involving a glycerin factory.\"\nBesides, Huang Tong, an investigator in that office, said, \"We rarely get involved in products that are sold for export.\"\nWan Qigang, the legal representative for the Taixing Glycerine Factory, said in an interview late last year that the authorities had not questioned him about the Panama poisoning, and that his company made only industrial-grade glycerin.\n\"I can tell you for certain that we have no connection with Panama or Spain,\" Wan said.\nBut in recent months, the Glycerine Factory has advertised 99.5 percent pure glycerin on the Internet.\nWan recently declined to answer any more questions. \"If you come here as a guest, I will welcome you,\" Wan said. \"But if you come again wanting to talk about this matter, I will make a telephone call.\"\nA local government official said that Wan was told not to grant interviews.\nA five-minute walk away, another manufacturer, the Taixing White Oil Factory, also advertises medical glycerin on the Internet, yet it, too, has no authorization to make it. The company's Web site says its products \"have been exported to America, Australia and Italy.\"\nDing Xiang, who represents the White Oil Factory, denied that his company made pharmaceutical-grade glycerin, but he said chemical trading companies in Beijing often called, asking for it.\n\"They want us to mark the barrels glycerin,\" Ding said in late December. \"I tell them we cannot do that.\"\nDing said he stopped answering calls from Beijing. \"If this stuff is taken overseas and improperly used. ...\" He did not complete the thought.\nIn chemical country, product names are not always what they seem.\n\"The only two factories in Taixing that make glycerin don't even make glycerin,\" said Jiang Peng, who oversees inspections and investigations in the Taixing branch of the State Food and Drug Administration. \"It is a different product.\"\nAll in a Name\nOne lingering mystery involves the name of the product made by the Taixing Glycerine Factory. The factory had called its syrup \"TD\" glycerin. The letters TD were in virtually all the shipping documents. What did TD mean?\nSpanish medical authorities concluded that it stood for a manufacturing process. Chinese inspectors thought it was the manufacturer's secret formula.\nBut Yuan Kailin, a former salesman for the Glycerine Factory, said he knew what the TD meant because a friend and former manager of the factory, Ding Yuming, had once told him. TD stood for the Chinese word \"tidai\" (pronounced tee-die), said Yuan, who left his job in 1998 and still lives about a mile from the factory.\nIn Chinese, tidai means substitute. A clue that might have revealed the poison, the counterfeit product, was hiding in plain sight.\nIt was in the product name.",

    "text": "Shame of Imported Labor in Kurdish North of Iraq\n2007-12-29T05:00:00.000Z\nSULAIMANIYA, Iraq \u0097 The tiny Filipino woman\u2019s hands trembled. She was in hiding, fearing capture at any moment. \nShe and a friend had come to Iraq\u2019s semi-autonomous Kurdish north as guest workers six months earlier. Now they worried they would be forcibly returned to Erbil, where they had been locked in a house for a month and made to work for free, they said, after their passports, cellphones and plane tickets were taken away. \nThe two had escaped by begging their captor to let them attend church, then making contact with other Filipino workers, who spirited them away.\nThousands of foreign workers have come to the Kurdish districts in the last three years, a huge turnaround for a place that had hardly any before, making it one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern destinations for the world\u2019s impoverished. They come from Ethiopia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Somalia, supporting an economic boom here that is transforming Kurdish society. \nBut nearly all foreign workers interviewed over a two-week period here said they had been deceived by unscrupulous agents who arrange the journeys. Unable to communicate, some arrive not knowing what country they are in. Once here, their passports are seized by their employment agencies, and they are unable to go home. \nSome are satisfied with their decision to come here, but agents\u2019 fees are high, often as much as two years\u2019 wages. To come up with the money, many borrow at high interest rates and find that their wages are equal only to the interest. In essence, they say, they end up working for free.\nWhile war rages to the south, mile after mile of new buildings are rising here, and wages for Kurds have risen sevenfold since 2003. Billions of dollars in investment are flowing in from Turkey and the United States, and large-scale oil exploration has just begun.\nFor the Kurds \u0097 guest workers themselves in Europe for generations \u0097 the newly arrived Asians and Africans are met with ambivalence. There are too few Kurds to take all the low-paying menial jobs, and many are uncomfortable hiring local Arabs, given the longstanding animosity between the groups.\nForeign women are integral to another transformation. As in some wealthy Persian Gulf states, the traditional Kurdish lifestyle is adopting some European ways: the rich and powerful want live-in maids, nightclubs need non-Muslim women to serve alcohol and men want intimate relationships before marriage \u0097 all roles largely forbidden for Kurdish women. \nImporting such workers relies on a far-reaching network of recruiters in poor countries, and for most of the 150 Bangladeshis cleaning the streets here, the journey to Kurdistan began at 5 Bonany Road in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the headquarters of the Travel Mix agency. \n\u201cThey said at the agency that I would make $300 a month and work as a waiter in a restaurant,\u201d said Tufazil Hussan. He said that he took out a $3,000 loan with monthly interest of $150 to pay the agency, but that upon his arrival his passport was taken and he was put to work sweeping the streets seven days a week for $155 a month. \nOptimistic, Mr. Hussan, 30, thinks he will soon get a better-paying job; other Bangladeshis say he will probably sweep the streets until the end of his three-year contract, then go home with little or nothing.\nHis supervisor, Abdul Khadar, is not much better off. A farmer from Tangai, Bangladesh, he makes $185 a month. Mr. Khadar said he borrowed $4,000 to pay Travel Mix. He estimates that for his first two years in Kurdistan, he will work only to pay off his loan. \nFor the city, the guest workers fill a manpower shortage while saving money. \u201cWe need 1,500 cleaners; we have 350,\u201d said Razgar Ahmed Hussein, Sulaimaniya\u2019s director of cleaning operations. \u201cI never wanted to bring foreign workers to this city, but we had no other option. Kurds do not want the jobs.\u201d\nThe city pays the local Lion Gate agency $325 per month for each cleaner. \u201cThe company takes more than half of that,\u201d Mr. Hussein said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fair arrangement. Groups of Bangladeshis have tried to run away to Turkey. If you pay them what they need, they won\u2019t run away. Three months ago the situation was so bad, they were living in a garage, their food was so little. They were begging for money in the street.\u201d\nLion Gate officials said conditions had never been bad and were getting better. \u201cWe pay for the workers\u2019 housing, food, electricity and plane tickets,\u201d said Nizar Mustafa Chawjwan, director of the company\u2019s Sulaimaniya office. \u201cWe take care of the workers\u2019 health, and we have brought a cook from Bangladesh for them.\u201d\nAs for allegations that Lion Gate business partners in Bangladesh cheated workers, Mr. Chawjwan said, \u201cIf Bangladeshi agents take money from them, we don\u2019t know anything about the deals they make over there.\u201d\nNisha Varia, an investigator with Human Rights Watch, said the combination of unscrupulous brokers in the workers\u2019 home countries and labor practices in Kurdistan left the workers with few options. \n\u201cEach side denies that it knows what other is doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIn reality, they are much more interconnected than that. They are dong business together, and that leads to these recruiting fees and debts, and puts the workers at risk of forced labor.\u201d\nMr. Chawjwan argued that the wages workers got were higher than those in the Persian Gulf, and that his company had good reason to hold the workers\u2019 passports. \u201cWe keep the passports to stop them from running away to Turkey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spend a lot of money to bring each one here.\u201d\nBut Ms. Varia rejected that argument. \u201cIt is a violation of international law to take someone\u2019s passport,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t own a person because they signed a contract.\u201d\nGuest workers are a new phenomenon here, and government workers acknowledge that there is no agency to monitor their labor conditions.\nAn agent who has brought in hundreds of Asian and African women in their teens and early 20s said that some had complained of unwanted sexual advances. She told of one client who expressed interest in an exceptionally beautiful young Ethiopian woman, offering extra money for her. He disappeared with the woman for several months, then inexplicably sent her home at his own expense. \u201cI suspect he got her pregnant,\u201d the agency manager said, insisting on anonymity.\nAnother Filipino, who gave her name only as Kikay for fear of retribution from her employer, said she and other young women came expecting $600 a month to work in restaurants in Kurdistan, which they were told was near Greece.\n\u201cIn the Philippines, they said we get the contract in Dubai, then in Dubai the agent said the contract is at the airport,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the airport, they grab our luggage and push it through the X-ray machine, then they start shouting at us, \u2018Go, go, your contract in Kurdistan.\u2019 We are confused. We don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\nIn Sulaimaniya, Kikay said, an agent from the Qadamkher employment agency met them at the airport. He was carrying a gun and was friendly with the police and immigration officials. \n\u201cThey took our passports and then drove us to a house,\u201d she said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying. We were very scared.\u201d Once there, Kikay said, the women were presented with a contract paying them $200 a month to work in a hotel. \nIf the women wanted to leave, they say now, they had to pay $2,000 to get their passports back. Cold and hungry, clad only in T-shirts in the winter chill, they signed the contract. As with the Bangladeshis, Kikay says, her wages are about equal to the interest on the loans she took out to come to the region, which she was surprised to learn is part of Iraq. \nThe local Qadamkher agency rejected allegations that workers were brought here without their knowledge or consent. But several of their contracts specified that foreign workers must pay $100 to $350 for every month left on the contracts if they break them. Most contracts run two or three years.\nSana Muhammad, a Qadamkher employee, said business was growing rapidly. The agency collects a one-time fee of $2,500 from Kurdish families for each domestic worker. \n\u201cWe have requests for 10 Indonesian girls right now that we\u2019re trying to fill,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have Ethiopian girls available but clients don\u2019t want them. They say their faces are ugly \u0097 the black skin is unfamiliar.\u201d (Similarly, the city cleaning supervisor said the Bangladeshi cleaners had to be moved away from the market because they were being racially harassed.)\nEva Enju is one of the Indonesian women in demand here. This fall, shortly after her 18th birthday, she arrived here believing she had landed in Turkey. She makes $150 a month and has had the good luck to be placed as a maid with Latifah Noori, a kind and funny 75-year-old who is partly paralyzed. \n\u201cI came here so that I could save money to buy a house,\u201d Ms. Enju explained.\nMs. Noori says Ms. Enju has been a godsend, working around the clock without complaint. \u201cEnju has no one here,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has just me to serve.\u201d\nBut Kikay\u2019s situation is less amicable. \u201cMy manager has my passport and identification,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think they will let me leave at the airport without it?\u201d If not, she said, \u201cthen I am trapped, and there is no future for me here.\u201d",

The fans therefore, may expect as much as they can, but they should also be prepared to accept defeat, if not humiliation, at the hands of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, England and the West Indies. No one should even think that the cricketers have let us down in any way, because they have not. In fact, they have done more to make us proud than we have ever expected them to. Even if they fail to win a single match from here on, it will not take the gloss away from the accomplishment they have achieved in this World Cup.\nJakarta Post\nRight message to Iran\nJAKARTA: It is hard to do the right thing. So hard that when realpolitik enters the decision-making fray, the gray areas become the most innocuous course to take. In recent times we have seen diplomats hide behind the back of a major power when faced with tough, critical decisions. Hence, despite a few sour voices at home, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry must be commended for doing the right thing in supporting UN Security Council Resolution 1747 on Iran. Eventually, Indonesia's vote in favor of the resolution was more by default than choice. Standing against the resolution or even abstaining would have made Indonesia the lonely fool. We certainly hope that this kind of game of \"follow the leader\" was not what transpired over the past week. If so, then all those criticisms of Indonesia prostrating itself before major powers may have some validity.\nManila Times\nBan genetically modified foods\nMANILA: To help solve the problems of hunger and poverty as well as to invigorate the economy with cheaper food products for both domestic consumption and export, the Philippine government has approved the use, planting and development of genetically modified food crops. Among these are corn, soybean, sugar beet, alfalfa, potato and cotton. Since they were first introduced, GMOs have been opposed by many reliable and rigorously scientific bodies. The use of GM crops in poor countries could make poor farmers even poorer. Many scientists have offered studies to show that lots of things about GMOs demand precautionary measures. Others point out that remedial measures should now be taken because hazardous GMO crop pollens have in fact already infected native species. The alarm has been sounded in the Philippines. The government must withdraw its approval.",

    "text": "A trail of poisoned medicine leads back to China\n2007-05-05T05:00:00.000Z\nA syrupy poison, diethylene glycol, is an indispensable part of the modern world, an industrial solvent and prime ingredient in antifreeze.\nIt is also a killer. And the deaths, if not intentional, are often no accident.\nThe kidneys fail first. Then the central nervous system begins to misfire. Paralysis spreads, making breathing difficult, then often impossible without assistance. In the end, most victims die.\nMany of them are children, poisoned at the hands of their unsuspecting parents.\nOver the years, the poison has been loaded into all varieties of medicine - cough syrup, fever medication, injectable drugs - a result of counterfeiters who profit by substituting the sweet-tasting solvent for a safe, more expensive syrup, usually glycerin, commonly used in drugs, food, toothpaste and other products.\nToxic syrup has figured in at least eight mass poisonings around the world in the past two decades. Researchers estimate that thousands have died. In many cases, the precise origin of the poison has never been determined. But records and interviews show that in three of the last four cases it was made in China, a major source of counterfeit drugs.\nPanama is the most recent victim. Last year, government officials there unwittingly mixed diethylene glycol into 260,000 bottles of cold medicine, with devastating results. Families have reported 365 deaths from the poison, 100 of which have been confirmed so far. With the onset of the rainy season, investigators are racing to exhume as many potential victims as possible before bodies decompose even more.\nPanama's death toll leads directly to Chinese companies that made and exported the poison as 99.5 percent pure glycerin.\nForty-six barrels of the toxic syrup arrived via a poison pipeline stretching halfway around the world. Through shipping records and interviews with government officials, this pipeline was traced from the Panamanian port of Col\u00f3n, back through trading companies in Barcelona and Beijing, to its beginning near the Yangtze Delta in a place local people call \"chemical country.\"\nThe counterfeit glycerin passed through three trading companies on three continents, yet not one of them tested the syrup to confirm what was on the label. Along the way, a certificate falsely attesting to the purity of the shipment was repeatedly altered, eliminating the name of the manufacturer and previous owner. As a result, traders bought the syrup without knowing where it came from, or who made it. With this information, the traders might have discovered that the manufacturer was not certified to make pharmaceutical ingredients.\nAn examination of the two poisoning cases last year - in Panama and earlier in China - shows how China's safety regulations have lagged behind its growing role as low-cost supplier to the world. It also demonstrates how a poorly policed chain of traders in country after country allows counterfeit medicine to contaminate the global market.\nLast week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned drug makers and suppliers in the United States \"to be especially vigilant\" in watching for diethylene glycol. The warning did not specifically mention China, and it said there was \"no reason to believe\" that glycerin in this country was tainted. Even so, the agency called for all glycerin shipments to be tested for diethylene glycol, and said it was \"exploring how supplies of glycerin become contaminated.\"\nChina is already being accused by U.S. authorities of exporting wheat gluten with an industrial chemical, melamine, that ended up in pet food and animal feed. The FDA recently banned imports of Chinese-made wheat gluten after it was linked to pet deaths in the United States.\nBeyond Panama and China, toxic syrup has caused mass poisonings in Haiti, Bangladesh, Argentina, Nigeria and India.\nIn Bangladesh, investigators found poison in seven brands of fever medication in 1992, but only after countless children died. A Massachusetts laboratory detected the contamination after Dr. Michael Bennish, a pediatrician who works in developing countries, smuggled samples of the tainted syrup out of the country in a suitcase. Bennish, who investigated the Bangladesh epidemic and helped write a 1995 article about it for BMJ, formerly known as The British Medical Journal, said that given the amount of medication distributed, deaths \"must be in the thousands or tens of thousands.\"\n\"It's vastly underreported,\" Bennish said of diethylene glycol poisoning. Doctors might not suspect toxic medicine, particularly in poor countries with limited resources and a generally unhealthy population, he said, adding: \"Most people who die don't come to a medical facility.\"\nThe makers of counterfeit glycerin, which superficially looks and acts like the real thing but generally costs considerably less, are rarely identified, much less prosecuted, given the difficulty of tracing shipments across borders. \"This is really a global problem, and it needs to be handled in a global way,\" said Dr. Henk Bekedam, the World Health Organization's top representative in Beijing.\nRenwick McLean and Brent McDonald contributed reporting.",

    "text": "\u2018The World in a City\u2019\n2007-11-04T07:58:00.000Z\nSo You Thought You Knew Astoria \n* * * \nFor half a century, Astoria in Queens has been a neighborhood of caf\u00e9s where dark-haired Greek men sip strong coffee and smoke strong cigarettes while talking in Greek late into the night. It is a place of quiet sidewalks lined with tenderly fussed-over brick and shingle row houses, where a solitary widow in black can be glimpsed scurrying homeward as if she were on the island of Rhodes. \nThe caf\u00e9s are still teeming, the houses tidy. But the Greek hold on the neighborhood has slowly been weakening. Successful Greeks have been leaving for leafier locales. As a result, there are moments when Astoria has a theme-park feel to it, a cardboard fa\u00e7ade of a Greek Main Street with caf\u00e9s named Athens, Omonia, and Zodiac and Greece's blue and white colors splashed everywhere, but a diminishing number of actual Greeks living within. \nThat's because other groups have been rising up to take their place. On a Friday on Steinway Street, one of Astoria's commercial spines, several hundred men from North African and Middle Eastern countries were jammed into Al-Iman Mosque, a marble-faced storefront that is one of several Muslim halls of worship that have sprung up in Astoria. Some wore ordinary street clothes, some white robes and knit white skullcaps. There were so many worshipers that thirteen had to pray on the sidewalk, kneeling shoeless on prayer mats and touching their foreheads and palms to the ground. When the prayers were over, El Allel Dahli, a Moroccan immigrant, emerged with his teenage son, Omar, telling of the plate of couscous and lamb he had brought as a gift to the poor to honor the birth that morning of his daughter, Jenine. \"I am very happy today,\" he told me. \nHe could also have been happy that, as his visit confirmed, the immediate neighborhood was turning into New York City's casbah. Not only was there his flourishing mosque, but down Steinway Street, as far as his eyes could see, there were Middle Eastern restaurants, groceries, travel agencies, a driving school, a barber shop, a pharmacy, a dried fruit and nuts store, a bookstore \u2014 twenty-five shops in all. In the caf\u00e9s, clusters of Egyptian, Moroccan, or Tunisian men were puffing on hookahs \u2014 tall, gaudily embellished water pipes stoked with charcoal to burn sheeshah, the fragrant tobacco that comes in flavors such as molasses and apple. Sometimes these men \u2014 taxi drivers, merchants, or just plain idlers \u2014 play backgammon or dominoes or watch Arabic television shows beamed in by satellite, but mostly they schmooze about the things Mediterranean men talk about when they're together \u2014 soccer, politics, women \u2014 while waiters fill up their pipes with chunks of charcoal at $4 a smoke. In classic New York fashion, Steinway Street is a slice of Arabic Algiers on Astoria's former Main Street, renamed after a German immigrant who a century before assembled the world's greatest pianos a few blocks away. \nAnd it is not just Middle Easterners and North Africans who are changing the neighborhood's personality. Those settling in Astoria in the past decade or two include Bangladeshis, Serbians, Bosnians, Ecuadorians, and, yes, even increasingly young Manhattan professionals drawn by the neighborhood's modest rents, cosmopolitan flavors, and short commute to midtown Manhattan. More vibrant than them all seem to be the Brazilians, who have brought samba nightclubs and bikini-waxing salons to streets that once held moussaka joints. When Brazil won the World Cup in 2002, Astoria's streets were turned into an all-night party, and when the team lost in 2006, the streets were leaden with mourning. \nNew York can be viewed as an archipelago, like Indonesia a collection of distinctive islands, in its case its villagelike neighborhoods. Each island has its own way of doing things, its own flavor, fragrance, and indelible characters. But, as a result of the roiling tides of migration and the unquenchable human restlessness and hunger for something better and grander, most of these neighborhoods are in constant, ineluctable flux. Some transform with astonishing swiftness as if hit by a flood; a few suffer erosion that is scarcely detectable until one day its inhabitants realize that what was there is gone. \nAstoria was an appropriate jumping-off point for my three-year-long ramble around the city because it is a classic New York neighborhood, a place that has long had a sharply defined character and a distinct place in the city's landscape, but one that has been turned into a Babel of cultures by the waves of immigration set off by the 1965 law. When New Yorkers dropped the name Astoria, it was understood they were talking about an enclave where Greek was spoken and Greek folkways were observed. So it was striking to me as I walked the streets how much of that accent had faded. Astoria's Greek population has been cut by a third in the past two decades, by some unofficial estimates, to 30,000 from 45,000, with official, if undercounted, census figures even gloomier, putting the number of people who claimed Greek ancestry at just 18,217, or 8.6 percent of the neighborhood's residents. \nThe decline of the Greeks can be seen as an old New York story, no different from the shrinking of the Jewish population on the Lower East Side or the number of Italians along Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. As immigrants of one nationality make it, they forsake the jostling streets, and newer immigrants, hoping to make their fortunes, move in. \"It's an upward mobility kind of thing,\" said Robert Stephanopoulos, dean of Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral on East Seventy-fourth Street and father of George (Bill Clinton's press secretary and now an ABC broadcaster). But the fact that it is an oft-told story is scant consolation for longtime Greek residents who have tried to rekindle the old country in this new one. They find a bittersweet quality to the changeover. On the one hand, it affirms their community's upswing; on the other, their village in New York is withering. \n\"In New York everything turns around,\" Peter Figetakis, forty-eight, a Greek-born film director who has lived in Astoria since the 1970s, told me. \"Now the Hindus and Arabs, it's their time.\" \nFor the newer residents, the mood is expansive. On a two-block stretch of Steinway between Twenty-eighth Avenue and Astoria Boulevard, there is a veritable souk, with shops selling halal meat, Syrian pastries, airplane tickets to Morocco, driving lessons in Arabic, Korans and other Muslim books, and robes in styles such as the caftan, the abaya, the hooded djellaba, and the chador, which covers the body from head to toe, including much of the face. Indeed, a common street sight is a woman in ankle-length robe and head scarf-hijab \u2014 surrounded by small children. Laziza of New York Pastry, a Jordanian bakery, may have baklava superior to that made by the neighborhood's Greeks. With two dozen such Arabic shops, the Steinway strip outpaces the city's most famous Middle Eastern thoroughfare, Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue, which was started by Lebanese and Syrian Christians, not Muslims. In caf\u00e9s and restaurants once owned by Greeks and Italians, television shows from Cairo and news from Qatar-based Al Jazeera are beamed in on flat-screen televisions. Some caf\u00e9s are open round-the-clock so taxi drivers can stop in and have their sheeshah and an espresso. \nNoureddine Daouaou, a taxi driver from Casablanca who has lived in the United States for more than twenty years, said he prefers Astoria to other places in New York where Arabs cluster because the neighborhood has a cosmopolitan mix of peoples. \"You don't feel homesick,\" he said. \"You find peace somehow. You find people try to get along. We can understand each other in one language.\" \nThe number of Arab speakers in the neighborhood the city designates as Queens Community Board 1 (the city is broken into fifty-nine community boards that offer advice on land-use and budget issues) rose from 2,265 in 1990 to 4,097 in 2000, an 80 percent increase, and will be far larger in the next census. For the Middle Easterners, the attraction to Astoria seems to be the congenial Mediterranean accent: foods that overlap with such Greek delicacies as kebab, okra, lentils, and honey-coated pastries, and cultural harmonies such as men idling with one another in caf\u00e9s. \"They feel more comfortable with Greeks,\" George Mohamed Oumous, a forty-five-year-old Moroccan computer programmer, said of his fellow Arabs. \"We've been near each other for centuries. You listen to Greek music, you think you could be listening to Egyptian music.\" \nAli El Sayed, who is Steinway's Sidney Greenstreet, the man aware of this mini-Casablanca's secrets, was a pioneer. A broad-shouldered Alexandrian with a shaved head like a genie, Sayed moved to Steinway Street in the late 1980s to open the Kabab Caf\u00e9, a narrow six-table cranny filled with Egyptian bric-a-brac, stained glass, and a hookah or two. It sells a tasty hummus and falafel plate. \"How's the food, folks?\" he'll sometimes ask, displaying his American slang. \"I'm just an insecure guy, so I need to ask.\" He found Astoria congenial because it was easy to shop for foods, such as hummus and okra, that he uses in his cooking. Within a few years the neighborhood had enough Arabs and other Muslims to support its first mosque, which was opened in a onetime pool hall on Twenty-eighth Avenue. \nSayed told me that Egyptians in Astoria are proud to be Americans, proud to blend into American society. Indeed, Egyptians and other Arabs and Muslims are assimilating in the United States with as much enthusiasm as earlier immigrant groups. In London, Paris, and Hamburg, there is far more ambivalence. Even two and three generations after they began settling in those cities, the Muslim underclass tends to remain outside the mainstream, whether by choice or because of the hostility they encounter from their long-rooted European neighbors. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, those communities have been fertile soil for homegrown terrorists. But in American cities such as New York, Muslims have been \"pretty much immune to the jihadist virus,\" according to an assessment by Daniel Benjamin, a former National Security Council official quoted in The Atlantic on the fifth anniversary of September 11. Across the United States, Arab immigrants have a median income higher than the overall American one and a larger proportion of graduate degrees, something that is not true in France, Germany, and Britain. Moreover, Arabs and other Muslims are pouring into the United States in larger numbers than ever, despite the dip in the first years after 9/11, searching for jobs and personal freedom just as immigrants have always done. In 2005, for example, there were almost 5,000 Egyptians admitted as legal permanent residents, more than in the years before 9/11. \nBut assimilation can be a Trojan horse, a gift full of dangers, and those perils are appreciated in Arab Astoria. Many of the neighborhood's Egyptians and other younger Middle Easterners are marrying non-Middle Easterners. Sayed is married to an Argentinian, and his seven-year-old son, Esmaeel, speaks English and Spanish, not Arabic. \"There are lots of fears that their culture is getting destroyed,\" Sayed said. \nThough in many patches of Astoria, Arabs are supplanting Greeks, the transition, by most accounts, has been without overt bitterness or conflict. George Delis, district manager of Community Board 1, said, \"I get complaints from Greeks that the streets are dirtier, the properties not as well kept. I say to them, 'When you came to this country, the Italians and Irish were saying there goes the neighborhood.' And that's how I feel. This is a community of immigrants.\" Indeed, Oumous, the Moroccan computer programmer, said there was some suspiciousness after September 11 and landlords were likely to inquire more scrupulously into newcomers' backgrounds, but generally there has been no antagonism. \ni heard an entirely different beat just ten blocks south \u2014 the samba sound of the Brazilians. The Brazilians stand out in the smorgasbord of New York Latinos, who generally come here poor, half educated, and willing to spirit across borders. Brazilians in New York more often tend to come from bourgeois backgrounds; they are well schooled, and many held professional, managerial, or highly skilled jobs before they left their homeland. The 2000 census revealed that 30.8 percent of the city's Brazilians had degrees from colleges or graduate schools, triple the number for some other nationalities from Latin America, such as Mexicans or Ecuadorians. Brazilians can afford to fly here legally on tourist visas, which require proof of jobs and savings accounts, then intentionally overstay them. Unable to transfer their credentials here, they work as housekeepers, shoeshine guys, go-go dancers, and limousine drivers, hoping to legalize themselves but knowing that in the meantime they will make far more money here than they could have as white-collar workers in Brazil. \n\"In Brazil you have quality of life, but here you have financial security,\" explained Jamiel Ramalho de Almeida, the neatly bearded owner of the Ipanema Beauty Salon on Thirty-sixth Avenue who holds a teaching degree from a Brazilian college. \"When you get a taste of the good life, it's hard to go back to what you had before.\" \nAt least since Carmen Miranda, with a fruit bowl for a hat, chica- chica-boomed audiences out of some of their stodginess, Brazil has had a distinct mystique among Americans. Samba and bossa nova rhythms have shaped the music of Frank Sinatra and Manhattan's dance clubs. Movies such as Black Orpheus, with its alternately haunting, rollicking score, and Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands, with its antic story of the erotic pull of a dead husband for a remarried widow, have mixed magic, lust, and a Brazilian love of revelry to relax American restraints. Pel\u00e9 ignited a romance with soccer that has become a ritual of suburban autumn weekends. \nBut the mystique has always been felt at arm's length. Very few Brazilians actually settled here. That has been changing. Brazil's often inflationary economy and unemployment that perennially hovers near 10 percent have driven professionals and merchants to find their fortunes elsewhere. The New York area \u2014 not just Astoria, but Newark's Ironbound and Danbury, Connecticut \u2014 has been a galvanic destination. Although the 2000 census counted 13,000 New York City residents of Brazilian ancestry, with 3,372 of them in Astoria, the Brazilian consulate thinks those are gross undercounts. Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Gra\u00e7a Lima, the consul general in New York, doubled those numbers, and Astoria officials believe there may be 15,000 Brazilians in the area. \nSo many, in fact, that Tatiana Pacheco told me, \"I feel like I'm in a different Brazilian town instead of ten thousand miles away.\" She is a slender twenty-eight-year-old woman with long brown hair who in many ways typifies the Brazilian New Yorker. She went to college in Brazil, then came here in the late 1990s and took a job as an au pair. By the time I met her she was working as a counselor to immigrants from all over the world, not just Brazil, at Immigration Advocacy Services, a nonprofit group near the mosque on Steinway Street. \n(Continues...) \nExcerpted from The World in a City by Joseph Berger Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Joseph Berger.

    "text": "Decline of the Dog\n2007-07-29T04:00:00.000Z\nTHE detail springs out at you from the laminated articles that practically sheath his pushcart on the corner of 45th Street and Avenue of the Americas: Mohammed Rahman, owner of Kwik Meal and maker of a widely touted lamb-and-rice platter, once worked as a sous-chef at the celebrated Russian Tea Room. \nA native of Bangladesh whose pristine toque reaches nearly to the ceiling of his cramped stall, Mr. Rahman quit the restaurant business in 2000 after he noticed a pushcart near the World Trade Center selling platters of halal food. Intrigued, he ordered a container of chicken and rice. A few greasy bites later, he had concluded that he could elevate the plebeian dish to unprecedented heights of refinement. \n\u201cI\u2019m a chef,\u201d Mr. Rahman recalled thinking at the time. \u201cI can serve better food for people from the office. The suit-and-tie people \u2014 they will come.\u201d\nBack then, the sight of a gourmet halal cart might have caused some passers-by to raise their eyebrows. But in recent years it has become increasingly common to see purveyors of $4.95 lamb-and-rice platters displaying glowing reviews and drawing huge crowds. It\u2019s become increasingly common to see purveyors of $4.95 lamb-and-rice platters, period. \nAlthough the city doesn\u2019t collect statistics that distinguish between different types of street food, halal vendors generally agree that their ranks have swelled in the last five to eight years, prompting the obvious question: How did the halal platter become the city\u2019s new hot dog?\n\u201cThe hot dog now is for tourists,\u201d said a rueful Chafik el-Mokhtar, office manager at 2M Friend Corporation, a hot-dog cart garage and supply store on West 47th Street near 11th Avenue. \n\u201cThe people usually go for chicken and rice because it\u2019s good for hunger,\u201d he added wistfully. \nMohamed Abouelenein, an Egyptian who used to sell hot dogs, said, \u201cHot dog is not a meal.\u201d That\u2019s one reason he switched to gyro and chicken in 1992, becoming, he claims, the first peddler in New York to sell halal meat from a cart. \n\u201cWe figured out that most of the cabdrivers are Egyptian, Pakistani,\u201d he said. \u201cThey suffered too much from no halal.\u201d\nOn some corners of Manhattan, halal carts outnumber hot-dog vendors by as much as three to one. Mr. Abouelenein\u2019s cart, named 53rd and 6th, after the Midtown corner on which it sits, stays open from 7 p.m. to 4 a.m., feeding throngs of clubbers, foodies and cabbies. Its success has been such that Mr. Abouelenein recently opened a new cart across the street, supplanting \u2014 yes \u2014 a hot-dog stand. \nThe term halal may be applied to any food prepared in accordance with the laws of the Koran, although in New York the term has taken on special connotations: oily chunks of chicken or gyro meat, yellowish rice, some scraps of lettuce, hot sauce and, of course, the mysterious substance known as white sauce.\nThe most obvious explanation for its popularity is that the city is home to many more Muslim immigrants than in the past. \nArthur Schwartz, a New York food historian who runs the Web site foodmaven.com, also suggests that a particular kind of customer has been instrumental to the success of halal carts. \u201cYou can always tell who the new immigrant group is by the cabdrivers,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cMost of the cabdrivers are now Bangladeshi, and the car service drivers are Egyptian. And they are good customers for the carts.\u201d \nSidewalk wisdom holds that Muslims took over the street-cart business in the 1990s from Greeks, who had themselves inherited it from Italians and Germans. Census data broadly supports this chronology. In an analysis of data from 1990, the Queens College sociology department found that 306 first-generation German and Italian New Yorkers identified themselves as members of an occupational category that included the job \u201cstreet vendor\u201d; by 2005, that figure had dropped to zero. During that period, the number of Greeks in the field rose to 200 from 120, while the number of Egyptians, Bangladeshis and Afghans surged to 563 from 69. \nTony Dragonas, a native of Greece and a sidewalk chef on the corner of 62nd Street near Madison Avenue, vividly remembers many of his compatriots selling their carts to Muslim buyers in the 1990s. \u201cA lot of people got old, a lot of people died,\u201d he said. Raising one leg of his denim shorts to reveal a skein of varicose veins, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard work. My kids \u2014 they don\u2019t want to do this. They want to get educated.\u201d\nThe son of a hot-dog vendor, Mr. Dragonas has succeeded by continually reinventing himself, supplementing staples like souvlaki and Italian sausages with black angus steak and prosciutto-and-mozzarella sandwiches. Some halal vendors have gone even further in adapting their cooking to the New York palate, which has itself grown more sophisticated as recent immigrants from places like Mexico and Thailand have redrawn the restaurant landscape. Halal vendors sell varieties of white sauce so far removed from any traditional food that no term less ambiguous than \u201cwhite sauce\u201d would accurately describe them. \nX-Press Power Lunch, a chain with carts in Manhattan and Brooklyn, is one of many companies that cater to the city\u2019s less adventurous types with a white-sauce base of mayonnaise. At the other end of the spectrum is Mr. Rahman, whose quest for the sophisticated \u201csuit and tie\u201d market has culminated in the creation of what many consider Manhattan\u2019s white sauce par excellence, a m\u00e9lange of yogurt, sour cream, cottage cheese and cucumber.\nALONG with culinary innovation, creative approaches to marketing may explain the popularity of halal food among non-Muslim customers. Asim Rafiqi, a 33-year-old refugee from Afghanistan, studied computer science for two years at St. John\u2019s University in Queens before going into the family business, Rafiqi\u2019s, in 1996. Since then, the pushcart chain that he owns with four of his brothers has stretched across Midtown and beyond, staking out no fewer than 11 spots with its signature red-and-black umbrellas. \nLast winter, he and his brothers designed several new carts; their structures call for cooks and customers to stand facing one another. This should prove especially advantageous for Mr. Rafiqi, a gregarious man with a gleaming smile. \u201cYou\u2019re talking to the customer, you\u2019re with the customer,\u201d he said.\nWhen it comes to innovation, few vendors have proved the equal of Mr. Abouelenein, the owner of 53rd and 6th. His employees wear uniforms of yellow \u2014 \u201cWe Are Different,\u201d the T-shirts proclaim \u2014 and the business has a Web site, 53rdand6th.com, where devotees are invited to submit works of cart-inspired art. \nNine months ago, after a scuffle among customers spiraled into a stabbing. Mr. Abouelenein responded with yet another innovation, one that few hot-dog vendors have ever contemplated. He hired bouncers. ",

    "text": "South Asian leaders gather in New Delhi for summit\n2007-04-03T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 South Asian leaders called for vigorous efforts to thwart terrorism, slow climate change and tackle energy and food shortages as they met on Tuesday for an annual summit.\nOne-fifth of the world's people, and many of its most impoverished, live in the eight countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, or SAARC, a group that has often been seen as little more than a talk shop for regional leaders since its founding in 1985. It consists of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, which became a member on Monday.\nThe group was set up to promote economic cooperation and has since sought to tackle a range of issues, from food security to terrorism. But progress in most areas has been slow, mainly because of the rivalry between India and Pakistan.\nThe issue of terrorism was raised on Tuesday by Afghanistan, host India and Sri Lanka.\n\"It is our common duty to fight extremism and terrorism in all forms and sources, including political sponsorship and financing,\" said President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan.\nIndia and Sri Lanka have for decades battled separatist groups that often launch terror attacks. Afghanistan says Taliban militants are orchestrating assaults in Afghanistan from Pakistani territory, a charge Pakistan denies.\nPresident Mahinda Rajapakse of Sri Lanka warned that unless South Asian nations act collectively, transborder terrorist groups will find safe havens.\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz of Pakistan and other leaders acknowledged that SAARC has made limited progress, and asked member nations to act quickly to bring about social and economic changes. \"Let us move from debate and discussions to concrete action,\" Aziz said.\nThe summit's agenda also includes talks on establishing a South Asian university and a regional food bank, and on overcoming problems in implementing a regional free trade agreement that came into effect in July.\nSingh said India was ready to open its markets to South Asian nations without insisting on reciprocity. He also cited the need to tackle global climate change and regional energy and food shortages, which he said were \"all issues that impact on our development strategies and which need our focused attention.\"\nMember states are also considering India's proposal to streamline their visa processes for each other's citizens. Singh said New Delhi would make it easier for teachers, students, journalists and medical patients from SAARC countries to get Indian visas.",

    "text": "Some countries report hopeful trends in child mortality\n2007-05-07T05:00:00.000Z\nThe rate at which young children perish has worsened most disastrously over the past 15 years in Iraq, hard hit by sanctions and war, and in Botswana, Zimbabwe and Swaziland, devastated by AIDS, but researchers at Save the Children, in a report released Monday, also found against-the-odds progress in some of the poorest nations of the world.\nBangladesh has profoundly bettered children's survival chances by promoting family planning, a strategy that has enabled women to have fewer children, space the births and strengthen their own health and that of their babies.\nNepal, despite a decade-long Maoist insurgency, has halved the death rate of children under 5 with the help of 50,000 mostly illiterate mothers who have squeezed vitamin A drops into the mouths of every child, hauled the laggards in for vaccinations and even diagnosed and dispensed medicines to combat often deadly bouts of pneumonia.\nAnd Malawi, suffering from an extreme shortage of doctors and nurses, has made surprising gains by taking steps that require no professional skills: distributing mosquito nets that protect children from malarial mosquitoes and giving highly enriched, therapeutic food to severely malnourished children.\n\"In 2007, when we know what to do and how little it costs, that 28,000 kids are still dying each day is just plain wrong,\" said David Oot, a public health specialist on the team that produced the Save the Children report, \"State of the World's Mothers: Saving the Lives of Children Under 5.\"\nAmong the 60 developing countries where 94 percent of the child deaths occurred, 20 have either made no progress or regressed, while 24 have cut death rates of children under 5 by at least 20 percent. Several broad trends emerged.\nA focus on family planning was central. The five countries that made the greatest strides in reducing child deaths - Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal and the Philippines - all saw women's use of contraceptives rise and fertility rates decline. In those countries, mothers were less likely to be physically depleted by having too many babies in too short a time. And with fewer children, families were also able to invest more in the care of each child.\nPolitical will was also a crucial ingredient of success across the countries, and Egypt, which has cut the death rate of children under 5 by 68 percent since 1990, more than any other country, exemplifies this finding, according to researchers at Save the Children, a nonprofit group, and others in the field.\n\"In words and deed, Egypt has put children more at the center of their social agenda than most other countries,\" said Ruth Levine, author of \"Millions Saved: Proven Successes in Global Health.\"\nEgypt has carried out a comprehensive effort to improve the health of mothers and children. It invested in clean water and public health campaigns to teach the importance of hand washing in disease prevention. It built roads that sped access to hospitals. It renovated dilapidated clinics. It made sure most mothers had midwives or other skilled workers to attend births. It strove to perfect the art of the immunization campaign.\n\"There is a way to do a blanket of public health interventions that is very effective,\" said Dr. Ayman El-Mohandes, a pediatrician who heads the Department of Prevention and Community Health at the School of Public Health at George Washington University and who served as a consultant on a U.S.-financed maternal and child health program in Egypt.\nDespite many hopeful stories, broad progress against infant and child mortality has flagged since an international campaign to reduce deaths began 25 years ago, the researchers concluded. By the end of the 1980s, global rates of child mortality had fallen 20 percent, saving the lives of 12 million children.\n\"Much of the momentum behind the child survival revolution has now been lost, and gains achieved in the 1980s and early 1990s have slowed or reversed,\" the report says. \"Under-5 mortality declined by only 10 percent from the early 1990s to 2000.\"",

    "text": "Queens Now Has Less Feta, More Jellyfish\n2007-01-26T05:00:00.000Z\nLIKE most New York immigrant stories, mine started with a long trip, a small apartment in a humble neighborhood and hope for a better life. Sure enough, I graduated from the little apartment to a bigger one, and then a house. I got a better job and a better life. But 27 years later, the neighborhood remains the same: Astoria, Queens. \nTry as I might, I cannot think of a good reason to leave. From the Manhattan perspective, Astoria makes some sense because it is, after all, only a few short subway stops from Bloomingdale\u2019s. If you cannot afford Manhattan, well, Astoria \u2014 like Park Slope, Sunnyside, Cobble Hill and all the rest of the runner-up darlings of the real-estate pages \u2014 qualifies as a fallback position. \nBut that\u2019s not how I see it. For me, Astoria is not a satellite of Manhattan, it\u2019s the gateway to Queens, a jumping-off point for the borough that, when it comes to ethnic diversity, knows no equal. For me this is not an abstract demographic issue. It is as real as the food on my plate.\nAs Astoria has changed, and along with it the rest of Queens, my feeding habits have too, never more so than in the last couple of years. Three years ago I stepped down as The Times\u2019s restaurant critic and re-entered civilian life. Gone were the days of lavish Manhattan meals paid for by my employer. I rediscovered my own kitchen and, at the same time, my own neighborhood. The parasitic life of being fed by others was over. My wife, Nancy, and I were hunter-gatherers again. But the terrain had changed.\nIn 1980, when my rent was $250 a month, Astoria was heavily Greek and Italian. Broadway, my nearest shopping street, abounded in Italian delicatessens and Greek butchers who hung hairy goat carcasses and fuzzy rabbits in the window. Their number has dwindled with the years. A Swiss butcher named Ren\u00e9 operated a truly anomalous store, a French-style boucherie. His ancient, white-haired mother sat at the cash register and took the money. Ren\u00e9, who looked like an enormous slab of meat, took my orders for, say, noisette of pork, without raising an eyebrow. Alas, Ren\u00e9 is long gone, as is Walken\u2019s Bakery a few doors away, owned by the family of the actor Christopher Walken.\n Other ethnic surprises survive. Although the original owner has retired, Astoria Meat Products continues to sell Eastern European sausages, breads and jams. Big chunks of double-smoked bacon and plump, garlicky kielbasa hang from steel rods overhead. On weekends, when the mood strikes, I still drop by and pick up half a smoked, glazed ham. \nThe Italians are almost all gone, and many of the Greeks have moved on too. The demise of my favorite Greek deli had one fortunate consequence, though. It led me to Titan Foods, a supermarket that draws Greek shoppers from miles around. This is the place for olives \u2014 nearly 20 varieties displayed in big steel cylinders \u2014 and for feta cheese in every gradation, from crumbly, salty Greek styles to smoother, milder fetas from Bulgaria. It is almost shocking to report that the French make feta too, the creamiest of all. \nThe real prize in the deli case at Titan is home-made yogurt, thick, tangy and rich, a different species entirely from the standard grocery store brands. Titan sells the standard Greek pastries from a bakery counter, but I go either to Omonia Cafe, on Broadway, where the phyllo-topped custard is so good that I finally asked the woman behind the counter to pronounce it for me so I could order it by name. It\u2019s: galaktoboreko (guh-lock-tuh-BORE-ee-ko). The baklava is also first-rate \u2014 packed with finely chopped nuts, well-seasoned and not too goopy \u2014 but there\u2019s an even better version at a hole-in-the-wall on 31st Avenue: Thessalikon Pastry Shop, a caterer that sells its wares, often grudgingly, by the tray.\nLet us not romanticize the Greek restaurants of Astoria. For some reason, many a food writer, charmed by the neighborhood, has gone weak in the knees over steam-table moussaka, rubbery fried calamari and greasy lamb shanks. Greek cuisine does not, even at its best, ascend to great heights. For a time, Elias Corner on 31st Street enjoyed a cult reputation that utterly mystified me. It is an estiatorio, a type of restaurant in which customers approach a fish counter, point to their choice and pay by the pound. The fish is painted with some olive oil, strewn with a few herbs and grilled. That\u2019s it. \nFor some reason, this formula besotted New York for several years, even though rank amateurs could produce the same results at home. I much prefer the five-year-old Agnanti, at the upper end of the neighborhood near Astoria Park, which offers unusual regional dishes like ntaka, a Cretan bread salad, and mustard-dipped shrimp kataifi.\n Astoria without Greeks is unthinkable. It is the home not only of Socrates Sculpture Park but also of Socrates Realty and Athena\u2019s nail salon. But in my end of the neighborhood, near the 36th Avenue el stop, the ethnic swirl has brought Bangladeshis, Colombians, Brazilians and Mexicans. \nOn summer nights, unpredictably, a Bangladeshi vegetable vendor occasionally turns up, his cart heaped high with Asian vegetables sold by no one else. Asian sari shops, sweet shops and grocery stores now line 36th Avenue, along with a video store that brightens the street with its showings of Bollywood musicals on a flat-screen television. On Broadway, one stop north on the N Line, Mexican taquerias flank the off-track betting parlor. \nAt the far end of the neighborhood, immigrants from Egypt and North Africa have remade a desolate stretch of Steinway Street into a lively boulevard lined with restaurants, hookah cafes and bakeries. \nSo much for home base. Queens is vast. Over the decades, my explorer\u2019s compass has pointed in wildly different directions. For a while, a Gujarati restaurant in Elmhurst had my full attention, until it burned down. Ping\u2019s and Joe\u2019s Shanghai in Elmhurst also enjoyed my favor. In Woodside, La Flor Bakery and Cafe sells sublime $4 fruit tarts that require two diners to finish them off. My thoughts often turn to them in idle hours.\n But Flushing is now my north star. Over the years, an area once in sorry decline has evolved into a pulsating Chinese and Korean neighborhood and a food-lover\u2019s paradise. This is not new news, but it took me a while to catch up. My culinary life has been transformed by the Gold City Supermarket on Kissena Boulevard, a huge, high-energy store, half of it devoted to a dazzling selection of imported sauces, condiments and dried and frozen foods, the other half to produce and meat departments that boggle the mind.\n It pays to do some homework before visiting. Although prices are posted, all signs are in Chinese characters. Bruce Cost\u2019s classic \u201cAsian Ingredients\u201d (Morrow Cookbooks) or Huang Su-Huei\u2019s well-illustrated \u201cChinese Cuisine\u201d (Wei-Chuan) can serve as guides to the aisles stacked with exotic barbecue sauces, light and dark Chinese soy sauces and small treasures like pickled mustard cabbage. \nThe fish counter is dramatic. I once saw an eel make a break for freedom, slithering across the produce-department floor. Customers like to pick out a live fish, which an impassive fishmonger holds aloft, flopping in a net. A quick whack from a wooden mallet, and the performance is over. \nThe post-shopping reward is just a few doors away, at the Fay Da Bakery. This is a chain with two outlets in Chinatown and six others scattered across the city. Patrons take a tray, grab a pair of tongs and load up on steamed and fried buns, both savory and sweet. Some are both at once, like a chewy, sticky-rice bun that looks like a honey-dip doughnut outside but inside contains pork bits swimming in a rich gravy. \nThen it\u2019s on to downtown Flushing and the J&L Mall. Flushing abounds in monster Chinese restaurants that do a bonanza dim-sum business. But hidden in nooks and corners are tiny stands that offer outstanding bargains. My consigliere in these matters is Harley Spiller, a relentless Chinese-food detective who occasionally sends out field reports to his friends. The \u201cmall\u201d is nothing more than a corridor on Main Street lined by rows of snack stands and lunch counters. Little or no English is spoken, so non-Chinese customers adapt. Finger pointing and basic business terms like \u201ctwo\u201d or \u201cthree\u201d work fine. The stall owners, in my experience, are friendly, accommodating and intrigued to see a non-Chinese customer.\nHalfway down the aisle, on the left, a bun stall turns out a variety of large steamed and baked buns at a dollar or two apiece. The best is a crepelike envelope of soft dough encasing chopped chives, egg and glass noodles. A close cousin, which came hot from the oven on my most recent visit, was a big ball of pillowy steamed bread dough filled with egg, glass noodle, chopped Chinese leeks and tiny dried shrimp. \nAt the entrance of the mall, to the right, the buns come three for a dollar. The staple items are small steamed buns with beef or pork filling, but you can also find sweet fried doughnuts accented with scallion, or sticky rice snacks with a meat and mushroom center. These are steamed in a bamboo leaf and then tied up in a neat package. \nAt the back of the mall, spicy Szechuan vegetable dishes are sold from a counter by weight. There are about a dozen choices. I picked four at random on my last visit: long strands of pickled seaweed; cabbage and peppercorns in a fragrant, winey pickling broth; cubes of amber, firm tofu with peanuts and sesame seed; and pickled long beans, chopped into tiny slices and tossed with red-pepper flakes. \nFlushing may occupy me for a while. There\u2019s another mall just a couple of blocks down Main Street, the Golden Shopping Mall, that merits investigation. And even more seductive is the strangely named Waterfront International Enterprises, a restaurant specializing in the cuisine of northeastern China. It\u2019s cold-weather food, heavily reliant on hearty soups and stews. Grilled whole jellyfish, evidently, is the traditional way to start the meal. Count me in. ",

    "text": "FDA tracked tainted drugs, but trail went cold in China\n2007-06-17T05:00:00.000Z\nAfter a drug ingredient from China killed dozens of Haitian children a decade ago, a senior American health official sent a cable to her investigators: Find out who made the poisonous ingredient and why a state-owned company in China exported it as safe, pharmaceutical-grade glycerin.\nThe Chinese were of little help. Requests to find the manufacturer were ignored. Business records were withheld or destroyed.\nThe Americans had reason for alarm. \"The U.S. imports a lot of Chinese glycerin, and it is used in ingested products such as toothpaste,\" Mary Pendergast, then deputy commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration, wrote on Oct. 27, 1997. Learning how diethylene glycol, a syrupy poison used in some antifreeze, ended up in Haitian fever medicine might \"prevent this tragedy from happening again,\" she wrote.\nThe agency's mission ultimately failed. By the time an FDA agent visited the suspected manufacturer, the plant was shut down and Chinese companies said they bore no responsibility for the mass poisoning.\nTen years later it happened again, this time in Panama.\nChinese-made diethylene glycol, masquerading as its more expensive chemical cousin glycerin, was mixed into medicine, killing at least 100 people there last year. And recently, Chinese toothpaste containing diethylene glycol was found in the United States and seven other countries, prompting tens of thousands of tubes to be recalled.\nThe agency's efforts to investigate the Haiti poisonings, documented in internal FDA memorandums obtained by The New York Times, demonstrate not only the intransigence of Chinese officials, but also the same regulatory failings that allowed a virtually identical poisoning to occur 10 years later. The cases further illustrate what happens when nations fail to police the global pipeline of pharmaceutical ingredients.\nIn Haiti and Panama, the poison was traced to Chinese chemical companies not certified to make pharmaceutical ingredients.\nState-owned exporters then shipped the toxic syrup to European traders, who resold it without identifying the previous owner - an attempt to keep buyers from bypassing them on future orders.\nAs a result, most of the buyers did not know that the ingredient came from China, known for producing counterfeit products, nor did they show much interest in finding out.\nChina itself was a victim of diethylene glycol poisoning last year when at least 18 people died after ingesting poisonous medicine made there. In the wake of the deaths, and reports of pet food and other products contaminated with dangerous ingredients from China, officials there announced that they would overhaul the regulation of food, drugs and chemicals.\nBeyond the three incidents linked to Chinese diethylene glycol, there have been at least five other mass poisonings involving the mislabeled chemical in the past two decades - in Bangladesh, Nigeria, Argentina and twice in India.\n\"This problem keeps coming back,\" said Joshua Schier, a toxicologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And no wonder: the counterfeiters are rarely identified, much less prosecuted.\nFinding a way to keep diethylene glycol out of medicine, particularly in developing countries, has confounded health officials for decades. \"It is preventable, and we have to figure out some way of stopping this from happening again,\" said Carol Rubin, a senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official.\nIn a global economy, ingredients for drugs are often bought and sold many times in different countries, sometimes without proper paperwork, all of which increases the risk of fraud, the authorities say.\nThe Panama poison passed through five hands, the Haitian poison six. In both instances, the factory's original certificate of analysis, attesting to the contents of the shipment and its provenance, did not accompany the product as it moved around the world.\n\"Where there is a loophole in the system, a frailty in the system, it's the ability of an unscrupulous distributor to take industrial or technical material and pass it off as pharmaceutical grade,\" said Kevin McGlue, a board member of the International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council.\nUncovering that deception can be difficult. \"It's impossible to get anyone to do the trace-backs,\" said Michael Bennish, co-author of a 1995 medical journal article on a poisoning epidemic in Bangladesh.\nOne reason, Bennish said, is the clout of local manufacturers. \"We tried to follow up as amateur Sherlocks, investigators, but you don't go down to the wholesale market and ask questions,\" he said. \"You are going to get your fingers burnt.\"\nThe United States may not have gotten what it wanted from China, but the Haiti crisis did bring together health groups to search for ways to stop diethylene glycol poisonings. At a workshop in Washington in February 1997, health experts recommended that certificates of analysis be improved to allow users to \"trace the product back through every intermediary, broker and repackager to the original manufacturer.\"\nThe workshop participants also called for better testing of drug ingredients and asked governments to tighten oversight of drug manufacturing.\nThe next year, the World Health Organization offered many of the same recommendations. And a 1998 article in JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical Association, warned that failure to strictly follow the guidelines could cause poisonings \"even in countries where quality control procedures are usually strictly applied.\"\nMuch of this had been said before, yet the poisonings have continued.\nJust as the JAMA article was being published, three dozen children began dying of acute renal failure at two hospitals in Delhi. A local drug maker had unwittingly mixed diethylene glycol into acetaminophen syrup, much as the Haitian pharmacist had.\nThe drug maker was prosecuted, but according to interviews and government records no progress had been made in identifying the poison supplier.\n\"My experience as an investigator tells me that many of these things will not be proven,\" said M. Venkateswarlu, the drug controller general of India.\nFinding counterfeiters often means pursuing leads across foreign borders, and no international authority has the power to do that.\nHoward Zucker, who helps to oversee drug issues for the WHO, said individual countries must conduct their own trace-back investigations.\nDavid Mishael, a Miami lawyer, knows the difficulty of assigning blame in these deaths. For 10 years, Mishael has unsuccessfully pursued legal claims in the United States and Europe against European traders who helped to arrange the shipment of toxic syrup to Haiti.\n\"You can imagine the cost,\" said Mishael, who is representing Haitian parents whose children died from the fever medicine.\nHe said the authorities in the Netherlands assessed a $250,000 fine against the Dutch company Vos, which tested the counterfeit syrup, found it impure and did not alert anyone in Haiti. But given how many died, he called the size of the fine \"a joke.\" A lawyer who represents Vos, Jeffrey Shapiro, declined to comment.\nA few children survived after being flown to the United States by humanitarian groups. One of them, Faika Jean, was 2 months old at the time and nearly died en route. Now 11, she has learning disabilities as a result of the poisoning, said her father, Wislin Jean.\nPendergast, now a private lawyer and consultant, said China had the most to answer for. \"Everybody else is just reacting to initial failures,\" she said. \"It needs to take steps to protect not just its own consumers but also consumers all around the world.\"\nAfter it was reported in May that the Panama poison had been made and exported by Chinese companies as 99.5 percent pure glycerin, Chinese regulators said they would reopen their investigation of the incident. Three weeks later, the officials acknowledged some \"misconduct\" in how Chinese companies labeled the toxic syrup.\nBut most of the blame, they said, rested with a Panamanian importer who changed the paperwork to make the syrup look safer than it actually was.\nThe FDA disagrees, saying the deception began with Chinese companies falsely labeling a poisonous product glycerin. \"If the drums had been 99.5 percent glycerin, the deaths in Panama would never have occurred,\" the agency said.\nReporting was contributed by Jake Hooker from Beijing, Hari Kumar from New Delhi, Anand Giridharadas from Mumbai, and Julfikar Ali Manik from Dhaka, Bangladesh.",

    "text": "Slyders by Candlelight\n2007-02-18T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE White Castle on East Fordham Road in the Bronx shimmered as if glazed. A Valentine\u2019s Day of snow and freezing rain had left a thin layer of ice on its crenellated exterior and several inches of accumulation in the parking lot and on the sidewalk. There were few cars and even fewer pedestrians. \n\u201cNormally it\u2019s crazy in there,\u201d said Edmond Walton, who has worked at White Castle for nearly three years, as he ripped open a bag of de-icing salt and poured it into a white salt spreader. \u201cBut the weather slows a lot of people down.\u201d \nInside, Alecia Simpson, the general manager, remained optimistic and beamed at each entering takeout customer. It was the second year that she and her team at \u201cCastle No. 2,\u201d as the place is officially known, had participated in the company\u2019s nationwide Valentine\u2019s Day promotion, and the year before had been a success. \nFor this year, a mix of fawning and snarky local news media coverage \u2014 including a win-a-date contest with the blogger The Assimilated Negro \u2014 seemed to augur well. After all, Ms. Simpson said, reading from a plaque, the fast-food chain has operated an outpost on East Fordham Road in Belmont since Aug. 10, 1930.\nRed, white and pink streamers hung festively over half the room, and red plastic tablecloths sat on the empty tables. From 5 to 8 p.m., by reservation only, diners were to be offered menus featuring Fish Nibblers, jalape\u00f1o cheeseburgers and French toast sticks for dessert, along with a plastic rose, candlelight, table service and candy in a swan-shaped container. \nNadine Ortiz, a shift manager who last year made a modest if undisclosed amount in tips by serving customers at their tables, waited by the self-service coffee island.\nA group of four students \u2014 three men and a woman \u2014 from nearby Fordham University were the first party to arrive. \u201cWe wanted to see it sober,\u201d one member of the group explained. The moment they arrived, Ms. Ortiz rushed over to light their candle, and another server came by to jot down their order \u2014 mozzarella sticks, three chicken ring sandwiches and three cheeseburger meals, including fries and soda \u2014 on a clipboard. \nGolam Talukder, a taxi driver from Bangladesh who lives nearby, arrived later with his wife, to be seated at an undecorated booth that was near the bathroom. She had joined him in New York only two weeks earlier and spoke no English. The couple had never celebrated Valentine\u2019s Day, said Mr. Talukder, who wanted no fuss made about their evening.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just regular people,\u201d he said as he wrinkled his nose and motioned to the red half of the room. \u201cToo fancy.\u201d\nAlso among the diners that evening was Kendra D\u2019Emilia, a lawyer who had planned the night as a surprise for her husband, Paul. Unable to make a reservation at any of the White Castles in Manhattan \u2014 the couple live on the Upper West Side \u2014 she had booked a table in the Bronx because her husband had gone to school at Fordham. \n\u201cIt\u2019s usually the worst night to go out to a restaurant,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Emilia said as she helped Jack, the 2-year-old sitting next to her, take a gulp of hot chocolate. \u201cAnd now that we have a baby, we have an excuse.\u201d ",

    "text": "UN scientists using radiation to prod nature into producing better crops\n2007-08-29T05:00:00.000Z\nVIENNA \u2014 Pierre Lagoda pulled a small container from his pocket and spilled the contents onto his desk. Four tiny dice rolled to a stop.\n\"That's what nature does,\" Lagoda said. The random results of the dice, he explained, illustrate how spontaneous mutations create the genetic diversity that drives evolution and selective breeding.\nHe rolled the dice again. This time, he was mimicking what he and his colleagues have been doing quietly around the globe for more than a half-century - using radiation to scramble the genetic material in crops, a process that has produced useful mutants like red grapefruit, disease-resistant cocoa and premium barley for Scotch whiskey.\n\"I'm not doing anything different from what nature does,\" he said. \"I'm not using anything that was not in the genetic material itself.\"\nLagoda, the head of plant breeding and genetics at the International Atomic Energy Agency, prides himself on being a good salesman. It can be a tough act, however, given wide public fears about the dangers of radiation and the risks of genetically manipulated food. His work combines both fields but has nonetheless managed to thrive.\nThe process leaves no residual radiation or other obvious marks of human intervention. It simply creates offspring that exhibit new characteristics.\nThough poorly known, radiation breeding has produced thousands of useful mutants and a sizable fraction of the world's crops, Lagoda said, including varieties of rice, wheat, barley, pears, peas, cotton, peppermint, sunflowers, peanuts, grapefruit, sesame, bananas, cassava and sorghum.\nThe mutations can improve yield, quality, taste, size and resistance to disease and can help plants adapt to diverse climates and conditions.\nLagoda takes pains to distinguish the little-known radiation work from the contentious field of genetically modified crops. That practice can splice foreign genetic material into plants, creating exotic varieties grown widely in the United States but often feared and rejected in Europe. By contrast, radiation breeding has made few enemies.\n\"Spontaneous mutations are the motor of evolution,\" Lagoda said in his office. \"We are mimicking nature in this. We're concentrating time and space for the breeder so he can do the job in his lifetime.\n\"We concentrate how often mutants appear - going through 10,000 to 1 million - to select just the right one.\"\nRadiation breeding is widely used in the developing world, due largely to the efforts of the atomic agency, an arm of the United Nations in Vienna. Beneficiaries have included Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand and Vietnam.\nPlant scientists say radiation breeding could play an important role in the future. By promoting crop flexibility, it could help feed billions of added mouths despite shrinking land and water, rising oil and fertilizer costs, increasing soil exhaustion, growing resistance of insects to pesticides and looming climate change. Globally, food prices are already rising fast.\n\"It's not going to solve the world food crisis,\" said J. Neil Rutger, former director of the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Stuttgart, Arkansas. \"But it will help.\"\nThough the method was discovered some 80 years ago in the United States, it is now used mostly overseas, with Asia and Europe the leading regions.",

    "text": "Calling the Faithful and Getting Complaints\n2007-02-25T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Masjid Nur al-Islam mosque, on Church Avenue in Kensington, Brooklyn, is a humble two-story brick structure with a green and white sign in Arabic and English. Amid the auto body shops and the Mexican and Middle Eastern restaurants that populate its low-slung corner of the neighborhood, the building barely stands out \u2014 except for the sounds that emanate, four times a day, from a small gray bullhorn mounted on the edge of its roof.\nA little before 12:30 p.m. and again at 3, 5:30 and 7:15, the speaker broadcasts Muslim calls to prayer that the faithful consider essential, but that some neighbors, who have complained for years, say are just too loud. These residents renewed their complaints at a recent meeting of the Dahill Neighborhood Association attended by the police captain in charge of the 66th Precinct, Peter DeBlasio. The meeting was reported in Flatbush Life, a local newspaper.\nIvan Selzer, co-president of the neighborhood group, said in an interview that in response to previous entreaties, the mosque had lowered the volume, but that the noise had recently gotten worse.\nAnd he emphasized that his group\u2019s objections to the mosque, which serves a large Bangladeshi and Pakistani community, were narrowly focused. \u201cThis is not coming from any radical place, or anti-anything,\u201d Mr. Selzer said. \u201cThis is coming from, it\u2019s just a lot of noise.\u201d\nEarly one afternoon last week, Mohamed Elshenawy, an imam at the mosque, stood at a microphone on the building\u2019s second floor and, in a sonorous voice, intoned Arabic words over the loudspeaker that translate, in part, to: \u201cGod is the greatest. ... There is no god except God. ... Muhammad is the messenger of God. ... Come to prayer. ... Come to salvation.\u201d\nA short time later, Mr. Elshenawy said he was aware of few complaints about noise, though he acknowledged that a police officer had visited the mosque in connection with the matter. Out of consideration for neighbors, he added, the mosque does not amplify a fifth, early-morning call to prayer, but he said that if the other calls were not loud enough for local Muslims to hear, they would be the ones complaining.\n \u201cIf they don\u2019t hear it,\u201d Mr. Elshenawy said, \u201cyou make something for nothing.\u201d\n Police Officer Martin Speechley, a department spokesman, said that at this point the police can do little besides mediate. \n\u201cIt\u2019s religious, so you\u2019re walking on rough ground here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do all we can, but if there\u2019s no law being broken, we\u2019re fairly powerless to make somebody comply with what somebody else wants.\u201d",

But judges found the victim herself to be guilty. Her crime is called \"mingling\": When she was abducted, she was in a car with a man not related to her by blood or marriage, and in Saudi Arabia, that is illegal. Last month, she was sentenced to six months in prison and 200 lashes with a bamboo cane.\nTwo hundred lashes are enough to kill a strong man. Women usually receive no more than 30 lashes at a time, which means that for seven weeks the \"girl from Qatif,\" as she's usually described in news articles, will dread her next session with Islamic justice.\nWhen she is released, her life will certainly never return to normal: Already there have been reports that her brother has tried to kill her because her \"crime\" has tarnished her family's honor.\nWe also saw Islamic justice in action in Sudan, when a 54-year-old British teacher named Gillian Gibbons was sentenced to 15 days in jail before the government pardoned her this week; she could have faced 40 lashes.\nWhen she began a reading project with her class involving a teddy bear, Gibbons suggested the children choose a name for it. They chose Muhammad; she let them do it. This was deemed to be blasphemy.\nThen there's Taslima Nasreen, the 45-year-old Bangladeshi writer who bravely defends women's rights in the Muslim world. Forced to flee Bangladesh, she has been living in India. But Muslim groups there want her expelled, and one has offered 500,000 rupees for her head.\nIn August she was assaulted by Muslim militants in Hyderabad, and in recent weeks she has had to leave Calcutta and then Rajasthan. Taslima Nasreen's visa expires next year, and she fears she will not be allowed to live in India again.\nIt is often said that Islam has been \"hijacked\" by a small extremist group of radical fundamentalists. The vast majority of Muslims are said to be moderates.\nBut where are the moderates? Where are the Muslim voices raised over the terrible injustice of incidents like these? How many Muslims are willing to stand up and say, in the case of the girl from Qatif, that this manner of justice is appalling, brutal and bigoted - and that no matter who said it was the right thing to do, and how long ago it was said, this should no longer be done?\nUsually, Muslim groups like the Organization of the Islamic Conference are quick to defend any affront to the image of Islam. The organization, which represents 57 Muslim states, sent four ambassadors to the leader of my political party in the Netherlands asking him to expel me from Parliament after I gave a newspaper interview in 2003 noting that by Western standards some of the Prophet Muhammad's behavior would be unconscionable. A few years later, Muslim ambassadors to Denmark protested the cartoons of Muhammad and demanded that their perpetrators be prosecuted.\nBut while the incidents in Saudi Arabia, Sudan and India have done more to damage the image of Islamic justice than a dozen cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, the organizations that lined up to protest the hideous Danish offense to Islam are quiet now.\nI wish there were more Islamic moderates. For example, I would welcome some guidance from that famous Muslim theologian of moderation, Tariq Ramadan. But when there is true suffering, real cruelty in the name of Islam, we hear, first, denial from all these organizations that are so concerned about Islam's image.\nWe hear that violence is not in the Koran, that Islam means peace, that this is a hijacking by extremists and a smear campaign and so on. But the evidence mounts up.\nIslamic justice is a proud institution, one to which more than a billion people subscribe, at least in theory, and in the heart of the Islamic world it is the law of the land. But take a look at the verse above: More compelling even than the order to flog adulterers is the command that the believer show no compassion. It is this order to choose Allah above his sense of conscience and compassion that imprisons the Muslim in a mindset that is archaic and extreme.\nIf moderate Muslims believe there should be no compassion shown to the girl from Qatif, then what exactly makes them so moderate?\nWhen a \"moderate\" Muslim's sense of compassion and conscience collides with matters prescribed by Allah, he should choose compassion. Unless that happens much more widely, a moderate Islam will remain wishful thinking.\nAyaan Hirsi Ali, a former member of the Dutch Parliament and a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of \"Infidel.\"",

    "text": "Translating India, Sometimes Fluently\n2007-07-18T04:00:00.000Z\nANY American cook who longs to plunge deeply into the cuisine of India is bound to grow impatient with the cookbooks offered by major United States publishers. Wonderful though many of those books are, their scope looks awfully limited stacked up against the riches now found in the innumerable grocery shops and restaurants that the Indian diaspora has brought here. \nBut mainstream cookbook publishers are no longer the only game in town. Thanks to globalization and new technologies, Americans now have access to a surprising range of ocean-hopping alternatives. Many Indian-published books show up at shops like Butala Emporium in Jackson Heights, Queens. Even more options are available online and from publishers in other countries.\nThese off-the-map volumes aren\u2019t for everyone. What is often their greatest virtue is also their most frequent drawback: they rarely get any professional editorial whacking into conventional shape. So they can be rich in originality and insight but amateurish in design, writing style or \u2014 among the recipes \u2014 decipherability.\nTwo good illustrations of the trade-offs are \u201cThe Calcutta Kitchen,\u201d by Simon Parkes and Udit Sarkhel (Interlink Publishing Group, $29.95), and \u201cGrains, Greens and Grated Coconuts: Recipes and Remembrances of a Vegetarian Legacy,\u201d by Ammini Ramachandran (iUniverse paperback, $23.95). The first roves adventurously around the great port city of its title; the other lovingly recalls the food of its author\u2019s native Kerala state in the far south.\n\u201cThe Calcutta Kitchen,\u201d a British import available from Interlink, a Massachusetts concern, deals with culinary terrain that is nearly unknown in the United States despite the abundant presence of Calcuttan immigrants and Bangladeshi restaurateurs (who, unfortunately, almost never serve Bengali food).\nMr. Parkes, a food reporter for BBC Radio, explores the city and its food with 10 witty, eccentric, thoughtful essays. His angles include the local passion for freshwater fish rushed to markets from an extraordinary wetlands system, declining ex-outposts of the British Raj like the Tollygunge Club and the many ethnic presences that enliven the flavor of Calcutta, among them Armenian Christians, Baghdad Jews and Tibetan dumpling-makers.\nHis lively summings-up are magnificently reinforced by the photographs of Jason Lowe, whose chronicling of faded beauties, brash incongruities and glory-amid-grime cooking is alone worth the price.\nThe downside comes when you hit the recipes by Mr. Sarkhel, a London restaurateur. He covers many bases, as varied as ghee-enriched boiled rice and mustard-seasoned fish in banana-leaf packets, but seems clueless about what makes directions intelligible. People used to improvising from unorthodox cookbooks can follow some recipes to good effect. But even they may be stumped by foggy terminology, wildly inaccurate timings and measurements, or the omission of details (white or black poppy seeds in the condiment called posto?).\nI got about four times the stated yield for the mustard condiment kashundi, and have no idea whether the fruit of long struggles with incomprehensible directions resembled the real thing. On the other hand, pan-fried shrimp in a spicy wet rub and a dish of spinach with assorted starchy vegetables needed only minor guesswork for really excellent results. \n\u201cGrains, Greens and Grated Coconuts,\u201d a self-published volume sold almost exclusively online, is a much more consistent work whose virtues are the direct opposite of those in \u201cThe Calcutta Kitchen.\u201d Expect no photographic tours or colorful reportorial vignettes. The purpose of this modest no-frills book is to place a region, its history, and its family and cultural heritages into a coherent context for understanding food. \nInstead of trying to cover all menu bases that an editor might insist on, Ms. Ramachandran is free to concentrate on unorthodox categories, including amazingly diverse \u201ccurries\u201d (sauced vegetable combinations), pickles and preserves, breakfast specialties, rice dishes associated with sacred observances and temple or rite-of-passage offerings.\nOther books have ably explored India\u2019s far southern territory, but Ms. Ramachandran reveals amazing range and depth in Kerala\u2019s Hindu vegetarian traditions. And American home cooks should find her introductions to ingredients, techniques and equipment accessible.\nThough the recipes are best used by cooks who know something about Indian food, they make eminent sense. I had fine success with the coconut-laced vegetable m\u00e9lange aviyal, as well as with cold rice in a spicy yogurt dressing and a gorgeously seasoned spinach pur\u00e9e. Indian sweets are mostly a closed book to me, so a simple, irresistible dish of ripe plantains caramelized with sugar and ghee came as a welcome surprise.",

    "text": "Grazing from Delhi to London\n2007-11-18T05:00:00.000Z\nTHINK of Brick Lane, and images of London's most famous immigrant street, depicted in Monica Ali's novel (and soon-to-be film) of the same name, come to mind, as do the spicy smells of cumin, cardamom and turmeric emanating from the more than 50 Bangladeshi restaurants that line the historic thoroughfare.\n But a new culinary movement is taking place on Brick Lane, a street crowded with visitors on weekend mornings and afternoons (particularly on Sunday, when the hugely popular flea market is open) \u2014 one that has less to do with Indian food and more to do with satisfying the tastes of the trendy crowd living in the East End of London. (To get to Brick Lane, take the London Underground to the Aldgate East station; the street is about a five-minute walk away.)\nFor a grazing day like no other, start at the Brick Lane Beigel Bakery (No. 159), a one-room shop that is one of the last reminders that Jewish immigrants flocked to the area in the late 1800's, for distinctly different bagels \u2014 smaller, softer and doughier than those in New York. (Try the salt beef bagels with mustard and gherkins for \u00a32.60, about $5.70 at $2.14 to the pound, or perhaps a slice of freshly prepared cheesecake for 70 pence a slice.)\nAround the corner, at 18 Cheshire Street is Labour & Wait (44-207-729-6253), which sells '50s-style kitchen wares like enamel milk jugs. It is open Saturday 1 to 5 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and some Fridays. It's best to call to see if it's open.\nThe Old Truman Brewery, 91-95 Brick Lane, is now a complex of buildings that is a fashion and cultural center and includes studios, galleries, shops and nightclubs. Grab a seat (or rather a cardboard crate) at one of the communal butcher-block tables at the Story Deli (44-207-247-3137), which serves organic pizzas made with dough as thin as tissue paper. Recent specials (both \u00a39.50) included a chanterelle pizza with porcini pesto, pine nuts and caramelized red onion, as well as a pumpkin and goat cheese pizza with sun-dried tomatoes and red peppers.\nThe newest kid on the Brewery block is the Rootmaster (44-7912-389-314), a vegan restaurant that opened three months ago and that immediately began drawing foodies from around London to its location in a parking lot off Dray Walk. Housed in one of London's famous double-decker red Routemaster buses, with candlelit stylish seating upstairs, a kitchen on the main level and a cafe outside, the restaurant specializes in dishes like hand-made gyoza with peppers and mushrooms (\u00a34.75) and marinated pan-roasted tofu with crispy won tons and coconut-curried vegetables (\u00a39). Rootmaster is open daily, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. On Sundays, the brewery is also home to two food markets, open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., which feature a variety of culinary offerings from around the world \u2014 from crepes to Thai food.\nOf course, it is essential that any visit to Brick Lane include a Bengali meal. Meraz Caf\u00e9, at 56 Hanbury Street just off Brick Lane (44-207-247-6999), is unlike many of the tourist-trap Indian restaurants aiming for your business with offers of tired lunch buffets for under \u00a36. Instead, Meraz is small and sleek, its walls brightly painted brick red, and furnished with comfortable designer seating areas and kitschy art. Its simple menu includes freshly prepared Handi cooking with herbs. A heaping plate of chicken akhni (spicy chicken with rice) is \u00a34.50, as is the nihari (a tender lamb shank). On a recent visit, the vegetable and meat samosas were steaming inside (\u00a31.20), and the chapatti (60 pence) was just off the grill, a rarity nowadays. \nFinally, visit the Rajmahal Sweet Shop (44-207-7375-3536) at 57 Brick Lane and take out a small box of mixed cookies, cakes and fruits, like pistachio borfey (similar to marzipan) and jalebi, a pretzel-like fried dough covered with syrup. Savor them slowly as you walk to the end of the street having now experienced the new and the historic Brick Lane. ",

    "text": "The Art of Mapping on the Run\n2007-09-09T04:00:00.000Z\nIt used to be that updated editions of world atlases mainly tracked the shifting of borders and changes in the names of cities and countries determined by politics, diplomacy or war. \nThe surface of the planet itself was a relatively constant template in the background. You could render it in more detail with, say, better satellite data, but the basics didn\u2019t change much. \nNow, though, the accelerating and intensifying impact of human activities is visibly altering the planet, requiring ever more frequent redrawing not only of political boundaries, but of the shape of Earth\u2019s features themselves.\nHow so?\nIn the new edition of \u201cThe Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World\u201d (HarperCollins, 2007), for instance, there are before-and-after views of the Aral Sea, once the world\u2019s fourth-largest lake. It shriveled as Soviet-era irrigation projects siphoned off the rivers that replenished it. A dam completed in 2005 now prevents water from flowing out of the lake\u2019s northern lobe, which is expanding as a result.\nThe lake\u2019s vanishing and rebirth, easily visible from space, are the work of people.\n\u201cThe impactful thing is the size of some of these changing features,\u201d Mick Ashworth, the editor in chief of the atlas, said in a telephone interview from England. \nThe atlas charts the shifting coastline of Bangladesh, for example, where land has been lost to rising sea levels. It identifies islands that are likely to be subsumed by the seas, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands among them, and coastal communities that may be forced to move. One of them is Shishmaref, Alaska, located on a narrow island along the Bering Strait, where the break-up of sea ice has left the village more exposed to storms and the sea is advancing at a rate of 10 feet a year.\nSome scientists focused on global environmental change say it is no surprise that atlases, in essence, are becoming autobiographical, reflecting the reality that the physical Earth is increasingly what the human species makes of it. \nThe pace of change will only accelerate over the next two generations, many earth scientists and demographers say, as the human population and its \u201cfootprint\u201d \u2014 through growing appetites for energy, water and food \u2014 crest before leveling off later in the century as communities age and technology advances. \nWilliam Clark, an expert at Harvard on global environmental trends, said it was significant that, \u201ceven the most conservative of print atlases increasingly go beyond a little map that treats \u2018world climates\u2019 or \u2018world vegetation\u2019 the way it treats mountain ranges\u201d \u2014 as permanent fixtures. \nAll of this means a lot more work for atlas makers, who now have to keep up not only with political change, but also with large-scale effects of people on the home planet. \nMr. Ashworth said databases tracked by a staff of 50 cartographers are updated every three and a half minutes. \n\u201cWe can literally see environmental disasters unfolding before our eyes,\u201d he said in a news release last week.

    "text": "New U.S. report repeats warning on warmer climate\n2007-04-16T05:00:00.000Z\nFor the second time in a month, private consultants to the American government are warning that human-driven warming of the climate poses risks to the national security of the United States.\nA report, which had been scheduled to be published on Monday but was distributed to some reporters Saturday, said issues usually associated with the environment - such as rising ocean levels, droughts and violent weather caused by global warming - were also national security concerns.\n\"Unlike the problems that we are used to dealing with, these will come upon us extremely slowly, but come they will, and they will be grinding and inexorable,\" Richard Truly, a retired vice admiral and former NASA administrator, said in the report.\nThe effects of global warming, the study said, could lead to large-scale migrations, increased border tensions, the spread of disease and conflicts over food and water. All could lead to direct involvement by the U.S. military.\nThe report recommends that climate change be integrated into the nation's security strategies and says the United States \"should commit to a stronger national and international role to help stabilize climate changes at levels that will avoid significant disruption to global security and stability.\"\nThe report, called \"National Security and the Threat of Climate Change,\" was commissioned by the Center for Naval Analyses, a government-financed research group, and written by a group of retired generals and admirals called the Military Advisory Board.\nIn March, a report from the Global Business Network, which advises intelligence agencies and the Pentagon on occasion, concluded, among other things, that rising seas and more powerful storms could eventually generate unrest as such crowded regions as Bangladesh's sinking delta become less habitable,\nOne of the authors of the report, Peter Schwartz, a consultant who studies climate risks and other trends for the Defense Department and other clients, said the climate system, jogged by a century-long buildup of heat-trapping gases, was likely to rock between extremes that could wreak havoc in poor countries with fragile societies.\n\"Just look at Somalia in the early 1990s,\" Schwartz said. \"You had disruption driven by drought, leading to the collapse of a society, humanitarian relief efforts and then disastrous U.S. military intervention. That event is prototypical of the future.\n\"Picture that in Central America or the Caribbean, which are just as likely,\" he said. \"This is not distant, this is now. And we need to be preparing.\"\nOther recent studies have shown that drought and scant water have already fueled conflicts in such global flash points as Afghanistan, Nepal and Sudan, according to several recent studies.\nThis bodes ill, given projections that human-driven warming is likely to make some of the world's driest, poorest places drier still, experts said.\n\"The evidence is fairly clear that sharp downward deviations from normal rainfall in fragile societies elevate the risk of major conflict,\" said Marc Levy of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, which recently published a study on the relationship between climate and civil war.\nGiven that climate models project drops in rainfall in such places in a warming world, Levy said, \"It seems irresponsible not to take into account the possibility that a world with climate change will be a more violent world when making judgments about how tolerable such a world might be.\"",

    "text": "For a Small Slaughterhouse, a Dash of Local Glory\n2007-05-06T04:00:00.000Z\nAbout a dozen speckled Plymouth Rock hens sat at the front of the poultry section. They and their neighbors \u2014 hundreds of Rhode Island hens, Muscovy drakes and other fowl \u2014 warbled quietly in their pens. Lambs and goats munched alfalfa grass in a roomier wing next door. \nThese were their last moments. All these creatures had arrived from farms and had taken up temporary residence at the Madani Halal slaughterhouse on 94th Avenue near 100th Street in Ozone Park, Queens. An occasional feather drifted to the concrete floor, and a stillness pervaded the air. \n\u201cAccording to my Koran, animals have no voice,\u201d said Riaz Uddin, a Bangladeshi Muslim immigrant who started the slaughterhouse a decade ago. \u201cBut you treat them like you treat yourself.\u201d \nFour years ago, Mr. Uddin passed the business on to his son, Imran Uddin, a 29-year-old practicing Muslim who at first glance seems an unlikely halal slaughterman. Stocky with a fashionable shadow of a beard, the son wears a Bluetooth device clipped to his ear and a handset attached to the waist of his khaki cargo pants. He studied communications at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and worked at a Manhattan advertising firm, but he has been quick to embrace his father\u2019s ethos. \n\u201cHalal starts at the moment a chicken hatches from its egg,\u201d Imran Uddin said before rattling off a list of how the animals should be treated. Just before the lambs and goats die, he added, some of them are given water. \u201cIt helps calm them down,\u201d he said.\nMadani is one of roughly 80 state-regulated small-scale slaughterhouses and live markets in the city, but thanks to a recent star turn on film it is poised to become one of the best known. A documentary film about the slaughterhouse, titled \u201cA Son\u2019s Sacrifice\u201d and focusing on Imran\u2019s return to an insular Muslim world, will have its final showing this afternoon in the Tribeca Film Festival. The film, which won the festival\u2019s best documentary short film award on Thursday, will be seen on the PBS program \u201cIndependent Lens\u201d on Channel 13 later this year or early next year. But Madani\u2019s name is already familiar to his customers, many of them immigrants who want to buy live animals and see them slaughtered in keeping with Muslim traditions followed in their homelands. \nLast week, the regulars drifted in, bypassing a large Pathmark on Atlantic Avenue for the quiet industrial side street where Madani sits in a squat red brick building. Most customers headed straight for the poultry.\nA couple wandered in and picked out two hens. A worker quickly tethered the animals\u2019 spindly legs to a rod connected to a scale. Once weighed, the birds were placed in large stainless steel fixtures resembling upside-down traffic cones, their necks and heads poking through the narrow hole at the bottom. \nA Muslim employee sliced each bird\u2019s windpipe and major arteries with one swift motion. A slight ruffling of their white tail feathers was the only sign that their end was in sight.",

    "text": "Redesigning a condom so women will use it\n2007-11-13T05:00:00.000Z\nThe female condom has never caught on in much of the developed world. But in the third world, where it was introduced in the late 1990s, public health workers hoped it would overthrow the politics of the bedroom, empower women and stop the AIDS epidemic in its tracks.\nIt did not. Female condoms never really caught on there, either.\nOnly about 12 million female condoms are delivered each year in poor countries, compared with about 6 billion male condoms. Couples complained that the female version was awkward, unsightly, noisy and slippery \u2014 or, as Mitchell Warren, who was one of its earliest champions, now says, \"the yuck factor was a problem.\" Many women tried it, but in the end, it was adopted mainly by prostitutes.\nNow scientists are trying again. A new design \u2014 much the same at one end, different at the other \u2014 has been developed, and its makers hope it will succeed where its predecessor failed.\n\"Over 15 years, there's been no real competition, no second-generation product,\" said Michael J. Free, head of technology at PATH, a nonprofit group based in Seattle that did the redesign. \"There's no lack of interest, but we've been stalled.\"\nHowever, the new design does not overcome the glaring drawback that doomed the first to be a niche product: it cannot be used secretly. For that reason, married women, now one of the highest risk groups for AIDS in poor countries, rarely use it.\n\"I don't want my husband to know that I am wearing a condom,\" said Lois Chingandu, the director of SAfaids, an anti-AIDS organization in Zimbabwe.\n\"Condoms are almost undiscussable within a marriage\" in Africa, she added. \"It is something associated with casual sex. If a wife uses a condom, the message is that you have been unfaithful. If she even initiates the discussion, it tips the power scale. Men resist quite a lot, and it can result in violence.\"\nBut for couples who have agreed on condoms, and for sex workers whose clients cooperate, the new design has several advantages.\nThe redesigned female condom is made of softer, thinner polyurethane to better transmit warmth. It is easier to insert; one end is bunched up as small as a tampon, an improvement on the old design, which resembled the stiff rubber ring of a diaphragm and had to be folded into a figure 8 for insertion.\nDuring sex, the new female condom also moves more like a vagina than the old design did, according to couples in Seattle, Thailand, Mexico and South Africa who tested a series of prototypes, said Joanie Robertson, project manager for the condom at PATH. The old design hung passively from the rubber ring, which could shift around and sometimes hurt; the new design has dots of adhesive foam that adhere to the vaginal walls, expanding with them during arousal.\nAccording to PATH, more than 90 percent of the couples were satisfied with the ease of use and comfort of the new condom, and 98 percent found the sensation of sex to be \"O.K. to very satisfactory.\"\nNonetheless, progress is now stalled.\nPATH is seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration so the condom can be sold in the United States. And with the drug agency's approval, it would be much easier to license the condom in poor countries or get a World Health Organization endorsement.\nWhile the FDA designates male condoms as Class 2 medical devices \u2014 meaning that a new maker has to pass tests only for leakage and bursting \u2014 it puts female condoms in Class 3, the same category as pacemakers, heart valves and silicone breast implants.\nThat decision was made in 1999 \u2014 after much debate, and well after the condom was in use overseas \u2014 because there was no clinical data on the effectiveness of female condoms, and failure could be life-threatening if the woman's partner had AIDS. An advisory panel suggested not even calling it a \"condom\" and instead labeled it an \"intravaginal pouch,\" but the agency rejected that advice.\nNames notwithstanding, the Class 3 listing means that any new design must pass clinical trials, which would cost $3 million to $6 million.\n\"That's a huge, huge impediment, close to a 100 percent block, because no one's willing to put up that sort of money,\" Free said.\nThe United States Agency for International Development, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Lemelson Foundation and others paid for design costs and prototypes, but they are not willing to pay for clinical trials and the cost of building a factory. Private investors have also balked because the American and European markets for the original design proved smaller than had been predicted.\nThe failure of the original design \u2014 made by the Female Health Company of Chicago and marketed worldwide under names like FC1, Reality, Dominique, Femy and Protectiv \u2014 is still galling to AIDS experts.\n\"Their use has remained frustratingly and tragically low,\" said Peter Piot, executive director of UNAids, the United Nations AIDS agency.\nIn the 1990s, Warren, former director of international affairs for the Female Health Company, visited 24 countries trying to get the female condom accepted. Brazil, South Africa and Zimbabwe were the most receptive, said Warren, who now works on AIDS vaccines.\n\"It had some elements of success,\" he said, \"but hasn't had the blockbuster numbers the company had hoped for.\"\nBut, as Chingandu noted, even in Zimbabwe, after an initial flurry of excitement from women, the condom settled into a niche: a tool of the sex trade.\nWhether the condom did well or poorly in a particular country, Warren said, was determined mostly by how it was introduced. Brazil's rollout order was for one million. Bangladesh, by contrast, tried to start with only 20,000. And Uganda bought one million but then did little marketing and no training in how to use it.\n\"People said, 'Oh, it failed,'\" he said. \"Well, it didn't fail. It just wasn't available, or its introduction was a bad program. People need to practice with it before it catches on.\"\nHe called the new design \"a better mousetrap\" but said it still faced another problem it shares with the original: it is expensive compared with male condoms.\nWhile those are made by simply dipping molds in latex, the female one uses complex thin-film polyurethane. The most closely related technology is that used for blood bags, so PATH is visiting companies that make them.\nBut as Robertson noted, companies that make blood bags have little expertise in marketing sexual products.",

    "text": "Marking a major non-event - Opinion - International Herald Tribune\n2007-01-28T05:00:00.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 Another Davos has come and gone, leaving one baffled as to why the event receives such extensive media coverage given the unrepresentative selection of \"movers and shakers\" assembled there.\nAs a veteran of Davos, for the first time in several years I viewed the event not at first hand but through the prism of coverage in the international press. I am more baffled than ever that the event claims more print coverage than such other set-piece annual events as the Group of 8 summit, the IMF/World Bank annual meetings or the UN General Assembly \u2014 let alone the poor man's counterpart, the largely ignored World Social Forum just held in Nairobi. The extent of coverage confirms to many not just in the poor world but in the newly rich societies of Asia the implicit assumption of the West that the views of its politicians, businessmen and social commentators are of overwhelming importance while their's count for little.\nThus we hear plenty of Western views about the rise of China and India, but few on how they view each other or the West, or their future global role. That Japan is the world's second largest economy or Korea the leader in several major industrial fields go largely unreflected, except through the views of economists from Western investment banks.\nTwo years ago this column suggested that \"the 'World' in World Economic Forum has become something of a misnomer,\" noting that almost 80 percent of the speakers were from the Western world and more than 50 percent from the United States and Britain alone. Equally absent were the East Asian giants of global commerce or representatives of the 300 million Muslims of secular Indonesia and Bangladesh. Last year I noted that Davos was \"a useful mirror of the West's received wisdom about the world,\" but a very poor reflection of global trends and very late in waking up to the impact that Asian giants in particular had been making on the globe.\nJudging by the media coverage, nothing much has changed this year. Yes, the issue of climate change was to the fore, and even included some participation by India and China on the subject of emissions. But, given how even President George W. Bush has now acknowledged the existence of this problem, it showed how far Davos is a laggard rather than a leader in the field of opinion forming, and a poorly balanced one at that.\nThe financial sector continued to get a large share of Davos media coverage \u2014 again a reflection of the choice of speakers as well as the interests of the news wire services' major clients. But there seems to have been one improvement this year \u2014 the absence of the movie world glitterati, whose presence last year added to the media-circus atmosphere.\nIt was not always like this. In the past, Davos attracted far less media coverage because it focused more on discussion of themes and ideas and frank exchanges in closed sessions where participants spoke and argued more freely. Now it has become a forum for grandstanding speeches and sound-bite quotes. Platitudes that would otherwise go unreported get extensive coverage and junior-league brokerage economists get publicity for rehashing the opinions of research reports which would otherwise go unnoticed and unremarked.\nThe Western bias, far less noticeable in earlier days, has become self-reinforcing as Asian government and business leaders ignore Davos or dispatch midlevel officials. Even rich countries and companies sometimes baulk at the cost of participation.\nFor sure, some business deals get discussed. There may be opportunities for dialogue on the Middle East or the Doha round of trade talks. But there are opportunities aplenty elsewhere for such meetings \u2014 and in circumstances where the atmosphere is less party oriented.\nSo why does Davos continue to attract media attention far in excess of its real news value?\nThe answer, at least from this journalist, is that it is fun, a social event masquerading as hard work. Lots of good food and drink, a chance to catch up with old friends and perhaps meet some new ones. A bracing climate, isolated position and agreeable environment add to the charm. (When Davos moved to New York in 2002 in homage to 9/11 the atmosphere was lacking and it was more like a UN General Assembly meeting, complete with lousy food).\nYes, it would better to be in Davos than read about in Hong Kong. But let's stop pretending it is a major event for anyone other than the participants.",

The old design hung passively from the rubber ring, which could shift around and sometimes hurt; the new design has dots of adhesive foam that adhere to the vaginal walls, expanding with them during arousal.\n According to PATH, more than 90 percent of the couples were satisfied with the ease of use and comfort of the new condom, and 98 percent found the sensation of sex to be \u201cO.K. to very satisfactory.\u201d\n Nonetheless, progress is now stalled.\nPATH is seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration so the condom can be sold in the United States. And with the drug agency\u2019s approval, it would be much easier to license the condom in poor countries or get a World Health Organization endorsement.\n While the F.D.A. designates male condoms as Class 2 medical devices \u2014 meaning that a new maker has to pass tests only for leakage and bursting \u2014 it puts female condoms in Class 3, the same category as pacemakers, heart valves and silicone breast implants.\n That decision was made in 1999 \u2014 after much debate, and well after the condom was in use overseas \u2014 because there was no clinical data on the effectiveness of female condoms, and failure could be life-threatening if the woman\u2019s partner had AIDS. An advisory panel suggested not even calling it a \u201ccondom\u201d and instead labeled it an \u201cintravaginal pouch,\u201d but the agency rejected that advice.\n Names notwithstanding, the Class 3 listing means that any new design must pass clinical trials, which would cost $3 million to $6 million.\n \u201cThat\u2019s a huge, huge impediment, close to a 100 percent block, because no one\u2019s willing to put up that sort of money,\u201d Dr. Free said.\n The United States Agency for International Development, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Lemelson Foundation and others paid for design costs and prototypes, but they are not willing to pay for clinical trials and the cost of building a factory. Private investors have also balked because the American and European markets for the original design proved smaller than had been predicted.\n The failure of the original design \u2014 made by the Female Health Company of Chicago and marketed worldwide under names like FC1, Reality, Dominique, Femy and Protectiv \u2014 is still galling to AIDS experts.\n \u201cTheir use has remained frustratingly and tragically low,\u201d said Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of UNAids, the United Nations AIDS agency.\n In the 1990s, Mr. Warren, former director of international affairs for the Female Health Company, visited 24 countries trying to get the female condom accepted. Brazil, South Africa and Zimbabwe were the most receptive, said Mr. Warren, who now works on AIDS vaccines.\n \u201cIt had some elements of success,\u201d he said, \u201cbut hasn\u2019t had the blockbuster numbers the company had hoped for.\u201d\n But, as Ms. Chingandu noted, even in Zimbabwe, after an initial flurry of excitement from women, the condom settled into a niche: a tool of the sex trade.\n Whether the condom did well or poorly in a particular country, Mr. Warren said, was determined mostly by how it was introduced. Brazil\u2019s rollout order was for one million. Bangladesh, by contrast, tried to start with only 20,000. And Uganda bought one million but then did little marketing and no training in how to use it.\n \u201cPeople said, \u2018Oh, it failed,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWell, it didn\u2019t fail. It just wasn\u2019t available, or its introduction was a bad program. People need to practice with it before it catches on.\u201d\n He called the new design \u201ca better mousetrap\u201d but said it still faced another problem it shares with the original: it is expensive compared with male condoms.\n While those are made by simply dipping molds in latex, the female one uses complex thin-film polyurethane. The most closely related technology is that used for blood bags, so PATH is visiting companies that make them. \n But as Ms. Robertson noted, companies that make blood bags have little expertise in marketing sexual products.",

    "text": "'Poor' Calcutta\n2007-09-06T05:00:00.000Z\nCAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts \u2014 One morning in January 1997, I walked into my office at a nonprofit group here after a visit to my hometown, Calcutta. A very senior colleague, whom I would have, until then, characterized as being the \"sensitive\" sort, greeted me: \"Welcome back. And how is everyone in Calcutta - still starving and being looked after by Mother Teresa?\"\nAt first I thought this might be a bad attempt at humor, but I soon realized that my colleague was seriously inquiring about my city's suffering humanity and its ministering angel - the only images Calcutta evoked for him and countless others in the West.\nWhen Mother Teresa died eight months later, 10 years ago this week, foreign dignitaries and the Western news media descended on the city. The reports on the funeral portrayed a city filled with starving orphans, wretched slums and dying people abandoned on the streets, except for the fortunate ones rescued by Mother Teresa.\nThey described a city I didn't recognize as the place where I had spent the first 20 years of my life. There was no mention of Calcutta's beautiful buildings and educated middle class, or its history of religious tolerance and its vibrant literary and cultural life. Besides, other Indian cities also have their share of poverty, slums and destitution, as would be expected in a country where a third of the population lives on $1 a day - for example, more than half of Mumbai residents live in slums, far more than in Calcutta.\nWhy were they not equally damned in the eyes of the world?\nThe answer was that none of them served for seven decades as the adopted home base for a saintly European crusader whose work could succeed only if it was disproportionately magnified.\nIt was an instance of spin in which the news media colluded - voluntarily or not - with a religious figure who was as shrewd as any fund-raising politician, as is evident from the global expansion of her organization.\nFor Calcutta natives like me, however, Mother Teresa's charity also evoked the colonial past - she felt she knew what was best for the third world masses, whether it was condemning abortion or offering to convert those who were on the verge of death.\nAfter the funeral, I comforted myself with the possibility that Mother Teresa's death might redress the balance of perception.\nCalcutta, once called the second city of the British Empire, would again be seen as a pulsing metropolis of 14 million that has survived despite being twice slammed by huge influxes of refugees, once after the partition of 1947 and again during the Bangladesh war of independence in 1971.\nIn the absence of a missionary who had never allowed her compassion to be de-linked from Roman Catholic dogma, I hoped the world would recognize that Calcutta has not merely survived, it has battled tremendous odds without losing its soul.\nTen years and one beatification later, however, the relentless hagiography of the Catholic Church and the peculiar tunnel vision of the news media continue to equate Calcutta with the twinned entities of destitution and succor publicized by Mother Teresa.\nWith cultish fervor, her organization, the Missionaries of Charity, promotes her as an icon of mercy. Meanwhile, countless unheralded local organizations work for the needy without the glamour of a Nobel Prize or of impending sainthood.\nCharity need not be inconsistent with clarity. Calcutta is a modern Indian city where poverty and inequality coexist with measurably increasing prosperity, expanding opportunities, cautious optimism and, above all, pride in its unique character.\nMother Teresa might have meant well, but she furthered her mission by robbing Calcutta of its richly nuanced identity while pretending to love it.\n Chitrita Banerji is the author, most recently, of \"Eating India: An Odyssey Into the Food and Culture of the Land of Spices.\" ",

    "text": "A Top Chef\u2019s Kitchen Is Far Too Hot, Some Workers Say\n2007-01-17T05:00:00.000Z\nDANIEL BOULUD can\u2019t stand to see a detail out of place. As pans slam around him during dinner service in the Upper East Side restaurant that bears his first name, he will pause to request that a spoon be polished. How best to marry braised endive to seared beef can absorb him as utterly as the lilies in the dining room that haven\u2019t opened on schedule.\nHe\u2019s also a man who has cultivated the news media over his 23 years in New York. He is quick to get on the phone with a writer and can engineer a smart publicity move, like creating the world\u2019s most expensive hamburger, which won him worldwide attention in 2003. \nOutside the restaurant, Mr. Boulud is known for his generosity. Last year he helped raise nearly $2 million, much of it for Citymeals-on-Wheels, on whose board he sits. \nOn top of all that, Mr. Boulud is a social animal. His fellow four-star chefs would vote him the guy most likely to lead the conga line. \nIn short, he is a perfectionist who is accustomed to being liked. All of which helps explain why Mr. Boulud, 51, cannot grasp why a group of restaurant-worker advocates keep showing up outside Daniel with a 12-foot inflatable cockroach, singing \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d and chanting that he is a racist. \n\u201cRacism is a vicious charge,\u201d Mr. Boulud said in an interview. \u201cIt is too easy to accuse someone of that, and it is very hard to defend yourself.\u201d\nAnd yet Mr. Boulud is being forced to do just that. In December, seven current and former employees filed suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan accusing him of discrimination. Similar charges against Mr. Boulud are before the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \nAccording to the lawsuit, dining room workers at Daniel have been denied promotion because they were Latino or Bangladeshi. The employees also say that Mr. Boulud and other managers yelled racial slurs. At one point, they say, Spanish was banned among employees; only English and French were allowed. Those are examples, they say, of how the working culture at Daniel favors white Europeans at the expense of other groups. \nUntil recently Mr. Boulud has chosen not to speak publicly about the charges. He concedes that he could just settle out of court and make his headaches go away, but he said that would imply that he is guilty. \nMr. Boulud, a native of Lyon, France, holds up his own immigrant experience as a defense. He said he likes nothing more than to help young people who love the restaurant business move up the same way his mentors helped him.\n\u201cIt is a question of trust and evolution,\u201d he said.\nBut he has had enough of inflatable cockroaches and accusations. \u201cI want a judge to show me if I was wrong,\u201d he said.\nTo that end, he filed a suit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan accusing the group leading the protest, the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, or ROC, of defamation, nuisance and harassment, and of causing damage to his business. \nThe organization has shown up outside Daniel and a couple of his public events more than a dozen times, most recently Thursday night in observance of Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday. Managers have escorted customers into the restaurant with the sort of care that might be afforded women wearing furs near an animal-rights convention, and waiters have walked outside and staged impromptu counterdemonstrations, matching the protesters chant for chant. \nMr. Boulud first came in contact with the Restaurant Opportunities Center one evening in the fall of 2005, at the height of dinner service. About 40 members marched in and handed managers a letter demanding that he discuss their accusations or face a lawsuit and as much as $1.2 million in liabilities. \nBoth sides initially found common ground, but negotiations soon fell apart. It has been downhill since.\nGiven their role in an industry where very few workers are represented by unions, New York restaurant owners are watching the fight closely, with some offering off-the-record support as they worry that the organization will next turn its attention to them.\nWHATEVER the outcome, Mr. Boulud\u2019s headaches bring to light a common problem in high-end restaurants around the country. In an industry that relies largely on immigrants, just how difficult is it for workers who don\u2019t speak English as a first language to get ahead? And at what point does hiring someone to achieve a certain look or style in a restaurant turn into racism?\n \u201cThis is not a new issue,\u201d said Gerald A. Fernandez, the president of the Multicultural Foodservice and Hospitality Alliance and a director of the National Restaurant Association. \n\u201cSometimes the Europeans have been given a free pass,\u201d Mr. Fernandez said. \u201cThey\u2019re in this high-end restaurant doing very sophisticated food, and they\u2019ve kind of been under the covers on these issues. People haven\u2019t held them to the same standard like a T.G.I. Friday\u2019s or some other national chain that has had to take a hard look at this stuff.\u201d\nThe Restaurant Opportunities Center, a nonprofit group, sprang to life as a way to help Windows on the World restaurant workers who had a difficult time getting fair treatment after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Since then the group has dedicated itself to helping immigrants who face discrimination and poor working conditions in New York\u2019s restaurant business. Along with running Colors, a cooperative restaurant on Lafayette Street in Manhattan, it produces reports on working conditions and helped put together a restaurant training manual distributed by the city. \nBut it also uses the threat of lawsuits and bad publicity to make social change, a tactic it hopes to employ on top restaurants elsewhere in the country. \n\u201cIf people aren\u2019t going to see the value of change, they will see the consequences of not changing,\u201d said Saru Jayaraman, the Yale-educated lawyer who is the group\u2019s executive director.\nThe approach has worked before. In 2005, Ms. Jayaraman\u2019s organization got the Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group, which runs Cit\u00e9 and Park Avenue Cafe, to pay $164,000 to 23 workers who claimed that they were discriminated against because they were Mexican and that they were forced to work as many as 15 hours a week extra, without pay.\nWhether Mr. Boulud discriminates against workers because of their national origin is something the courts may have to decide. Interviews with more than a dozen former and present employees, some connected with the Restaurant Opportunities Center and others not, revealed a collection of stories that could support either side. \nSome workers offered what appeared to be clear examples of discrimination. Others said that workers who went to ROC were simply looking for a quick payout and didn\u2019t have the skills or motivation to be waiters at Daniel, one of the finest French restaurants in the country.\nJos\u00e9 Arenas, an immigrant from Mexico, is a plaintiff in the discrimination suit. He got a job in 2003 busing tables at Daniel, happy to have found a way finally to support his wife and two young children. His manager, he recalls, told him there would be opportunities for promotion, but Mr. Arenas said he was passed over for three jobs by French busers with less experience whom he had trained.\n\u201cSome nights I could not sleep, and I don\u2019t want other people to experience that same discrimination,\u201d said Mr. Arenas, who now works as a waiter at a Midtown restaurant he did not want to name.\nPeople who have left the restaurant voluntarily and are not connected with the Restaurant Opportunities Center offer two versions of life as an immigrant at Daniel. Miguel Albarado, an Ecuadorean who most recently worked at Le Bernardin, started as a buser at Daniel in 1999 and in four years worked his way up to a position as a waiter, when he left to start a Chinese buffet in Jersey City. He got back into fine dining with a job waiting tables at Le Bernardin and is now starting a restaurant in the Bronx. \nMr. Albarado said the suit was a misunderstanding.\n\u201cThere are people who are really motivated, and they get promoted,\u201d he said. \u201cThey build trust with the owners. Others are not motivated, and they don\u2019t get the trust.\u201d\nOthers say that verbal abuse and bias in the promotion system were so bad they had to get out.\nJohnny Parra was a waiter making about $70,000 a year until 2004, when she left to work at Alain Ducasse. She stopped working when that restaurant closed and she took time off for a sex change operation. Ms. Parra said she was spared the harassment that other Latinos complained of and was promoted ahead of workers who were perhaps better qualified, mainly because she was light-skinned. But she said she witnessed the problems, particularly in the kitchen.\n\u201cYou cannot even go in when Daniel was in there,\u201d she said. \u201cFrench guys would say to me: \u201cDon\u2019t go in the kitchen. He\u2019s cursing the Mexicans.\u2019 \u201d\nMR. BOULUD acknowledged that, like many of the country\u2019s best chefs, he has screamed in the kitchen, but he said he had not targeted any one group in his remarks.\n\u201cPeople change with time, and I think I have changed with time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I burst out it will last 10 seconds, and it is over. But I am fair. I have made an effort in the past few years to keep the kitchen serene.\u201d\nA manager did tell workers they shouldn\u2019t speak Spanish at the restaurant, but that was a mistake and was corrected the same week, said Brett Traussi, director of operations at the Dinex Group, which oversees Mr. Boulud\u2019s five restaurants and his catering company.\nThat\u2019s not to say Daniel is an easy place to work. It can be a tough and exacting environment.\n\u201cThis is not nursery school,\u201d said Michael Lawrence, assistant director of operations at Dinex, who is named as a defendant in the federal lawsuit. \u201cIt\u2019s equal-opportunity bite-your-head-off.\u201d\nStill, Mr. Boulud\u2019s operation offers great rewards to those who meet the challenge, he said. And Mr. Boulud himself can be very generous: he has lent money to employees who need it, including one of the plaintiffs in the suit.\nEven a buser can make more than $40,000 a year with benefits. Not everyone who starts as a buser or a runner can succeed at Daniel as a waiter, Mr. Lawrence said. The restaurant is about theater, about creating an environment in which diners will scramble for a reservation and the chance to pay $96 for three courses of food prepared by Mr. Boulud, who is in the kitchen almost every night. \nOn the floor, a waiter must dance a careful ballet of precise French-style service and be well versed in wine, cheese and French cuisine. He (and most often it is \u201che\u201d) has to be able to carve a chicken effortlessly at tableside while describing the differences between a Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9 and a Pouilly-Fum\u00e9. \nAnd because it is a French restaurant, Mr. Boulud wants to have plenty of French-speaking and French-trained waiters on the floor, some of whom he brings in from France, trains for a short time at lower-paying jobs and then promotes.\n(One night this month, four Hispanic men were waiting tables at Daniel. Three had been promoted from lounge waiter to dining room waiter after the onset of the protests, but Mr. Lawrence said there was no connection. \u201cIt was because they were ready,\u201d he said, adding that normally five Hispanic waiters are on duty.)\nLike many chefs, Suzanne Goin, the principal owner of Lucques and AOC in Los Angeles, handpicks waiters to achieve a certain feel in a restaurant, but she said she believed that any style of service could be learned no matter what a person\u2019s culture. And like many chefs, she has made it a point to have a staff that reflects the demographic makeup of the surrounding city. \nBut it wasn\u2019t always that way for her. When Ms. Goin worked at Campanile in Los Angeles some years ago, she worried how customers would react to the restaurant\u2019s first Mexican-born waiter. Managers worked to help him learn the wine and improve his pronunciation. She now makes that kind of training available to anyone who has the desire and intelligence to do the job.\n\u201cI think we should promote people worthy of being promoted, but you also can\u2019t get people of color on the floor who don\u2019t have skills or the language,\u201d she said.\nPhoebe Damrosch, a former waiter at Per Se who has just finished a book on the restaurant business called \u201cService Included,\u201d to be issued in the fall by William Morrow, said there is a thick glass ceiling in fine-dining rooms, both for women and for people who aren\u2019t white. \n\u201cThey always say, \u2018They\u2019re not ready,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Damrosch said. \u201cThat\u2019s always the phrase: \u2018She\u2019s not quite ready.\u2019 They always hide under wine knowledge.\u201d\nHer husband, Andr\u00e9 Mack, understands the problem managers face when trying to give customers what they want from service staff members. An African-American, he worked as a sommelier at Per Se before he left to start a wine business. \nDiners used to ask their waiter if they could see the sommelier, and when Mr. Mack showed up, would say, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re waiting for the sommelier to come by.\u201d Or they would confuse him with the other black man on the floor.\nBut he doesn\u2019t think that most fine restaurants discriminate. \n\u201cSome people might use it as an excuse to not promote people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in my experience if you had the right attitude and were willing to learn, it didn\u2019t matter what you looked like.\u201d\nTOM COLICCHIO, whose restaurant Craft has been cited by the Restaurant Opportunities Center as exemplary in promoting people of color, offers English classes for his staff, but said he doesn\u2019t spend a lot of extra time worrying about diversity.\n\u201cWe feel that if someone is ready for promotion, they get promoted,\u201d he said. \u201cSimple as that.\u201d \nSometimes it does take extra effort, though. Many Bangladeshi staff members at Gramercy Tavern, where Mr. Colicchio used to be the chef, had the potential to be excellent waiters, but were not familiar with wine because, as observant Muslims, they didn\u2019t drink it.\n Without extensive wine knowledge, they couldn\u2019t be sent onto the floor. For one particularly promising person, though, Mr. Colicchio found a solution. He made him a captain in the private dining room, where all the wine is ordered in advance.\nAs for Mr. Boulud\u2019s problem, Mr. Colicchio suggested more talking. He didn\u2019t condone the tactics of the Restaurant Opportunities Center, but he said that Mr. Boulud needed to sit down and talk with its representatives again.\n\u201cThere is no right or wrong here,\u201d he said. \u201cDaniel has a right to run his business the way he wants to run it. But sometimes we get so busy running our restaurants we don\u2019t listen to people. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative? Having a 12-foot cockroach in front of your restaurant?\u201d",

    "text": "Just the Thing to Carry Your Conscience In\n2007-07-18T04:00:00.000Z\nIF you are reading this anytime after dawn on Wednesday, you are probably too late to make a fashion statement and simultaneously keep the world safe from plastic bags. \nAt 8 this morning, 15 Whole Foods stores in the New York area were to start selling $15 cotton bags by Anya Hindmarch, a London designer better known for bags that range to $1,500 and beyond. The bags, which read \u201cI\u2019m not a plastic bag,\u201d are intended to be used and reused for groceries, in place of plastic. Whole Foods is selling 20,000, first come first served, limit three to a customer while supplies last. If offerings of the bag in other cities are any guide, the lines will be long.\nA stampede of would-be purchasers in Taiwan in June sent 30 people to the hospital and required the riot police. A similar outpouring in Hong Kong caused no injuries, but the police closed down the shopping mall. \u201cApparently they are not used to queuing,\u201d Ms. Hindmarch said last week from a hotel in Tokyo, where she had just finished the latest offering of her bag. To avoid more riots, future events in Southeast Asia will take place on the Internet.\nWhat started out as a small effort in London to reduce the number of biodegradable-resistant plastic bags that litter the landscape has become a wildly successful worldwide campaign. With 34 stores around the world and 20 more opening this year, Ms. Hindmarch knows that even if you can\u2019t interest people in a cause on moral or ethical grounds you can reach them by making the cause fashionable. \n\u201cTo create awareness you have to create scarcity by producing a limited edition,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate the idea of making the environment trendy, but you need to make it cool and then it becomes a habit.\u201d\nEven before Ms. Hindmarch\u2019s canvas tote became the talk of London, enough people were talking about plastic shopping bags that they qualified as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. In recent years, governments around the world have considered bans on them, and stores have found new tactics for weaning customers from them. \nMade from polyethylene, a petroleum product, the bags may take as long as 500 years to degrade. Meantime they hang from trees, catch on power lines, float on oceans and lakes and clog storm drains, killing birds, fish, turtles and sea mammals unfortunate enough to ingest them or become entangled in them. \nAmericans throw away 100 billion plastic bags a year, recycling less than 1 percent of them, according to the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research and advocacy group in Washington.\nSan Francisco is the first American city to ban the nonbiodegradable bags. Later this year, first supermarkets and then large chain pharmacies there will have to offer biodegradable and compostable bags. The drawback is that they are much more expensive than the nonrecyclables. \nAntibag bills are being considered in Boston; Baltimore; Annapolis, Md.; Portland, Ore.; and Santa Monica and Oakland, Calif.\nNew York City is in the early stages. As part of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d campaign, the city sponsors public service announcements telling people to use cloth bags for grocery shopping and to reuse plastic bags. \nCity Councilman Michael E. McMahon, the chairman of the council\u2019s sanitation and solid waste management committee, is from Staten Island, where he remembers the bags blowing all over from the Fresh Kills landfill, now closed. His committee is drafting a bill to require stores to take back plastic bags from customers. He hopes that in four or five years, people will be able to recycle them with their glass and paper.\nMost of the city\u2019s supermarket chains already offer reusable cloth bags for about $1. D\u2019Agostino plans to give away 20,000 at its 19 stores in New York City and Westchester in September. Whole Foods stores in the New York region sell a model printed with a retro honey logo. They also offer a discount of 10 cents to any shopper who returns a plastic bag to the store for reuse. \nFor all these efforts, though, the United States is far behind other parts of the world in addressing concerns about plastic bags. In places like South Africa, Zanzibar, Scandinavia and Uganda, the use of such bags has been reduced or eliminated by banning or taxing them, by charging for them in stores, by giving incentives to customers who provide their own bags and by selling inexpensive reusable bags made of recycled plastic or cloth.\nBy the end of the year the bags will be banned in Paris, and by 2010 in all of France. In Ireland, where the plastic bags are known as the national flag, they have cost 20 cents each, at the government\u2019s direction, since 2002; the fee has been credited with cutting bag use more than 90 percent. \nIn Uganda plastic bags are banned entirely. Bans, restrictions or incentives to switch to reusable bags are in place in towns and cities in Australia, India, Pakistan, Taiwan, Canada and Britain. Various restrictions or charges are in place in Japan, Germany, New Zealand, Bangladesh and Italy. For about a decade Scandinavian countries have charged for bags, whether plastic or paper. Last March Ikea began charging 5 cents for plastic bags in its stores in the United States.\nBut all those efforts are foolish, according to the Society of the Plastics Industry Inc., a trade group. \n\u201cMost of the legislation being proposed to ban or limit the use of plastic bags is misguided,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe problem is not plastic bags. The problem is behavioral \u2014 the human propensity to litter. The solution is for all of us to change our behavior and learn to reduce, reuse, recycle and properly dispose of plastic bags.\u201d \nThe statement also said the industry is investing in recycling facilities.\nLost in the criticism of plastic bags is the fact that paper bags have their own environmental cost, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, another research and advocacy group. By the council\u2019s reckoning, the plastic bags used in the United States each year require some 12 million barrels of oil to produce, and paper bags, 14 million trees. \n Even so, Ms. Hindmarch hasn\u2019t given up plastic bags entirely. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to put a smelly fish in a canvas bag,\u201d she said.\nAnyone reading this while standing in a bag line, beware: according to Ms. Hindmarch some Hong Kong bag-seekers who withstood the stampede but went away empty-handed planned to fly to New York to try again. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about the carbon footprint for that,\u201d she said. Or the trampled.\nIf money is no object, the disappointed can be made whole. As of midday yesterday more than 200 were for sale on eBay, some for more than $300.",

    "text": "Poor Calcutta\n2007-09-05T04:00:00.000Z\nCambridge, Mass.\nONE morning in January 1997, I walked into my office at a nonprofit group here after a visit to my hometown, Calcutta. A very senior colleague, whom I would have, until then, characterized as being the \u201csensitive\u201d sort, greeted me: \u201cWelcome back. And how is everyone in Calcutta \u2014 still starving and being looked after by Mother Teresa?\u201d \nAt first I thought this might be a bad attempt at humor, but I soon realized that my colleague was seriously inquiring about my city\u2019s suffering humanity and its ministering angel \u2014 the only images Calcutta evoked for him and countless others in the West. When Mother Teresa died eight months later, 10 years ago today, foreign dignitaries and the Western news media descended on the city. The reports on the funeral portrayed a city filled with starving orphans, wretched slums and dying people abandoned on the streets, except for the fortunate ones rescued by Mother Teresa. \nThey described a city I didn\u2019t recognize as the place where I had spent the first 20 years of my life. There was no mention of Calcutta\u2019s beautiful buildings and educated middle class, or its history of religious tolerance and its vibrant literary and cultural life. Besides, other Indian cities also have their share of poverty, slums and destitution, as would be expected in a country where a third of the population lives on $1 a day \u2014 for example, more than half of Mumbai residents live in slums, far more than in Calcutta. Why were they not equally damned in the eyes of the world? \nThe answer was that none of them served for seven decades as the adopted home base for a saintly European crusader whose work could succeed only if it was disproportionately magnified. It was an instance of spin in which the news media colluded \u2014 voluntarily or not \u2014 with a religious figure who was as shrewd as any fund-raising politician, as is evident from the global expansion of her organization. For Calcutta natives like me, however, Mother Teresa\u2019s charity also evoked the colonial past \u2014 she felt she knew what was best for the third world masses, whether it was condemning abortion or offering to convert those who were on the verge of death. \nAfter the funeral, I comforted myself with the possibility that Mother Teresa\u2019s death might redress the balance of perception. Calcutta, once called the second city of the British Empire, would again be seen as a pulsing metropolis of 14 million that has survived despite being twice slammed by huge influxes of refugees, once after the partition of 1947 and again during the Bangladesh war of independence in 1971. In the absence of a missionary who had never allowed her compassion to be de-linked from Catholic dogma, I hoped the world would recognize that Calcutta has not merely survived, it has battled tremendous odds without losing its soul. \nTen years and one beatification later, however, the relentless hagiography of the Catholic Church and the peculiar tunnel vision of the news media continue to equate Calcutta with the twinned entities of destitution and succor publicized by Mother Teresa. With cultish fervor, her organization, the Missionaries of Charity, promotes her as an icon of mercy. Meanwhile, countless unheralded local organizations work for the needy without the glamour of a Nobel Prize or of impending sainthood. \nCharity need not be inconsistent with clarity. Calcutta is a modern Indian city where poverty and inequality coexist with measurably increasing prosperity, expanding opportunities, cautious optimism and, above all, pride in its unique character. Mother Teresa might have meant well, but she furthered her mission by robbing Calcutta of its richly nuanced identity while pretending to love it. ",

    "text": "F.D.A. Tracked Poisoned Drugs, but Trail Went Cold in China\n2007-06-17T04:00:00.000Z\nAfter a drug ingredient from China killed dozens of Haitian children a decade ago, a senior American health official sent a cable to her investigators: find out who made the poisonous ingredient and why a state-owned company in China exported it as safe, pharmaceutical-grade glycerin.\nThe Chinese were of little help. Requests to find the manufacturer were ignored. Business records were withheld or destroyed. \nThe Americans had reason for alarm. \u201cThe U.S. imports a lot of Chinese glycerin and it is used in ingested products such as toothpaste,\u201d Mary K. Pendergast, then deputy commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration, wrote on Oct. 27, 1997. Learning how diethylene glycol, a syrupy poison used in some antifreeze, ended up in Haitian fever medicine might \u201cprevent this tragedy from happening again,\u201d she wrote.\n The F.D.A.\u2019s mission ultimately failed. By the time an F.D.A. agent visited the suspected manufacturer, the plant was shut down and Chinese companies said they bore no responsibility for the mass poisoning.\nTen years later it happened again, this time in Panama. Chinese-made diethylene glycol, masquerading as its more expensive chemical cousin glycerin, was mixed into medicine, killing at least 100 people there last year. And recently, Chinese toothpaste containing diethylene glycol was found in the United States and seven other countries, prompting tens of thousands of tubes to be recalled.\n The F.D.A.\u2019s efforts to investigate the Haiti poisonings, documented in internal F.D.A. memorandums obtained by The New York Times, demonstrate not only the intransigence of Chinese officials, but also the same regulatory failings that allowed a virtually identical poisoning to occur 10 years later. The cases further illustrate what happens when nations fail to police the global pipeline of pharmaceutical ingredients.\nIn Haiti and Panama, the poison was traced to Chinese chemical companies not certified to make pharmaceutical ingredients. State-owned exporters then shipped the toxic syrup to European traders, who resold it without identifying the previous owner \u2014 an attempt to keep buyers from bypassing them on future orders.\nAs a result, most of the buyers did not know that the ingredient came from China, known for producing counterfeit products, nor did they show much interest in finding out.\nChina itself was a victim of diethylene glycol poisoning last year when at least 18 people died after ingesting poisonous medicine made there. In the wake of the deaths, and reports of pet food and other products contaminated with dangerous ingredients from China, officials there announced that they would overhaul the regulation of food, drugs and chemicals.\nBeyond the three incidents linked to Chinese diethylene glycol, there have been at least five other mass poisonings involving the mislabeled chemical in the past two decades \u2014 in Bangladesh, Nigeria, Argentina and twice in India.\n \u201cThis problem keeps coming back,\u201d said Dr. Joshua G. Schier, a toxicologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And no wonder: the counterfeiters are rarely identified, much less prosecuted.\nFinding a way to keep diethylene glycol out of medicine, particularly in developing countries, has confounded health officials for decades. \u201cIt is preventable and we have to figure out some way of stopping this from happening again,\u201d said Carol Rubin, a senior C.D.C. official. \nIn a global economy, ingredients for drugs are often bought and sold many times in different countries, sometimes without proper paperwork, all of which increases the risk of fraud, the authorities say. \nThe Panama poison passed through five hands, the Haitian poison six. In both cases, the factory\u2019s original certificate of analysis, attesting to the contents of the shipment and its provenance, did not accompany the product as it moved around the world. \n\u201cWhere there is a loophole in the system, a frailty in the system, it\u2019s the ability of an unscrupulous distributor to take industrial or technical material and pass it off as pharmaceutical grade,\u201d said Kevin J. McGlue, a board member of the International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council.\nUncovering that deception can be difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to get anyone to do the trace-backs,\u201d said Dr. Michael L. Bennish, co-author of a 1995 medical journal article on a poisoning epidemic in Bangladesh.\nOne reason, Dr. Bennish said, is the clout of local manufacturers. \u201cWe tried to follow up as amateur Sherlocks, investigators, but you don\u2019t go down to the wholesale market and ask questions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are going to get your fingers burnt.\u201d\nA Crisis in Haiti\nBy the end of June 1996, the F.D.A. knew it might have an international crisis on its hands. A poison had found its way into fever syrup in Haiti, and the F.D.A. wanted to know if more of the same might be heading to the United States or, for that matter, to any other country. But to learn that, the agency needed to find the manufacturer. \nThis was not just any poison. Virtually every young poisoning victim who showed up at the main hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti\u2019s capital, died.\n Labeled pharmaceutical-grade glycerin, the toxic syrup was mixed into thousands of bottles of fever medicine. For months, parents gave it to children, then watched them die, in agony, from kidney failure. No one suspected the medicine until much later. \nOfficially, at least 88 children died, nearly half under the age of 2. But those 88 were only the ones doctors remembered or for whom hospital records could be found. \nThe F.D.A. traced the poison to a German broker, Chemical Trading and Consulting, but the company\u2019s records were not much help. \u201cThey cannot trace glycerine lots to their manufacturer,\u201d David Pulham, an F.D.A. investigator, wrote on June 30, 1996.\n Chemical Trading had arranged for a Dutch company, Vos B.V., to sell 72 barrels of the suspect syrup to Haiti, records show. The agency dispatched an investigator, Ann deMarco, who made an unsettling discovery: sitting in Vos\u2019s warehouse near Rotterdam were 66 more barrels labeled glycerin, all containing lethal concentrations of diethylene glycol. \n\u201cSome of this second shipment has been sold,\u201d Ms. deMarco wrote in a memorandum on July 4, 1996. Although the missing barrels had gone to an industrial user, not a drug maker, the F.D.A.\u2019s worries grew. \nMs. deMarco learned that another broker, Metall-Chemie, a German trader, had arranged for Vos to buy the barrels from Sinochem International Chemicals Company, a giant exporter in Beijing owned by the Chinese government.\nBut Metall-Chemie also did not know the manufacturer, and one of its officials predicted that the F.D.A. would have trouble finding that out. \u201cIt is difficult to get any information from Chinese traders,\u201d Ms. deMarco wrote.\n More complete shipping records would have identified who made the poison. But in this case, records provided few clues.\n\u201cThe original source of the material had been obliterated on documents and product containers,\u201d Ms. deMarco wrote to senior F.D.A. officials. \u201cOne trader referred to this practice as \u2018neutralization.\u2019 I was advised that neutralization is a common practice among traders in order to protect their business interests.\u201d\n With no paper trail, American officials turned to Sinochem for help. \n Initially, they took an indirect approach. In July 1996, the American Embassy in China contacted the company and asked for a list of Chinese glycerin makers, without saying that it was investigating the Haiti poisonings. Sinochem, however, \u201cwould not reveal the names of actual manufacturers in order to prevent the prospective foreign customer from bypassing Sinochem,\u201d an embassy official reported to Washington. \nIn early August, American officials asked Sinochem representatives specifically about the origin of the Haiti poison. \u201cThey want to investigate further and were unable (or unwilling) to give the name of the manufacturer at this time,\u201d the officials reported. \nFederal investigators sought help from senior Chinese drug regulators, who promised to help find the manufacturer, but said it \u201cwill take time,\u201d records show.\n When another month passed without any word from either regulators or Sinochem, the embassy tried again. Chinese regulators said they had done nothing to find the factory, according to a confidential State Department telegram from September 1996. \nSinochem did finally offer the manufacturer\u2019s name: the Tianhong Fine Chemicals Factory in the city of Dalian in northeastern China. But Sinochem \u201crefused\u201d to provide an address, saying it was illegible. A telephone number would have to suffice, it said. \nThat, too, was unproductive. When American investigators called the plant manager, Zhang Gang, they were told he was not available. Send a fax, they were told. That did not work either. \u201cThe phone was always busy,\u201d investigators reported.\nFinally, they got Mr. Zhang on the phone, but he, too, refused to give out his factory\u2019s address. He said that tests had found no signs of diethylene glycol, adding that \u201cthere had been no cases in China of poisoning resulting from the ingestion\u201d of glycerin contaminated by diethylene glycol, investigators wrote.\nAfter months of trying to trace the poison to its source, United States investigators were at a dead end.\n\u201cThe Chinese officials we contacted on this matter were all reluctant to become involved,\u201d a State Department official wrote in late September 1996, saying that drug regulators and the plant manager had insisted on communicating only on the telephone \u201cto avoid leaving a paper trail.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWe cannot be optimistic about our chances for success in tracking down the other possible glycerine shipments.\u201d \nThe following May, Mr. Pulham, who was part of the original F.D.A. investigative team in Haiti, tried to revive the investigation. \u201cIs it possible to block-list all Chinese pharmaceutical products until we gain cooperation?\u201d he asked.\nThe suggestion went nowhere. Five months later, Ms. Pendergast of the F.D.A. wrote her memorandum, imploring investigators to keep digging.\n\u201cChina is turning into one of the major bulk pharmaceutical producers in the world,\u201d she wrote. \u201cUnless they have an open, transparent and predictable system for dealing with problems and other countries, it is going to be rough sledding in the years ahead.\u201d\nOn Nov. 17, 1997, federal investigators once again questioned Sinochem officials. They denied any wrongdoing, saying that two certificates of analysis showed that the suspect shipment was safe, pharmaceutical-grade syrup. But when the F.D.A. asked to see them, Sinochem refused. \n \u201cThe officials were not willing to explain why they could not provide the copies,\u201d an American official reported at the time.\nChen Liusuo, who handled the glycerin sales, strongly disputed the F.D.A.\u2019s account. In an interview with The Times, Mr. Chen said Sinochem cooperated. \u201cWe gave them everything they wanted,\u201d Mr. Chen said, adding that the agency was satisfied.\n\u201cThe product we sold was glycerin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt passed through three or four companies after us. To find the problem you need to look at every link in the supply chain.\u201d\nA Chinese government official familiar with the F.D.A.\u2019s inquiries said the Americans\u2019 frustration might have stemmed from their misunderstanding about who regulated chemical companies, which led them to seek help from the wrong officials. \u201cThis was a truly tragic event, and we expressed our sadness and sympathy,\u201d said the official, who asked not to be identified.\nAt the end of 1997, a year and a half after the F.D.A. began tracing the poisonous shipments, one of its investigators, Ted Sze, finally got inside the Tianhong chemical plant in Dalian. But glycerin was no longer made there, and Mr. Sze had no records to inspect. The plant manager, Mr. Zhang, told investigators that he had received no complaints about his products and that his company had not produced the poison.\nMr. Sze, now retired from the F.D.A., said in an interview that he had no choice but to accept the manager\u2019s word and clear the company of wrongdoing. \u201cBy the time I went there, the plant was already shut down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe agency can only do so much.\u201d\nThe Experts\u2019 Recommendations\n The United States may not have gotten what it wanted from China, but the Haiti crisis did bring together health groups to search for ways to stop diethylene glycol poisonings. At a workshop in Washington in February 1997, health experts recommended that certificates of analysis be improved to allow users to \u201ctrace the product back through every intermediary, broker and repackager to the original manufacturer.\u201d\nThe workshop participants also called for better testing of drug ingredients and asked governments to tighten oversight of drug manufacturing. \nThe next year, the World Health Organization offered many of the same recommendations. And a 1998 article in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, warned that failure to strictly follow the guidelines could cause poisonings \u201ceven in countries where quality control procedures are usually strictly applied.\u201d \nMuch of this had been said before, yet the poisonings have continued. \nJust as the JAMA article was being published, three dozen children began dying of acute renal failure at two hospitals in Delhi, India. A local drug maker had unwittingly mixed diethylene glycol into acetaminophen syrup, much as the Haitian pharmacist had.\nThe drug maker was prosecuted, but according to interviews and government records no progress had been made in identifying the supplier of the poison. \n\u201cMy experience as an investigator tells me that many of these things will not be proven,\u201d said Dr. M. Venkateswarlu, the drug controller general of India.\n Finding counterfeiters often means pursuing leads across foreign borders, and no international authority has the power to do that. Dr. Howard Zucker, who helps to oversee drug issues for the W.H.O., said individual countries must conduct their own trace-back investigations.\nBut if the United States could not do that on behalf of Haiti, poorer, less influential nations would have little chance of tracking down counterfeiters.\nAfter the Haiti poisoning, a more accurate, less expensive test for diethylene glycol was developed, but last year\u2019s case in Panama shows that suppliers and governments do not always use it. \nAnd as long as counterfeiters do not fear prosecution, the poisonings are likely to continue, experts say.\nDr. Mohammed Hanif, a prominent physician in Dhaka, Bangladesh, said the foreign suppliers of diethylene glycol were never prosecuted for the deaths of thousands of children from 1982 to 1992. \u201cThe traumatizing memories of those days still torment me,\u201d said Dr. Hanif, who wrote a paper about the deaths from toxic medicine.\nIn Argentina, a court official said no one had been prosecuted for supplying the diethylene glycol that ended up in a health supplement, killing 29 people in 1992. \nDavid Mishael, a Miami lawyer, knows the difficulty of assigning blame in these deaths. For 10 years, Mr. Mishael has unsuccessfully pursued legal claims in the United States and Europe against European traders that helped to arrange the shipment of toxic syrup to Haiti. \u201cYou can imagine the cost,\u201d said Mr. Mishael, who is representing Haitian parents whose children died from the fever medicine. \nHe said Dutch authorities assessed a $250,000 fine against Vos, which tested the counterfeit syrup, found it impure and did not alert anyone in Haiti. But given how many died, he called the size of the fine \u201ca joke.\u201d A lawyer who represents Vos, Jeffrey B. Shapiro, declined to comment. \nA few children survived after being flown to the United States by humanitarian groups. One of them, Faika Jean, was 2 months old at the time and nearly died en route. Now 11, she has learning disabilities as a result of the poisoning, said her father, Wislin Jean. \nMs. Pendergast, now a private lawyer and consultant, said China had the most to answer for. \u201cEverybody else is just reacting to initial failures,\u201d she said. \u201cIt needs to take steps to protect not just its own consumers but also consumers all around the world.\u201d\nAfter The Times reported in May that the Panama poison had been made and exported by Chinese companies as 99.5 percent pure glycerin, Chinese regulators said they would reopen their investigation of the incident. Three weeks later, the officials acknowledged some \u201cmisconduct\u201d in how Chinese companies labeled the toxic syrup.\nBut most of the blame, they said, rested with a Panamanian importer who changed the paperwork to make the syrup look safer than it actually was. \nThe F.D.A. disagrees, saying the deception began with Chinese companies falsely labeling a poisonous product glycerin. \u201cIf the drums had been 99.5 percent glycerin, the deaths in Panama would never have occurred,\u201d the F.D.A. said in a statement.\nA Dissatisfied Customer\nThe F.D.A.\u2019s Haiti investigation never did find more counterfeit glycerin from China, despite a global hunt. But its concerns, it turns out, were not unfounded. \nIn 1995, the same year babies began to die in Haiti, 284 barrels of a chemical labeled glycerin arrived in New York on container ships. Although the chemical was not intended for use in drugs, it was labeled 98 percent pure. An official with the company that bought the barrels, Dastech International, of Great Neck, N.Y., would later say, \u201cIt smelled like glycerin, it looked like glycerin.\u201d But after one of its customers complained, Dastech took a closer look. \nAlthough the chemical was labeled 98 percent pure glycerin, Dastech said in court records that the syrup actually contained sugar compounds \u2014 as well as diethylene glycol. \nThe exporter was Sinochem. Claiming that it was fleeced, Dastech tried to get its money back from the broker who arranged the sale, court records show.\nIt never did.",

    "text": "Daniel Boulud, chef, fights racism charges - Travel & Dining - International Herald Tribune\n2007-01-18T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW YORK \u2014 Daniel Boulud can't stand to see a detail out of place. As pans slam around him during dinner service in the Upper East Side restaurant that bears his first name, he will pause to request that a spoon be polished. How best to marry braised endive to seared beef can absorb him as utterly as the lilies in the dining room that haven't opened on schedule.\nHe's also a man who has cultivated the news media over his 23 years in New York. He is quick to get on the phone with a writer and can engineer a smart publicity move, like creating the world's most expensive hamburger, which won him worldwide attention in 2003.\nOutside the restaurant, Boulud is known for his generosity. Last year he helped raise nearly $2 million, much of it for Citymeals-on-Wheels, on whose board he sits.\nOn top of all that, Boulud is a social animal. His fellow chefs would vote him the guy most likely to lead the conga line.\nIn short, he is a perfectionist who is accustomed to being liked. All of which helps explain why Boulud, 51, cannot grasp why a group of restaurant-worker advocates keep showing up outside Daniel with a 12- foot, or 3.5 meter, inflatable cockroach, singing \"We Shall Overcome\" and chanting that he is a racist.\n\"Racism is a vicious charge,\" Boulud said in an interview. \"It is too easy to accuse someone of that, and it is very hard to defend yourself.\"\nAnd yet Boulud is being forced to do just that. In December, seven current and former employees filed suit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan accusing him of discrimination. Similar charges against Boulud are before the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nAccording to the lawsuit, dining room workers at Daniel have been denied promotion because they were Latino or Bangladeshi. The employees also say that Boulud and other managers yelled racial slurs.\nAt one point, they say, Spanish was banned among employees; only English and French were allowed. Those are examples, they say, of how the working culture at Daniel favors white Europeans at the expense of other groups.\nUntil recently Boulud had chosen not to speak publicly about the charges. He concedes that he could just settle out of court and make his headaches go away, but he said that would imply that he is guilty.\nBoulud, a native of Lyon, France, holds up his own immigrant experience as a defense. He said he liked nothing more than to help young people who love the restaurant business move up the same way his mentors helped him. \"It is a question of trust and evolution,\" he said.\nBut he has had enough of inflatable cockroaches and accusations. \"I want a judge to show me if I was wrong,\" he said. To that end, he filed a lawsuit in the trial-level State Supreme Court in Manhattan accusing the group leading the protest, the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, of defamation, nuisance and harassment, and of causing damage to his business.\nThe organization has shown up outside Daniel and at a couple of his public events more than a dozen times.\nGiven their role in an industry where very few workers are represented by unions, New York restaurant owners are watching the fight closely.\nThe Restaurant Opportunities Center has dedicated itself to helping immigrants who face discrimination and poor working conditions in New York's restaurant business.\nBut it also uses the threat of lawsuits and bad publicity to make social change, a tactic it hopes to employ on top restaurants elsewhere in the country.\n\"If people aren't going to see the value of change, they will see the consequences of not changing,\" said Saru Jayaraman, the Yale-educated lawyer who is the group's executive director.\nBoulud acknowledged that, like many of the country's best chefs, he has screamed in the kitchen, but he said he had not targeted any one group in his remarks.\n\"People change with time, and I think I have changed with time,\" he said. \"If I burst out, it will last 10 seconds, and it is over. But I am fair. I have made an effort in the past few years to keep the kitchen serene.\"\nA manager did tell workers they shouldn't speak Spanish at the restaurant, but that was a mistake and was corrected the same week, said Brett Traussi, director of operations at the Dinex Group, which oversees Boulud's five restaurants and his catering company.\nThat's not to say Daniel is an easy place to work. It can be a tough and exacting environment.\n\"This is not nursery school,\" said Michael Lawrence, assistant director of operations at Dinex, who is named as a defendant in the federal lawsuit. \"It's equal-opportunity bite-your-head-off.\"\nStill, Boulud's operation offers great rewards to those who meet the challenge, he said. And Boulud himself can be very generous: he has lent money to employees who need it, including one of the plaintiffs in the suit.\nEven a buser can make more than $40,000 a year with benefits. Not everyone who starts as a buser or a runner can succeed at Daniel as a waiter, Lawrence said. The restaurant is about theater, about creating an environment in which diners will scramble for a reservation and the chance to pay $96 for three courses of food prepared by Boulud, who is in the kitchen almost every night.\nBecause it is a French restaurant, Boulud wants to have plenty of French-speaking and French-trained waiters on the floor, some of whom he brings in from France, trains for a short time at lower-paying jobs and then promotes.",

    "text": "Cricket: Heavyweight clash opens last eight\n2007-03-26T05:00:00.000Z\nHost versus title holder is one of the great clashes of any competition, a game with which World Cup organizers in many sports have been wont to launch their tournaments. So the meeting Tuesday of West Indies and Australia in Antigua is the perfect start to the second stage of the World Cup, the Super Eights.\nBy the time this phase concludes on April 21 each team will have played the other - six matches to add to the one against the other qualifier from its preliminary pool. The top four go through to the semifinals.\nLike the short, sharp pool stage that made almost every match matter, this is an improvement over previous Cup formats. The idea that each qualifier for the second stage should play all the others was used in 1999 and 2003. There, though, it was merely a Super Six - and a longer first stage meant each team had already played two of the other five teams in the final half dozen. Some arrived with two victories, already on the verge of the semifinals. Others started a single defeat from elimination.\nThis time nobody has more than a single point advantage or deficit, so all the games over the next three and a half weeks should be important.\nThe venues have changed. The tournament has left Jamaica, Trinidad, St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Lucia and moved to Antigua and Guyana, which will stage the first dozen matches between now and April 9. Then the play moves to Grenada and Barbados.\nWest Indies against Australia would be compelling under any circumstances. It is an appropriate international debut for the new, 20,000-capacity Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. The ground is named for Antigua's greatest cricketer, whose brilliant fielding was instrumental in turning the first World Cup final - played by these two sides at Lord's Ground in London in 1975 - in favor of West Indies.\nThey are two of the four unbeaten sides from the pool stage - the other two, Sri Lanka and New Zealand, meet April 12. They were also the finalists in world cricket's most recent test of one-day strength, the Champions Trophy played late last year. Australia won that meeting in Mumbai by eight wickets after the West Indies batting fell apart.\nAustralia looked like an irresistible force as it ticked off one of the few gaps on its r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Then came a run of defeats to New Zealand and England that knocked it out of first place in the world rankings and, more importantly, punctured its aura of invincibility.\nHow much it has recuperated is unclear. Even when struggling, it would have expected to have stomped Ireland and the Netherlands unmercifully, as it did in the first round. There was, though, a distinct sense of regained menace in its 83-run victory over South Africa on Saturday.\nMatthew Hayden launched a huge total by reaching 100 faster than anyone else in World Cup history and the momentum was maintained as Australia scored 377.\nThere was no panic when South Africa replied by blasting away at the start of its innings, and the Proteas eventually crumbled under the pressure of the chase.\nThe West Indian pool matches were more challenging, starting with its opening day victory over Pakistan in what now seems another age. It has bowled well, with Daren Powell's pace providing a cutting edge, but has not yet needed anything special from its two most dangerous batsmen - skipper Brian Lara, already guaranteed cricketing immortality, and hard-hitting opener Chris Gayle, whose partner Shivnarine Chanderpaul batted beautifully against Ireland.\nWe will know more about West Indies' title credentials by the end of the week as it faces the other three unbeaten teams in rapid succession.\nNew Zealand is next up on Thursday, followed by the formidable-looking Sri Lankans in Guyana on Sunday. Win all three and West Indies will be all but through to the semifinals. It risks losing form through inactivity over the following two and a half weeks. It plays South Africa on April 10, before finishing with a burst of two matches in little over 48 hours against Bangladesh and England.\nThe tournament desperately needs a source of good cheer.

    "text": "Cricket: Heavyweight clash opens last eight\n2007-03-26T05:00:00.000Z\nHost versus title holder is one of the great clashes of any competition, a game with which World Cup organizers in many sports have been wont to launch their tournaments. So the meeting Tuesday of West Indies and Australia in Antigua is the perfect start to the second stage of the World Cup, the Super Eights.\nBy the time this phase concludes on April 21 each team will have played the other - six matches to add to the one against the other qualifier from its preliminary pool. The top four go through to the semifinals.\nLike the short, sharp pool stage that made almost every match matter, this is an improvement over previous Cup formats. The idea that each qualifier for the second stage should play all the others was used in 1999 and 2003. There, though, it was merely a Super Six - and a longer first stage meant each team had already played two of the other five teams in the final half dozen. Some arrived with two victories, already on the verge of the semifinals. Others started a single defeat from elimination.\nThis time nobody has more than a single point advantage or deficit, so all the games over the next three and a half weeks should be important.\nThe venues have changed. The tournament has left Jamaica, Trinidad, St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Lucia and moved to Antigua and Guyana, which will stage the first dozen matches between now and April 9. Then the play moves to Grenada and Barbados.\nWest Indies against Australia would be compelling under any circumstances. It is an appropriate international debut for the new, 20,000-capacity Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. The ground is named for Antigua's greatest cricketer, whose brilliant fielding was instrumental in turning the first World Cup final - played by these two sides at Lord's Ground in London in 1975 - in favor of West Indies.\nThey are two of the four unbeaten sides from the pool stage - the other two, Sri Lanka and New Zealand, meet April 12. They were also the finalists in world cricket's most recent test of one-day strength, the Champions Trophy played late last year. Australia won that meeting in Mumbai by eight wickets after the West Indies batting fell apart.\nAustralia looked like an irresistible force as it ticked off one of the few gaps on its r\u00e8sum\u00e8. Then came a run of defeats to New Zealand and England that knocked it out of first place in the world rankings and, more importantly, punctured its aura of invincibility.\nHow much it has recuperated is unclear. Even when struggling, it would have expected to have stomped Ireland and the Netherlands unmercifully, as it did in the first round. There was, though, a distinct sense of regained menace in its 83-run victory over South Africa on Saturday.\nMatthew Hayden launched a huge total by reaching 100 faster than anyone else in World Cup history and the momentum was maintained as Australia scored 377.\nThere was no panic when South Africa replied by blasting away at the start of its innings, and the Proteas eventually crumbled under the pressure of the chase.\nThe West Indian pool matches were more challenging, starting with its opening day victory over Pakistan in what now seems another age. It has bowled well, with Daren Powell's pace providing a cutting edge, but has not yet needed anything special from its two most dangerous batsmen - skipper Brian Lara, already guaranteed cricketing immortality, and hard-hitting opener Chris Gayle, whose partner Shivnarine Chanderpaul batted beautifully against Ireland.\nWe will know more about West Indies' title credentials by the end of the week as it faces the other three unbeaten teams in rapid succession.\nNew Zealand is next up on Thursday, followed by the formidable-looking Sri Lankans in Guyana on Sunday. Win all three and West Indies will be all but through to the semifinals. It risks losing form through inactivity over the following two and a half weeks. It plays South Africa on April 10, before finishing with a burst of two matches in little over 48 hours against Bangladesh and England.\nThe tournament desperately needs a source of good cheer. It is hard to imagine a better one than the host getting off to a decent start as it begins its run for the final four.\nVideo of Woolmer hotel reviewed\nSecurity video from the hotel where the Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer was strangled may contain images of the killer or killers, the authorities said, The Associated Press reported from Kingston, Jamaica.\nDeputy Police Commissioner Mark Shields said the video showed only the corridors at the end of Woolmer's floor in the Pegasus Hotel, not the door to his room or others.\n\"But at least it will give us a good indication of who went on those floors,\" Shield said Sunday.\nThe 58-year-old coach was found dead in his room March 18, a day after his team lost to Ireland in the World Cup. The humiliating defeat forced Pakistan's elimination\nThe police have not identified any suspects. The authorities said there was no sign of forced entry, suggesting Woolmer likely knew the killer or killers.\nThe Pakistan team left the island Saturday, hours after three members of the delegation were re-questioned. The police had earlier fingerprinted and taken DNA samples from all team members.\n\"This is an extraordinary investigation in that many of the potential witnesses are leaving the island,\" Shields said.\nShields said the police planned to interview more possible witnesses and were awaiting results of DNA and toxicology tests.

    "text": "Big corporations try to tap a market they have ignored\n2007-06-04T05:00:00.000Z\nJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The world's biggest corporations are scrambling to tap a market they have largely ignored for decades - the world's four billion poor people.\nFrom South Africa to Brazil, companies like Danone and Unilever sell individual packets of yogurt and soap in rural villages and urban open-air markets. In the telecommunications sector, the biggest growth area is among the poor, who are snapping up cellphones.\nSome 60 percent of the world's population exists on less than $2 a day. Previously shunted aside as lacking purchasing power, they are now regarded as a buoyant growth market.\n\"We have to get away from thinking of the poor as a problem,\" said C.K. Prahalad, author of the book \"The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid.\"\n\"Part of the problem is that people have not had a full understanding of the size of the opportunity,\" he said in a recent presentation in Johannesburg.\nPrahalad, a business consultant and professor at the University of Michigan, said the purchasing power of poor people seemed small expressed in dollars, but carries more clout in emerging market economies, where goods cost less.\nThe world's four billion poor are estimated to have $5 trillion of annual purchasing power parity, a measure that tries to translate local buying strength into another currency based on common goods.\nPrahalad sees the move by big firms as a win-win situation, with companies increasing sales while low-income consumers get access to low-cost, quality goods and new technology.\nTo tap the market, though, innovation is the key. Firms have to develop new, affordable products and devise novel ways of selling them.\nIn India, where the trend got off the ground several years ago, the local unit of the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever developed a detergent that requires less water for poor rural customers.\nThe unit, Hindustan Lever, also put together a rural selling network, Shakti (meaning \"strength\"), which employs about 31,000 women to sell soap, shampoo, detergent and other products door-to-door in more than 100,000 villages.\n\"Rural consumers' incomes are rising, and for a consumer goods company, women are at the heart of what we do,\" a spokesman for Lever said.\nWhile Unilever has rolled out its Shakti model of direct selling in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Mozambique, other firms are also seeking to duplicate Unilever's model.\nIn Brazil, the Swiss food group Nestl\u00e9 opened a factory this year to produce small packets of powdered milk, biscuits and coffee to be sold door-to-door or in small shops.\nIn South Africa, the French food group Danone and a local dairy group, Clover, have started a project selling individual pots of vitamin-enriched Danimal yogurt for 1 rand, or 14 cents, by a network of women in townships.\nDanone created a new business model, set up a new distribution network and promoted the product in schools with a show that teaches the benefits of nutrition.\n\"We also wanted to cut out as much as possible any kind of middleman to make the product really affordable to the end consumer. If this product was to go into the normal chain, it would never cost 1 rand,\" said Maria Pretorius, a Danone marketing manager.\nIt recruited women like Joyce Daka, 50, who was struggling to survive in Orange Farm, a sprawling township west of Johannesburg. Now she is a thriving entrepreneur earning around 2,000 rand, or $287, per month.\n\"In the morning I go house to house, and then in the afternoon I find a busy spot,\" said Daka, sitting under a yellow Danone umbrella in her brightly colored Danimal T-shirt.\nOn a busy day she can sell over 700 pots of yogurt, but the average is around half of that. The saleswomen keep a profit of 20 South African cents from each yogurt pot they sell.\n\"It's made a huge difference in my situation,\" said Daka, who is taking care of two orphaned relatives in addition to her own children.\nAfter less than two years, sales by volume of the new low-cost product, so far only rolled out in the Johannesburg area, are outstripping some of the firm's major national brands.\nThe trend has spread into a host of other sectors, ranging from banking to medicine.\nIn India, the Aravind Eye Care System made cataract operations affordable to the masses by slashing the cost to the equivalent of $50 to $300 compared with $2,500 in the United States. It now is the largest eye care facility in the world, performing 200,000 operations a year.\nIn Kenya, Equity Bank was created to provide low-cost bank accounts for people who could not afford traditional services and has become so profitable it listed on the Nairobi stock exchange last year. Earnings per share more than doubled last year.\nIn Mexico, Banco Azteca specializes in giving loans to Mexicans who do not have formal jobs, like street stall owners, or to people whose earnings come largely from tips, like bartenders.\nThe bank, linked to the retailer Elektra, has been so successful that Wal-Mart de Mexico and other supermarket chains in Mexico are planning to start similar operations.\nIn the telecommunications sector, low-income markets are driving growth for mobile phone operators, which are rolling out services throughout the emerging world.\nIn Africa, where companies are rushing to erect base stations in isolated rural areas, cellphone penetration is just 15 percent but is growing fast.\nThe spread of cellphones among the poor is not only fattening profits, but opening up opportunities as farmers check international grain prices and craft makers contact customers.\nThe trend is helping to boost economic growth in emerging markets.\n\"What I think we need to recognize is the multinational company or the large local company which is providing these services is creating consumption and livelihood simultaneously,\" Prahalad said.\n\"This is also changing people's lives, they're increasing their livelihoods as micro producers.\"",

    "text": "Useful Mutants, Bred With Radiation\n2007-08-28T04:00:00.000Z\nVIENNA \u2014 Pierre Lagoda pulled a small container from his pocket and spilled the contents onto his desk. Four tiny dice rolled to a stop.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what nature does,\u201d Dr. Lagoda said. The random results of the dice, he explained, illustrate how spontaneous mutations create the genetic diversity that drives evolution and selective breeding.\nHe rolled the dice again. This time, he was mimicking what he and his colleagues have been doing quietly around the globe for more than a half-century \u2014 using radiation to scramble the genetic material in crops, a process that has produced valuable mutants like red grapefruit, disease-resistant cocoa and premium barley for Scotch whiskey.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing the same thing,\u201d he said, still toying with the dice. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything different from what nature does. I\u2019m not using anything that was not in the genetic material itself.\u201d\nDr. Lagoda, the head of plant breeding and genetics at the International Atomic Energy Agency, prides himself on being a good salesman. It can be a tough act, however, given wide public fears about the dangers of radiation and the risks of genetically manipulated food. His work combines both fields but has nonetheless managed to thrive.\nThe process leaves no residual radiation or other obvious marks of human intervention. It simply creates offspring that exhibit new characteristics.\nThough poorly known, radiation breeding has produced thousands of useful mutants and a sizable fraction of the world\u2019s crops, Dr. Lagoda said, including varieties of rice, wheat, barley, pears, peas, cotton, peppermint, sunflowers, peanuts, grapefruit, sesame, bananas, cassava and sorghum. The mutant wheat is used for bread and pasta and the mutant barley for beer and fine whiskey.\nThe mutations can improve yield, quality, taste, size and resistance to disease and can help plants adapt to diverse climates and conditions.\nDr. Lagoda takes pains to distinguish the little-known radiation work from the contentious field of genetically modified crops, sometimes disparaged as \u201cFrankenfood.\u201d That practice can splice foreign genetic material into plants, creating exotic varieties grown widely in the United States but often feared and rejected in Europe. By contrast, radiation breeding has made few enemies.\n\u201cSpontaneous mutations are the motor of evolution,\u201d Dr. Lagoda said. \u201cWe are mimicking nature in this. We\u2019re concentrating time and space for the breeder so he can do the job in his lifetime. We concentrate how often mutants appear \u2014 going through 10,000 to one million \u2014 to select just the right one.\u201d\nRadiation breeding is widely used in the developing world, thanks largely to the atomic agency\u2019s efforts. Beneficiaries have included Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand and Vietnam.\nPolitically, the method is one of many quid pro quos the agency, an arm of the United Nations in Vienna, offers client states. Its own agenda is to inspect ostensibly peaceful atomic installations in an effort to find and deter secret work on nuclear weapons.\nPlant scientists say radiation breeding could play an important role in the future. By promoting crop flexibility, it could help feed billions of added mouths despite shrinking land and water, rising oil and fertilizer costs, increasing soil exhaustion, growing resistance of insects to pesticides and looming climate change. Globally, food prices are already rising fast.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to solve the world food crisis,\u201d said J. Neil Rutger, former director of the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Stuttgart, Ark. \u201cBut it will help. Modern plant breeders are using every tool they can get.\u201d \nThe method was discovered some 80 years ago when Lewis J. Stadler of the University of Missouri used X-rays to zap barley seeds. The resulting plants were white, yellow, pale yellow and some had white stripes \u2014 nothing of any practical value.\nBut the potential was clear. Soon, by exposing large numbers of seeds and young plants, scientists produced many more mutations and found a few hidden beneficial ones. Peanuts got tougher hulls. Barley, oats and wheat got better yields. Black currants grew.\nThe process worked because the radiation had randomly mixed up the genetic material of the plants. The scientists could control the intensity of the radiation and thus the extent of the disturbance, but not the outcome. To know the repercussions, they had to plant the radiated material, let it grow and examine the results. Often, the gene scrambling killed the seeds and plants, or left them with odd mutations. But in a few instances, the process made beneficial traits. \nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the United States government promoted the method as part of its \u201catoms for peace\u201d program and had notable successes. In 1960, disease heavily damaged the bean crop in Michigan \u2014 except for a promising new variety that had been made by radiation breeding. It and its offspring quickly replaced the old bean.\nIn the early 1970s, Dr. Rutger, then in Davis, Calif., fired gamma rays at rice. He and his colleagues found a semi-dwarf mutant that gave much higher yields, partly because it produced more grain. Its short size also meant it fell over less often, reducing spoilage. Known as Calrose 76, it was released publicly in 1976.\nToday, Dr. Rutger said, about half the rice grown in California derives from this dwarf. Now retired in Woodland, Calif., he lives just a few miles from where the descendants grow, he said.\nA similar story unfolded in Texas. In 1929, farmers stumbled on the Ruby Red grapefruit, a natural mutant. Its flesh eventually faded to pink, however, and scientists fired radiation to produce mutants of deeper color \u2014 Star Ruby, released in 1971, and Rio Red, released in 1985. The mutant offspring now account for about 75 percent of all grapefruit grown in Texas.\nThough the innovations began in the United States, the method is now used mostly overseas, with Asia and Europe the leading regions. Experts cited two main reasons: domestic plant researchers over the decades have already made many, perhaps most of the easiest improvements that can be achieved with radiation, and they now focus on highly popular fields like gene splicing.\n\u201cMost scientists here would say it\u2019s pretty primitive,\u201d Norman T. Uphoff, a professor of government and international agriculture at Cornell University, said of the method. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a huge room with a flashlight.\u201d\nBut the flashlight is cheap, which has aided its international spread.\nToday, the process usually begins with cobalt-60, a highly radioactive material used in industrial radiography and medical radiotherapy. Its gamma rays, more energetic than X-rays, can travel many yards through the air and penetrate lead.\nUnderstandably, the exposure facilities for radiation breeding have layers of shielding. Scientists run small machines the size of water heaters that zap containers full of seeds, greenhouses that expose young plants and special fields that radiate row upon row of mature plants. In Japan, one circular field is more than 650 feet wide. A shielding dike some 28 feet high rises around its perimeter.\nDr. Lagoda said a rust fungus threatened the Japanese pear, a pear with the crisp texture characteristic of apples. But one irradiated tree had a branch that showed resistance. He said the Japanese cloned it, successfully started a new crop and with the financial rewards \u201cpaid for 30 years of research.\u201d\nThe payoff was even bigger in Europe, where scientists fired gamma rays at barley to produce Golden Promise, a mutant variety with high yields and improved malting. After its debut in 1967, brewers in Ireland and Britain made it into premium beer and whiskey. It still finds wide use.\n\u201cThe secret,\u201d reads a recent advertisement for a single malt Scotch whiskey costing $49.99 a bottle, is \u201cthe continued use of finest Golden Promise barley and the insistence on oak sherry casks from Spain.\u201d\n The atomic agency in Vienna has promoted the method since 1964 in outreach programs with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in Rome.\nStarting roughly a decade ago, for instance, the atomic agency helped scientists fight a virus that was killing cocoa trees in Ghana, which produces about 15 percent of the world\u2019s chocolate. The virus was killing and crippling millions of trees.\nIn the city of Accra on the Atlantic coast, at the laboratories of the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission, the scientists exposed cocoa plant buds to gamma rays. The mutants included one that endowed its offspring with better resistance to the killer virus.\nThe scientists planted the resistant variety on 25 farms across Ghana \u201cwith no evidence of a resurgence,\u201d M. R. Appaih, executive director of the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana, told the agency.\nThe atomic agency had similar success in the Peruvian Andes, where some three million people live on subsistence farming. The region, nearly two miles high, has extremely harsh weather. But nine new varieties of barley improved harvests to the point that farmers had surplus crops to sell.\nIn 2006, Prof. Gomes Pando won the Peruvian prize for Good Government Practices for her work on the radiation mutants.\nIn Vietnam, the agency has worked closely with local scientists to improve production of rice, a crop that accounts for nearly 70 percent of the public\u2019s food energy.\n One mutant had yields up to four times higher than its parent and grew well in acidic and saline soils, allowing farmers to use it in coastal regions, including the Mekong Delta.\nLast year, a team of 10 Vietnamese scientists wrote in an agency journal, Plant Mutation Reports, that the nation had sown the new varieties across more than one million hectares, or 3,860 square miles. The new varieties, they added, \u201chave already produced remarkable economic and social impacts, contributing to poverty alleviation in some provinces.\u201d\nDr. Lagoda said that radiation breeding, though an old technology, was undergoing rapid growth. New methods that speed up the identification of mutants are making radiation breeding even more popular, he said. \n\u201cNow it becomes interesting again,\u201d he said of the method. \u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea. It\u2019s not the solution. But it\u2019s a very efficient tool that helps us reduce the breeding time.\u201d\nSpreading the secret, Dr. Lagoda added as he played with his tiny dice, \u201cis very gratifying because we really, really help people.\u201d",

    "text": "Vietnam's preference for boys tips gender scales in Asia\n2007-10-31T05:00:00.000Z\nHANOI \u2014 Vietnam's preference for baby boys over girls is further tipping Mother Nature's scale in Asia, already skewed by a strong bias for boys among Chinese and Indians. The trend could lead to increased trafficking of women and social unrest, a United Nations report says.\nVietnam is now positioned where China was a decade ago, logging about 110 boys born to every 100 girls in a country where technology is readily available to determine the sex of a fetus and where abortion is legal, according to research released this week by the UN Population Fund.\nThe sex ratio at birth generally should equal about 105 boys to 100 girls, according to the report.\n\"The consequences are already happening in neighboring countries like China, South Korea and Taiwan. They have to import brides,\" said Tran Thi Van, assistant country representative of the Population Fund in Hanoi, adding that many of those wives are coming from Vietnam. \"I don't know where Vietnam could import brides from if that situation happened here in the next 10 or 15 years.\"\nThe report, which looked at China, India, Vietnam and Nepal, warned that tinkering with nature's probabilities could cause increased violence against women, trafficking and social tensions. It predicted a \"marriage squeeze,\" with the poorest men being forced to live as bachelors.\nGender imbalance among births has been rising in parts of Asia since the 1980s, after amniocentesis and ultrasound were introduced to determine the sex of a fetus early in pregnancy. Despite laws in several countries banning doctors from revealing the baby's sex, many women still find out and opt to abort females.\n\"I have noticed that there have been more and more boys than girls,\" said Truong Thi My Ha, a nurse on duty at Hanoi's Maternity Hospital. \"Most women are very happy when they have boys, while many are upset if they have girls.\"\nIn China, the 2005 estimate was more than 120 boys born to 100 girls, with India logging about 108 boys to 100 girls in 2001, when the last census was taken. However, pockets of India have rates around 120. In several Chinese provinces, the ratio spikes to more than 130 boys born to 100 girls.\nReports of female infanticide still surface in some poor areas of countries, and deaths rates are higher among girls in places like China, where they are sometimes breast fed for shorter periods, offered less health care and vaccinations and even given smaller food portions than their brothers, the report said.\nIt estimated that Asia was short 163 million females in 2005 when compared with overall population balances of men and women elsewhere in the world. It said sex ratios at birth in other countries, like Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh, also should be closely monitored to avoid uneven trends there.\nEarlier research has documented the gender imbalance in the region. A Unicef report last year estimated that 7,000 girls go unborn every day in India.\n\"It's very difficult to imagine what's going to be the exact impact of these missing girls in 20 years,\" said Christophe Guilmoto, an author of the report presented this week at a reproductive health conference in Hyderabad, India. \"No human society that we know has faced a similar problem.\"\nThe reasons boys are favored over girls in the region are complex and deeply rooted in Asian society. In many countries, men typically receive the inheritance, carry on the family name and take care of their parents in old age, while women often leave to live with their husband's family.\nIn India, wedding costs and dowries are often required to be paid by the parents of the bride, and sons are the only ones permitted by the Hindu religion to perform the last rites when their fathers die.\n\"My husband took me to a private clinic to be checked. I broke down in tears when I saw the result because I knew this is not what my husband wanted,\" said Nguyen Thi Hai Yen, 33, of Vietnam, recalling when she discovered that her second baby was a girl. \"But he was good. He told me it was O.K.\"\nChina has a one-child policy, while Vietnam encourages only two children per family after relaxing an earlier ban restricting couples from having more. Such limits have forced many women to abort girls and keep trying for sons who can carry on the family lineage.\nThe report calls for increased public awareness, more government intervention and steps to elevate women's place in society by promoting gender equality.",

(Vintage, $14.95. ) To satisfy his curiosity about British soccer hooligans, Buford, a former fiction editor of The New Yorker, ran with the pack, recording his experience in \u201cAmong the Thugs.\u201d \u201cHeat\u201d thrusts him into another physically demanding, often dangerous world, as an apprentice to the dynamic chef and restaurateur Mario Batali. Interspersed with this culinary-education tale is Batali\u2019s own story: Buford\u2019s nearly four-year odyssey includes stints with Batali\u2019s former teachers and a sojourn in Italy in search of the techniques and history of Italian cooking. In the Book Review, Julia Reed said Buford\u2019s \u201cdeftly intertwining narratives include everything from high-end restaurant gossip and kitchen secrets to a passionate homage to the rapidly declining traditions of handmade food.\u201d \nHIGH LONESOME: New & Selected Stories 1966-2006, by Joyce Carol Oates. (Ecco/Harper Perennial, $19.95. ) Oates has conjured hundreds of mesmerizing short stories that peer into the darkest corners of American culture. This collection, which includes classic stories like \u201cIn the Region of Ice,\u201d which won the O. Henry prize in 1967, as well as 11 new stories, spans Oates\u2019s career and gives a coherent overview of her work. In the novel BLACK GIRL/WHITE GIRL (Ecco/Harper Perennial, $13.95 ), Oates takes a provocative look at race relations, as the white girl of the title tries to reconstruct the brutal death of her black college roommate in the 1970s. \nSONS OF PROVIDENCE: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the American Revolution, by Charles Rappleye. (Simon & Schuster, $16.95.) Rappleye skillfully details the complex relationship between Moses and John Brown \u2014 brothers who were Rhode Island business leaders and early advocates of colonial rights \u2014 whose differences over slavery tested but never destroyed their friendship. (Like John, Moses owned slaves, but a conversion to the Quaker faith in the early 1770s inspired him to set them free.) \nGALLATIN CANYON: Stories, by Thomas McGuane. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13. ) McGuane\u2019s first collection in nearly 20 years is populated by misfits and seekers, men whose destinies are profoundly shaped by the places they inhabit. In the title story, a relationship between an unnamed narrator and his girlfriend falls apart as they drive through Gallatin Canyon, toward Idaho, where the narrator intends to use his obnoxious guile to undo a business deal. In \u201cThe Refugee,\u201d an alcoholic sails the Caribbean while mourning the death of his closest friend, weathering monstrous storms and seeking absolution. \u201cMcGuane has driven so hard into the heart of a received wisdom concerning American manhood,\u201d Stephen Metcalf wrote here, \u201cthat he has broken through to the other side.\u201d \nTHE FOREIGNER\u2019S GIFT: The Americans, the Arabs, and the Iraqis in Iraq, by Fouad Ajami. (Free Press, $16. ) In this assessment of the continuing struggle in Iraq, Ajami, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and an unofficial adviser to the Bush administration, argues that the country\u2019s troubles result from the unwillingness of Sunni Arabs in Iraq and elsewhere to accept the Shiites\u2019 rise to power. THE END OF IRAQ: How American Incompetence Created a War Without End, by Peter W. Galbraith. (Simon & Schuster, $15. ) Deeply skeptical of the Bush administration\u2019s attempts to reunify Iraq, Galbraith, a former Senate staff member and ambassador to Croatia, advocates a policy of American withdrawal and proposes breaking the country into parts \u2014 beginning with an independent Kurdistan. \nTO HELL WITH ALL THAT: Loving and Loathing Our Inner Housewife, by Caitlin Flanagan. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.99. ) Recasting some of her most incisive essays for The Atlantic Monthly and The New Yorker, Flanagan joins the mommy wars, taking satirical shots at all sides. \nALENTEJO BLUE, by Monica Ali. (Scribner, $14. ) In this evocative follow-up to \u201cBrick Lane,\u201d her debut novel about Bangladeshi immigrants in London, Ali again tells a tale of an insular community in flux. Set in and around a southern Portuguese village, the novel is told from the points of view of different inhabitants or visitors to the region: an ancient, closeted gay pig farmer; a fat, dimwitted cafe owner; a poor, scatty Englishwoman and her slovenly family; vacationers of varying ages and conditions. Our reviewer, Liesl Schillinger, said Ali\u2019s second novel \u201cdemonstrates her versatility and hints at the breadth and variety of her interests.\u201d \nTHE HUDSON: A History, by Tom Lewis. (Yale University, $17. ) The Hudson \u2014 not particularly long, not notably central vis-\u00e0-vis the modern United States \u2014 is depicted in this first-rate history as the great national theater: avenue of explorers, military battleground, artists\u2019 inspiration and industrial dump.

A police official in the city of Hyderabad said Ms. Nasreen faced a charge of \u201churting Muslim feelings.\u201d On Thursday lawmakers and members of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen Party expressed outrage over Ms. Nasreen\u2019s criticisms of Islam for what she called oppression of women. The protesters disrupted a publication party by hurling objects at her and shouting for her death. Three legislators from the party were charged with rioting, but a senior party member registered a complaint against Ms. Nasreen, saying she had made rude remarks about Islam, which led to her being charged. Under Indian law, promoting \u201cdisharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill will\u201d between religious groups is punishable by up to three years in jail. In 1994 thousands of Muslims demanded Ms. Nasreen\u2019s death for blasphemy, and she went into exile after a court declared that she had \u201cdeliberately and maliciously\u201d injured the religious feelings of Muslims with her Bengali-language novel \u201cLajja\u201d (\u201cShame\u201d), about riots between Muslims and Hindus. The European Parliament awarded her the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought that year. In March an Indian Muslim group from Uttar Pradesh state offered a bounty of 500,000 rupees (more than $12,000) for Ms. Nasreen\u2019s execution.\nNBC Confirms Its Plans\nFor a Fourth Hour of \u2018Today\u2019\n NBC said in January that it would eventually add a fourth hour to the \u201cToday\u201d program and that the hosts would include Ann Curry and Natalie Morales both recognizable to \u201cToday\u201d viewers, and Hoda Kotb of \u201cDateline\u201d in prominent roles. Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira would be relegated to the sidelines. As the expansion draws near \u2014 NBC will begin offering a fourth hour, from 10 to 11 a.m., Eastern time, of \u201cToday\u201d to local stations on Sept. 10 \u2014 the network has largely held to that plan, said an NBC Universal executive who has been briefed directly on the lineup for the fourth hour but was not authorized to describe it. In addition to Ms. Curry, Ms. Morales and Ms. Kotb, who will serve as primary co-hosts, four other people on the NBC roster will be regularly featured. They are Tiki Barber, formerly of the New York Giants; Amy Robach of MSNBC; Nancy Snyderman, an NBC medical correspondent; and Giada De Laurentiis, a contributor on the food beat. JACQUES STEINBERG\nNew York\u2019s New Club\nThe Bowery Presents, an independent concert promoter, is expected to announce today that a new rock club is coming to New York, and it\u2019s a big one: Terminal 5, with room for 3,000, at 610 West 56th Street in Clinton. The first concert, featuring the National, is to take place on Oct. 11. Others to appear in the following months include M.I.A., Justice, the Decemberists, Ween and the Shins. In the space once occupied by Exit, a cavernous dance hall, the three-floor, 40,000-square-foot club is the largest concert space to open this year in the city. Next month the Bowery Presents will open the Music Hall of Williamsburg, in Brooklyn. Tickets for the Oct. 11 show at Terminal 5 will go on sale Friday through terminal5nyc.com. BEN SISARIO\nPotter Translator Escapes Lawsuit\nThe French publisher of the Harry Potter books will not sue the teenager who was arrested for publishing his own complete French translation of the final Potter book, though he could still be charged by French officials, the BBC reported. The decision not to sue for damages was made in agreement with J. K. Rowling, the author of the books, said the book\u2019s French publisher, Gallimard, which will publish the French translation of \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\u201d on Oct. 26. \u201cThe aim was never financial; it only aimed to protect authors\u2019 rights,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the company. The 16-year-old, from the southern city of Aix-en-Provence, was arrested last week after he posted his unauthorized translation, which appeared within a few days of the book\u2019s release in English on July 21. Gallimard said France\u2019s anti-piracy squad found the translation as part of an inquiry into organized networks that post pirated book translations online.

    "text": "Terror in the weather forecast\n2007-04-24T05:00:00.000Z\nTORONTO \u2014 Does climate change threaten international peace and security? The British government thinks it does. As this month's head of the United Nations Security Council, Britain convened a debate on the matter last Tuesday. One in four United Nations member countries joined the discussion - a record for this kind of thematic debate.\nCountries rich and poor, large and small, and from all continents - Bangladesh, Ghana, Japan, Mexico, much of Europe and, most poignantly, a large number of small island states endangered by rising seas - recognized the security implications of climate change. Some other developing countries - Brazil, Cuba and India and most of the biggest producers of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide, including China, Qatar and Russia - either questioned the very idea of such a link or argued that the Security Council is not the right place to talk about it.\nBut these skeptics are wrong. Evidence is fast accumulating that, within our children's lifetimes, severe droughts, storms and heat waves caused by climate change could rip apart societies from one side of the planet to the other. Climate stress may well represent a challenge to international security just as dangerous - and more intractable - than the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War or the proliferation of nuclear weapons among rogue states today.\nIn America, Congress and senior military leaders are taking heed: Legislation under consideration in both the Senate and the House calls for the director of national intelligence to report on the geopolitical implications of climate change. And last week a panel of 11 retired generals and admirals warned that climate change is already a \"threat multiplier\" in the world's fragile regions, \"exacerbating conditions that lead to failed states - the breeding grounds for extremism and terrorism.\"\nAddressing the question of scientific uncertainty about climate change, General Gordon Sullivan, a former U.S. Army chief of staff who is now retired, said: \"Speaking as a soldier, we never have 100 percent certainty. If you wait until you have 100 percent certainty, something bad is going to happen on the battlefield.\"\nIn the future, that battlefield is likely to be complex and hazardous. Climate change will help produce the kind of military challenges that are difficult for today's conventional forces to handle: insurgencies, genocide, guerrilla attacks, gang warfare and global terrorism.\nIn the 1990s, a research team I led at the University of Toronto examined links between various forms of environmental stress in poor countries - cropland degradation, deforestation and scarcity of fresh water, for example - and violent conflict. In places as diverse as Haiti, Pakistan, the Philippines and South Africa, we found that severe environmental stress multiplied the pain caused by such problems as ethnic strife and poverty.\nRural residents who depend on local natural resources for their livelihood become poorer, while powerful elites take control of - and extract exorbitant profits from - increasingly valuable land, forests and water. As these resources in the countryside dwindle, people sometimes join local rebellions against landowners and government officials. In mountainous areas of the Philippines, for instance, deforestation, soil erosion and depletion of soil nutrients have increased poverty and helped drive peasants into the arms of the Communist New People's Army insurgency.\nOther times, people migrate in large numbers to regions where resources seem more plentiful, only to fight with the people already there. Or they migrate to urban slums, where unemployed young men can be primed to join criminal gangs or radical political groups.\nClimate change will have similar effects, if nations fail to aggressively limit carbon dioxide emissions and develop technologies and institutions that allow people to cope with a warmer planet.\nThe recent report of Working Group II of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identifies several ways warming will hurt poor people in the third world and hinder economic development there more generally. Large swaths of land in subtropical latitudes - zones inhabited by billions of people - will experience more drought, more damage from storms, higher mortality from heat waves, worse outbreaks of agricultural pests and an increased burden of infectious disease.\nThe potential impact on food output is a particular concern: In semi-arid regions where water is already scarce and cropland overused, climate change could devastate agriculture. (There is evidence that warming's effect on crops and pastureland is a cause of the Darfur crisis.) Many cereal crops in tropical zones are already near their limits of heat tolerance, and temperatures even a couple of degrees higher could lead to much lower yields.\nBy weakening rural economies, increasing unemployment and disrupting livelihoods, global warming will increase the frustrations and anger of hundreds of millions of people in vulnerable countries.\nEspecially in Africa, but also in some parts of Asia and Latin America, climate change will undermine already frail governments - and make challenges from violent groups more likely - by reducing revenues, overwhelming bureaucracies and revealing how incapable these governments are of helping their citizens.\nWe've learned in recent years that such failure can have consequences around the world and that great powers can't always isolate themselves from these consequences. It's time to put climate change on the world's security agenda.\n Thomas Homer-Dixon, director of the Trudeau Center for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Toronto, is the author of \"The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization.\"",

    "text": "F.D.A. tracked poison drugs, but trail went cold in China\n2007-06-16T05:00:00.000Z\nAfter a drug ingredient from China killed dozens of Haitian children a decade ago, a senior American health official sent a cable to her investigators: find out who made the poisonous ingredient and why a state-owned company in China exported it as safe, pharmaceutical-grade glycerin.\nThe Chinese were of little help. Requests to find the manufacturer were ignored. Business records were withheld or destroyed.\nThe Americans had reason for alarm. \"The U.S. imports a lot of Chinese glycerin and it is used in ingested products such as toothpaste,\" Mary Pendergast, then deputy commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration, wrote on Oct. 27, 1997. Learning how diethylene glycol, a syrupy poison used in some antifreeze, ended up in Haitian fever medicine might \"prevent this tragedy from happening again,\" she wrote.\nThe FDA's mission ultimately failed. By the time an FDA agent visited the suspected manufacturer, the plant was shut down and Chinese companies said they bore no responsibility for the mass poisoning.\nTen years later it happened again, this time in Panama. Chinese-made diethylene glycol, masquerading as its more expensive chemical cousin glycerin, was mixed into medicine, killing at least 100 people there last year. And recently, Chinese toothpaste containing diethylene glycol was found in the United States and seven other countries, prompting tens of thousands of tubes to be recalled.\nThe FDA's efforts to investigate the Haiti poisonings, documented in internal FDA memorandums obtained by The New York Times, demonstrate not only the intransigence of Chinese officials, but also the same regulatory failings that allowed a virtually identical poisoning to occur 10 years later. The cases further illustrate what happens when nations fail to police the global pipeline of pharmaceutical ingredients.\nIn Haiti and Panama, the poison was traced to Chinese chemical companies not certified to make pharmaceutical ingredients. State-owned exporters then shipped the toxic syrup to European traders, who resold it without identifying the previous owner \u2014 an attempt to keep buyers from bypassing them on future orders.\nAs a result, most of the buyers did not know that the ingredient came from China, known for producing counterfeit products, nor did they show much interest in finding out.\nChina itself was a victim of diethylene glycol poisoning last year when at least 18 people died after ingesting poisonous medicine made there. In the wake of the deaths, and reports of pet food and other products contaminated with dangerous ingredients from China, officials there announced that they would overhaul the regulation of food, drugs and chemicals.\nBeyond the three incidents linked to Chinese diethylene glycol, there have been at least five other mass poisonings involving the mislabeled chemical in the past two decades \u2014 in Bangladesh, Nigeria, Argentina and twice in India.\n\"This problem keeps coming back,\" said Dr. Joshua Schier, a toxicologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And no wonder: the counterfeiters are rarely identified, much less prosecuted.\nFinding a way to keep diethylene glycol out of medicine, particularly in developing countries, has confounded health officials for decades. \"It is preventable and we have to figure out some way of stopping this from happening again,\" said Carol Rubin, a senior CDC official.\nIn a global economy, ingredients for drugs are often bought and sold many times in different countries, sometimes without proper paperwork, all of which increases the risk of fraud, the authorities say.\nThe Panama poison passed through five hands, the Haitian poison six. In both cases, the factory's original certificate of analysis, attesting to the contents of the shipment and its provenance, did not accompany the product as it moved around the world.\n\"Where there is a loophole in the system, a frailty in the system, it's the ability of an unscrupulous distributor to take industrial or technical material and pass it off as pharmaceutical grade,\" said Kevin McGlue, a board member of the International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council.\nUncovering that deception can be difficult. \"It's impossible to get anyone to do the trace-backs,\" said Dr. Michael Bennish, co-author of a 1995 medical journal article on a poisoning epidemic in Bangladesh.\nOne reason, Bennish said, is the clout of local manufacturers. \"We tried to follow up as amateur Sherlocks, investigators, but you don't go down to the wholesale market and ask questions,\" he said. \"You are going to get your fingers burnt.\"\nA Crisis in Haiti\nBy the end of June 1996, the FDA knew it might have an international crisis on its hands. A poison had found its way into fever syrup in Haiti, and the FDA wanted to know if more of the same might be heading to the United States or, for that matter, to any other country. But to learn that, the agency needed to find the manufacturer.\nThis was not just any poison. Virtually every young poisoning victim who showed up at the main hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, died.\nLabeled pharmaceutical-grade glycerin, the toxic syrup was mixed into thousands of bottles of fever medicine. For months, parents gave it to their children, then watched them die, in agony, from kidney failure. No one suspected the medicine until much later.\nOfficially, at least 88 children died, nearly half under the age of 2. But those 88 were only the ones doctors remembered or for whom hospital records could be found.\nThe FDA traced the poison to a German broker, Chemical Trading and Consulting, but the company's records were not much help. \"They cannot trace glycerine lots to their manufacturer,\" David Pulham, an FDA investigator, wrote on June 30, 1996.\nChemical Trading had arranged for a Dutch company, Vos BV, to sell 72 barrels of the suspect syrup to Haiti, records show. The agency dispatched an investigator, Ann deMarco, who made an unsettling discovery \u2014 sitting in Vos's warehouse near Rotterdam, were 66 more barrels labeled glycerin, all containing lethal concentrations of diethylene glycol.\n\"Some of this second shipment has been sold,\" deMarco wrote in a memorandum on July 4, 1996. Although the missing barrels had gone to an industrial user, not a drug maker, the FDA's worries grew.\ndeMarco learned that another broker, Metall-Chemie, a German trader, had arranged for Vos to buy the barrels from Sinochem International Chemicals Company, a giant exporter in Beijing owned by the Chinese government.\nBut Metall-Chemie also did not know the manufacturer, and one of its officials predicted that the FDA would have trouble finding that out. \"It is difficult to get any information from Chinese traders,\" deMarco wrote.\nMore complete shipping records would have identified who made the poison. But in this case, records provided few clues.\n\"The original source of the material had been obliterated on documents and product containers,\" deMarco wrote to senior FDA officials. \"One trader referred to this practice as 'neutralization.' I was advised that neutralization is a common practice among traders in order to protect their business interests.\"\nWith no paper trail, American officials turned to Sinochem for help.\nInitially, they took an indirect approach. In July 1996, the American Embassy in China contacted the company and asked for a list of Chinese glycerin makers, without saying that it was investigating the Haiti poisonings. Sinochem, however, \"would not reveal the names of actual manufacturers in order to prevent the prospective foreign customer from bypassing Sinochem,\" an embassy official reported to Washington.\nIn early August, American officials asked Sinochem representatives specifically about the origin of the Haiti poison. \"They want to investigate further and were unable (or unwilling) to give the name of the manufacturer at this time,\" the officials reported.\nU.S. investigators sought help from senior Chinese drug regulators, who promised to help find the manufacturer, but said it \"will take time,\" records show.\nWhen another month passed without any word from either regulators or Sinochem, the embassy tried again. Chinese regulators said they had done nothing to find the factory, according to a confidential State Department telegram from September 1996.\nSinochem did finally offer the manufacturer's name: the Tianhong Fine Chemicals Factory in the city of Dalian in northeastern China. But Sinochem \"refused\" to provide an address, saying it was illegible. A telephone number would have to suffice, it said.\nThat, too, was unproductive. When American investigators called the plant manager, Zhang Gang, they were told he was not available. Send a fax, they were told. That did not work either. \"The phone was always busy,\" investigators reported.\nFinally, they got Zhang on the phone, but he, too, refused to give out his factory's address. He said tests had found no signs of diethylene glycol, adding that \"there had been no cases in China of poisoning resulting from the ingestion\" of glycerin contaminated by diethylene glycol, investigators wrote.\nAfter months of trying to trace the poison to its source, United States investigators were at a dead end.\n\"The Chinese officials we contacted on this matter were all reluctant to become involved,\" a State Department official wrote in late September 1996, saying that drug regulators and the plant manager had insisted on communicating only on the telephone \"to avoid leaving a paper trail.\"\nHe added, \"We cannot be optimistic about our chances for success in tracking down the other possible glycerine shipments.\"\nThe following May, Pulham, who was part of the original FDA investigative team in Haiti, tried to revive the investigation. \"Is it possible to block-list all Chinese pharmaceutical products until we gain cooperation?\" he asked.\nThe suggestion went nowhere. Five months later, Pendergast of the FDA wrote her memorandum, imploring investigators to keep digging.\n\"China is turning into one of the major bulk pharmaceutical producers in the world,\" she wrote. \"Unless they have an open, transparent and predictable system for dealing with problems and other countries, it is going to be rough sledding in the years ahead.\"\nOn Nov. 17, 1997, U.S. investigators once again questioned Sinochem officials. They denied any wrongdoing, saying that two certificates of analysis showed that the suspect shipment was safe, pharmaceutical-grade syrup. But when the FDA asked to see them, Sinochem refused.\n\"The officials were not willing to explain why they could not provide the copies,\" an American official reported at the time.\nChen Liusuo, who handled the glycerin sales, strongly disputed the FDA's account. In an interview with The Times, Chen said Sinochem cooperated. \"We gave them everything they wanted,\" Chen said, adding that the agency was satisfied.\n\"The product we sold was glycerin,\" he said. \"It passed through three or four companies after us. To find the problem you need to look at every link in the supply chain.\"\nA Chinese government official familiar with the FDA's inquiries said the Americans' frustration might have stemmed from their misunderstanding about who regulated chemical companies, which led them to seek help from the wrong officials. \"This was a truly tragic event, and we expressed our sadness and sympathy,\" said the official, who asked not to be identified.\nAt the end of 1997, a year and a half after the FDA began tracing the poisonous shipments, one of its investigators, Ted Sze, finally got inside the Tianhong chemical plant in Dalian. But glycerin was no longer made there, and Sze had no records to inspect. The plant manager, Zhang, told investigators that he had received no complaints about his products and that his company had not produced the poison.\nSze, now retired from the FDA, said in an interview that he had no choice but to accept the manager's word and clear the company of wrongdoing. \"By the time I went there, the plant was already shut down,\" he said. \"The agency can only do so much.\"\nThe Experts' Recommendations\nThe United States may not have gotten what it wanted from China, but the Haiti crisis did bring together health groups to search for ways to stop diethylene glycol poisonings. At a workshop in Washington in February 1997, health experts recommended that certificates of analysis be improved to allow users to \"trace the product back through every intermediary, broker and repackager to the original manufacturer.\"\nThe workshop participants also called for better testing of drug ingredients and asked governments to tighten oversight of drug manufacturing.\nThe next year, the World Health Organization offered many of the same recommendations. And a 1998 article in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, warned that failure to strictly follow the guidelines could cause poisonings \"even in countries where quality control procedures are usually strictly applied.\"\nMuch of this had been said before, yet the poisonings have continued.\nJust as the JAMA article was being published, three dozen children began dying of acute renal failure at two hospitals in Delhi, India. A local drug maker had unwittingly mixed diethylene glycol into acetaminophen syrup, much as the Haitian pharmacist had.\nThe drug maker was prosecuted, but according to interviews and government records no progress had been made in identifying the supplier of the poison.\n\"My experience as an investigator tells me that many of these things will not be proven,\" said Dr. M. Venkateswarlu, the drug controller general of India.\nFinding counterfeiters often means pursuing leads across foreign borders, and no international authority has the power to do that. Dr. Howard Zucker, who helps to oversee drug issues for the WHO, said individual countries must conduct their own trace-back investigations.\nBut if the United States could not do that on behalf of Haiti, poorer, less influential nations would have little chance of tracking down counterfeiters.\nAfter the Haiti poisoning, a more accurate, less expensive test for diethylene glycol was developed, but last year's case in Panama shows that suppliers and governments do not always use it.\nAnd as long as counterfeiters do not fear prosecution, the poisonings are likely to continue, experts say.\nDr. Mohammed Hanif, a prominent physician in Dhaka, Bangladesh, said the foreign suppliers of diethylene glycol were never prosecuted for the deaths of thousands of children from 1982 to 1992. \"The traumatizing memories of those days still torment me,\" said Hanif, who wrote a paper about the deaths from toxic medicine.\nIn Argentina, a court official said no one had been prosecuted for supplying the diethylene glycol that ended up in a health supplement, killing 29 people in 1992.\nDavid Mishael, a Miami lawyer, knows the difficulty of assigning blame in these deaths. For 10 years, Mishael has unsuccessfully pursued legal claims in the United States and Europe against European traders that helped to arrange the shipment of toxic syrup to Haiti. \"You can imagine the cost,\" said Mishael, who is representing Haitian parents whose children died from the fever medicine.\nHe said Dutch authorities assessed a $250,000 fine against Vos, which tested the counterfeit syrup, found it impure and did not alert anyone in Haiti. But given how many died, he called the size of the fine \"a joke.\" A lawyer who represents Vos, Jeffrey Shapiro, declined to comment.\nA few children survived after being flown to the United States by humanitarian groups. One of them, Faika Jean, was 2 months old at the time and nearly died en route. Now 11, she has learning disabilities as a result of the poisoning, said her father, Wislin Jean.\nPendergast, now a private lawyer and consultant, said China had the most to answer for. \"Everybody else is just reacting to initial failures,\" she said. \"It needs to take steps to protect not just its own consumers but also consumers all around the world.\"\nAfter The Times reported in May that the Panama poison had been made and exported by Chinese companies as 99.5 percent pure glycerin, Chinese regulators said they would reopen their investigation of the incident. Three weeks later, the officials acknowledged some \"misconduct\" in how Chinese companies labeled the toxic syrup.\nBut most of the blame, they said, rested with a Panamanian importer who changed the paperwork to make the syrup look safer than it actually was.\nThe FDA disagrees, saying the deception began with Chinese companies falsely labeling a poisonous product glycerin. \"If the drums had been 99.5 percent glycerin, the deaths in Panama would never have occurred,\" the FDA said in a statement.\nA Dissatisfied Customer\nThe FDA's Haiti investigation never did find more counterfeit glycerin from China, despite a global hunt. But its concerns, it turns out, were not unfounded.\nIn 1995, the same year babies began to die in Haiti, 284 barrels of a chemical labeled glycerin arrived in New York on container ships. Although the chemical was not intended for use in drugs, it was labeled 98 percent pure. An official with the company that bought the barrels, Dastech International, of Great Neck, New York, would later say, \"It smelled like glycerin, it looked like glycerin.\" But after one of its customers complained, Dastech took a closer look.\nAlthough the chemical was labeled 98 percent pure glycerin, Dastech said in court records that the syrup actually contained sugar compounds \u2014 as well as diethylene glycol.\nThe exporter was Sinochem. Claiming that it was fleeced, Dastech tried to get its money back from the broker who arranged the sale, court records show.\nIt never did.",

Zahi Hawass, the secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said that legislation approved by a ministerial committee will be presented to the Egyptian Parliament, where it was expected to pass. The copyrights would then apply anywhere in the world, he said, although he gave no explanation of how Egypt would pursue infringements. He said the proposed law would apply to full-scale precise copies of museum objects and \u201ccommercial use\u201d of ancient monuments. The Egyptian newspaper Al-Wafd recently published a report saying that more people visit the pyramid-shaped Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas each year than Luxor itself. The newspaper suggested that the hotel share some profits with Luxor, Egypt.\nArrests in Statue Theft\nEight suspects were under arrest in Bangladesh on Thursday as the authorities carried out raids in an effort to recover two 1,500-year-old terra-cotta statues of the Hindu god Vishnu stolen from a high-security cargo area at the international airport in Dhaka, The Associated Press reported. Local television reports said the statues, insured for a total of $65,000 and bound for exhibition at the Guimet Museum in Paris before they disappeared on Sunday, may have been demolished. Outcry over the thefts prompted the government to decide not to send other artifacts to Paris for the show and to seek the return of those already sent. \nA Long Holiday for Groban\nMary J.

NBC got a boost from repeats of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d at 9 p.m. (7.8 million) and 10 (8.7 million). CBS finished third as its broadcast of the \u201c30th Annual Kennedy Center Honors\u201d from 9 to 11 p.m. drew 6.2 million viewers, down sharply from the 10 million who tuned in a year ago. Ratings for the gala paled in comparison to CBS\u2019s 8 p.m. rerun of \u201cCriminal Minds\u201d (9.1 million). ABC was a distant fourth for the night. BENJAMIN TOFF ",

    "text": "India's democratic path\n2007-08-14T05:00:00.000Z\nAt their blood-soaked independence 60 years ago this week, India and Pakistan embarked on unique experiments in nation-building. Pakistan was to be a nation bringing together diverse languages, ethnic groups and cultures, united by a common faith - Islam - even if its eastern and western wings were miles apart, with India, a neighbor it considered hostile, straddled in between.\nThe Indian dream was to unite an even more diverse body of ethnicities, languages, castes, cultures and religions, to mold a country built on the ideals of secular, liberal democracy.\nThe difference between the two visions is so fundamental that the many ties that bind the two nations - music, cinema, food, cricket, culture and a shared history - cannot overcome it.\nPakistan made religion its centerpiece, making people subservient to the state. India, despite its overt religiosity, officially swore by secularism, and its institutions strove to keep its people politically free for most of its post-independence history - with the exception of the \"Emergency\" of 1975-1977, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi suspended key provisions of the Constitution and jailed many of her opponents.\nThere was never a race between the two countries: India is, after all, many times bigger and has far more people - but the world, and Pakistan, saw it as a rivalry. The politics of the Cold War polarized that thinking, with Pakistan being a U.S. ally, and for some time a member of Central Treaty Organization; India opting ostensibly for nonalignment, but in essence, supporting Soviet positions on many issues.\nThose ties notwithstanding, it was India's great frustration that it could not decouple itself from the politics of the subcontinent.\nStrangely, it was the tit-for-tat nuclear tests of 1998 - and not the original Indian nuclear test of 1974 - that helped India sail away from being linked with Pakistan. By making its nuclear program overt, Pakistan thought it secured parity; instead, it became the subject of international pressure. India escaped much censure because by then India was already a booming economy; its businesses critical in the globalized world of multinational business and trade; and what India considers its crown jewels - its rule of law, its English-speaking elite, and its dynamic private sector - were being recognized internationally.\nTo be sure, both had internal strife. India in Punjab, Kashmir, and its northeast; Pakistan had skirmishes in its frontier provinces, its business capital Karachi becoming the capital of lawlessness, and its social structure disintegrated after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan of 1979, which helped consolidate the nearly decade-long rule of General Muhammad Zia ul-Haq, under whose leadership Pakistan embraced a form of Islam that its founding fathers had never bargained for.\nOne could argue Pakistan had little choice, once it had chosen to be a theocracy. The more Pakistani society modernized, the more its people sought freedom, the more Pakistan would begin to look like India. But being like India was not the point of the Partition: The point was to create a home for the subcontinent's Muslims, who were presumably unsafe in India. But while India has a shameful record of riots in which many Muslims have died, and many Muslims lead lives of utter destitution (but then so do many Hindus and others, too), it was also electing Muslims as presidents, appointing them to head the air force, to the supreme court, and Muslims dominated Bollywood, played cricket for India, and founded multimillion dollar companies. In Pakistan, the record of advances for minorities was poorer.\nFaith alone could not bind Pakistan, in any case. East Pakistan went its own way, becoming Bangladesh in 1971 after a civil war that killed over 300,000 civilians. In 1984, the astute British author of Pakistani origin, Tariq Ali, raised pertinent questions about his former home in a book called \"Can Pakistan Survive?\" A year later, M. J. Akbar, an Indian writer, wrote a sobering yet sunny book about India, called \"The Siege Within,\" suggesting that despite its internal turmoil, the country would hold together because its democratic form permitted dissent.\nToday, India connotes images of the hi-tech city of Bangalore and shopping malls of Gurgaon; Pakistan reminds many foreigners of madrasas from where militants emerge. Indeed, that is a caricature, but like all clich\u00e9s, there is a grain of truth in these images.\nClearly everything isn't sound with India. Maoists control stretches of Indian hinterland; the caste wars have not abated; bomb blasts occur periodically; and there are concerns over perceived rise in inequality. (In fact, after 15 years of economic reforms, India has lifted more people out of absolute poverty than at any time in its history). India has succeeded, not only to break free from being compared constantly with Pakistan, but it is being taken reasonably seriously in world affairs. The nuclear agreement between India and the United States and the important role India plays in current global trade negotiations are examples of that.\nWhat brought about that change in perceptions?\nNational choices may provide the key. Pakistan opted for religion and military, two forces that require submission to authority, to bind the nation. The corruption of its military could not be questioned; and its flawed democratic leaders rarely given the opportunity to complete their terms.\nIn India, such choices were left for the people to decide. The military largely remained in the barracks, brought out on the Republic Day in January every year like family silver for display. Of course, it suppressed - often brutally - insurgencies in the northeast, Punjab and Kashmir. But those insurgencies existed in the first place because India did not fully extend its democracy to those regions.\nElsewhere, India trusted the basics of democracy - where people could, and did, vote out governments, and elect leaders who more accurately represented their interests.\nWhen political pressure increased, India had the mechanism that permitted the steam to be let off. Pakistan did not, except rarely - which is why the recent reinstatement of Judge Iftikhar Chaudhry to the Supreme Court, whom President Pervez Musharraf clearly does not like, is all the more remarkable.\nThe rise of China has resurrected the old debate: Does democracy help, or hinder development? The Chinese compromise - that the rice bowl will be full but the peasants shouldn't ask questions - has seemed attractive to many autocrats around the world, who portray freedom of expression and civil liberties as inconvenient luxuries poor countries cannot afford.\nBut Pakistan shows that an absence of democracy does not mean sustained high growth or a stable order. And India's old excuse - that being democratic it can't grow fast - is also wearing thin. It is among the fastest-growing economies in the world today. What keeps nations free and prosperous, then, are those fundamental freedoms - to think, to speak, to trade?\nPakistan has been ruled for nearly half its 60 years by unelected generals and its economy still runs along feudal, monopolistic lines. For its first 45 years, Indians had abundant political freedom, but limited economic freedom. (Wealthy Indians could have any car they wanted, so long as it was a white Ambassador). That has changed, and its people are free, and its businesses are becoming so. That's the real meaning of freedom and the ultimate lesson of this anniversary, for both nations, and beyond.\nSalil Tripathi is a London-based writer.",

    "text": "A new luxe take on 'Made in China'\n2007-10-01T05:00:00.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 Say \"Made in China\" these days and the growing list of manufacturing scandals immediately comes to mind. But the recalls of lead paint-covered toys, news of poisonous dog food and shocking sweatshop stories obscure another reality: a very small but flourishing high-end factory sector that produces top-class goods.\nCheap and nasty fashion gets made a lot in mainland China but increasingly, well, chic happens. \"Luxury manufacturing in China is a new trend so there will not be many factories. I would think this number must be less than 100 or even much lower,\" said Hana Ben-Shabat, a partner and international consumer goods specialist at the London offices of the management consultancy A.T. Kearney.\n\"In the beginning I was skeptical,\" said Rafe Totengco, designer of Rafe New York, a label popular among the Hollywood crowd. \"I thought: 'Ugh, cheap labor . . . !' and I had all the perceptions of people who are uneducated about manufacturing in China.\"\nA few years ago, hearing what some other high-end brands were doing on the mainland, Totengco began to visit workshops in Guangdong and Shenzhen in southern China. The recipient of several U.S. accessories design awards, he said, \"I was blown away.\"\nTotengco said he found tidy, Chinese-owned factories with neat, uniformed local workers and some Italian employees. The equipment tended to be cutting edge and the products, he said, were excellent quality with attention to detail. While he still uses Italian skins, he has had two collections entirely made in China, including the reptile-skin clutches that the \"Desperate Housewives\" star Eva Longoria ordered earlier this year for members of her wedding party.\nPrice, however, is not a big advantage in these factories. \"It is not cheap. Small runs, under 300 pieces per style, per color, tend to cost the same as anywhere else in the world,\" said Fiona Kotur-Marin, a Hong Kong-based designer who also is a production consultant and a silent partner in the Tory Burch brand.\n\"There are different tiers of manufacturing in China,\" she said, \"In the north, it is less expensive production. As you move south, manufacturing gets more refined.\" Labor for handbags or clothes generally constitutes just a tiny fraction of overall costs, often less than 10 percent, and the average general rates for workers in, say, Bangladesh can be a fifth of those in China.\nThe main advantage, according to Kotur-Marin: \"Chinese factories meet their deadlines, unlike Europe.\" Chinese workers do not have the vacation allowances of European workers so factories, for example, work through August. And one of the under-appreciated qualities of the mainland's manufacturing capacity, she said, is a sophisticated supply chain infrastructure.\nAnd the best workshops do not work with just anybody, Kotur-Marin said. \"They pick you, you don't pick them because they don't need your business.\"\nA recent study by consultants at the international accounting and business consultancy firm KPMG and at Monash University in Australia reported: \"While companies are often wary of the 'Made in China' tag, companies such as Coach, Paul Smith and Armani have shifted some of their manufacturing to China in recent years.\"\nBurberry makes up to 10 percent of its products in some of the more sophisticated factories across the border from Hong Kong, including about a quarter of its shirts and some of its accessories.\nNone of the three brands mentioned in the study would comment on their product sourcing methods.\nWhen queried directly about the percentage of their goods made in part or entirely in China, representatives of other randomly selected European luxury labels were vehement that their goods were made in Europe yet refused to give further details about their manufacturing process.\nTheir reticence is understandable, analysts say. \"One of the selling points of luxury is that the goods are handcrafted in Europe,\" said Nick Debnam, head of KPMG's consumer group in the Asia Pacific region and an author of the study.\nAnd Ben-Shabat at A.T. Kearney said: \"This is something all players will handle with care because of the sensitivity of consumers. Why pay $1,000 for handbag if it's not made in Italy?\"\n\"Typically, you will see that they maintain most production of high-end ranges in Europe but will try to produce a sport line in a low-cost location,\" she said. \"Or they will only do part of the work in the Far East and complete it in Europe.\"\nChina's own appetite for luxury goods may drive the country's growth in high-end manufacturing in the future, industry experts say.\nManagement advisers at Ernst and Young predict that by 2015, Chinese consumers will account for some $11.5 billion of luxury purchases, 29 percent of the industry's sales.\nChina already is the world's third-largest single market for luxury goods.\nEarlier this year, the World Luxury Association predicted that by 2009, 60 percent of all luxury goods would be made in the mainland - and some of that production doubtless would end up being bought by the Chinese themselves.\nYet even that scenario has its own problems. Mainland Chinese, in particular, relish the \"exotic\" frisson of owning something made in Italy or France, Debnam said.\nAside from the general negative connotation around the \"Made in China\" tag these days, Kotur-Marin is frank about the other obstacles for a brand using mainland factories. For example, it took plenty of patience and five samples to prototype her bag named Fane Hitchcock. The $575 feathered clutch is now a hit among the East Coast socialites that patronize Kotur but the factory initially could not understand what she was trying to do.\n\"It is easier to work in Italy because we share the same vocabulary\" of design, Kotur-Marin said. In China, \"you are working with many people who have never been to Bloomingdale's.\"\nWhich partly explains the presence of foreign employees at some of the top-end factories. Of the six that Kotur works with, one has Italian workers; two of the five manufacturers used by Totengco have some Europeans on the payroll.",

    "text": "Alice Rawsthorn on design for the unwealthiest 90 percent\n2007-04-29T05:00:00.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 The numbers seem nutty. There are 6.5 billion people on this planet, 90 percent of whom can't afford basic products and services. Half of them, nearly three billion people, don't have regular access to food, shelter or clean water. Yet whenever we think, or talk, about design, it's invariably about something that's intended to be sold to one of the privileged minority - the richest 10 percent.\nThe $1 million chaise longue. The fast car. The sleek computer. The beautiful book. The super-legible typeface. The toothbrush, power drill or MP3 player that's ingenious enough to be priced a little higher than its competitors. Museums, books, magazines, and blogs are stuffed with such things. Tens of thousands of designers devote their working lives to producing more.\nIt's not that there's anything wrong with designing things like that. But when you look at the bigger picture, doesn't it seem strange that so much time, energy and resources should be consumed by creating luxuries for relatively few people, when so many essentials are needed urgently by so many more? Why are designers so focussed on designing for the wealthiest 10 percent?\n\"That question always reminds me of the quote attributed to the bank robber, Willie Sutton, when someone asked him why he robbed banks,\" said Paul Polak, president of International Development Enterprises, a nonprofit organization that encourages innovation among poor farmers in developing countries. \"His answer was: 'Because that's where the money is.' \"\nFair enough. Designers are entitled to earn a living. But if you flick back through design history, they haven't all focused on the privileged minority. Think of R. Buckminster Fuller's emergency housing, or the sustainable products devised by Victor Papanek for use in developing countries. Their work has already had tremendous impact. Fuller's geodesic domes have provided shelter for hundreds of thousands of people in desperate circumstances; and Papanek is lauded as a pioneer of socially responsible design. Yet both have been treated as bit-part players in design history, as have other designers with similar goals.\nThat's changing. Designers, like so many other people, have become increasingly concerned about the plight of the needy majority, and many of them are now using their skills to address it. Some do so by devoting part of their time to voluntary work for nonprofit organizations, like Architecture for Humanity or Engineers Without Borders. Others have chosen to work full time in humanitarian or sustainable design.\nThe Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York is exploring this phenomenon in \"Design for the Other 90%,\" an exhibition opening Friday. It is hard to think of a more important or inspiring issue for a design museum to address right now. It is equally hard to imagine a more appropriate venue than the Cooper-Hewitt, whose home is the wisteria-clad Carnegie Mansion built on upper Fifth Avenue at the turn of the 20th century by the robber baron, Andrew Carnegie. Having made a fortune in the steel industry, Carnegie gave most of it away to endow schools and libraries. This is the first time the Cooper-Hewitt has devoted an exhibition to humanitarian design. \"It's a call to action,\" Cynthia Smith, the show's curator, explained. \"There's a big interest among design students and design professionals in finding socially responsible design solutions to the underpinnings of poverty.\"\n\"Design for the Other 90%\" analyzes 30 humanitarian design projects, all addressing basic needs in the areas of shelter, health, water, education, energy and transport. As anyone who has dipped into the quagmire of development knows, it is a ferociously political field with diverse, often conflicting opinions. Humanitarian design is no exception, but the Cooper-Hewitt hopes to skate around the schisms by presenting a diverse range of approaches.\nSome of the featured projects were invented by their users, others by design professionals, and many were collaborations. There are emergency solutions to disasters, like the biodegradable Global Village Shelters, which have been used as cheap temporary housing after hurricanes in Grenada and the United States, and are now pitched in Andrew Carnegie's garden. There are ingenious responses to ongoing problems, such as the Lifestraw, a drinking straw that helps to prevent the spread of typhoid, cholera and other waterborne diseases by making contaminated water drinkable; and the Ceramic Water Filter, developed by IDE in Cambodia and now manufactured there.\nMany humanitarian designers focus on helping the needy to enhance their earning potential by setting up new businesses, or running existing ones more efficiently. The Bamboo Treadle Pump enables poor farmers in countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia and India to pump up groundwater during the dry season. The Big Boda Load-Carrying Bicycle provides cheap transport in Kenya and Uganda to carry hundreds of pounds of cargo or two passengers using pedal-power. And thanks to the KickStart MoneyMaker Block Press, eight workers can produce up to 800 building blocks a day from soil and a small quantity of cement.\nThe level of technical complexity varies greatly from project to project. \"I was stunned by how simple, simple solutions could have a direct impact on people's lives,\" said Cynthia Smith. The Q Drum helps people to transport water more easily by rolling it along the ground, rather than carrying it. The Pot-in-Pot Cooler preserves fruit and vegetables by cooling them in an earthenware pot, which nestles inside another pot with wet sand filling the space between. And the One Laptop Per Child's X01 laptop computer is a technologically sophisticated attempt to alleviate poverty by designing a laptop cheap enough - between $100 and $150 - to be bought for children throughout the developing world by their governments. The impact on those children's education, and the rest of their lives, will be incalculable.\n\"This is an incredible project that has the potential to transform the lives of the people in greatest need,\" said Yves B\u00e9har, the San Francisco-based product designer who has developed the hardware for the XO1. \"How could any designer turn down the chance to be part of it?\"",

    "text": "'Fallujah,' a scathing account of U.S. assault\n2007-05-30T05:00:00.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 Soon after Falluja became a symbol of the horrific violence and aggressive American tactics in Iraq, the theater director Jonathan Holmes listened to a group of British generals and journalists conduct a post-mortem on what had happened during the assault on that town.\nHolmes, antiwar in his beliefs but a newcomer to war talk, was struck by the drama of the dialogue, the surprisingly articulate nature of the soldiers, even their charisma, as they thrashed out the what-ifs.\n\"This guy came and he looked like Sam Neill and he seemed to be sincerely devoted to doing things better,\" Holmes said of one of the British generals at that seminar, held at Oxford. \"I took down what they said, and it was immediately theatrical.\"\nThus the play \"Fallujah,\" now at the Old Truman Theater in London's East End, was born. The play (which uses the preferred British spelling in its title) is the latest entrant in the growing canon of documentary theater that concentrates on Iraq.\nHolmes has tried to convey the 2004 assault on Falluja, when the Americans used a ferocious strategy to re-establish control of the town after the massacre of four American contract workers, whose mutilated bodies were dragged through the streets and strung from a bridge.\nAt the time of the attack, described by officials as an attempt to pacify the place and empty it of enemy insurgents, many civilians fled, and journalists were kept out. In the aftermath the United States military said that most of those killed had been military-age males, and that the high number of dead attested to the accuracy of the marines.\nUsing what he calls \"eyewitness testimonies\" for the script and the overpowering sound effects of rocket fire and low-lying helicopters, Holmes has fashioned a play that focuses on the traumas of those trapped in the town.\nThe script is based, he said, on the accounts of people \u2014 soldiers, doctors, aid workers and fleeing civilians \u2014 who were in or around the scene. They include Jo Wilding, a British antiwar activist who went to Iraq to perform as a clown, and a freelance American journalist, Dahr Jamail, whose accounts were used by Holmes to create the character Sasha, a television reporter.\nSasha rails against the Americans and complains that some of her reports are not being shown because they are \"too passionate.\"\nThe characters also include an Iraqi aid worker, a Christian Iraqi cleric, American soldiers who spout hatred for the Iraqis and British soldiers who show contempt for the Americans.\nThe anti-American theme is relentless. A British soldier, a member of the coalition forces, calls the assault totally unacceptable and theorizes that \"war is an American way to teach geography.\" Holmes says the dialogue of the soldiers comes from several British military men who served in Iraq and helped him understand what had happened.\nThe play is being staged in a loftlike unused brewery that has been converted into a theater. The props \u2014 a Red Cross ambulance, hospital beds, rows of hazardous-materials suits and stylized corpses representing the contractors \u2014 are scattered across the floor and along the white walls.\nThe actors walk on and off a set that resembles an art installation, designed by the Paris-based artists Lucy and Jorge Orta. As they move around the space \u2014 an American sniper explaining that he must \"completely demoralize the enemy,\" agonized aid workers complaining that they can't reach the needy \u2014 the audience follows with them.\nFor those who don't want to stand, folding chairs are provided. And if the crowd around the actors gets too dense, television screens hung from the walls convey the action for those who cannot see well.\nWith antiwar sentiment running deeper in Britain than in the United States, the play has found a ready audience in its monthlong run, which ends on Saturday. Surprisingly, the conservative Daily Telegraph gushed with enthusiasm; The Guardian, a liberal daily, dismissed the effort as too preachy.\nOn a recent night the audience appeared to be decidedly sympathetic to the high-pitch antiwar message. Young men and women with backpacks and older peaceniks and locals from Brick Lane, where the theater is located in a heavily Bangladeshi neighborhood, mixed easily with the actors.\nHolmes, 31, a senior lecturer in the department of drama at Royal Holloway, University of London, attracted heavyweight help from the theater world. The Shakespearean actress Fiona Shaw gave advice on the script.\nImogen Stubbs, known in Britain for her classical stage performances, plays Jo, the British activist, and tells a compelling story of American soldiers preventing her ambulance from reaching a woman giving birth. At another point she is kidnapped and shakes uncontrollably with fear as Iraqi captors taunt her, saying they will fight for 100 years.\nThe denunciations of the United States are severe, particularly in the scenes that deal with the use of napalm in Falluja, an allegation made by leftist critics of the war but never substantiated.\nBut Holmes makes no pretense of objectivity. He writes in the introduction to a book about the play and its origins that the theater offers the chance to \"publicize the disgrace and to condemn it noisily.\"\nA starting point for the presentation was the work of the Ortas, whose installation art revolves around themes of society and the military. \"I had always seen her work as a set waiting for a play,\" Holmes said of Lucy Orta. \"When I approached her, she leapt at it.\"\nTo bring the drama closer to home, Holmes closes the play with Condoleezza Rice, played by a young Zimbabwean actress, Chipo Chung, who uses a Southern accent far more pronounced than that of the real secretary of state.\nChung, dressed in a trim \"Condi\" suit, stands at a pulpit of a Midwestern church and talks of how America's belief in faith will help overcome those people \"who are trying to shake our will.\" It's an unsettling ending after 90 minutes of blanket violence and injustice.",

    "text": "Lies, grief and a ticket home for illegal Indian migrants\n2007-04-04T05:00:00.000Z\nDUBAI \u2014 Twenty-four Indian men, two of them too young to shave, were sitting under the fake palm trees in the transit zone at the Dubai airport, dressed in track suits like a sports team - but one dejected by loss.\nThe 24 were making the last leg of a journey home to the farmlands of Punjab. They had not meant to return so soon. Most had left six or nine months ago on a desperate voyage along the newest route of migration from Asia to Europe, going by plane to the Middle East, then across Africa and by sea up the west coast toward Europe.\nBut the voyage ended in disaster, leaving them stranded in a dismal warehouse in Mauritania. Now they were being escorted home.\nAs they headed home they told the painful tale of their failed migration, just a few stories from the vast global saga of people in motion. Some spoke of horrors at the hands of people-smugglers - drug injections, beatings and knife-fights in the dark hull of an ailing ship. Yet, for all the fear and privation, there was scant relief in their return to their villages and farms. Ahead of them lay shame, vanished livelihoods and insurmountable debt.\n\"For a short time my family will be happy,\" Naresh, 37, a sugarcane farmer from Punjab, said on the flight that took the group from Tunis to Dubai. \"I feel very sad because of everything we have lost.\"\nAjay, 26, used to sell clothes in a Punjab market. His boy was just 15 days old when Ajay left home nine months ago. \"How can I show my face to my son?\" he asked.\nFarmers, shopkeepers and taxi drivers, these men are all victims of a criminal network that profited from their need to survive. Misled wholesale by gang members who recruited them where they lived, they were promised a quick and safe passage to Europe, with no mention of Africa or any journey by sea.\nWith the active support of their families, the Indians borrowed against everything they owned to raise the average $7,000 fee for a trip to Europe in the hope of few years' work abroad. Now the individuals were returning with just $500 each from an aid agency.\nSmugglers \"gave us a visa to go by airplane, not by ship,\" said Davinda, who claimed to be 18 but looked younger. \"They said it would take three days and it took six to nine months, and they behaved like Ali Baba.\"\nThe 24 were reluctant to give any details about the smugglers. Nervous after facing so many threats, they also asked that their full names not be given.\nIn the airport, the men stuck together in small bands, based on age or shared experience, as they wandered past Arab sheiks in flowing white robes, the Pakistan junior field hockey team in green blazers and drivers of passenger buggies in canary yellow uniforms.\nEach of the men from India had an envelope with $500 from the International Organization of Migration, an intergovernmental agency that helps distressed migrants go home. It had distributed the money between flights to ease the immediate pain of return.\nAmid the airport's duty-free opulence, some of them men contemplated buying cigarettes or whisky to resell on arrival in India. But facing questioning by Indian migration officials in New Delhi, and reluctant to attract more attention, none of them risked any purchases.\nAlthough affectionate among themselves, the men were mistrustful about the world they were negotiating after their ordeal. Fearful of being robbed on the way, the men time and again sought assurance that they would be accompanied, as planned, right through the New Delhi airport by Khaled Qadir, a representative of the International Organization of Migration.\nQadir said the men, although deeply disappointed, should not bear the full brunt of their failure.\nFirst, he said, they fell victim to smugglers.\nSecond, \"the families have a role to play,\" said Qadir, adding that people from such remote regions had few resources to help them judge the smugglers' claims. \"They are illiterate and uneducated, and it is very easy to give these people a rosy picture, telling them they can get to Greece or Spain and make thousands of dollars and make the family happy.\"\nThe migrants left India on separate journeys and landed in Africa, where they were among nearly 400 men rounded up by smugglers and ushered onto a boat whose fate this newspaper has chronicled. Their decrepit shrimp trawler, the Marine I, meandered at sea for 11 miserable weeks until it was rescued in international waters between West Africa and the Canary Islands of Spain, and towed to safety on the coast of Mauritania.\nAfter first withholding their names and nationalities, most of the larger group began to identify themselves and volunteered to go home. Issued temporary travel documents, the 24 are among 161 Indians whom the International Organization of Migration has now repatriated.\nGiving new details of the risks of migration, the Indians said they had been ferried out to the corroded hulk of the Marine I by night, in small boats, 25 to 35 at a time, fear mingling with relief at being on their way.\nNaresh, the sugar-cane farmer, waited six months in a house with 115 other men before embarking. He said that when they boarded, \"Conakry men\" tried to inject the migrants with drugs - 500-milligram doses of ampicillin - that they said would put them to sleep.\n\"They had injections and when we saw them we were very afraid,\" Naresh said. \"They were very big. In India we have very small injections.\"\nHe managed to resist, he said, but some of the passengers did not.\nAjay said he was on one of the last boats to reach the Marine I. He estimated that 330 men - Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Indians and Pakistanis - were already huddled in the hold. The heat grew stifling. There were no sanitary provisions and with the men below deck forbidden to come up for air, tensions quickly arose.\nSome of the passengers \"behaved very badly,\" Naresh said, adding that they were aggressive in commandeering the rations. \"They hit us and wouldn't give us food.\" Some had knives, he said.\nFed once every 36 hours on nothing but rice, the men shared one bottle of water a day between six. It was hot, Naresh said, but \"we drank just one drop at a time.\"\nThey slept where they sat on filthy mats. Some passengers smoked; some discarded their trash in the hold. The men had only salt water to wash their faces. Fever broke out. They were plagued by lice and rashes. \"I wanted to die,\" Naresh said.\nAfter weeks at sea the ship was buzzed by surveillance aircraft and at that point the captain took off, ostensibly to bring back food. The passengers never saw him again.\nA Spanish rescue vessel towed the ship to port, where the migrants spent weeks playing cards and doing aerobics classes run by the Red Cross. Time and again the men expressed their gratitude to Spain. \"The Spanish saved our lives,\" Naresh said.\nBut in the shelter, it slowly dawned on them that they would never make it to Europe, and the first of the 369 men asked to go home.\n\"I cried when the first group left, because I realized that we had no chance of going to Spain,\" said Mandeep, a bright-eyed 27-year-old who studied history and Punjabi. \"Then I understood that I, too, was going back, that everything was finished, that all my money was gone, and I had risked my life.\"\nThe roots of their tragedy in Africa developed in India, where for most of them their families had bought into their dreams of a passage to Europe. The men borrowed against their houses, their shops or the farms passed down the generations.\nDeepa, 24, a taxi driver who wound up trapped in a house in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, for 18 months, had earned 2,500 rupees, or $60, in Punjab. Lured by the promise of earning $800 a month as a driver in Europe, he pawned his taxi and his home.\nAjay was sold a promise made by an agent he met \"through a friend.\" The man told him that European immigration would never grant him a visa, whereas the agent could get him to Italy \"in two or three days.\"\nAjay's relatives pooled their jewelry and his parents mortgaged their home to provide a \"deposit\" for a pawn broker who loaned him $7,000 - the agent's fee. \"I don't know how to pay the money back,\" Ajay said in English that he had taught himself from a book. \"They said I must pay in one year. If I don't pay it back, they will take the house.\"\nHe is an experienced migrant, having worked for two years in a fast-food chain in Kuala Lumpur before returning to be married in Punjab. In Malaysia he made $200 a month and sent most of it to his family. He had counted on earning more in Europe.\nNaresh sold the sugarcane farm inherited from his grandparents to raise money for an agent who promised a trip to Greece.\nSonu, a wheat and rice farmer of 23, sold his buffalo and most of his farm after he \"made a friend\" in a Sikh temple who promised to get him to Europe for $7,000.\nMandeep sold two toy stores he had inherited. \"I am going to India, but my shops are gone,\" he said. \"What can I do? You tell me.\"\nDespite all they lost, many of the 24 said they would make another attempt to get to Europe.\nBut not Deepa. \"God saved my life,\" he said. \"I'm not going to try again.\"",

    "text": "Wanted by the regime, a monk escapes from Myanmar\n2007-10-25T05:00:00.000Z\nMAE SOT, Thailand \u2014 One of the organizers of the September protest marches in Myanmar, Ashin Kovida, a 24-year-old monk, escaped to Thailand last week by carrying a false identification card, dying his hair blond and wearing a crucifix.\nAshin Kovida crossed the border to Thailand illegally and said Thursday that he was planning to request refugee status. He is wanted by Myanmar's military government, which accuses him of storing explosives in his monastery in Yangon, the country's largest city.\nThe monk called that accusation absurd and detailed his role and his escape during a six-hour interview here Thursday.\nArticulate and lucid, Ashin Kovida offers an insight into what was nebulous at the time of the protests: who organized them and how. He paints a picture of bare-bones organization by a group of 15 monks in their 20s. He said he was the leader of the group and said he was inspired by videos of the popular uprisings in Yugoslavia against the government of Slobodan Milosevic.\nThe group received financial assistance from three well-known Burmese dissidents - an actor, a comedian and a poet - but did not receive any foreign assistance during their protests, Ashin Kovida said.\nEight of the 15 monks in his organizing committee are now \"missing,\" he said. Another six, he said, are hiding in Yangon.\nAlso arrested was Thin Thin Khaing, 42, whom he described as his adoptive mother and said was taken from her home in the early hours of Oct. 12. Her driver, Phoe Wa, was also detained along with their car, which carries the license plate number 4A/4000, he said.\nThin Thin Khaing has not formally adopted Ashin Kovida but served as his sponsor in the monkhood, a common practice in Buddhist countries in Southeast Asia.\nAshin Kovida said he believes the authorities have detained her to put pressure on him to give himself up.\nHlaing Moe Than, 37, a student activist in the 1988 uprising that came close to overthrowing the military government and a lead organizer of students in the September demonstrations, was shown a picture of Ashin Kovida on Thursday and confirmed his identity.\n\"He is one of the famous leaders among the Buddhist monks during the protests,\" Hlaing Moe Than said.\nAshin Kovida led daily protests through Yangon from Sept. 18 through Sept. 27, the day after the authorities began raiding monasteries. One of his main preoccupations, he said, was being able to feed the thousands of monks who had come to Yangon from other regions. He also worried about the presence of what he called \"fake monks,\" who he suspected were planted by the military government.\nThe spark for the demonstrations was the warning shots fired at monks on Sept. 5 in the central Burmese city of Pakokku.\n\"The first time I heard the information I was speechless,\" Ashin Kovida said. \"It was an unbelievable thing.\"\nHis fellow monks were outraged and looked for ways to respond. They decided to completely disengage themselves from the government, refusing all support and contacts.\nOlder monks and abbots urged the monks to carry out their protests inside the monasteries, but Ashin Kovida said younger monks defied these directives because they thought protesting in their cloistered world would not do any good.\nAshin Kovida reached out to students he had met during alms collections and began to plan the protest marches through Yangon.\n\"We realized that there was no leadership - a train must have a locomotive,\" he said.\nHe said he helped supervise the printing of pamphlets that would be distributed to monasteries. \"There were students and young people who were on our side,\" Ashin Kovida said. The students made up the pamphlets on their computers, printed them out and made photocopies.\n\"We had to do hundreds of them,\" he said. \"We delivered to all the monasteries in Rangoon. We tried to distribute to other regions as much as possible.\" Yangon is also known as Rangoon.\nOn Sept. 18, he said, he led the first cordon of monks through the streets in Yangon.\nOn Sept. 19, a crowd of about 2,000 protesters, including 500 monks, was sitting on the tiled floor inside the Sule Pagoda when Ashin Kovida stood up and addressed them.\n\"To continue demonstrations in a peaceful way we must have leadership,\" Ashin Kovida remembered saying. \"I call on 10 monks to come join me in the front.\"\nFifteen monks came forward, he said, the crowd cheering them on.\nThey formed what they called the Sangga Kosahlal Apahwe, the Monks Representative Group. Ashin Kovida was elected chairman.\nAshin Kovida then addressed the crowd again and gave a small speech.\n\"In this country at present we are facing hardships,\" Ashin Kovida recalled saying. \"People are starving, prices are rising. Under this military government there are so many human rights abuses. I call on people to come to join together with us. We will continue these protests peacefully every day until we win. If there are no human rights there is no value of a human.\"\nAshin Kovida said he led a week of daily protests, meeting with his group of organizers in the mornings and beginning the marches at noon. The demonstrations were peaceful and unhindered until Sept. 26, when the riot police blocked the monks' path, charged them and dispersed them.\n\"The police pulled the monks' robes and beat them,\" Ashin Kovida remembered. \"Nuns were stripped of their sarongs.\"\nDozens of monks were taken into detention; Ashin Kovida escaped by climbing over a brick wall.\nThe next day, Sept. 27, as the crackdown intensified, Ashin Kovida said he changed out of his robes and put on a sarong and short-sleeved shirt. He fled to a small village about 65 kilometers, or 40 miles, outside Yangon and with the help of relatives and friends hid in a small abandoned wooden hut.\nHe was so afraid of attracting the attention of neighbors that he suppressed his coughs and never left the house, which had no running water. For two weeks he lived in the dark hut, with no way of washing himself. He relieved himself using a plastic bucket. Friends occasionally dropped off food.\nOn Oct. 12, his adoptive mother was detained, news that was immediately relayed to him. He fled into the night, barefoot.\n\"I ran down a large road,\" he said. \"Whenever a car came I hid in the bushes.\"\nHe reached a friend's house before dawn, borrowed some clothes and headed back to Yangon, wearing a light-blue baseball cap, reading glasses and a sarong.\nFriends in Yangon helped him dye his hair, which was growing in, blond. He bought a crucifix in a local market and several days later boarded a bus heading toward the Thai border.\nHe passed about eight checkpoints - he can't remember exactly how many - on the way to the border. He used a fake identity card, and reached the border town of Myawadi on Oct. 17. The next morning he crossed the Moei River to Thailand in a boat.\nAshin Kovida faces almost certain detention if he returns to Myanmar. In the Oct. 18 edition of The New Light of Myanmar, the state-run newspaper, he was accused of hiding \"48 yellowish high-explosive TNT cartridges\" in his monastery.\n\"They just want to associate the monks with violence and terrorism,\" Ashin Kovida said.\n\"I have been in the monkhood since I was so young,\" he said. \"My whole life I have been studying only Buddhism and peaceful things.\"\nHe said his father is a carpenter and his mother runs a small market stall selling onion and chilies.

    "text": "Quiz Answers\n2007-01-07T05:00:00.000Z\nRUSSELL A. STONE\n1. c. Chaim Weizmann was Israel\u2019s first president. The president is head of state, and the prime minister is political leader. David Ben-Gurion was the first prime minister; Golda Meir was the first, and only, woman; Menachem Begin, elected almost 30 years after independence, was the first prime minister not from the Labor Party.\n2. c. The religious holidays of Sukkot, Shavuot and Passover are mentioned in the Book of Exodus, and were marked by pilgrimages to the temple. Hanukkah celebrates the rededication of the Temple of Jerusalem after the victory of the Maccabees over the Syrian Greeks. It is mentioned in First and Second Maccabees, ancient books that are not part of the Hebrew Bible. \n3. b. Hebrew and Arabic are the official languages of modern Israel. The English that appears on postage fulfills an international regulation that a country\u2019s name be rendered in the Latin alphabet. English on currency is a holdover from the days of the British Mandate, which controlled Palestine before Israel\u2019s independence. \n4. a. Principal holy sites include the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and Via Dolorosa (Christianity); Dome of the Rock and Al Aksa Mosque (Islam); Temple Mount and the Western Wall, or Wailing Wall (Judaism). So far as is known, the Buddha did not visit Jerusalem. \n5. d. Jerusalem\u2019s status is still in dispute. From 1949 until 1967, the city was divided. Jordan controlled the Old City and East Jerusalem. Israel controlled West Jerusalem. Since the 1967 war, all of the city has been controlled by Israel, and the municipal boundaries have been expanded. The ultimate status of Jerusalem has not been decided to the satisfaction of either Israel or the Palestine Authority.\nELLIOTT COLLA\n1. c. Ali Baba and Aladdin were likely French inventions of the 18th century, introduced in Antoine Galland\u2019s popular translation \u201cLes Milles et Une Nuits.\u201d Scheherazade, the vizier\u2019s daughter who must tell stories each night to keep her head, appears in the earliest accounts we have of \u201cNights,\u201d from 10th-century Baghdad. \n2. c. Amid sectarian strife, famine and underdevelopment in the second half of the 19th century, large numbers of Syrians and Lebanese began to migrate to Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. Thousands settled (the Arab-Brazilian community numbers more than a million today), but many returned after making their fortunes. This pattern helped fuse mainstays of Latin American culture \u2014 soccer, the bossa nova, mat\u00e9 \u2014 into the culture of the Levant.\n3. d. Albumen, silk and olive come from the Latin; the rest are from Arabic. The words in the first grouping derive from science: al-kuhl (powder) and al-kali (calcined ashes). Gauze and muslin are named for places associated with fabric manufacturing (Gaza and Mosul). Sherbet (shurbat) and artichoke (kharshuf) were foods imported into Europe through the Middle East. Magazine (makhzan), tariff (ta\u2019rif) and average (\u2019awar, denoting damaged goods) originated in the thriving mercantile world of medieval Islam.\n4. a. As a Soviet republic, Kazakhstan granted women the right to vote in 1924. Turkey did so in 1930, France in 1944 and Iran in 1963. Women still don\u2019t have the right to vote in Saudi Arabia.\n5. a. It was not until the mid-19th century that the demographics began to shift to a Sunni Muslim majority. Decades of war against Russia in the Caucasus, the great powers in the Mediterranean, and secessionists from the Balkans, Greece, the Levant and Egypt succeeded in breaking off Christian territories while concentrating the Muslim character of the remaining territories.\n6. d. The city had been home to a large Jewish community since its founding. Like many Jewish communities in the Arab world, Baghdad\u2019s began to emigrate in the wake of the violence that attended the founding of Israel in 1948.\nCOLONIZING LIBYA\n1. c. \n2. b.\n3. d.\n4. a.\n5. e. \nSources on the Italian domination of Libya include \u201cForgotten Voices: Power and Agency in Colonial and Postcolonial Libya,\u201d by Ali Abdullatif Ahmida, and \u201cItalian Colonialism,\u201d by Ruth Ben-Ghiat and Mia Fuller.\nSAMUEL HEILMAN\n1. False. Ultra-Orthodox Jews, known as haredim, are in principle neither, though some have recently supported nationalist parties in government coalitions. Haredim believe that the Jews\u2019 exile is God\u2019s punishment for sin, and only God, not man, can end this exile.\n2. True. Religious Zionists saw the 1967 war as a sign that God wanted Jews to settle their ancient homeland. When they did not, God brought the 1973 war to show that what could be given could be taken away. Islamists, on the other hand, saw the defeats as God\u2019s punishment for Muslim trust in the false gods of nationalism, socialism, pan-Arabism and the West. A return to Islam, in faith and practice, was essential to returning lost lands to the domain of Islam.\n3. True. Orthodox Jewish women cover their hair once they are married. All Muslim women are expected to. Both are expected to cover their bodies, legs and arms.\nJOHN VOLL\n1. c. The Great Pyramid was built as the tomb for Cheops, the Old Kingdom pharaoh of Egypt, in the third millennium B.C.E.\n2. b. Iran is ethnically diverse. Persians make up the largest percentage of the population (responsible estimates range from 35 to 51 percent). And Persians are not Arab, nor is their language Arabic. It\u2019s Persian. Arabs are, in fact, only about 3 percent of Iran\u2019s population. People tend to confuse religious and ethnic identity. Only about 15 percent of the world\u2019s Muslims are Arab. \n3. d. Benazir Bhutto led Pakistan; Tansu Ciller, Turkey; Begum Khaleda Zia and Sheik Hasina Wajed, Bangladesh.\n4. d. Syria became independent as a republic at the end of World War II. But Egypt was a monarchy when it became officially independent in 1922 (overthrow: 1952). As part of the World War I settlement, Britain created Iraq as a monarchy (overthrow: 1958). The United Nations created Libya as a monarchy in 1951 (overthrow: 1969).",

    "text": "Terror in the Weather Forecast\n2007-04-24T04:00:00.000Z\nToronto\nDOES climate change threaten international peace and security? The British government thinks it does. As this month\u2019s head of the United Nations Security Council, Britain convened a debate on the matter last Tuesday. One in four United Nations member countries joined the discussion \u2014 a record for this kind of thematic debate. \nCountries rich and poor, large and small, and from all continents \u2014 Bangladesh, Ghana, Japan, Mexico, much of Europe and, most poignantly, a large number of small island states endangered by rising seas \u2014 recognized the security implications of climate change. Some other developing countries \u2014 Brazil, Cuba and India and most of the biggest producers of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide, including China, Qatar and Russia \u2014 either questioned the very idea of such a link or argued that the Security Council is not the right place to talk about it.\nBut these skeptics are wrong. Evidence is fast accumulating that, within our children\u2019s lifetimes, severe droughts, storms and heat waves caused by climate change could rip apart societies from one side of the planet to the other. Climate stress may well represent a challenge to international security just as dangerous \u2014 and more intractable \u2014 than the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the cold war or the proliferation of nuclear weapons among rogue states today.\nCongress and senior military leaders are taking heed: Legislation under consideration in both the Senate and the House calls for the director of national intelligence to report on the geopolitical implications of climate change. And last week a panel of 11 retired generals and admirals warned that climate change is already a \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d in the world\u2019s fragile regions, \u201cexacerbating conditions that lead to failed states \u2014 the breeding grounds for extremism and terrorism.\u201d\nAddressing the question of scientific uncertainty about climate change, Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, a former Army chief of staff who is now retired, said: \u201cSpeaking as a soldier, we never have 100 percent certainty. If you wait until you have 100 percent certainty, something bad is going to happen on the battlefield.\u201d\nIn the future, that battlefield is likely to be complex and hazardous. Climate change will help produce the kind of military challenges that are difficult for today\u2019s conventional forces to handle: insurgencies, genocide, guerrilla attacks, gang warfare and global terrorism.\nIn the 1990s, a research team I led at the University of Toronto examined links between various forms of environmental stress in poor countries \u2014 cropland degradation, deforestation and scarcity of fresh water, for example \u2014 and violent conflict. In places as diverse as Haiti, Pakistan, the Philippines and South Africa, we found that severe environmental stress multiplied the pain caused by such problems as ethnic strife and poverty.\nRural residents who depend on local natural resources for their livelihood become poorer, while powerful elites take control of \u2014 and extract exorbitant profits from \u2014 increasingly valuable land, forests and water. As these resources in the countryside dwindle, people sometimes join local rebellions against landowners and government officials. In mountainous areas of the Philippines, for instance, deforestation, soil erosion and depletion of soil nutrients have increased poverty and helped drive peasants into the arms of the Communist New People\u2019s Army insurgency.\nOther times, people migrate in large numbers to regions where resources seem more plentiful, only to fight with the people already there. Or they migrate to urban slums, where unemployed young men can be primed to join criminal gangs or radical political groups. \nClimate change will have similar effects, if nations fail to aggressively limit carbon dioxide emissions and develop technologies and institutions that allow people to cope with a warmer planet.\nThe recent report of Working Group II of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identifies several ways warming will hurt poor people in the third world and hinder economic development there more generally. Large swaths of land in subtropical latitudes \u2014 zones inhabited by billions of people \u2014 will experience more drought, more damage from storms, higher mortality from heat waves, worse outbreaks of agricultural pests and an increased burden of infectious disease.\nThe potential impact on food output is a particular concern: in semiarid regions where water is already scarce and cropland overused, climate change could devastate agriculture. (There is evidence that warming\u2019s effect on crops and pastureland is a cause of the Darfur crisis.) Many cereal crops in tropical zones are already near their limits of heat tolerance, and temperatures even a couple of degrees higher could lead to much lower yields.\nBy weakening rural economies, increasing unemployment and disrupting livelihoods, global warming will increase the frustrations and anger of hundreds of millions of people in vulnerable countries. Especially in Africa, but also in some parts of Asia and Latin America, climate change will undermine already frail governments \u2014 and make challenges from violent groups more likely \u2014 by reducing revenues, overwhelming bureaucracies and revealing how incapable these governments are of helping their citizens.\nWe\u2019ve learned in recent years that such failure can have consequences around the world and that great powers can\u2019t always isolate themselves from these consequences. It\u2019s time to put climate change on the world\u2019s security agenda.",

    "text": "A crucifix on his neck, monk escapes Myanmar\n2007-10-25T05:00:00.000Z\nMAE SOT, Thailand \u2014 One of the main organizers of the September protest marches in Myanmar, Ashin Kovida, a 24-year-old Buddhist monk, escaped to Thailand last week by carrying a false identification card, dying his hair blond and wearing a crucifix.\nOn Thursday, Ashin Kovida offered details of his harrowing escape and insights into what has remained a central question about the September protests: Who organized the orderly lines of saffron-robed monks who marched through Yangon - and how.\nAshin Kovida crossed the border to Thailand illegally and said Thursday that he was planning to request refugee status. He is wanted by Myanmar's military government, which accuses him of storing explosives in his monastery in Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar.\nThe monk called that accusation absurd.\nIn a six-hour interview in this border town, he painted a picture of a bare-bones organization, a group of 15 monks in their 20s who organized the September demonstrations. He said he had been elected leader of the group and had been inspired by videos of the popular uprisings in Yugoslavia against the government of Slobodan Milosevic.\nThe group received financial help from three well-known Burmese dissidents - an actor, a comedian and a poet - but did not receive any foreign assistance during their protests, Ashin Kovida said.\nEight of the 15 monks in his organizing committee are missing, he said. The other six, he said, are hiding in Yangon.\nKnown to have been arrested was Thin Thin Khaing, 42, whom he described as his adoptive mother. He said she was taken from her home in the early hours of Oct. 12. Her driver, Phoe Wa, was also detained, and their car impounded, he said.\nThin Thin Khaing has not formally adopted Ashin Kovida but served as his sponsor in the monkhood. Ashin Kovida said he believed that the authorities had detained her to put pressure on him to give himself up.\nHlaing Moe Than, 37, a lead organizer of students in the September demonstrations who also fled to Thailand, was shown a picture of Ashin Kovida on Thursday and confirmed the more recent refugee's identity.\n\"He is one of the famous leaders among the Buddhist monks during the protests,\" Hlaing Moe Than said.\nAshin Kovida led daily protests through Yangon from Sept. 18 through Sept. 27, the day after the authorities began raiding monasteries.\nOne of his main preoccupations, he said, was being able to feed the thousands of monks who had come to Yangon from other regions. He also worried about the presence of what he called \"fake monks,\" who he suspected had been planted by the military government.\nThe spark for the demonstrations was warning shots fired by the police at monks on Sept. 5 in the central Burmese city of Pakokku.\n\"The first time I heard the information, I was speechless,\" Ashin Kovida said. \"It was an unbelievable thing.\"\nHis fellow monks were outraged and looked for ways to respond. They decided to disengage themselves completely from the government, refusing all alms, support and contacts.\nOlder monks and abbots urged the monks to carry out their protests inside the monasteries, but Ashin Kovida said younger monks had defied those directives thinking that protesting within their cloistered world would not do any good.\nAshin Kovida reached out to students he had met during alms collections and began to plan the protest marches through Yangon.\n\"We realized that there was no leadership,\" he said. \"A train must have a locomotive.\"\nHe said he had helped supervise the printing of pamphlets that would be distributed to monasteries, titled: \"The monks will come out onto the streets.\"\n\"There were students and young people who were on our side,\" Ashin Kovida said. The students made up the pamphlets on their computers, printed them out and made photocopies.\n\"We had to do hundreds of them,\" he said. \"We delivered to all the monasteries in Rangoon. We tried to distribute to other regions as much as possible.\" Yangon is also known as Rangoon.\nOn Sept. 18, he said, he led the first line of monks through the streets in Yangon.\nOn Sept. 19, a crowd of about 2,000 protesters, including 500 monks, was sitting on the tiled floor inside the Sule Pagoda when Ashin Kovida stood up and addressed them.\n\"To continue demonstrations in a peaceful way we must have leadership,\" Ashin Kovida remembered saying. \"I call on 10 monks to come join me in the front.\"\nFifteen monks came forward, he said, the crowd cheering them on.\nThey formed what they called the Sangga Kosahlal Apahwe, the Monks Representative Group. Ashin Kovida was elected chairman.\nAshin Kovida then addressed the crowd again with a short speech.\n\"In this country at present we are facing hardships,\" Ashin Kovida recalled saying. \"People are starving, prices are rising. Under this military government there are so many human rights abuses. I call on people to come to join together with us. We will continue these protests peacefully every day until we win. If there are no human rights there is no value of a human.\"\nAshin Kovida said he had led a week of daily protests, meeting with his group of organizers in the mornings and beginning the marches at noon. He heard reports on the Burmese-language service of the BBC about other monks who had organized themselves but he never met those groups.\nThe demonstrations were peaceful and unhindered until Sept. 26, when the riot police blocked the monks' path, charged them and dispersed them.\n\"The police pulled the monks' robes and beat them,\" Ashin Kovida remembered. \"Nuns were stripped of their sarongs.\"\nDozens of monks were taken into detention; Ashin Kovida escaped by climbing over a brick wall.\nThe next day, Sept. 27, as the crackdown intensified, Ashin Kovida said, he changed out of his robes and put on a sarong and short-sleeve shirt. He fled to a small village about 65 kilometers, or 40 miles, outside Yangon and with the help of relatives and friends hid in a small abandoned wooden hut.\nHe was so afraid of attracting the attention of neighbors that he suppressed his coughs and never left the house, which had no running water. For two weeks he lived in the dark hut, with no way of bathing. He relieved himself using a plastic bucket. Friends occasionally dropped off food.\nOn Oct. 12, when his adoptive mother was detained, the news was immediately relayed to him. He fled into the night, barefoot.\n\"I ran down a large road,\" he said. \"Whenever a car came I hid in the bushes.\"\nHe reached a friend's house before dawn, borrowed some clothes and headed back to Yangon, wearing a light-blue baseball cap, reading glasses and a sarong.\nFriends in Yangon helped him dye his hair, which was growing in, blond. He bought a crucifix in a local market and several days later boarded a bus heading toward the Thai border.\nHe passed about eight checkpoints - he could not remember exactly how many - on the way to the border. He used a fake identity card, and reached the border town of Myawadi on Oct. 17. The next morning he crossed the Moei River to Thailand in a boat.\nAshin Kovida faces almost certain detention if he returns to Myanmar.\nIn the Oct. 18 edition of The New Light of Myanmar, the state-run newspaper, he was accused of hiding \"48 yellowish high-explosive TNT cartridges\" in his monastery.\n\"They just want to associate the monks with violence and terrorism,\" Ashin Kovida said.\n\"I have been in the monkhood since I was so young,\" he said. \"My whole life I have been studying only Buddhism and peaceful things.\"\nHe said his father is a carpenter and his mother runs a small market stall selling onion and chilies. Both live in Rakhine State, in northwest Myanmar near the border with Bangladesh.\nMany in Myanmar will not be able to forgive the government for the crackdown on monks, he said.\n\"It's a stain on the history of Burma,\" Ashin Kovida said. \"Inside Burma now, a lot of students and people are organizing the next step against the SPDC\" - the acronym for the military government. \"I think it will be the same time as the Olympics in China,\" he said, referring to the 2008 Games in Beijing. \"That is my own opinion.\"\nPornnapa Wongakanit contributed reporting from Mae Sot.",

    "text": "An Assault in Iraq, a Stage Hit in London\n2007-05-29T04:00:00.000Z\n LONDON, May 28 \u2014 Soon after Falluja became a symbol of the horrific violence and aggressive American tactics in Iraq, the theater director Jonathan Holmes listened to a group of British generals and journalists conduct a post-mortem on what had happened during the assault on that town. \n Mr. Holmes, antiwar in his beliefs but a newcomer to war talk, was struck by the drama of the dialogue, the surprisingly articulate nature of the soldiers, even their charisma, as they thrashed out the what-ifs. \n \u201cThis guy came and he looked like Sam Neill and he seemed to be sincerely devoted to doing things better,\u201d Mr. Holmes said of one of the British generals at that seminar, held at Oxford. \u201cI took down what they said, and it was immediately theatrical.\u201d \n Thus the play \u201cFallujah,\u201d now at the Old Truman Theater in London\u2019s East End, was born. The play (which uses the preferred British spelling in its title) is the latest entrant in the growing canon of documentary theater that concentrates on Iraq. \n Mr. Holmes has tried to convey the 2004 assault on Falluja, when the Americans used a ferocious strategy to re-establish control of the town after the massacre of four American contract workers, whose mutilated bodies were dragged through the streets and strung from a bridge. \n At the time of the attack, described by officials as an attempt to pacify the place and empty it of enemy insurgents, many civilians fled, and journalists were kept out. In the aftermath the United States military said that most of those killed had been military-age males, and that the high number of dead attested to the accuracy of the marines. \n Using what he calls \u201ceyewitness testimonies\u201d for the script and the overpowering sound effects of rocket fire and low-lying helicopters, Mr. Holmes has fashioned a play that focuses on the traumas of those trapped in the town. \n The script is based, he said, on the accounts of people \u2014 soldiers, doctors, aid workers and fleeing civilians \u2014 who were in or around the scene. They include Jo Wilding, a British antiwar activist who went to Iraq to perform as a clown, and a freelance American journalist, Dahr Jamail, whose accounts were used by Mr. Holmes to create the character Sasha, a television reporter. \n Sasha rails against the Americans and complains that some of her reports are not being shown because they are \u201ctoo passionate.\u201d \nThe characters also include an Iraqi aid worker, a Christian Iraqi cleric, American soldiers who spout hatred for the Iraqis and British soldiers who show contempt for the Americans. \n The anti-American theme is relentless. A British soldier, a member of the coalition forces, calls the assault totally unacceptable and theorizes that \u201cwar is an American way to teach geography.\u201d Mr. Holmes says the dialogue of the soldiers comes from several British military men who served in Iraq and helped him understand what had happened. \n The play is being staged in a loftlike unused brewery that has been converted into a theater. The props \u2014 a Red Cross ambulance, hospital beds, rows of hazardous-materials suits and stylized corpses representing the contractors \u2014 are scattered across the floor and along the white walls. \n The actors walk on and off a set that resembles an art installation, designed by the Paris-based artists Lucy and Jorge Orta. As they move around the space \u2014 an American sniper explaining that he must \u201ccompletely demoralize the enemy,\u201d agonized aid workers complaining that they can\u2019t reach the needy \u2014 the audience follows with them. \n For those who don\u2019t want to stand, folding chairs are provided. And if the crowd around the actors gets too dense, television screens hung from the walls convey the action for those who cannot see well. \nWith antiwar sentiment running deeper in Britain than in the United States, the play has found a ready audience in its monthlong run, which ends on Saturday. Surprisingly, the conservative Daily Telegraph gushed with enthusiasm; The Guardian, a liberal daily, dismissed the effort as too preachy. \n On a recent night the audience appeared to be decidedly sympathetic to the high-pitch antiwar message. Young men and women with backpacks and older peaceniks and locals from Brick Lane, where the theater is located in a heavily Bangladeshi neighborhood, mixed easily with the actors. \n Mr. Holmes, 31, a senior lecturer in the department of drama at Royal Holloway, University of London, attracted heavyweight help from the theater world. The Shakespearean actress Fiona Shaw gave advice on the script.\n Imogen Stubbs, known in Britain for her classical stage performances, plays Jo, the British activist, and tells a compelling story of American soldiers preventing her ambulance from reaching a woman giving birth. At another point she is kidnapped and shakes uncontrollably with fear as Iraqi captors taunt her, saying they will fight for 100 years. \n The denunciations of the United States are severe, particularly in the scenes that deal with the use of napalm in Falluja, an allegation made by left-wing critics of the war but never substantiated. \n But Mr. Holmes makes no pretense of objectivity. He writes in the introduction to a book about the play and its origins that the theater offers the chance to \u201cpublicize the disgrace and to condemn it noisily.\u201d He strove for authority more than authenticity, he said. \n Like another documentary play, \u201cGuant\u00e1namo: \u2018Honor Bound to Defend Freedom,\u2019 \u201d \u201cFallujah\u201d breaks with the usual approach in such productions of having the actors sitting on the stage reading scripts. \n \u201cOn a purely theatrical level, I wanted to do something different from four actors delivering monologues,\u201d Mr. Holmes said. \u201cThat approach is like a radio play, quite sad. It gives a sense of avoiding theatricality because of the serious material. I wanted a way to have people think about it more abstractly.\u201d\n A starting point for the presentation was the work of the Ortas, whose installation art revolves around themes of society and the military. \u201cI had always seen her work as a set waiting for a play,\u201d Mr. Holmes said of Lucy Orta. \u201cWhen I approached her, she leapt at it.\u201d \nTo bring the drama closer to home, Mr. Holmes closes the play with Condoleezza Rice, played by a young Zimbabwean actress, Chipo Chung, who uses a Southern accent far more pronounced than that of the real secretary of state. \nMs. Chung, dressed in a trim \u201cCondi\u201d suit, stands at a pulpit of a Midwestern church and talks of how America\u2019s belief in faith will help overcome those people \u201cwho are trying to shake our will.\u201d It\u2019s an unsettling ending after 90 minutes of blanket violence and injustice.

    "text": "Tudor Charm Loses Ground to McMansion Space\n2007-06-10T04:00:00.000Z\nJAMAICA ESTATES, in east-central Queens, hugs a ridge whose steepness discouraged early settlement. Even after that changed, in the early 20th century, and the neighborhood became a car-friendly suburb, residents tended to preserve the trees, which by that point were old and numerous.\nThey still are. Jamaica Estates\u2019 current tree population is 5,746, mostly maples, oaks and ashes, but also Kentucky coffee trees and Japanese snowbells, according to a recent census from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. (For perspective, the Midtown Manhattan ZIP code 10036 has 784 trees.)\nBut that abundance may finally be under threat, as new arrivals are chopping trees down to make way for large-scale additions, according to brokers and longtime residents. One in five buyers are going a step further, they say, and razing houses, especially the area\u2019s trademark Tudors, some adorned with witch\u2019s-hat towers and leaded-glass windows.\n\u201cA lot of people that are new to the community don\u2019t respect the traditions,\u201d said Edward Morrill, who lives with his wife, Joyce, in a 2,000-square-foot home, built in 1935, that has three bedrooms, two and a half baths and a facade with a crosshatch of timbers. The home, which cost $62,000 in 1973, was recently assessed at $1.1 million, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s distasteful and insensitive to the history here and what we call the quality of life,\u201d Mr. Morrill said.\nWhat it is not, though, is illegal. Even under the neighborhood\u2019s R1 and R2 zoning, which requires generous space between residences, most lots in Jamaica Estates are ample enough to hold larger houses. \nNor does the area have landmark status, the ultimate protection against teardowns in areas with restrictive zoning. In an unofficial referendum two years ago, officials said, the community clearly voiced resistance to becoming a landmark. \nModern families sometimes desire more space than diminutive older homes offer, said Isaac Abraham, who in April closed on a 1940s brick colonial in Jamaica Estates, for $750,000. Its 2,300 square feet are insufficient for himself, his wife, Elita, and their three children, so the Abrahams are adding 700 square feet, including a bedroom and a basement. He said he expected the $350,000 renovation to increase the property\u2019s value to $1.6 million. \n\u201cThe homes need to be renovated for younger tastes,\u201d said Mr. Abraham, a jewelry importer in Manhattan whose previous address was in nearby Fresh Meadows, where he lived on one 1,500-square-foot floor of a two-family home.\nWith its sidewalks and side yards, Jamaica Estates reminds him of his childhood home in Great Neck, N.Y., in nearby Nassau County. \nAnother lure was the close-knit group of Jewish immigrants from Bukhara, Uzbekistan, his family homeland. (There are as many as 1,000 here and nearby, said Corey Bearak of the Northeast Queens Jewish Community Council.) Mr. Abraham\u2019s family is not fully unpacked, he said, but its religious life has found focus with two synagogues.\nAnd although the presence of construction equipment may concern some neighbors, he said, the plan is to retain original details like the slate roof and dentil moldings. \u201cThe house has great craftsmanship,\u201d Mr. Abraham said. \u201cWe are trying to keep as much as possible.\u201d\nBut while he and other residents ponder how extensively to alter their single-family homes, zoning issues in the southern part of the neighborhood have the potential for a much greater impact. The city seeks to loosen zoning on Hillside Avenue to allow more high-rises, as part of a 368-block master plan affecting several neighborhoods in the borough.\nAlthough many residents say Hillside\u2019s rough commercial strip needs revitalization, there is concern that adding thousands of residents could overwhelm the subway, the sewers and the schools.\nIn March, Community Board 8, which covers Jamaica Estates, voted 36 to 0 to reject the zoning plan, echoing the opinion of the Jamaica Estates Civic Association, a 700-member group. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the size of buildings overshadowing the private homes in Jamaica Estates,\u201d said Michael Bookbinder, the association\u2019s president and a 61-year resident. \u201cWe actually think the area should be downzoned.\u201d\nWhat You\u2019ll Find\nThough Hillside may be shabby, the area becomes well tended immediately after a turn onto Midland Parkway, which curves through Jamaica Estates\u2019 historic heart. \nThis summer, Midland\u2019s grassy mall will undergo the final phase of a $500,000 renovation, restoring the cupola-topped gatehouse that doubles as a World War II memorial.\nRadiating off Midland are roads lined with detached single-family houses, which make up 80 percent of Jamaica Estates\u2019 stock. (The rest is mostly co-ops, clustered in prewar midrises along Wexford Terrace.) \nBecause they went up as part of a planned community, the houses have many common traits. Most are set back on rises, reached by twisting stone stairs. Wooden front doors, many with large hinges and latches, recall the English countryside by way of J. R. R. Tolkien, so a passer-by might be forgiven for half-expecting to see a hobbit. \nBut the area is not exclusively Tudor. Craftsman, Cape Cod and Mediterranean homes, detailed with terra cotta, add stylistic variety. \nAs a microcosm of Queens, the neighborhood is ethnically diverse; 45 percent of its approximately 14,000 residents are foreign-born, according to the 2000 census. Bangladeshis make up 11 percent of the population, while Filipinos are 10 percent. Haitians represent 7 percent; Guyanese, 5 percent; Russians, 4 percent. Forty-three percent of residents identify themselves as white.\nWhat You\u2019ll Pay\nThere are few bargains in Jamaica Estates, though homes at its edges, near Homelawn Street or in the Cunningham Park section, are generally more affordable, trading for $725,000, brokers say.\nThe more coveted homes, along Henley and Aberdeen Roads, can fetch $2.25 million, and those with double lots are the ripest targets for teardowns, according to brokers.\nA typical property is a 1930s home on Dumfries Place that closed in April, with three bedrooms, an eat-in kitchen and a detached two-car garage, for $900,000, said Julia Shildkret, who has been selling homes in Jamaica Estates for two decades. At that price, she said, \u201cthese aren\u2019t for first-time buyers, but people who have already sold a home.\u201d \nUnlike the white-hot Forest Hills to the west, Jamaica Estates has seen its prices climb slowly in the last two years, about 5 percent a year. They are about 25 percent higher than they were in 2002, said David Yudell, the sales manager at Astor Brokerage.\nIn Jamaica Estates\u2019 headiest year, 2005, homes routinely sold in two weeks. It may now take three months, Mr. Yudell said.\nAs for tax, there\u2019s a world of difference between Jamaica Estates and towns in Nassau County, despite the proximity. Expect to pay about $5,000 a year on a Tudor here, not including city income tax, Ms. Shildkret said. Such a house in Garden City would cost $15,000 in taxes (including income tax).\nWhat to Do\nCunningham Park, which brushes Jamaica Estates\u2019 eastern side, once held the Long Island Motor Parkway, the nation\u2019s first highway, according to Robert Miller, who gives walking tours of the area.\nThe remaining 3.5 miles of the road are used today by joggers and strollers. Nearby, in late May, a tent for the Big Apple Circus towered beyond a baseball diamond.\nClose together on Hillside Avenue are places to savor Colombian plantains, halal Chinese food and pizza. Across the street is a deli decorated with a \u201cWatch Live Cricket\u201d sign.\nUnion Turnpike has dry cleaners, pharmacies and a bookshop, as well as King Yum, a Polynesian restaurant with a decorative thatched roof over the bar. It offers karaoke on Wednesdays and Fridays, and its \u201cFive O\u201d special, with crab, mushrooms, and noodles, costs $17.50.\nThe Schools\nThe Holliswood School on Radnor Road teaches prekindergarten through fifth grade. Last year, on the annual state exams, 77 percent of third-graders were found proficient in English, 88 percent in math.\nAbigail Adams School, on 84th Avenue, offers kindergarten through fifth. Of third-graders, 94 percent were proficient in English, 89 percent in math. \nGeorge J. Ryan Junior High School, on 175th Street in Fresh Meadows, enrolls more than 1,300 students, of whom 28 went on last year to the Bronx High School of Science, where admission requires a test. For students who stay close, there is Francis Lewis High School, which enrolls about 4,200. On the class of 2006\u2019s SAT, students averaged 471 on the verbal section, 536 on math and 463 on writing, versus 493 verbal, 510 math and 483 writing statewide.\nEighty percent of seniors graduate, compared with 60 percent citywide, and 95 percent attend two- or four-year colleges, said Andrew Jacob, an Education Department spokesman. Greek, Hebrew and Korean are taught, and extracurricular offerings include a debate team, jazz band and Muslim student union. There are 13 varsity-level sports.\nPrivate Jewish and Catholic schools are also popular, as is the United Nations International School on Croydon Road, which instructs 190 students from kindergarten through Grade 8. For high school, many transfer to the school\u2019s Manhattan campus.\nThe Commute\nThe end of the line for the F train is at Hillside Avenue and 179th Street, and subways deliver riders to Midtown in 35 minutes.\nThe QM1A bus runs locally along Union Turnpike, then express to Midtown from the intersection of Main Street. Another option is the Q46, which also follows Union and drops riders at a stop for the F and E trains on Queens Boulevard.\nThe History\nTimothy L. Woodruff, New York\u2019s lieutenant governor under Theodore Roosevelt, developed Jamaica Estates in the early 1900s, billing the 503-acre community as a close-in version of Tuxedo Park, N.Y., the private enclave in Orange County.\nThe developer most closely associated with the neighborhood today is probably Donald J. Trump, who grew up in a colonial on Midland.\nGoing Forward\nDespite the new kosher market on Union and a few small stores on Hillside, the area could use a better selection of food stores. ",

In parts of Antarctica that are warming, coastal ice shelves and inland ice sheets have been disintegrating and surging seaward in ways that could hint at a faster rise in global sea levels in coming decades.\nBut at both poles, scientists say, questions still outnumber answers. \nThe project will formally begin Thursday. Opening ceremonies will be held today in Washington, London and Strasbourg, France.\nThis is just the fourth such integrated Arctic and Antarctic science effort since 1881.

Marburger III, the science adviser to President Bush, said the United States had a vital interest in studies at both poles. \n\u201cThe North Pole is in our backyard,\u201d he said in an e-mail message. \u201cThe U.S. has huge geopolitical interests in the Arctic region, and we need to understand the changes that are taking place there. Many other countries have direct economic interests in the Arctic, and all are served by joining forces in I.P.Y. research.

    "text": "Malaysia's endangered national car looks to Mecca\n2007-11-22T05:00:00.000Z\nMalaysia's perennially ailing national carmaker Proton may try to revive its fortunes by pointing itself toward Mecca, quite literally. The company that controls the troubled automaker may seek ties with companies in Iran and Turkey to produce an \"Islamic\" car, complete with Muslim accessories for motoring believers.\nKhazanah Nasional, the company that controls Proton, is looking for a savior since talks with German carmaker Volkswagen have been called off, according to a joint statement the two companies issued Tuesday, ending Proton's latest search for a global partner that would give it economies of scale to help it survive in an increasingly free market.\nInstead, Khazanah officials say, they may seek ties with carmakers in Turkey and Iran to produce Islamic cars using GPS to locate Mecca, and featuring compartments for storing the Koran, headscarfs and prayer rugs, Proton's managing director, Syed Zainal Abidin, told reporters.\nThe idea calls up a scheme cooked up by former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and then-finance minister Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah in the 1980s to create Islamic toilets by rebranding Japanese toilets that shoot jets of cleansing water up the privates at the press of a button (located on the left), as Muslims regard toilet paper as unclean. Despite visions of sales across Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia and other Islamic countries, the idea did not turn Malaysia into an international toilet exporter.\n\"The car will have all the Islamic features and should be meant for export purposes. We will identify a car that we can develop to be produced in Malaysia, Iran or Turkey,\" Syed Zainal said.\nThat cut little ice with market analysts or the stock market. Proton's shares promptly dived by nearly 20 percent on news of the collapsed negotiations and of another report that the possibility of a tie-up with the US's General Motors was also off.\nPrime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who originally was inclined to kill the ailing national car when he came into office in 2003, told reporters in Singapore that Proton was \"doing well,\" and added that no government bailout was in the works. \"Proton has started turning around now,\" he told a press conference, arguing that the export campaign would save it.\nThat was a statement made pretty much for domestic consumption, in the face of considerable evidence to the contrary. The state-controlled company recently endured its fifth straight quarterly loss, of US$13.8 million. Proton lost $169 million in the 2007 financial year, beset by inroads made by multinational automakers triggered by Malaysia's agreement to abide by the rules of the World Trade Organization.\nProton's market share continues to slide from its onetime high of more than 60 percent in 2002 to 30 percent by 2006. Since it came into existence in 1985, the car project has lost billions of dollars, and much more in opportunity costs to consumers, who were either forced to buy it or pay staggering tariffs to buy cars built or imported by global carmakers.\nThe Asia Free Trade Area has mandated tariff reductions to a maximum of 5 percent by next year, which should spell a further drop in sales. As tariffs have fallen, Proton has been under attack from cheaper, newer and better cars from Korea and Japan. Nissan and Hyundai are popular options and have chipped away by introducing locally produced models at competitive prices.\nBut, Kazanah officials say, improving domestic and export sales, particularly from the car company's Persona models, led to the decision to call off negotiations with Volkswagen. \"The government is therefore of the view that Proton's management should be allowed to continue with its plans to further strengthen the company,\" management said in a press release.\n\"The public is taking up the new Proton models like never before. I think that's great, it was heart-breaking to see the shape Proton and its vendors were in,\" Said a Kuala Lumpur-based analyst. \"Like it or not, Proton has costs us billions, so simply shutting it down is an option too hard to swallow. The question is whether or not Proton executives can get their act together and sustain a long-term recovery to profitability. Is this just a brief respite? Shouldn't they be thinking strategic global initiatives? Only an international technologically advanced partner can lift Proton.\"\nTurkish carmakers don't cause investors' blood to surge. But in the face of American churlishness over Iran's supposedly innocent plans to go nuclear for power, the country's auto industry is doing amazingly well. With a tenth of the world's oil reserves, Iran is home to the Middle East's biggest car industries, building a million vehicles a year for a market that is as big as Australia's and three times that of Indonesia, according to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald. Korea's Kia is producing a version of its Pride in Turkey, Peugeot has a version of its popular 405 and Renault invested US $300 million with the automaker Saipa.\nTalk to the contrary, there is no indication that Islamic livery would produce a buying spree amongst any but the most faithful, any more than the Islamic toilet became an export item, and it appears that the Iranians and Turks are fully capable of producing their own Islamic models. But as with everything in Malaysia, politics plays a more important role than economics in industrial policy.\nProton was the focal point of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's dream to turn Malaysia into an industrial powerhouse. But when Abdullah Badawi took over in 2003 and began cutting away at many of Mahathir's favorite projects, Proton was in peril. But Abdullah Badawi has been forced to back away from his vows to rid the country of huge white elephant projects. As the prime minister's political capital has been devalued by his reputation for indecision, he has increasingly backed away from the bold pronouncements he made when he came to power.\nFor four years, Proton has been in talks with potential foreign players, including GM, Volkswagen and, PSA Peugeot Citroen. Malaysia's policymakers in an election year are not willing to face the possibility that as many as 12,000 jobs could be lost by the closure of Proton's factories and ancillary marketing, advertising and other businesses. Proton's 2 billion ringgit production plant in Tanjung Malim north of Kuala Lumpur, which is severely under-utilized, is a plum that foreign automakers have eyed sporadically. The plant, which was envisaged to churn out about 400,000 cars a year, is now only producing about 200,000, shooting the concept of economies of scale dead.\nAlthough a foreign partner could very well increase production capacity to around 350,000 units a year and lower production costs, the old bosses of the United Malays National Organisation, don't want to give the facilities away to foreign partners, Islamic or otherwise. Certainly the idea that consumers will feel a patriotic duty to buy local has been disproved all over the planet, and the Malaysian public is no different. Car buyers have already been worn down by unceasing complaints over the quality of Proton cars and their high price. A story on Proton that ran last June in Asia Sentinel generated 44 replies \u2013 all but two complaining about quality or the government's misguided economic policy that produced it in the first place.\"Proton cars have been selling well locally for the last few months but at the end of the day, Proton has to be competitive globally,\" Kurnia Insurans chief investment officer Pankaj Kumar told AFP. \"I don't think it has been that innovative. The new models are mostly re-badged versions of previous models.\"",

    "text": "Low Technologies, High Aims\n2007-09-11T04:00:00.000Z\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Beneath the bustling \u201cinfinite corridor\u201d linking buildings at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, just past a boiler room, an assemblage of tinkerers from 16 countries welded, stitched and hammered, working on rough-hewn inventions aimed at saving the world, one village at a time.\nM.I.T. has nurtured dozens of Nobel Prize winners in cerebral realms like astrophysics, economics and genetics. But lately, the institute has turned its attention toward concrete thinking to improve the lives of the world\u2019s bottom billion, those who live on a dollar a day or less and who often die young.\nThis summer, it played host to a four-week International Development Design Summit to identify problems, cobble together prototype solutions and winnow the results to see which might work in the real world. \nMohamed Mashaal, a young British engineer headed for a job with BP on the North Sea this fall, poured water into a handcrafted plastic backpack worn by a design partner, Bernard Kiwia, who teaches bicycle repair in rural Tanzania and hopes to offer women there an easier way to tote the precious liquid for long distances. \nSham Tembo, an electrical engineer from Zambia, and Jessica Vechakul, an engineering graduate student at M.I.T., slowly added a cow manure puree to a five-gallon bucket holding charcoal made from corncobs. In the right configuration, the mix might generate enough electricity to charge a cellphone battery or a small flashlight for a year or more.\nThe summit (www.iddsummit.org) was the brainchild mainly of Amy Smith, a lecturer at M.I.T. who received her master\u2019s there in 1995 and in 2004 won a MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius\u201d award, and Kenneth Pickar, an engineering professor at the California Institute of Technology. Faculty and students from Olin College, an engineering school near Boston, were also involved.\nThe flurry of activity was taking place at D-Lab, a research center and set of courses at M.I.T. devoted to devising cheap technologies that could have a big effect in impoverished communities. In homage to Ms. Smith\u2019s passion for attacking poverty from the ground up, the lab is nicknamed \u201cAmy\u2019s World.\u201d\nTypically, D-Lab sends students abroad in midwinter breaks to work with people who are struggling with a lack of clean water, electricity, cooking fuels or mechanical power to turn crops into products. For four weeks, though, the real world had come to M.I.T.\nThroughout the workshop, Ms. Smith served as scoutmaster, cheerleader, cook and personal shopper (when work flowed deep into the night), and she provided periodic reality checks. \nShe seemed dazed at times, but never fazed. \u201cEveryone calls this an experiment,\u201d Ms. Smith said of the workshop, the first of its kind. \u201cI call it the realization of a vision.\u201d\nThe work itself was often two steps back, not one step forward. As Lhamotso, a young woman from Tibet, and Laura Stupin, who just graduated from Olin, wrestled with a whirring Rube Goldberg mash-up of bicycle and grain mill, the chain slipped with a loud clang. \n\u201cWe have a real friction problem,\u201d Ms. Stupin yelled.\nThe workshop was developed over the last year by Ms. Smith, Dr. Pickar and others after a meeting to discuss a \u201cdesign revolution\u201d \u2014 a shift in focus among companies, universities, investors and scientists toward attacking problems that hamper development in the world\u2019s poorest places. \n\u201cNearly 90 percent of research and development dollars are spent on creating technologies that serve the wealthiest 10 percent of the world\u2019s population,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThe point of the design revolution is to switch that.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThere are several different places where that revolution has to take place. We started thinking, \u2018How do we train engineers so they might start thinking of this as a field of engineering they\u2019d want to pursue?\u2019 \u201d\nDeveloping a pedal-powered grain mill or a backpack for water, as workshop participants did, was only a first step. The teams also had to be sure that their creations could be built of local materials cheaply enough to be bought by the world\u2019s poorest people, that they could be fixed easily and fit ways of living that have deep-rooted rhythms. \nThe workshop began in mid-July, with the arrival of nearly 50 visitors from Brazil, Ghana, Guatemala, Tanzania, Tibet and other countries. \nMost of the $200,000 budget was provided by donations from individuals and private groups, including the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance, which supports university programs to develop commercially viable products that advance society. \nThe workshop began with a lecture by Paul Polak, a psychiatrist turned entrepreneur, who develops simple solutions for the problems of the poor. Dr. Polak, who has become something of a guru to the design revolution movement, railed against conventional charity and insisted that the route to prosperity lies in inventions that improve lives but mesh with existing lifestyles. \nHe laid out the principles of development from the bottom up, including the importance of first listening and watching, then following the old dictum \u201csmall is beautiful\u201d with another, equally important one: \u201ccheap is beautiful.\u201d\nThe goal, he said, should be to improve a million lives, and to make technologies that can be sold and bought in increments \u2014 like a drip-irrigating system that can expand as a farmer\u2019s income rises. Dr. Polak said in an interview that at least in the classroom, the push for such initiatives was coming from young people. \nMs. Smith said she wanted to avoid having the workshop end up as yet another academic exercise where the only outcome is often a set of paper proceedings or pledges. This time, she said, the goal was \u201cno paper, just prototypes.\u201d\nIn fact, in the first days of the workshop, it seemed that the only paper in evidence was an ever-spreading, flower-petal array of blue, green, pink and yellow sticky notes on walls and blackboards. The notes charted the progression from basic needs (water, food, energy, health) to specific issues (a three-mile hike to and from the nearest water supply in a Tanzanian village, the lack of a well-testing kit that a Bangladeshi village clinic could afford). \nMs. Smith placed participants in project teams. Then came round-table discussions, rough sketches, technical drawings and the first three-dimensional models. \nHalf a dozen volunteer mentors helped the participants make their ideas more concrete. Some were academics, like Ariel Phillips of Harvard, whose specialty is group dynamics. Others were drawn from Ms. Smith\u2019s black book filled with an array of fixers and crafters \u2014 people whose careers have been spent solving problems by turning metal, plastic, wood, circuitry and motors into working devices. They included Dennis Nagle, a former weapons designer who abandoned the profession, he said, during the Summer of Love and turned to lighting design and other things, like the 24-ton array of speaker cabinets for a Guns N\u2019 Roses concert. \nThe mentors\u2019 task was making things work. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we\u2019re on the verge of a Home Depot run,\u201d announced Jock Brandis, who had driven to the workshop from Wilmington, N.C. After a career building contraptions on movie sets, Mr. Brandis now helps run the Full Belly Project, which develops machines to simplify village work. \nMr. Brandis noted that the budget for developing a peanut sheller for a Malian village was far different from that for building a camera-toting vehicle in rural Mexico to film Antonio Banderas galloping through the desert as Zorro. But the challenge of filling a niche with limited materials and tools is similar. \nThe other similarity is that both kinds of design begin with a blank slate. As Mr. Brandis put it: \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018Here\u2019s the model high-rise made of Styrofoam, and then the flying saucer has to fly into it, and we need to shoot it three times from three different angles, and next Tuesday it\u2019s got to happen.\u2019 \u201d\nAt the workshop, Mr. Brandis examined with approval one group\u2019s design for an oven with three grates of progressively finer mesh to hold charcoal fuel, so that big pieces that have not burned down stay separate from more fully consumed fuel, limiting harmful smoke. \n\u201cWhat you try to do in virtually every situation is make their lives more efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the big revolution in America was between 1860 and 1960 \u2014 that a person doing a day\u2019s work can produce a lot more product. And that means time is more valuable and that means he has more time to do other things.\u201d\nAshley Thomas, an entering senior at M.I.T., explained the appeal of such work while struggling with a teetering metal frame for a cooler that uses evaporation from wet fabric instead of electrical components to draw heat from its contents. The idea was conceived with participants from Tibet, where meat must be stored for weeks in isolated rural areas, and India, where heat can quickly ruin a vendor\u2019s inventory. \n\u201cImagine a fruit vendor in a rural area or the slums,\u201d explained Deepa Dubey, a partner of Ms. Thomas, who studies product design as a graduate student in Kanpur, India. \u201cHe comes with all his fruit and vegetables. At the end of the day he makes one dollar, and whatever is left he has to throw it away because he can\u2019t store it.\u201d\nMs. Thomas said, \u201cAmy\u2019s class is about the hardest class to get into at M.I.T., including at the Sloan School, which is basically about how to make a million dollars after you graduate.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s taking industrial design theory and applying it to where you can have the greatest impact. Here, $5 worth of angle iron and towels could mean a month\u2019s supply of food. To me, that\u2019s just worth so much more than spending that amount of time working on designing a slick new computer.\u201d ",

    "text": "Arts, Briefly \n2007-11-24T05:00:00.000Z\nNobel Laureate Sues Publisher\n G\u00fcnter Grass, the Nobel Prize-winning author, has sued Random House over a claim in a new biography that he volunteered to serve in the Nazis\u2019 Waffen SS unit, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday, citing the online edition of the German magazine Der Spiegel. Mr. Grass, right, is seeking an injunction against the publishing house over a phrase in a biography by Michael J\u00fcrgs, which reads: \u201cG\u00fcnter Grass admitted ... that as a 17-year-old he willingly joined the Waffen SS.\u201d Mr. Grass wrote last year in his autobiography \u201cPeeling the Onion\u201d that he was drafted into the Waffen SS in the final months of World War II, an admission for which he was widely condemned because he had kept his Nazi service a secret for more than 60 years while urging other Germans to confront their painful histories. Mr. Grass told a Berlin district court that Mr. J\u00fcrgs had knowingly erred in writing that he had joined the Waffen SS willingly, his lawyer told Der Spiegel. He said Mr. Grass has handed the court a statement asserting, \u201cThe conscription into the Waffen SS happened without my active participation.\u201d Mr. J\u00fcrg\u2019s book, \u201cG\u00fcnter Grass,\u201d is published in Germany by Goldmann, which is owned by Random House, itself a subsidiary of Bertlesmann, a German company. A legal representative for Goldmann said the book would remain on sale pending a court ruling.\nHigh Price of Meat Loaf\nA federal appeals court ruled that Sony Music must pay the founder of a small record company $5 million for failing to put his company\u2019s logo on reissues of Meat Loaf\u2019s album \u201cBat Out of Hell,\u201d The Associated Press reported yesterday. Steve Popovich, the founder of Cleveland International Records, signed Meat Loaf, then known as Marvin Lee Aday, and in 1977 persuaded Epic Records, a unit of CBS Records, to release his album. Sony later bought CBS Records and paid $6.7 million to Mr. Popovich and his former partners to settle a lawsuit over royalties from \u201cBat Out of Hell.\u201d The settlement required Sony to place the Cleveland International logo on future Meat Loaf albums, but Sony did not add the logo to \u201cBat Out of Hell\u201d for more than a year. In a 2-to-1 decision reached Wednesday, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati upheld a federal jury\u2019s 2005 decision awarding Mr. Popovich $5 million in damages. \u201cI worked too hard for them and made them too much money to get robbed now, in the autumn of my life,\u201d Mr. Popovich said. \u201cBat Out of Hell\u201d has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide.\nA Queen Is Auctioned\nThe earliest known full-length portrait of Queen Elizabeth I was sold at Sotheby\u2019s in London for \u00a32.6 million (about $5.4 million), Bloomberg News reported yesterday. The price was a record for any British royal portrait, the auction house said, and more than double the pre-auction estimate. The winning bidder was Philip Mould, a London art dealer, who bought the portrait, above, along with another dealer. The painting was originally given by the queen to Griffith Hampden, the sheriff of Buckinghamshire, on a visit to Hampden House, Sotheby\u2019s said. The image dates from the 1560s and may have been painted by the Antwerp artist Steven van der Meulen. The work may have been intended to attract potential suitors, but Queen Elizabeth, known as the Virgin Queen, never married. \nSpringsteen Keyboardist \nTakes a Leave\nThe keyboardist Danny Federici, an original member of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s E Street Band, is taking a leave of absence from the group, which is on tour, while undergoing treatment for melanoma, Billboard reported. Mr. Federici will be replaced by Charles Giordano, who previously played in Mr. Springsteen\u2019s Seeger Sessions Band. On Monday in Boston, the E Street Band\u2019s set list was tilted toward material with which Mr. Federici is closely associated, including \u201cKitty\u2019s Back,\u201d \u201cTenth Avenue Freeze-Out\u201d and \u201c4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy).\u201d \u201cDanny is one of the pillars of our sound and has played beside me as a great friend for more than 40 years,\u201d Mr. Springsteen said in a statement. \u201cWe all eagerly await his healthy and speedy return.\u201d \nMuslim Extremists Threaten a Writer\nTaslima Nasreen has been the target of death threats from extremist Muslims since 1994, when she published \u201cShame,\u201d a novel that depicts violence against minority Hindus by Muslim fundamentalists in her native Bangladesh. Agence France-Presse reported that last week Ms. Nasreen, right, a self-proclaimed feminist and atheist, was being moved repeatedly, disguised in a black burqa, as authorities in India sought to assure her safety following violent Islamist protests calling for her expulsion from the country. \u201cI am mentally distressed; I am not well at all,\u201d Ms. Nasreen told the Press Trust of India on Friday by telephone from an undisclosed location. She has lived in the Indian state of West Bengal since 2004, in an apartment guarded by Indian security forces, while seeking permanent residence in India, which is officially a secular country. So far, however, the government, fearful of upsetting the country\u2019s large Muslim minority, has granted her only six-month visa extensions. The All India Milli Council, a Muslim group, said in New Dehli on Friday that all Muslim organizations would \u201cvehemently protest\u201d her continued stay. In March, an offshoot group of the influential All India Muslim Personal Law Board declared a reward for anyone who \u201cbeheaded ... the notorious woman\u201d who has \u201chas put Muslims to shame.\u201d In August, Ms. Nasreen was assaulted in the Indian city of Hyderabad by Muslim activists, led by three state legislators, who hurled copies of her latest book at her and shouted for her death. \nFootnotes\nJ.

    "text": "Afghan hostage crisis transfixes South Korea\n2007-07-26T05:00:00.000Z\nSEOUL \u2014 Ever since Afghan militants kidnapped 23 South Korean aid workers last week, people here have reacted with shock, disbelief and hope - their mood shifting as news from Afghanistan carried conflicting hints about the hostages' fate.\nOn Thursday, the national mood reached its lowest point. The government confirmed what millions of South Koreans following the news overnight had hoped would not be true - that a bullet-riddled body found in southern Afghanistan where the Taliban said they had abandoned it was indeed that of a South Korean.\nBae Hyung Kyu, a Christian pastor with a big smile who left a wife and 9-year-old daughter behind, was found dead Wednesday, his 42nd birthday.\nMany members of the Saemmul Presbyterian Church, to which Bae and 19 other hostages belonged, wept. They had prayed for the safe return of the hostages. When the news about Bae came, some were seen on local television hugging each other in tears, some collapsing on the floor.\n\"The organization responsible for the abduction will be held accountable for taking the life of a Korean citizen,\" said Baek Jong Chun, chief secretary for security and foreign policy for President Roh Moo Hyun.\nAs Roh's special envoy, Baek flew to Kabul on Thursday to work with the Afghan government to try to free the rest of the South Koreans, who have been held since their bus was hijacked on a road south of Kabul a week ago Thursday.\nBaek's comment appeared to take a stronger stance than the South Korean government's earlier appeals to the Taliban. But Chun Ho Sun, a spokesman for Roh, said Seoul opposed military operations to rescue the hostages. He also reconfirmed that South Korea would withdraw its 200 military medics and engineers from Afghanistan by the end of the year as scheduled.\nThe Taliban said the South Korean government had not been acting in good faith and threatened to kill more hostages if its demands for the release of an equal number of Taliban prisoners were not met. After conflicting reports Wednesday that eight of the hostages were going to be released, Chun said Thursday that the authorities believed 22, including 18 women, were still being held.\n\"We resumed the negotiations this morning and there are a lot of efforts going on, but so far we have not reached any final conclusion,\" Waheedullah Mujadeddi, an Afghan official involved in the talks, said Thursday. \"The Taliban says they are alive, and that's why we resumed the negotiations.\"\n[Qari Yousef Ahmadi, who says he is a spokesman for the Taliban, asserted Thursday that the 22 remaining hostages were fine, The Associated Press reported from Kabul. But he contended that the Afghan authorities were not allowing South Korean officials to negotiate directly with his group.\n[A local police chief said the negotiations with the Taliban were difficult because the kidnappers' demands were unclear.\n[\"One says let's exchange them for my relative, others say let's release the women, yet another wants a deal for money,\" said Khwaja Mohammad Sidiqi, the police chief in Qarabagh. \"They have got problems among themselves.\"\nTelevision stations in South Korea carried running updates on the situation. In this highly wired country, where the Internet has emerged as a major channel of public opinion, people posted Web messages lamenting Bae's death and praying for the release of the other hostages. But many also criticized churches for sending young people to countries like Afghanistan.\n\"After Reverend Bae's death, we are more concerned about our family members,\" said Che Mi Sook, the sister of a hostage, Che Chang Hee, reading a joint statement from relatives of the hostages. \"Many of us suffer a heart pain, and this is a pain that any parent and anyone who has a family will understand.\"\nThe tearful appeal to the kidnappers was the most watched video clip on the Internet in South Korea on Thursday.\nFor South Koreans, this new crisis represents the cost the country is paying for the aid and evangelical operations that its Christian churches conduct in some of the world's most dangerous places.\nIn 2004, a South Korean interpreter and aspiring Christian missionary was beheaded by militants in Iraq.\nSeveral South Korean missionaries have served time in or remain in Chinese prisons for allegedly trying to convert North Korean refugees or for smuggling them to South Korea. One missionary, who was kidnapped by North Korean agents in 2000, is believed to have died in the North.\nWith 12,000 to 17,000 evangelists working in more than 160 countries, South Korea has one of the most aggressive armies of Christian missionaries on earth. Only the United States sends out more - 46,000 by some estimates.\nA conservative association of Protestant churches in South Korea has called for dispatching 100,000 missionaries by 2030.\nAlong with those full-time missionaries, South Korean churches dispatch numerous evangelical, educational and medical missions.\nSaemmul Church has stressed that Bae's group was not engaged in evangelism, but was doing only relief work at hospitals and kindergartens.\nNonetheless, the hostage crisis, and the deportation last year of 1,600 South Korean Christians gathering for a \"peace festival\" in Afghanistan, has highlighted the overseas activities of Korean Christians.\n\"In South Korean churches, emphasis has always been on growth and expansion,\" said Lee Won Gue, a professor at Methodist Theological Seminary in Seoul. \"There is a fierce competition among churches - so much so that the reputation of the pastor or his church often depends on how many missionaries are sent abroad and how many churches are built there.\"\nEven small churches finance missionary expeditions, thanks to congregations that are generous with cash donations.

    "text": "Fears and dashed hopes in Korea over hostages in Afghanistan\n2007-07-26T05:00:00.000Z\nSEOUL \u2014 Ever since a group of 23 South Korean aid workers was kidnapped by Afghan militants last week, people here have reacted with shock, disbelief and hope - their mood shifting as news flashes from Afghanistan often carried conflicting hints about the fate of the hostages.\nThe national mood sunk to the bottom on Thursday, when the government confirmed what millions of South Koreans following news overnight hoped would not be true - that a bullet-riddled body found in southern Afghanistan, at a place where the Taliban said they had abandoned it, was indeed a South Korean.\nBae Hyung Kyu, a Christian pastor with a big smile who left a wife and 9-year-old daughter behind, was found dead Wednesday, his 42nd birthday.\n\"No! No! This can't be true!\" cried female members of Saemmul Presbyterian Church, to which Bae and 19 other hostages belonged. Church members had prayed overnight for the safe return of the hostages. When the news about Bae came, they hugged each other in tears. Some were seen on local television collapsing on the floor after hearing the news.\n\"The organization responsible for the abduction will be held accountable for taking the life of a Korean citizen,\" Baek Jong Chun, chief secretary for security and foreign policy for President Roh Moo Hyun, said in a statement.\nAs Roh's special envoy, Baek flew to Kabul on Thursday, where he would work with the Afghan government to try to free the rest of 22 South Koreans, held hostage since their bus was hijacked at gunpoint on a road south of Kabul a week ago Thursday.\nBaek's comment appeared to take a stronger stance than the South Korean government's earlier appeals to the Taliban. But Chun Ho Sun, a spokesman for Roh, said Seoul opposed military operations to rescue the hostages. He also reconfirmed that South Korea will withdraw its 200 military medics and engineers from Afghanistan by the end of the year as scheduled.\nTelevision stations in South Korea carried running updates on the hostage situation. In this highly wired country, where the Internet has emerged as a major channel of public opinions, people posted Web messages lamenting Bae's death and praying for the other hostages' release. But many also criticized churches for sending young people to countries like Afghanistan.\n\"After Reverend Bae's death, we are more concerned about our family members,\" Che Mi Sook, a 47-year-old sister of a hostage, Che Chang Hee, said, reading a joint statement from relatives of the hostages. \"Many of us suffer a heart pain, and this is a pain that any parent and anyone who has a family will understand.\"\nThe tearful appeal to the kidnappers was the most watched video clip on Korean Internet portals.\nThe Taliban said the South Korean government had not been acting in good faith and threatened to kill more of the Korean hostages if its demands for the release of an equal number of Taliban prisoners were not met. After conflicting reports on Wednesday that eight of the hostages were going to be released, Chun said Thursday that the authorities believed 22, including 18 women, were still held captive.\n[Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a purported Taliban spokesman, said Thursday that all 22 hostages were fine, but he claimed that Afghan authorities were not allowing South Korean officials to negotiate directly with the militants, The Associated Press reported from Kabul.\n[\"Kabul officials asked us to give them more time,\" Ahmadi said, speaking by phone from an undisclosed location. \"The Taliban are not asking for money. We just want to exchange our prisoners for Korean hostages.\"\n[He added, \"When they release the Taliban, we will release the hostages.\"\n[However, a local police chief said that the negotiations with the captors were difficult because their demands were unclear.\n[\"One says let's exchange them for my relative, the others say let's release the women, and yet another wants a deal for money,\" said Khwaja Mohammad Sidiqi, a local police chief in Qarabagh. \"They have got problems among themselves.\"]\nFor South Koreans, the crisis is a sobering reminder of the high cost the country has to pay for expanding globally, especially for the aid and evangelical operations that its Christian churches conduct in some of the world's most dangerous places.\nIn 2004, a Korean interpreter and aspiring Christian missionary was beheaded by militants in Iraq. Several South Korean missionaries have served time or remain in Chinese prisons for allegedly trying to convert North Korean refugees or smuggling them to South Korea. One missionary, who was kidnapped by North Korean agents in 2000, is believed to have died in the North.\nWith between 12,000 and 17,000 missionaries in over 160 countries, South Korea has one of the biggest and most aggressive armies of Christian missionaries on earth. The number is second only to the estimate for the United States of 46,000. A conservative association of Protestant churches in South Korea has called for dispatching 100,000 missionaries by 2030.\nAlong with those full-time missionaries, South Korean churches dispatch numerous short-term evangelical, educational and medical missions.\nSaemmul Church has stressed that Bae's group was not engaged in evangelism, doing only relief work at hospitals and kindergartens.\nNonetheless, the hostage crisis, and the deportation last year of 1,600 South Korean Christians gathering for a \"peace festival\" in Afghanistan, highlighted the overseas activities of South Korean Christians.\n\"In South Korean churches, emphasis has always been on growth and expansion,\" said Lee Won Gue, a professor at Methodist Theological Seminary in Seoul. \"There is a fierce competition among churches, so much so that the reputation of the pastor or his church often depends on how many missionaries are sent abroad and how many churches are built there.\"\nEven small churches finance missionary expeditions, thanks to congregations generous with cash donations.

Today, 30 percent of South Korea's 48 million people are Christians, including 8.6 million Protestants and 5.1 million Roman Catholics. Roman Catholicism came to Korea in the late 18th century, followed a century later by Protestant missionaries from the United States.\nThe explosive growth followed the trajectory of Korea's rapid transformation from one of Asia's most isolationist kingdoms into the world's 11th largest economy. In the late 19th century, the Korea government beheaded an estimated 8,000 Roman Catholic converts as well as many missionaries from Europe. Today, Seoul's cityscape is dotted with numerous neon-lighted church signs.\nWhen South Korea adopted the catch phrase of \"globalization\" in the early 1990s and liberalized overseas travel, homegrown missionaries were among the first to jump on the bandwagon with the same zeal of South Korean businessmen exploiting overseas markets.\nIn South Korea, even small churches financed missionary expeditions, thanks to congregations generous with cash donations.

    "text": "Let Them Eat Shortcake\n2007-09-02T04:00:00.000Z\nThe young woman behind the counter at the beach boutique on Block Island was blond, ponytailed and suntanned. \u201cCan I khelp you?\u201d she asked a male customer as he wandered in, dazed from the sun. \u201cWhoa, where you from?\u201d he asked. \u201cMoldova,\u201d was the reply, as she rang up a navy belt dotted with green whales. \u201cThis is my sommer job, then I go beck.\u201d \u201cYou should find an American husband and stick around,\u201d the man teased. The cashier grinned and lowered her eyes. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut this is my third sommer here.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to think of migration as a north-south phenomenon, or, rather, south-north: Central American farmworkers journeying to the United States to harvest crops, Turkish Gastarbeiter traveling to Germany for construction and restaurant jobs; Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis resettling in England to become shopkeepers, chefs or (in the case of a lucky few) writers, pop stars and industrial magnates. But in her new novel, \u201cStrawberry Fields,\u201d Marina Lewycka, an Englishwoman born to Ukrainian parents in a refugee camp in Germany at the end of World War II, takes note of the westward migration that has been changing the landscape of England in recent decades. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the expansion of the European Union, it has been easier than it once was for Eastern Europeans to pick up their knapsacks and cross borders. Part of an earlier generation of refugees, imbued with nostalgia for the storied, soulful Eastern Europe of her parents\u2019 past, Lewycka seems to look on the incoming wave with less indulgence and more mortification than a nonimplicated person might. In her first novel, \u201cA Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian,\u201d one of the characters tells her wayward father: \u201cUkraina isn\u2019t like you remember it. It\u2019s different now. The people are different. They don\u2019t sing anymore \u2014 only vodka songs. All they\u2019re interested in is shopping. Western goods. Fashion. Electronics. American brand names.\u201d \u201cStrawberry Fields\u201d is also infused with this mournful perception.\nThe novel focuses on the misadventures of a handful of migrant workers from Ukraine and Poland and their friends from more distant parts who\u2019ve come to England to harvest berries or gut chickens, hoping to turn their pounds sterling into sacks of Ukrainian hryvnia and Polish zlotys back home \u2014 or, with a bit of luck, to hunker down in Britain permanently, fortified with \u201cmobilfons\u201d and wide-boy suits. Lewycka\u2019s hopelessly na\u00efve 19-year-old heroine, Irina, a professor\u2019s daughter from Kiev, arrives at Farmer Leapish\u2019s \u201cramshackle strawberry farm\u201d on Sherbury Down brimming with ill-founded optimism, hoping to harvest fodder for her Great Ukrainian Novel along with her bushels of berries.\n\u201cThe first thing I noticed was the light \u2014 the dazzling salty light dancing on the sunny field, the ripening strawberries, the little rounded trailer perched up on the hill,\u201d Irina reflects. Taking in the \u201cpretty steep-roofed farmhouse,\u201d the lawn that slopes down to a \u201cshallow glassy river\u201d and the \u201cwoods beyond,\u201d she smiles to herself, thinking with relief, \u201cSo this is England.\u201d But Irina\u2019s England turns out to include as many Satanic mills as pleasant pastures, plus an immigrant wrangler named Vulk, with a greasy ponytail, who creepily calls Irina \u201clittle flovver\u201d and longs to induct her into the flesh trade. \u201cEngland is a change, little flovver,\u201d he tells her. \u201cEngland is not like in you school book.\u201d Vulk is someone Irina\u2019s highbrow mother would call a \u201cperson of minimum culture,\u201d to say the least. Clueless as she is, Irina knows to keep out of Vulk\u2019s way, but she isn\u2019t nearly canny enough to keep Vulk out of hers. She would do well to accept the protection of a shy young Ukrainian migrant worker named Andriy, but she snubs him: \u201cI haven\u2019t come all this way to spend my time fending off the advances of a miner from Donbas,\u201d she loftily decides. Dreaming of Natasha and Pierre\u2019s romance in \u201cWar and Peace\u201d while keeping her eyes fixed on her strawberries, Irina risks slipping into a ditch of vice that anyone who saw the film \u201cDirty Pretty Things\u201d will recognize: not as romantic as Tolstoy\u2019s landscape, but much more accessible. (And now, to the list of things first-worlders need to feel guilty about \u2014 S.U.V.\u2019s, factory-farmed food, energy hogging \u2014 add a new item. Who has suffered so you can have strawberry shortcake?)\nA late-blooming fiction writer, Marina Lewycka produced a number of self-help books before \u201cA Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian\u201d appeared two years ago. That splendid debut, which won several awards in Britain, reads like a memoir. Rich and strange in detail, magnanimous yet unsparing in tone, it presents an unairbrushed portrait of two quarreling middle-aged Ukrainian-English sisters, Vera and Nadia, who reconcile to save their stubborn father from a disastrous late marriage. Grotesquely decayed, pedantic and obsessed with the history of tractors, Nikolai is also an incurable romantic. At 84, he has married a 36-year-old Ukrainian immigrant named Valentina, who has a bra-busting bosom and an unquenchable yen for material goods \u2014 from breast implants and fancy cars to a gas stove and a British passport. \u201cShe exploded into our lives,\u201d Nadia, the younger sister, notes with dismay, \u201clike a fluffy pink grenade.\u201d \nVera, the hardheaded older sister, has no sympathy for the interloper: \u201cWe read about these people in the papers every day. Immigrants, asylum seekers, economic migrants,\u201d she tells Nadia. \u201cIt is always the most determined and ruthless people who make it over here, and then when they find it isn\u2019t so easy to get a good job, they will turn to crime.\u201d Nadia, mindful of her family\u2019s own immigrant past, wants to be tolerant, but even she succumbs to xenophobia. \u201cI used to be liberal about immigration,\u201d she confesses. \u201cI suppose I just thought it was all right for people to live where they wanted. But now I imagine hordes of Valentinas barging their way through customs at Ramsgate, at Felixstowe, at Dover, at Newhaven \u2014 pouring off the boats, purposeful, single-minded, mad.\u201d \nSuch reluctant imaginings trickle like a narrow creek through \u201cA Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian,\u201d but in \u201cStrawberry Fields\u201d they swamp the story. The main characters \u2014 Irina; her Valentina-like Polish overseer, Yola; innocent Andriy; and the vile Vulk, along with a few other heavies \u2014 feel like the sort of caricatures you might see on an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d or in one of Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s send-ups of sleazy, dopey foreigners. When non-Slavs pop up on the landscape \u2014 a pious Malawian orphan named Emanuel who fears \u201ccanal knowledge\u201d; a family of British toffs (pot-smoking son, vegetarian mum, whiskey-soaked dad) \u2014 they\u2019re equally cartoony. Each character\u2019s reflections are presented in a different voice, with solecisms that are meant to be funny but instead inspire cringing. Even a stray dog (named Dog) who befriends Irina and Andriy produces long, one-note, capitalized canine monologues: \u201cfemale says how beautiful is the song of the bird she is more stupid than a sheep that bird is not good bird if it comes down from its tree i will catch it snap dead eat i am good dog i am dog.\u201d \nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with weaving fractured English, inflated Eastern European ravings and an odoriferous hound into fiction. Jonathan Safran Foer succeeded brilliantly at it in his novel \u201cEverything Is Illuminated,\u201d and Lewycka did the same herself (substituting odoriferous cats for the hound) in her first novel. But \u201cStrawberry Fields\u201d needed longer to ripen. Its plot suggests Vera\u2019s headlines, not Nadia\u2019s heartbeats, and the compassion the author undoubtedly feels for the literary-minded Ukrainian girl in the strawberry-stained jeans could have used more water, more sun and fewer stereotypes. As the schoolyard gibe goes, it takes one to know one. But writing what you know and writing what you think you know are often two very different things.",

    "text": "Opposition Parties Vow to Proceed With Jan. 8 Election\n2007-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\nNAUDERO, Pakistan \u0097 Three days after the violent killing of its leader, Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan\u2019s largest political party on Sunday picked her 19-year-old son to succeed her as chairman and vowed to forge ahead with elections next week, immediately creating a new quandary for the government about whether to delay the vote.\nThe moves by Ms. Bhutto\u2019s opposition party, the Pakistan Peoples Party, were clearly aimed at marshaling an outpouring of grief and anger to electoral advantage in the Jan. 8 parliamentary election. The other main opposition party, led by Nawaz Sharif, another former prime minister, also decided Sunday to call off his previously announced boycott of the vote. \nAides to President Pervez Musharraf have suggested that the election could be postponed, perhaps for months, because of the chaos that has engulfed the country since Ms. Bhutto, the former prime minister returned from exile, was killed while campaigning Thursday. But now the prospect of a delay could further infuriate Ms. Bhutto\u2019s supporters and allies, pressuring Mr. Musharraf to hold the vote and risk a huge defeat at the polls.\nElections officials in Pakistan said Monday that they would take another day to decide on the timing of the polls, according to The Associated Press.\nThe announcement that Ms. Bhutto\u2019s first-born son, Bilawal, an Oxford undergraduate with no political experience, would lead her party was made at a chaotic news conference at the family\u2019s ancestral home here in a southern Pakistan village. \nHis father, Asif Ali Zardari, said he would manage the chairmanship on his son\u2019s behalf until he finished his university degree, for a minimum of three years. \nThe decision to place burden of blood and history on the son reflects not only an abiding dynastic streak in South Asian politics \u0097 three generations of the Nehru-Gandhi family have dominated politics in India, and hereditary politics pervade Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as well \u0097 but also how much the Pakistan Peoples Party relies on the Bhutto family name and legacy to bind its supporters. \nIn keeping with his new mantle, the new chairman took a new name, embracing his mother\u2019s maiden name as the newly anointed Bhutto scion.\n \u201cMy mother always said democracy is the best revenge,\u201d he told reporters in a brief address. \nThe elder Mr. Zardari said his son would henceforth be known as Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. He instructed reporters not to ask his son any further questions, saying he was \u201cof a tender age.\u201d\nLater, in the backyard of the family\u2019s house, the younger Mr. Zardari said in an interview that he had been tutored by his mother to play a role in Pakistani politics, but only after he completes his university education. \u201cThere was always a sense of fear I wouldn\u2019t be able to live up to her expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I will.\u201d \nAsked about his most immediate challenge, he said, \u201cFirst to finish my degree.\u201d \nThat would appear to rule out any possibility that Ms. Bhutto\u2019s son could become the new leader of Pakistan until he was significantly older. Nonetheless, the elder Mr. Zardari said in an interview, \u201cAs her son, he will become a uniting force.\u201d \nThe younger Mr. Zardari is a student of history at Christ Church at Oxford University, his mother\u2019s alma mater. \nMr. Zardari said that his wife had expressed the wish in her will that he be left in charge of the party, but that he had decided, with the consent of the executive committee, which met Sunday afternoon at the close of a three-day mourning period, to pass the baton to his son. \nHe said the will was written on Oct. 16, two days before her return to Pakistan, and given to him after her death, which is when he learned that she had chosen him to succeed her. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy chair to sit on,\u201d the elder Mr. Zardari said in the interview. \u201cA, she leaves me. B, she ties me in this. To say the least, it\u2019s overbearing.\u201d\n Senior party officials said, too, that the younger Mr. Zardari would be a far less controversial titular head than his father, who had been accused of a raft of corruption charges, jailed for a total of 11 years, and blamed in some quarters for some of Ms. Bhutto\u2019s political woes. \nIt could not be a more difficult time for the party. Ms. Bhutto had held together a large and diverse organization, and even if, on the back of public grief, it were to win the elections, it would be likely to be under great pressure to bring a semblance of stability to a nation racked by a wave of extremist violence. \nAt the news conference, the elder Mr. Zardari said he would not run in the election and therefore would not be the party\u2019s prime ministerial candidate.\nThat job, he said, would probably go to the party vice president, the veteran party leader Makhdoom Amin Fahim, but that was a decision, he added, that would have to be made by party leaders. \nMr. Zardari went on to say later in the interview that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for the party to survive without Ms. Bhutto. \u201cMy biggest job is to keep it from falling apart,\u201d he said. \nMs. Bhutto, 54, was killed Thursday evening as she left a party rally in the city of Rawalpindi, when her car was struck by gunfire and a suicide bombing. Ms. Bhutto\u2019s party and family insist that she was shot in the head. The government disputes it, saying that she struck her head fatally on the sunroof of her car.\nHer party appealed Sunday for an international inquiry into her death, along the lines of the investigation into the killing of Rafik Hariri, the former prime minister of Lebanon.\nThe younger Mr. Zardari\u2019s rise echoes the chilling, emotionally resonant path of his mother, who was thrust into public life after her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged in 1979 by order of the military ruler, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. \nShortly before the official announcement of his ascension at a crowded news conference came a ceremonious rearrangement of the dais. His newly constructed name was pinned to the back of a high-backed red chair, which was then adorned with a cushion and placed at the center of a long table. He entered, dressed in a black salwar kameez, the traditional long tunic and pants, and Armani glasses, biting his lips and carrying a portrait of his mother. He promised to carry on his mother\u2019s legacy as \u201ca symbol of the federation.\u201d\nRehman Malik, a senior party official, said Ms. Bhutto had asked him to coach her son in the basic workings of politics and government, from teaching him how to assess others to taking him to the halls of Parliament. \n\u201cShe has groomed up her husband,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was grooming her son also. She was telling me many times he will grow up and take over the party.\u201d\nFor his part, the younger Mr. Zardari said he had discussed with his mother the prospects of entering politics, but avoided getting into details about who would take over after her. \u201cWe always tried not to have this specific conversation because we hoped this day would come, if not never, then far, far in the future,\u201d he said. \nIn the interview, he spoke quietly, but politely, in the backyard of a crowded house in a remote village in a country where he had spent little time. He and his two younger siblings were raised mostly in Dubai. \nA cluster of relatives approached to embrace. \u201cYou raised our hopes just now,\u201d one man told him.\nThe young man took that in, also quietly, and waited for them to pass before speaking again. He said he feared for the survival of the country. When reminded that he had not grown up here, his answer came swiftly. He said he was lucky to have been reared by his mother, who knew the country well. Asked if she had ever encouraged him to succeed her as the leader of the party, he was vague. \n\u201cShe always said I had to finish my education before I got into politics,\u201d he answered. \u201cShe always said I would do something for Pakistan.\u201d \nPolitics here is as much about matters of the heart as anything else. Which is why Abida Hussain, another senior party official, when asked about the options facing the party at this crucial juncture, said simply, \u201cIt\u2019s Bilawal.\u201d ",

The exhibitions will examine how Moses vastly changed the physical landscape of New York City and how people lived in and around it, with hundreds of new bridges, parkways, beaches, pools, parks, apartment houses and civic buildings. \nTwo museums and a gallery at Columbia University will display drawings; architectural models for buildings, bridges and highways; film excerpts; and historic objects and photographs. Each will also have a collection of large-scale color photographs by Andrew Moore that show how the projects built decades ago have been absorbed into the fabric of the city. \nThese exhibitions coincide with the publication of \u201cRobert Moses and the Modern City: The Transformation of New York\u201d (W.W. Norton, Feb. 26, 2007). The book is edited by the curator of the exhibitions, Hilary Ballon, an architectural historian and professor of art history and archaeology at Columbia University, along with Kenneth T. Jackson, the Jacques Barzun Professor in History and the Social Sciences at Columbia.\nA symposium at the Museum of the City of New York on Feb. 1 at 5:30 p.m. will use Moses\u2019 legacy as a starting point to discuss contemporary issues like regional planning, open space initiatives, transportation and sustainable development. Participants will include Daniel Doctoroff, New York City\u2019s deputy mayor for economic development; Majora Carter, executive director of Sustainable South Bronx; and Tony Hiss, a writer and consultant on preservation and a visiting professor at New York University. The main auditorium is full, but the museum is accepting reservations for seating in an adjoining theater equipped with close-circuit television (212-534-1672, ext. 3395). Tickets are $20; museum members, students and those 62 and older, $10.\nOn March 2 and 3, a two-day conference will take place at the Lehman Center for American History at Columbia University, the Queens Museum of Art and the Museum of the City of New York. Some two dozen scholars will speak during the event, titled \u201cRobert Moses: New Perspectives on the Master Builder,\u201d on topics like the W.P.A. swimming pools in New York; the 1929 regional plan for the metropolitan area; opposition to the Fifth Avenue expansion and Moses\u2019 influence on public housing. Participants may call for information (212-854-2877) or see a schedule at www.columbia.edu/cu/lehmancenter. Admission is free. \nRobert Moses: Recreation \nQueens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park; (718) 592-9700. \n\u201cRobert Moses and the Modern City: The Road to Recreation,\u201d the exhibition at the Queens Museum of Art, will be open through May 27. It examines the development of the highway network connecting New Yorkers to ocean beaches in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Long Island; the construction of municipal pools; and the design of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in the 1930s. The plans Moses developed were ambitious: parkways were built with bicycle paths, playgrounds and lots of grass and trees; the pools were huge, with architecturally grand bathhouses; and the visions of the 1939 and 1964 World\u2019s Fairs, set in the 1,255-acre Queens park, literally rose from an ash dump. The exhibition will also include a model of Moses\u2019 plan for a bridge across Long Island Sound, connecting Oyster Bay and Rye, N.Y.\nOn Feb. 4, the Panorama of New York City, a 9,335-square-foot model of the five boroughs, will reopen after a renovation. The Panorama, the largest architectural scale model in the world, depicts every building in the city as of 1992, when it was last updated. Moses built it for the 1964 World\u2019s Fair. The official exhibition opening will take place from noon to 5 p.m. on Feb. 4.\nThe Queens Museum is open Wednesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Suggested donation is $5; students and those 62 and older, $2.50; members and children under 5, free.

These plans, using money from the federal Housing Act of 1949, involved the demolition of blocks of slums to build middle-class housing projects, such as the East River Houses at Corlears Hook, Penn Station South and Morningside Gardens. This development model was that of later apartment complexes like Kips Bay Plaza, Lincoln Towers and the Silver Towers at New York University.\nThis exhibition also examines campus expansion, at, among others, New York University, Fordham University and Long Island University.\nThe gallery is open Wednesday through Saturday, 1 to 5 p.m. Admission is free.

This exhibition will look at some of Moses\u2019 large civic projects, including the development of Lincoln Center, the construction of the United Nations and the planning of Riverside and East River parks. It will also look at some of the highways and bridges Moses built, from the scenic Henry Hudson Parkway winding through upper Manhattan and the Bronx to the more utilitarian Cross-Bronx Expressway.\nThere will also be sections devoted to some unrealized projects, like the Midtown and the Lower Manhattan expressways, and a plan to extend Fifth Avenue below Washington Square Park. The defeat of these proposals came as ideas about local community preservation and control coalesced and Moses\u2019 power declined.\nThe museum is open Wednesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Suggested contribution is $9; children, students and those 62 and older, $5; families, $20.\nSeeing Red \nTextile Museum, 2320 S Street NW, Washington; (202) 667-0441.\n\u201cRed,\u201d an exhibition exploring the use of the color in textiles for 2,500 years to signify social and cultural themes like status, power, love and death, opens Feb. 2 and will run through July 8.

    "text": "Reverse Foreign Aid\n2007-03-25T04:00:00.000Z\nFor the last 10 years, people in China have been sending me money. I also get money from countries in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 really, from every poor country. I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s so lucky. Everyone in a wealthy nation has become the beneficiary of the generous subsidies that poorer countries bestow upon rich ones. Here in the United States, this welfare program in reverse allows our government to spend wildly without runaway inflation, keeps many American businesses afloat and even provides medical care in parts of the country where doctors are scarce.\nEconomic theory holds that money should flow downhill. The North, as rich countries are informally known, should want to sink its capital into the South \u2014 the developing world, which some statisticians define as all countries but the 29 wealthiest. According to this model, money both does well and does good: investors get a higher return than they could get in their own mature economies, and poor countries get the capital they need to get richer. Increasing the transfer of capital from rich nations to poorer ones is often listed as one justification for economic globalization. \nHistorically, the global balance sheet has favored poor countries. But with the advent of globalized markets, capital began to move in the other direction, and the South now exports capital to the North, at a skyrocketing rate. According to the United Nations, in 2006 the net transfer of capital from poorer countries to rich ones was $784 billion, up from $229 billion in 2002. (In 1997, the balance was even.) Even the poorest countries, like those in sub-Saharan Africa, are now money exporters.\nHow did this great reversal take place? Why did globalization begin to redistribute wealth upward? The answer, in large part, has to do with global finance. All countries hold hard-currency reserves to cover their foreign debts or to use in case of a natural or a financial disaster. For the past 50 years, rich countries have steadily held reserves equivalent to about three months\u2019 worth of their total imports. As money circulates more and more quickly in a globalized economy, however, many countries have felt the need to add to their reserves, mainly to head off investor panic, which can strike even well-managed economies. Since 1990, the world\u2019s nonrich nations have increased their reserves, on average, from around three months\u2019 worth of imports to more than eight months\u2019 worth \u2014 or the equivalent of about 30 percent of their G.D.P. China and other countries maintain those reserves mainly in the form of supersecure U.S. Treasury bills; whenever they buy T-bills, they are in effect lending the United States money. This allows the U.S. to keep interest rates low and Washington to run up huge deficits with no apparent penalty. \nBut the cost to poorer countries is very high. The benefit of T-bills, of course, is that they are virtually risk-free and thus help assure investors and achieve stability. But the problem is that T-bills earn low returns. All the money spent on T-bills \u2014 a very substantial sum \u2014 could be earning far better returns invested elsewhere, or could be used to pay teachers and build highways at home, activities that bring returns of a different type. Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, estimates conservatively that maintaining reserves in excess of the three-month standard costs poor countries 1 percent of their economies annually \u2014 some $110 billion every year. Joseph Stiglitz, the Columbia University economist, says he thinks the real cost could be double that. \nIn his recent book, \u201cMaking Globalization Work,\u201d Stiglitz proposes a solution. Adapting an old idea of John Maynard Keynes, he proposes a sort of insurance pool that would provide hard currency to countries going through times of crisis. Money actually changes hands only if a country needs the reserve, and the recipient must repay what it has used.\nNo one planned the rapid swelling of reserves. Other South-to-North subsidies, by contrast, have been built into the rules of globalization by international agreements. Consider the World Trade Organization\u2019s requirements that all member countries respect patents and copyrights \u2014 patents on medicines and industrial and other products; copyrights on, say, music and movies. As poorer countries enter the W.T.O., they must agree to pay royalties on such goods \u2014 and a result is a net obligation of more than $40 billion annually that poorer countries owe to American and European corporations.\nThere are good reasons for countries to respect intellectual property, but doing so is also an overwhelming burden on the poorest people in poorer countries. After all, the single largest beneficiary of the intellectual-property system is the pharmaceutical industry. But consumers in poorer nations do not get much in return, as they do not form a lucrative enough market to inspire research on cures for many of their illnesses. Moreover, the intellectual-property rules make it difficult for poorer countries to manufacture less-expensive generic drugs that poor people rely on. The largest cost to poor countries is not money but health, as many people simply will not be able to find or afford brand-name medicine. \nThe hypercompetition for global investment has produced another important reverse subsidy: the tax holidays poor countries offer foreign investors. A company that announces it wants to make cars, televisions or pharmaceuticals in, say, east Asia, will then send its representatives to negotiate with government officials in China, Malaysia, the Philippines and elsewhere, holding an auction for the best deal. The savviest corporations get not only 10-year tax holidays but also discounts on land, cheap government loans, below-market rates for electricity and water and government help in paying their workers. \nRich countries know better \u2014 the European Union, for example, regulates the incentives members can offer to attract investment. That car plant will most likely be built in one of the competing countries anyway \u2014 the incentives serve only to reduce the host country\u2019s benefits. Since deals between corporations and governments are usually secret, it is hard to know how much investment incentives cost poorer countries \u2014 certainly tens of billions of dollars. Whatever the cost, it is growing, as country after country has passed laws enabling the offer of such incentives.\nHuman nature, not smart lobbying, is responsible for another poor-to-rich subsidy: the brain drain. The migration of highly educated people from poor nations is increasing. A small brain drain can benefit the South, as emigrants send money home and may return with new skills and capital. But in places where educated people are few and emigrants don\u2019t go home again, the brain drain devastates. In many African countries, more than 40 percent of college-educated people emigrate to rich countries. Malawian nurses have moved to Britain and other English-speaking nations en masse, and now two-thirds of nursing posts in Malawi\u2019s public health system are vacant. Zambia has lost three-quarters of its new physicians in recent years. Even in South Africa, 21 percent of graduating doctors migrate. \nThe financial consequences for the poorer nations can be severe. A doctor who moves from Johannesburg to North Dakota costs the South African government as much as $100,000, the price of training him there. As with patent enforcement, a larger cost may be in health. A lack of trained people \u2014 a gap that widens daily \u2014 is now the main barrier to fighting AIDS, malaria and other diseases in Africa.\nSometimes reverse subsidies are disguised. Rich-country governments spent $283 billion in 2005 to support and subsidize their own agriculture, mainly agribusiness. Artificially cheap food exported to poor countries might seem like a gift \u2014 but it is often a Trojan horse. Corn, rice or cotton exported by rich countries is so cheap that small farmers in poor countries cannot compete, so they stop farming. Three-quarters of the world\u2019s poor people are rural. The African peasant with an acre and a hoe is losing her livelihood, and the benefits go mainly to companies like Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill. \nMost costly to poor countries, they have been drafted into paying for rich nations\u2019 energy use. On a per capita basis, Americans emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere \u2014 and thus create more global warming \u2014 than anyone else. What we pay to drive a car or keep an industrial plant running is not the true cost of oil or coal. The real price would include the cost of the environmental damage that comes from burning these fuels. But even as we do not pay that price, other countries do. American energy use is being subsidized by tropical coastal nations, who appear to be global warming\u2019s first victims. Some scientists argue that Bangladesh already has more powerful monsoon downpours and Honduras fiercer cyclones because of global warming \u2014 likely indicators of worse things ahead. The islands of the Maldives may someday be completely underwater. The costs these nations will pay do not appear on the global balance sheets. But they are the ultimate subsidy. ",

More information: nysid.edu/news.\nThe Story of Moses\n\u201cRobert Moses and the Modern City,\u201d which consists of exhibitions in three venues, looks at the master builder Robert Moses, who developed dozens of monumental projects in New York during four decades starting in the 1930s. The exhibitions will examine how Moses vastly changed the physical landscape of New York City and how people lived in and around it, with hundreds of new bridges, parkways, beaches, pools, parks, apartment houses and civic buildings. \nTwo museums and a gallery at Columbia University will display drawings; architectural models for buildings, bridges and highways; film excerpts; and historic objects and photographs. Each will also have a collection of large-scale color photographs by Andrew Moore that show how the projects built decades ago have been absorbed into the fabric of the city. \nThese exhibitions coincide with the publication of \u201cRobert Moses and the Modern City: The Transformation of New York\u201d (W.W.

It examines the development of the highway network connecting New Yorkers to ocean beaches in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Long Island; the construction of municipal pools; and the design of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in the 1930s. The plans Moses developed were ambitious: parkways were built with bicycle paths, playgrounds and lots of grass and trees; the pools were huge, with architecturally grand bathhouses; and the visions of the 1939 and 1964 World\u2019s Fairs, set in the 1,255-acre Queens park, literally rose from an ash dump. The exhibition will also include a model of Moses\u2019 plan for a bridge across Long Island Sound, connecting Oyster Bay and Rye, N.Y., and the recently renovated Panorama of New York City. The Panorama, a 9,335-square-foot model of the five boroughs built by Moses for the 1964 World\u2019s Fair, is the largest architectural scale model in the world. It depicts every building in the city as of 1992, when it was last updated.\nThe Queens Museum is open Wednesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Suggested donation is $5; students and those 62 and older, $2.50; members and children under 5, free.

These plans, using money from the federal Housing Act of 1949, involved the demolition of blocks of slums to build middle-class housing projects, such as the East River Houses at Corlears Hook, Penn Station South and Morningside Gardens. This development model was used for later apartment complexes like Kips Bay Plaza, Lincoln Towers and the Silver Towers at New York University.\nThis exhibition also examines campus expansion, at, among others, New York University, Fordham University and Long Island University.\nThe gallery is open Wednesday through Saturday, 1 to 5 p.m. Admission is free. More information: www.columbia.edu/cu/wallach.\nRobert Moses: Civic Projects\nMuseum of the City of New York, Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street; (212) 534-1672.\n\u201cRobert Moses and the Modern City: Remaking the Metropolis\u201d will be at the museum through May 28. This exhibition will look at some of Moses\u2019 large civic projects, including the development of Lincoln Center, the construction of the United Nations and the planning of Riverside and East River parks. It will also look at some of the highways and bridges Moses built, from the scenic Henry Hudson Parkway winding through upper Manhattan and the Bronx to the more utilitarian Cross-Bronx Expressway.\nThere will also be sections devoted to some unrealized projects, like the Midtown and the Lower Manhattan expressways, and a plan to extend Fifth Avenue below Washington Square Park. The defeat of these proposals came as ideas about local community preservation and control coalesced and Moses\u2019 power declined.\nThe museum is open Wednesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Suggested contribution is $9; children, students and those 62 and older, $5; families, $20.\nSetting the Stage\nUrban Center Galleries of the Municipal Art Society, 457 Madison Avenue (East 51st Street); (212) 935-3960. \n\u201cTimes Square Theaters: A New Century, A New Style,\u201d an exhibition of photographs, architectural plans and objects, looks at Broadway theaters from the 20th century, and how audience tastes and changes in technology have affected the designs.

Some two dozen scholars will speak during the event, \u201cRobert Moses: New Perspectives on the Master Builder,\u201d on topics like Robert Moses and the W.P.A. swimming pools in New York; the 1929 regional plan for the metropolitan area; opposition to the Fifth Avenue expansion and Robert Moses\u2019 influence on public housing. Participants may call for information (212-854-2877) or see a schedule at columbia.edu/cu/lehmancenter. Admission will be free. \nRobert Moses: Recreation \nQueens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park; (718) 592-9700. \n \u201cRobert Moses and the Modern City: The Road to Recreation,\u201d the exhibition at the Queens Museum of Art, will be open from Jan. 28 through May 27. It will examine the development of the highway network connecting New Yorkers to ocean beaches in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Long Island; the construction of municipal pools; and the design of Flushing Meadows Corona Park in the 1930s. The plans Moses developed were ambitious: parkways were built with bicycle paths, playgrounds and lots of grass and trees; the pools were huge, with architecturally grand bathhouses; and the vision of the 1939 and 1964 Worlds Fairs, set in the 1,255-acre Queens park, literally rose from an ash dump. The exhibition will also include a model of Moses\u2019 plan for a bridge across Long Island Sound, connecting Oyster Bay and Rye, N.Y.\nOn Feb. 4, the Panorama of New York City, a 9,335-square-foot model of the five boroughs, will reopen after a renovation. The Panorama, the largest architectural scale model in the world, depicts every building in the city as of 1992, when it was last updated. Robert Moses built it for the 1964 World\u2019s Fair. The official exhibition opening, to which the public is welcome, will take place from noon to 5 p.m. on Feb. 4.\nThe Queens Museum is open Wednesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Suggested donation is $5; students and those 62 and older, $2.50; members and children under five, free.

Urban renewal plans, using money from the federal Housing Act of 1949, involved the demolition of blocks of slums to build middle-class housing projects, such as the East River Houses at Corlears Hook, Penn Station South and Morningside Gardens. This development model was that of later apartment complexes like Kips Bay Plaza, Lincoln Towers and the Silver Towers at New York University.\nThis exhibition will also examine campus expansion, at, among others, New York University, Fordham University and Long Island University.\nThe gallery is open Wednesday through Saturday, 1 to 5 p.m. Admission is free. More information: columbia.edu/cu/wallach.\nRobert Moses: Civic Projects\nMuseum of the City of New York, Fifth Avenue at 103d Street; (212) 534-1672.\n\u201cRobert Moses and the Modern City: Remaking the Metropolis,\u201d will be at the museum from Feb. 2 through May 28. This exhibition will look at some of Moses\u2019 large civic projects, including the development of Lincoln Center, the construction of the United Nations and the planning of Riverside Park and East River Park. It will also look at some of the highways and bridges Moses built, from the scenic Henry Hudson Parkway winding through upper Manhattan and the Bronx, to the more utilitarian Cross-Bronx Expressway.\nThere will also be sections devoted to some unrealized projects, like the Midtown Expressway and the Lower Manhattan Expressway, as well as a plan to extend Fifth Avenue below Washington Square Park. The defeat of these proposals came as ideas about local community preservation and control coalesced and Moses\u2019 power declined.\nThe museum is open Wednesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Suggested contribution is $9; children, students and those 62 and older, $5; families, $20.\nSingle Family: Past and Present\nThe Galleries of the New York School of Interior Design, 161 East 69th Street \nand 170 East 70th Street; (212) 472-1500.\nTwo exhibitions will open at the galleries on Feb. 1 and continue through April 21, one looking at pre-fabricated houses in the early 1900\u2019s, and the other a collection of ideas for houses today. \n\u201cPrefabricated Homes in America: The Early 20th Century Mail-Order House,\u201d in the 70th Street gallery, looks at the houses sold by companies like Sears Roebuck and Aladdin as early as 1914. The catalogues and plans in the exhibition offered families a choice of interior floor plan, architectural styles, and the latest home appliances, lighting fixtures and built-in cabinetry, as well as coordinated fabrics, wallpapers, furniture and china. \n\u201cThe HOME House Project: The Future of Affordable Housing,\u201d at the 69th Street gallery, is based on a national competition by the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C. It presents 100 house plans for single-family homes solicited by the HOME project from architects and artists, using Habitat for Humanity\u2019s basic floor plan as a starting point. David J. Brown, the director of the HOME project and the chief curator at the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art, will speak about the design program, which is ongoing, on Jan. 31 at 6 p.m. \nThe galleries are open Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free. More information: nysid.edu/news.\nWinter Antiques Show\nSeventh Regiment Armory, 643 Park Avenue (67th Street); (212) 472-1180.\nThe 53rd annual Winter Antiques Show will continue through Jan. 28. Offerings by the 75 dealers include medieval manuscripts and American folk art, silver serving dishes and Shaker furniture. There are textiles, jewelry, paintings, Indian artworks, ceramics, books and clocks from America, Europe and Asia.\nThere is a special exhibition of 60 objects from the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts in Winston-Salem, N.C. The objects, made in the American South before 1820, will include a carved mahogany tea table from 1750; a round ceramic sign from the shop of Gottfried Aust, a Moravian potter; an 1825 portrait of an American Indian boy by Charles Bird King; and a silver rococo coffee pot made by Alexander Petrie. \nSeveral dealers will offer lectures. Elle Shushan, a dealer in American portrait miniatures from the Colonial era through the 20th century, will speak about the development of an American portrait style, on Jan. 27 at 5:30 p.m. She will look at works by the Peale family, John Wesley Jarvis, Henry Inman, John Singleton Copley and Gilbert Stuart. The other remaining lectures in the series will be about collecting drawings, on Jan. 26 at 5:30 p.m.; and antique frames from the Renaissance to the 20th century, on Jan. 27 at 2:30 p.m. The lectures are free with admission.\nThe show will be open daily from noon to 8 p.m., except on Sundays and Thursdays when it will close at 6 p.m. Admission, which includes a catalog, will be $20.

The images, representing each of the lower 48 states, depict natural places where Mr. Jackson sees faces, figures and other anthropomorphic elements in the landscape. The gallery is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free. More information: perryrubenstein.com.\nMosaics by Tiffany\nLillian Nassau Gallery, 220 East 57th Street; (212) 759-6062.\n\u201cTiffany Glass Tiles and Mosaic Treasures, 1890-1905,\u201d an exhibition of tiles and mosaics designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany and Tiffany Studios, is on display through Jan. 31. Louis Comfort Tiffany considered mosaic art a cornerstone of his designs. He incorporated mosaics and tiles in the Veteran\u2019s Room in the Seventh Regiment Armory (1880); the residence of H.O. Havemeyer in New York (1891); the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company\u2019s Chapel, designed for the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893; and projects for the Marshall Field department store in Chicago.\nThe ceramic pieces and tiles in the exhibition were designed by Tiffany Studios to be used in mosaics, windows and lamps, several of which will be on display at the gallery. Open Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturday, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free. Information: lilliannassau.com.\nGold, in Depth\nAmerican Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street; (212) 769-5100. \n\u201cGold,\u201d an exhibition that includes gold bars, coins, Olympic medals, pre-Columbian jewelry and gold-plated presentation phonograph records, runs through Aug. 19, 2007.

(near Fourth Street), Washington; (202) 272-2448. \n\u201cReinventing the Globe: A Shakespearean Theater for the 21st Century,\u201d an exhibition of drawings, photographs, maps and models, will be at the museum through Aug. 27.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \nMuseums\n \u2605 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: MART\u00edN RAM\u00edREZ,  through April 29. Ram\u00edrez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty.) But most of all, Ram\u00edrez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)\n \u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)\n \u2605 GREY ART GALLERY: \u2018SEMINA CULTURE: WALLACE BERMAN & HIS CIRCLE,\u2019 through March 31. The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) may ring only a faint bell to many New Yorkers, but he was a central, charismatic figure in an underground of West Coast artists and poets in the 1950s and 60s. A collagist, poet, photographer and the publisher of an influential journal, Semina, he inspired others to make art too, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write. And a traveling love company of them has come to Grey Art Gallery, trailing dreams, delusions and marijuana clouds. New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780. (Holland Cotter)\n \u2605 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY\u2019 through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can\u2019t tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. \n (Michael Kimmelman) \n INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON\u2019S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,\u2019 through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive \u2014 the \u201cposthumous\u201d exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It\u2019s an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Kimmelman) \nINTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018MARTIN MUNKACSI: THINK WHILE YOU SHOOT!\u2019 through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early \u201860s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. He became a celebrity in America. He photographed Fred Astaire dancing and Joan Crawford poolside. In the breezy layouts of Harper\u2019s Bazaar, the work looked brilliant. (See above.) \n(Kimmelman) \n * THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer, and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) \nMORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018PRIVATE TREASURES: FOUR CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTER DRAWINGS,\u2019 through April 8. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The works span more than 400 years, from the 16th to the early 20th century, and include drawings in ink and pencil, watercolor, chalk and gouache. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn\u2019t an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one\u2019s craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example \u2014 and the most historically significant work here \u2014 is a black chalk drawing, \u201cThe Dead Christ\u201d (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don\u2019t know where they came from, where they\u2019re going, or when you\u2019ll see them again. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org.\n (Martha Schwendener) \n \u2605 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ARMANDO REVER\u00d3N, through April 16. Unless you spotted his single smoke-puff of a painting at MoMA months ago, Armando Rever\u00f3n probably means nothing to you. Why should he? The artist, who died in 1954, spent most of his life in a shack by the sea in his native Venezuela. Many of his contemporaries dismissed him as nuts. His white-on-white pictures are practically unphotographable. But chances are that if you visit this retrospective, you\u2019ll find yourself thinking about him a lot. His art and his story are like few others, and so is the museum\u2019s inspired installation: a single, long corridor with cabinetlike rooms of paintings on either side and, at the very end, against a sea-green wall, a life-size doll with giant bat wings floating overhead. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)\nNEUBERGER MUSEUM OF ART: FUGITIVE ARTIST: THE EARLY WORK OF RICHARD PRINCE, 1974-77, through June 24. This artist is one of the most elusive, perverse and sardonic of all of the important appropriation artists to emerge in the early 1980s, so perhaps it is not surprising that he has boycotted this exhibition of little-known early work, all from public and private collections. But that doesn\u2019t stop the 50 pieces on view from revealing his roots in 1970s Conceptual Art; his progress from generic to original and radical; or the depth and duration of his fascination with language, photography, print-making, the more banal forms of urban postwar Americana and a disconnected, decidedly male blankness. If anything, it increases his stature. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100. (Smith)\n  \n \n Last Chance\n\n \u2605 TONY CONRAD In 1973 the conceptual artist, composer and filmmaker Tony Conrad decided to make a movie that would last a lifetime, so he painted white squares on big, scroll-like sheets of paper and hung the results on the wall for a one-night \u201cscreening.\u201d In fact, those \u201cYellow Movies\u201d have been playing ever since, the action being physical change through the effects of time and light. Displayed in a gallery more than 30 years later, they are an exhilarating sight: Zen thankas that are also abstract paintings that are also existential projection screens. The film of a lifetime is still in progress. Greene Naftali, 526 West 26th Street, eighth floor, Chelsea, (212) 463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter).\n \u2605 \u2018LET EVERYTHING BE TEMPORARY, OR WHEN IS THE EXHIBITION?\u2019 Some of the best art ever made was meant to fade away, and in these days of serious object-glut, a little ephemerality comes as a relief. That\u2019s the point of this barely-there show organized by Elena Filipovic. To a Felix Gonzalez-Torres pile of freebie candy, she adds Gabriel Kuri\u2019s display of ripening avocadoes; Jo\u00eblle Tuerlinckx\u2019s site-specific confetti floor piece; Oksana Pasaiko\u2019s disappearing soap; and Michel Blazy\u2019s mashed-potato mural. A wall text by Tomo Savic-Gecan speculates on giving market value to art that is in a constant state of change. The artist Boris Belay is filming the whole disappearing show through tomorrow. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, apexart.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n \u2605 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,\u2019 The 100 paintings and drawings on display here are by 10 artists, including George Grosz, Christian Schad and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic\u2019s porous worlds reassemble; we look into the faces of museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Monday. (Smith) \n\u2605 THE MET: SET IN STONE: THE FACE IN MEDIEVAL SCULPTURE One of those revelatory close-ups at which the Metropolitan Museum of Art excels, This show brings together nearly 80 carved, mostly limestone heads, mostly from the 12th and 13th centuries, mostly torn during bouts of iconoclasm from the sculptures and reliefs that turned Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches into Bibles in stone. There are excellent side trips, into the grotesque, the influence of the antique, the glimmers of the Renaissance and a new isotope-matching technique that helping to divine which heads come from where. The treatments of hair and beard with which medieval sculptors were more at ease than they were with, say, eyes or smiles, are almost a show within a show, as, in their own way, are the haunting, seemingly modernist works that look like nothing else here. (212) 535-7710; closes on Monday. (Smith)\n \u2605 VERA ILIATOVA For her New York solo debut, the Russian-born artist Vera Iliatova delivers a group of small, detailed, atmospheric paintings in which groups of young women \u2014 all self-portraits of the artist \u2014 gather in bucolic settings that make Eden a place of exile. In one painting we are simultaneously in a Poussinian glade, a Brooklyn tenement and a ruined resort. Autumn trees blaze; fighter planes pass overhead. Two women appear in the poses of Masaccio\u2019s Adam and Eve after the Fall; others talk, wrestle and wail. Monya Rowe Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Room 605, Chelsea, (212) 255-5065, monyarowegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n  \u2605 \u2018NETWORKED NATURE\u2019 This cool little show, organized by Marisa Olson for Rhizome, a new-media organization associated with the New Museum of Contemporary Art, filters that old Romantic standby, Nature, through the new-fangled technology. Philip Ross powers hydroponic plant environments with LED lighting; Shih-Chieh Huang creates an inflatable flower through concepts from robotics. A California collective, C5, evokes \u201csublime locales\u201d through global positioning systems. Stephen Vitiello has the voices George W. Bush whispering in an ivy bush; Gail Wight, in a video called \u201cCreep,\u201d makes slime mold look sort of beautiful. Foxy Production, 617 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-2758; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)\n  MARIO SCHIFANO: PAINTINGS 1960-1966 All but indivisible in New York for 40 years, the work of this Italian artist, who died in 1998 at the age of 64, receives a stirring welcome back in this exhibition of 20 drawings and paintings. In monochromes on brown paper and in canvases involving the Coca-Cola logo and pieces of Plexiglas, Pop and Minimalism are joined almost before they were invented. The more homegrown influence of Arte Povera is visible in the startling nonchalance and even roughness of some works.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.\nMuseums\n \u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. \n(Roberta Smith)\n CHINA INSTITUTE: \u2018SHU,\u2019 through Feb. 24. This second installation of a two-part show glances back at the period of artistic expansion in the 1970s, and its contraction, after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Qiu Zhijie\u2019s photographic \u201clibrary,\u201d which papers the walls of the China Institute\u2019s main staircase, makes evident the information explosion in the 80s. Among the thousands of titles are Chinese classics, books on natural sciences and treatises by Plato, Disraeli and Harold Bloom. Such a trove might have been considered a treasure before Tiananmen Square; afterward, such resources became sources of angst. The figure that appears throughout Zhang Xiaogang\u2019s 1991 series \u201cPrivate Notes,\u201d for example, looks as if he is losing his mind \u0097 and his head, torso and myriad other body parts \u0097 as he struggles to write letters and decode illegible manuscripts. Without easy access to words, the images imply, there can be no such thing as free expression. 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org. \n(Bridget L. Goodbody)\n  COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) \n \u2605 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY\u2019 through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org.\n (Michael Kimmelman) \n \u2605 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,\u2019 through Feb. 19. This show\u2019s 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic\u2019s porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) \n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL \u0097 AN ARTIST\u2019S COUNTRY ESTATE,\u2019 through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house- museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound \u0097 and of the Tiffany residences preceding it \u0097 is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany\u2019s genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,\u2019 through March 4. Saul Steinberg\u2019s famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg\u2019s progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like \u201cFeet on Chair\u201d (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like \u201cStreet War (Cadavre Exquisis)\u201d (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)\n \u2605 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG\u2019S NEW YORK,\u2019 through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg\u2019s eyes, could be monuments, too. You may think you know Steinberg\u2019s work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)\n  \n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018KIKI SMITH: A GATHERING, 1980-2005,\u2019 through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum\u2019s black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith\u2019s art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org.\n (Holland Cotter)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n \u2605 SERGIO PREGO To take the fullest pleasure in this exhibition, you must stand perfectly still and quiet in front of \u201cBlack Monday\u201d (2006), a single-channel video of still life photographs of con trolled fireworks explosions taken inside an abandoned factory in Bilbao, Spain. In all, the artist took more than a thousand photographs of 17 different explosions, using 40 cameras. He then scanned them into a computer, cropped them and ran them together to create the video. He also composed what he calls \u201ca sequencing of sounds,\u201d a series of repeating ambient electronic noises that serve as the soundtrack. The result is a multifaceted representation of something that is usually invisible to the eye: explosion clouds immobilized in time and space, forming immensely beautiful sculptural shapes. Lehmann Maupin Gallery, 540 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-2923, www.lehmannmaupin.com, through Feb 10. (Benjamin Genocchio)\nLast Chance\n \u2605 HENRY DARGER: THE VIVIAN GIRLS EMERGE Further proof that Henry Darger\u2019s epic art did not spring whole from a fevered outsider brain is provided by a cache of his early forays into image collecting and collage. Most spectacular is \u201cThe Battle of Calverhine,\u201d a leathery, reliclike panorama of carefully knit and hand-tinted found images. It teems with all things Darger (and not a little Pop) and has never been exhibited in this country. Andrew Edlin Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9723; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n\u2605 CANDIDA HOFER  In large color photographs of the different galleries of the Louvre, taken on Tuesdays when the museum is closed, both the long, vaulted spaces and the painting and sculpture they contain speak of different times and styles. Equally affecting, if not a little frightening, is the lavish, timeless grandeur of these vistas. A palace that became a museum, the Louvre is also a precursor of the barrel-vaulted arcades that sprang up in Paris in the first half of the 19th century. Most of them are gone, but the Louvre\u2019s arcades live on. Sort of. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-1018; closes tomorrow(Smith)\nNINA KATCHADOURIAN: \u2018OFFICE SEMAPHORE\u2019 Ms. Katchadourian has borrowed marine flag signaling techniques to create an interactive art project consisting of an old-fashioned tourist telescope installed at the corner of a plaza in the middle of the financial district, its lens trained on the window of an upper-floor office in a nearby skyscraper. Each day the man working in the office, or his assistant, arranges objects on his widow sill. The combination and order of the objects represent a specific message, which viewers down on the plaza can interpret using a key-chart on the telescope. 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, corner of Liberty and William Streets, Lower Manhattan; stairway entrance to the plaza is on William Street, at Cedar Street; www.publicartfund.org; closes on Sunday. (Genocchio)\u2605 THE MET: \u2018SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT\u2019 The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully\u2019s bold and energizing \u201cWall of Light\u201d paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. They are complemented by tiny independent watercolors that Mr. Scully sees as \u201cantidotes\u201d to the big ones. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks), whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. \u201cI\u2019m trying to turn stone into light,\u201d Mr. Scully has said, and the more you look at them, the more filled with light and life they become. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Monday. (Glueck)\n HELEN MIRRA: BREAK CAMP This show of carefully composed, low-lying sculptures made from cut-up wood pallets has a smooth, almost Zen serenity, but its thoughtful brand of Post-Minimalism seems both precious and overly familiar, creating the impression of an engaging sensibility that could aim much higher. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n \u2605 MUSEUM OF ARTS & DESIGN: \u2018SIMPLY DROOG: 10 + 3 YEARS OF CREATING DISCUSSION AND INNOVATION\u2019 . Droog Design, a many-headed, loosely affiliated collective of usually, but not entirely, Dutch designers and architects, has probably generated more discussion than innovation in its 13 years of existence. Presented in a free-flowing, Droog-designed layout, this show vigorously continues the process. It includes about 150 mostly domestic objects by scores of designers. Some are great, some are silly, some are Conceptual Art. But there is plenty to sink your teeth into, especially with help from the small free brochure containing label information and rationales for each item. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)\n\u2605 MOMA: \u2018BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS\u2019 This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (212) 708-9400; closes on Monday. (Smith) \n \u2605 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER\u2019  With 46 artists and a mix of usual and unusual suspects, this exhibition forms a black hole in which Dada, Fluxus, Punk, Pop, Conceptual and Neo-Conceptual mingle like cackling furies, along with Performance art, feminism, abject art and various forms of appropriation. While its dour tone becomes a bit relentless, it is admirably consistent and shows artists grappling with reality, which has its own kind of comfort. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday. (Smith)\n P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018THE GOLD STANDARD\u2019 Gold is both color and subject in this glittering, pertinent show, installed on creamy yellow walls. Even though a generally dim view of contemporary society prevails, it is scary how good gold makes everything look. (See above.) Closes on Monday (Smith) \nSIGMAR POLKE Painting is man\u2019s oldest conjuring trick, and Sigmar Polke is one of its reigning magicians. In this show, new paintings and those from the 1980s, all two-sided and painted with resin, surround a small selection of German Baroque amber (Bernstein is German for amber) jewelry and exquisite tchotchkes. The show simulates a Wunderkammer, a darkened wonder cabinet of the 17th or 18th century. The paintings, made translucent by the resin, nearly defy deciphering. Doodles and abstract splashes of white paint overlay murky washes of glowing resin on both sides of their membranous support, then cast dim shadows on the wall behind, so that the pictures seem suspended in midair, floating. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, www.michaelwerner.net; closes tomorrow \n(Kimmelman) \nQUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018QUEENS INTERNATIONAL 2006: EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE\u2019 . The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as of Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition\u2019s subtitle. The show tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer\u2019s quick-cut video \u201cEveryday,\u201d which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Martha Schwendener)",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \n\u2018THEATER OF CRUELTY\u2019 Antonin Artaud (1896-1948) was a Surrealist poet, mystic, drug addict and playwright who is said to have died sitting at the foot of his bed, holding a shoe. Rebellious young writers and artists have long admired him, especially his 1938 manifesto, \u201cThe Theater and Its Double,\u201d which includes the essay \u201cThe Theater of Cruelty,\u201d describing performances that try to shock, affect and unsettle the audience as much as they can. At White Box in Chelsea, the curator Ra\u00fal Zamudio has gathered a marvelously twisted assortment of artwork by two dozen artists from as many nations, all paying homage to Artaud; some of it will no doubt leave you scratching your head in wonder. Video dominates, including Daniel Joseph Martinez\u2019s \u201cHollow Men\u201d (video image, above) and Sislej Xhafa\u2019s poignant, chilling close-up of a gun on muddy ground being pelted with rain. Something terrible has happened here. Marcos Lopez shows small but intriguingly staged photographs of autopsies, with the arrangement of the figures mirroring scenes from Western religious iconographic traditions. Teresa Margolles has a sound installation of a real autopsy guaranteed to give you goose bumps, especially when the pathologist pulls out the power tools. Then there is Martin Durazo\u2019s vibrant, chaotic installation in a cubbyholelike crevice in which strobe lights, sound, sculpture and psychedelic video projections, among other things, freely intermingle. The show\u2019s wider purpose can be hard to grasp, but the setup gives a clear nod to Artaud. (Through Aug. 11, White Box, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, 212-714-2347, whiteboxny.org.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO \nMuseums\n\u2605 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: \u2018THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)\n \u2605 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018THE SHAPES OF SPACE,\u2019 through Sept. 5. The Guggenheim takes time off from thematic blockbusters to bring the public up to date on recent acquisitions, provocatively installed by three younger curators among an astute selection of older works from the collection. The theme is space, one of modern art\u2019s central concerns. The results are mixed, but cause for optimism. It is not every day you can look at a Mondrian while listening to disco and rap emanating from another kind of grid: the flashing patterns of a digitized dance floor by Piotr Uklanski. The atmosphere can get a bit mall-like at times, but this is what every New York museum needs to do more: play with the collection and find new ways to bring it to life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)\n\n \u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,\u2019 through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work\u2019s laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. \n(Michael Kimmelman)\n\n\u2605 International Center of Photography: \u2018Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)\nMETROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother, Stephen, was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.). The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling \u201cdrew the line\u201d at C\u00e9zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso \u201cbad painters and fakers.\u201d Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting \u2014 and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nTHE MET: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) \n(Grace Glueck)\n THE MET: \u2018HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,\u2019 through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum\u2019s collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: \u201cThe question is not what you look at but what you see.\u201d Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans\u2019s late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore\u2019s landscapes and Rachel Harrison\u2019s photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show \u2014 only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms \u2014 it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Schwendener)\n* THE MET: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA,\u2019 through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter\u2019s mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th- century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch\u2019s talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)\n* THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Dec. 2. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck) \nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)\nMUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: \u2018THE FRENCH EVOLUTION: RACE, POLITICS & THE 2005 RIOTS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. Alexis Peskine serves as an informed guide to recent events in France, although his position is somewhat complicated. Son of a Franco-Russian father (an architect) and an Afro-Brazilian mother, Mr. Peskine holds a bachelor of fine arts degree from Howard University and a master\u2019s from the Maryland Institute College of Art, which set him distinctly apart from the working-class youth in the banlieue, or suburb. His training as a graphic artist is evident in paintings that appropriate elements from comics, cartoons and food products, while his interest in hip-hop culminates in a music video titled \u201cRipa\u201d (slang for Paris). Uneven at times, Mr. Peskine\u2019s work is ambitious and reflective. It also succeeds in showing us how in France\u2019s difficulties we feel echoes of our own. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org.\n (Schwendener)\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,\u2019 through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His \u201cTorqued Ellipses\u201d and \u201cTorqued Toruses\u201d and other recent works like \u201cBand\u201d and \u201cSequence\u201d have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That\u2019s about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)\nMUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,\u2019 through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York\u2019s work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)\nTHE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: \u2018PARADISE IN PRINT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Watercolors, folio editions, rare books and prints from the 18th through the mid-20th centuries reveal how closely linked natural and human histories have been in the Caribbean over the last 500 years. Engravings and lithographs of cash crops like coffee, chocolate, tobacco and sugar (nicknamed \u201cgreen gold\u201d) are accompanied by images from Mark Catesby\u2019s 18th-century natural history, which served as the model for Audubon\u2019s \u201cBirds of America\u201d; images of African slaves and colonialists; selections from the 19th-century French lithographer Etienne Denisse\u2019s book \u201cFlora of America;\u201d and Nikolaus Joseph Jacquin\u2019s extraordinary \u201cSelectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia,\u201d published around 1780 in Vienna and illustrated with watercolors painted directly into the book. (It was purchased for the Botanical Garden by Andrew Carnegie.) Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, (718) 817-8616, nybg.org. (Schwendener)\n NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,\u2019  through Feb. 25. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with \u201csacred\u201d sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole\u2019s epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, \u201cThe Course of Empire,\u201d is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. The exhibition includes works by George Loring Brown, Asher B. Durand, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church and others. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Schwendener)\nNEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro- slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. (See above) (Edward Rothstein)\n NOGUCHI MUSEUM: \u2018SURVEY OF PARIS ABSTRACTIONS,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Early in his career, Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) received a Guggenheim Fellowship and went to Paris, where he was introduced to Brancusi a few days after arriving. For five weeks in 1927, Noguchi served as Brancusi\u2019s apprentice. Afterward, he set up his own studio in Gentilly, outside of Paris, where he created the 30 gouaches, or opaque watercolors, and six of the sculptures on view here. Brancusi\u2019s influence on Noguchi is obvious in works like \u201cGlobular,\u201d from 1928, an abstract brass sculpture that looks so much like a Brancusi that out of this context it would probably be mistaken for one. But a selection of works from the 1920s to the 1980s shows how the lessons from this period continued to inform Noguchi throughout his career. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. \n(Schwendener)\n\u2605 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018ORGANIZING CHAOS,\u2019 through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn\u2019t rule out many interesting connections. The subject of \u201corganizing chaos\u201d is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimar\u00e3es, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitieollo. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)\nWADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, \u2018WHERE WERE WE,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,\u2019 through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein\u2019s brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein\u2019s taste clearly hasn\u2019t won the day, but it\u2019s never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018RESISTANCE IS ... ,\u2019 through Sept. 2. This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it\u2019s smart, engaging and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn\u2019t look or feel more apposite. (See above.) \n(Benjamin Genocchio)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018RUDOLF STINGEL,\u2019 through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions seen lately at the Whitney. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (See above.) (Smith)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,\u2019 through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) \nGalleries: Uptown\n\u2018MAGICAL MEANS: MILTON AVERY AND WATERCOLOR\u2019 Milton Avery (1885-1965) painted in watercolor mostly when he was away from his New York studio. Watercolors were light and easy to transport, and during the Depression, when the cost of paper was a consideration, he could use both sides of a sheet. Works spanning more than 30 years are here, including landscapes, portraits, still lifes and abstract compositions. Bulky bathers show him distilling the influence of Matisse and Picasso. Echoes of Ashcan realism are obvious in paintings of train tracks or the boardwalk at Coney Island. Mostly the work shows Avery\u2019s consistent desire to, as he once said, \u201celiminate and simplify, leaving apparently nothing but color and form.\u201d Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Aug. 10. (Schwendener)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n \u2018AGITATION AND REPOSE\u2019 This group show opens with a very anxious object: a wall clock with spinning hands, by Via Lewandowsky. It continues with Rainer Ganahl\u2019s bicycle ride into oncoming traffic and Holly Zausner\u2019s body-laden tour of Berlin, and concludes with Claire Watkins\u2019s sculpture of what appears to be a detached nervous system. The real draw, though, is a group of six short videos by, and starring, the excellent Roman Signer. In one, a helicoptor buzzes him in bed; in another, hay explodes through the floor as he sits reading; in a third, a sudden explosion prompts him to start \u2014 and finish \u2014 a painting. Repose has never been Mr. Signer\u2019s thing. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Aug. 17. (Cotter)\n  \u2605 \u2018COLOUR BEFORE COLOR\u2019 The spelling discrepancy in the show\u2019s title is meant to indicate that color photography as we now know it was not the exclusive achievement of Americans like William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, but was also nurtured by a group of European photographers whose efforts range from the subtle still lifes of Luigi Ghirri (which are similar to those of Irving Penn) to claustrophobic close-ups of sun bathers by the Spanish photographer Carlos P\u00e9rez Siquier. The show, organized by the British photographer Martin Parr, is a must-see for anyone interested in the medium. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, hastedhunt.com, through Aug. 17. (Smith)\n \u2605 \u2018A POINT IN SPACE IS A PLACE FOR AN ARGUMENT\u2019 Despite its title, taken from the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, this group show of 56 works by 30 artists is fairly even-tempered, less about argument than about unexpected connections. With special attention to the margins and physical process, it ranges across generations, styles and mediums, gathering together works by Lynda Benglis, Bruce Nauman, Niki de Saint Phalle, Forrest Bess, Joe Overstreet, Cathy Wilkes, Raoul De Keyser, Al Taylor and Andre Cadere. Common ground is a shared opposition to tradition, to standard definitions of greatness, to accepted notions of material or finish, or to the separation of art mediums. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com, through Aug. 10. (Smith)\n\u2018SOURCE CODE\u2019 This is the first of three shows commemorating Eyebeam\u2019s 10th anniversary. The roster includes \u201cartists, technologists, hackers and programmers,\u201d among them Cory Arcangel, Radical Software Group, Mark Napier, Carrie Dashow, Nina Katchadourian, Steve Lambert, Golan Levin and Jennifer and Kevin McCoy. \u201cThe Duellists\u201d by MediaShed is a work in which two young men, videotaped on closed-circuit television in a shopping center, engage in a choreographed performance of Parkour, a form of \u201cfree running\u201d that looks like a combination of break dancing, martial arts, acrobatics and skateboarding without the board. Interesting that in an exhibition centered on technology, a work that puts raw human ability in the foreground steals the show. Eyebeam, 540 West 21st Street, (212) 937-6580, eyebeam.org, through Aug. 11. (Schwendener)\nGalleries: Other\n MARTIN CREED: \u2018FEELINGS\u2019 Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of beanbag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an antigravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, through Sept. 16. (Smith)\n SOL LEWITT: \u2018DRAWING SERIES ...\u2019 If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early \u201970s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)\nPublic Art\nMAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, \u201cConjoined\u201d and \u201cDefunct,\u201d and a glacierlike boulder, \u201cErratic,\u201d by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is \u201cConjoined,\u201d a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other\u2019s end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Genocchio) \nLast Chance\n GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,\u2019 Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat\u2019s invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; closes on Monday.(Smith)\n \u2605 ALEX HAY: \u2018NEW PAINTINGS\u2019 In the 1960s this painter pitted Pop, Photo Realism and abstraction against one another. Now he has turned to \u201cfound\u201d abstractions: enlarged replications of weathered, peeling boards. Made with an elaborate process of stenciling and spray painting, they lean toward the Modernist monochrome, while keeping one foot planted in trompe l\u2019oeil. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com; closes today. (Smith)\nTHE JEWISH MUSEUM: \u2018DATELINE: ISRAEL: NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though on the whole the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) \n JIM ISERMANN: \u2018VINYL SMASH-UP, 1999-2007\u2019 This exhibition sets out to be a mini-retrospective of Jim Isermann\u2019s vinyl decals. Though the pieces are hung in a manner more appropriate to an interior designer\u2019s showroom than to an art gallery, this Electric-Kool-Aid-Acid-Test-colored show will give you a good dose of California-meets-Op-Art aesthetics. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com; closes tomorrow. (Goodbody)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018POIRET: KING OF FASHION\u2019 A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) \u201cDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition, the latest effort from the Met\u2019s esteemed Costume Institute, does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) \n \u2018PROMISED LAND\u2019 Blink and you could be standing in the American wing of a big survey museum, only Americana here is delivered with a twist: a painting with a hunter standing over a pile of wildlife booty; a pencil drawing of Ben Franklin sitting cross-legged with an eagle above him ready to pounce; a tattered Confederate flag made with bubble gum and hung from a twig. The show, organized by Elizabeth M. Grady, takes its title from John Salvest\u2019s illuminated sign with black vinyl letters spelling out the words \u201cPromised Land.\u201d Like much of the work here, the sign, bordered with blinking red lights, offers sardonic commentary on the contemporary state of the Union. Morgan Lehman, 317 10th Avenue, at 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-2699, morganlehmangallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)\n\u2605 \u2018ROLE EXCHANGE\u2019 This elegant exhibition takes an interesting idea and walks with it. The idea, widespread among artists since the late 1960s, is the practice of creating fictional identities, especially in camera-based work. But it is thorough and contains a handful of unfamiliar artists and works. And one effort is especially worth the trip: Kalup Linzy\u2019s fabulously nuanced (and lip-synched) new video, a collaboration with Shaun Leonardo that restates a vintage blues duet as a gay flirtation. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea (212) 239-1181, skny.com; closes today. (Smith)",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \n\u2018AUTOMATIC UPDATE\u2019 Artists forgo more traditional image-making materials for a taste of recent technologies \u2014 LCD screens, DVD players, digital video and computers \u2014 in this buoyant survey of media installations at the Museum of Modern Art. The show begins in a black-box gallery on the second floor, with an interactive installation of 21 LCD screens on a wall connected to a laptop computer, a work by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, a young Mexican artist. Viewers can enter random words and ideas into the computer, which are then generated into questions and displayed on the screens; viewed in passing, the questions are like subliminal messages. Nearby is an installation by Jennifer and Kevin McCoy, an American husband-and-wife artist team, consisting of a tabletop model recreating the famous car accident scene from Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s 1967 film \u201cWeekend.\u201d Video cameras film the scene, the tabletop rotating to create the impression of movement, with the footage computer-processed and then played back live in a projection on an adjacent wall. It may be the coolest thing you\u2019ve ever seen. But also likable are Xu Bing\u2019s interactive computer installation, above, in which viewers are invited to communicate using popular symbols, and Paul Pfeiffer\u2019s tiny LCD monitor showing a digital loop of spinning and hovering basketballs, the artist having digitally removed the players from video of NBA games. Mr. Pfeiffer\u2019s piece is pretty fabulous, both as a contemplative, abstract aesthetic experience and as a meditation on beauty in sport. (Through Sept. 3, 212-708-9400, moma.org.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO \nMuseums\n\u2605 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: \u2018THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor., and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention. and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018THE SHAPES OF SPACE,\u2019 through Sept. 5. The Guggenheim takes time off from thematic blockbusters to bring the public up to date on recent acquisitions, provocatively installed by three younger curators among an astute selection of older works from the collection. The theme is space, one of modern art\u2019s central concerns. The results are mixed, but cause for optimism. It is not every day you can look at a Mondrian while listening to disco and rap emanating from another kind of grid: the flashing patterns of a digitized dance floor by Piotr Uklanski. The atmosphere can get a bit mall-like at times, but this is what every New York museum needs to do more: play with the collection and find new ways to bring it to life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. \n(Smith)\n \u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,\u2019 through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did comprises most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work\u2019s laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. \n(Michael Kimmelman)\n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN-AMERICAN PORTRAITS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African-American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, a little too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) \nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community.

A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum\u2019s collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: \u201cThe question is not what you look at but what you see.\u201d Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans\u2019s late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore\u2019s landscapes and Rachel Harrison\u2019s photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show \u2014 only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms \u2014 it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Martha Schwendener)\n* THE MET: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge of the department, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA,\u2019 through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter\u2019s mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th- century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch\u2019s talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)\n* THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Dec. 2. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) \nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)\nMUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: \u2018THE FRENCH EVOLUTION: RACE, POLITICS & THE 2005 RIOTS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. Alexis Peskine serves as an informed guide to recent events in France, although his position is somewhat complicated. Son of a Franco-Russian father (an architect) and an Afro-Brazilian mother, Mr. Peskine holds a bachelor of fine arts degree from Howard University and a master\u2019s from the Maryland Institute College of Art, which set him distinctly apart from the working-class youth in the banlieue, or suburb. His training as a graphic artist is evident in paintings that appropriate elements from comics, cartoons and food products, while his interest in hip-hop culminates in a music video titled \u201cRipa\u201d (slang for Paris). Uneven at times, Mr. Peskine\u2019s work is ambitious and reflective. It also succeeds in showing us how in France\u2019s difficulties we feel echoes of our own. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Schwendener)\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,\u2019 through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His \u201cTorqued Ellipses\u201d and \u201cTorqued Toruses\u201d and other recent works like \u201cBand\u201d and \u201cSequence\u201d have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That\u2019s about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)\nMUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,\u2019 through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York\u2019s work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)\nNEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,\u2019  through Feb. 25January 13. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with \u201csacred\u201d sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole\u2019s epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, \u201cThe Course of Empire,\u201d is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. The exhibition includes works by George Loring Brown, Asher B. Durand, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church and others. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org.\n(Schwendener)\nNEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro- slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there was another in which slavery was defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historical objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. (See above.) (Edward Rothstein)\nNOGUCHI MUSEUM: \u2018SURVEY OF PARIS ABSTRACTIONS,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Early in his career, Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) received a Guggenheim Fellowship and went to Paris, where he was introduced to Brancusi a few days after arriving. For five weeks in 1927, Noguchi served as Brancusi\u2019s apprentice. Afterward, he set up his own studio in Gentilly, outside of Paris, where he created the 30 gouaches, or opaque watercolors, and six of the sculptures on view here. Brancusi\u2019s influence on Noguchi is obvious in works like \u201cGlobular,\u201d from 1928, an abstract brass sculpture that looks so much like a Brancusi that out of this context it would probably be mistaken for one. But a selection of works from the 1920s to the 1980s shows how the lessons from this period continued to inform Noguchi throughout his career. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. \n(Schwendener)\n P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018THE DONNER PARTY,\u2019 through Sept. 24. Jim Shaw\u2019s \u201cDonner Party\u201d merges the saga of the ill-fated Donner-Reed Party, westbound settlers trapped in the High Sierras in the winter of 1846 to 1847, with Judy Chicago\u2019s benchmark feminist installation \u201cThe Dinner Party.\u201d The central element is a ring of miniature covered wagons that mimics the dining table in Ms. Chicago\u2019s work, with 27 sculptures assembled from items purchased in thrift stores. It may seem like a work based on sick, twisted, juvenile humor (O.K., it is \u2014 but that\u2019s Mr. Shaw\u2019s allure), yet \u201cThe Donner Party\u201d also contemplates how myths \u2014 national or, in the case of Ms. Chicago, individual \u2014 are forged and perpetuated, and it serves as a cautionary tale for taking them too seriously. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Schwendener)\n\u2605 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018ORGANIZING CHAOS,\u2019 through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn\u2019t rule out many interesting connections. The subject of \u201corganizing chaos\u201d is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimar\u00e3es, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitiello. (See above.) (Smith)\nP.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018PETER YOUNG: 1963-1977,\u2019 through Sept. 24. This ebullient show retraces the rapid rise of a maverick abstract painter who made it big and then took a pass, leaving town to settle eventually in Bisbee, Ariz. With the dot as his main staple, he worked in an array of styles, mixing Color Field, Minimalism and Process Art as he pleased. There are near-Photo-Realist images of streaming galaxies; luscious motifs derived from folding bare canvas onto painted canvas; chunky necklaces made of acrylic paint; and quirky, geometric line paintings stretched on tree branches. The show is a blast from the past that singes the present. (See above.) (Smith)\nTHE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018MIDNIGHT\u2019S DAYDREAM,\u2019 through Oct. 28. The three artists in this show were artists in residence at the Studio Museum of Harlem in the last year, but their work represents very different approaches. Titus Kaphar is the classicist, taking European and American portrait paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries and reconfiguring them into strategic compositions. Wardell Milan II is the archetypal collagist, photographing arrangements of art reproductions, family photos and images cut from magazines. Demetrius Oliver is the Conceptualist, working in the trickster vein of David Hammons and Duchamp. All three, however, actively confront race and (art) history, which often seems a mandate for young black artists. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Schwendener)\nWADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, \u2018WHERE WERE WE,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,\u2019 through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein\u2019s brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein\u2019s taste clearly hasn\u2019t won the day, but it\u2019s never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018RESISTANCE IS ... ,\u2019 through Sept. 2. This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it\u2019s smart, engaging and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn\u2019t look or feel more apposite. (See above.) (Benjamin Genocchio)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018RUDOLF STINGEL,\u2019 through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions seen lately at the Whitney. (See above.) (Smith)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,\u2019 through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter)\nGalleries: Uptown\n \u2018EMANCIPATORY ACTION: PAULA TROPE AND THE MENINOS\u2019 Paula Trope\u2019s work with the meninos, children who live in the favelas, or shantytowns, in Rio de Janeiro, is similar to Zana Briski\u2019s \u201cKids With Cameras\u201d project, chronicled in the film \u201cBorn Into Brothels.\u201d Like Ms. Briski, Ms. Trope distributes cameras among the children, but the cameras are rudimentary pinhole devices; and the grainy, blurry photographs, which look as if they were taken with a fisheye lens, are less photojournalism than elements in a larger conceptual project. Influenced by Brazilian art from the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 H\u00e9lio Oiticica, Cildo Meireles, Miguel Rio Branco and the filmmaker Glauber Rocha, figures central to Neo-Concretism, Tropicalia and Cinema Novo \u2014 Ms. Trope cites \u201cotherness\u201d and issues of authorship as central to her project. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, (212) 249-8950, through Sept 1. (Schwendener)\n \u2018OLD SCHOOL\u2019 The contemporary painters in \u201cOld School\u201d are interested in what might be called the proto-Surrealist sensibility of art made centuries before Freud. Anj Smith, Jakub Julian Ziolkowski and Hilary Harkness work well alongside Brueghel. A painting attributed to the School of Caravaggio serves as a reasonable springboard for grotesque still-life reinterpretations by Glenn Brown and John Currin, and portraits by Elizabeth Peyton and Jan van Noordt, among others. \u201cOld School\u201d skips the heavy art history explaining how paintings functioned as religious tracts, sermons on morality and proof of social status. But if you want art history, the Frick is only a block away. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through Aug. 31. (Schwendener)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n \u2018DOUBLE X-RATED: WHERE THE GIRLS ARE\u2019 The \u201cDouble X\u201d in the title of this all-woman group show, organized by Amelia Abdullahsani, refers to female chromosomes, which clearly do not determine any one art style. Despite a shared realism, goth-subculture portraits by the Stockholm-based Ulrika Minami Warmling are very different from Noel Grunwaldt\u2019s beautiful watercolors of dead birds. Katrin Sigurdardottir hides landscapes in boxes; Francesca Gabbiani conjures them up in collages; Joy Garnett continues her project of painting the contemporary political landscape, in this case in images derived from news reports of burning Paris immigrant neighborhoods. Stellan Holm Gallery, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, stellanholm.com, through Sept. 8. (Cotter)\n \u2605 \u2018NEOINTEGRITY\u2019 Everybody knows that artists make the best exhibition curators. They have great eyes, highly personal interests, enthusiasms, opinions and social circles packed with a surprising variety of other artists, including many not on the establishment radar. There are lots of surprises in this summer extravaganza organized by the painter Keith Mayerson, beginning with its size: 190 artists displayed in a space approximately the size of a small one-bedroom apartment. Some of the names are well known (Ross Bleckner, Jane Freilicher, Dana Schutz), others may be new (Chris Bogia, Matt Boruso, Andrew Madrid); all are integral to Mr. Mayerson\u2019s vision of a Muchness Sublime. Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com, through Aug. 24. (Cotter)\n \u2018SUBSTANCE & SURFACE\u2019 This impressively consistent but slyly varied group exhibition takes the modernist monochrome as its not-so-subtle subtext. Nearly everything on view has corners, a single dominating color and adheres to the wall one way or another. The theme is ostensible purity achieved by impure means, including sliced towel, unfurled cassette tape, homemade sandpaper, carpet, painted pebbles and pegboard. This 20th-century staple just keeps keeping on. Bortolami, 510 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com, through Aug. 31. (Smith)\nPETER YOUNG: FOLDED MANDALA & OAXACAN PAINTINGS Complementing the larger survey of the artist\u2019s work at P.S. 1 (see above), this exhibition presents 10 brightly colored works from two additional series dating from 1972 to 1980: one of densely dotted mandalas, the other of spatially intricate grids. In both cases Mr. Young\u2019s debt to non-Western art is evident, and honored. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6242, through Aug. 25. (Smith)\nGalleries: Other\n MARTIN CREED: \u2018FEELINGS\u2019 Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of beanbag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an antigravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, through Sept. 16. (Smith)\nSOL LEWITT: \u2018DRAWING SERIES ...\u2019 If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early \u201970s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)\nPublic Art\nMAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, \u201cConjoined\u201d and \u201cDefunct,\u201d and a glacierlike boulder, \u201cErratic,\u201d by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is \u201cConjoined,\u201d a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other\u2019s end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, www.madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Genocchio) \nLast Chance\n \u2018AGITATION AND REPOSE\u2019 This group show opens with a very anxious object: a wall clock with spinning hands. It continues with Rainer Ganahl\u2019s bicycle ride into oncoming traffic, Holly Zausner\u2019s excellent, body-laden film tour of Berlin and Diana Al-Hadid\u2019s impressive sculptural combination of organ pipes and Gothic tracery, and concludes with Claire Watkins\u2019s image of what appears to be a detached nervous system. The real draw, though, is a group of six short videos by, and starring, Roman Signer: in one a helicopter buzzes him in bed; in another hay explodes through the floor as he sits reading; in a third a sudden explosion prompts him to start \u2014 and finish \u2014 a painting. Repose has never been this wonderful artist\u2019s thing. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com; closes Friday. (Cotter) \n \u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019  Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street,(212) 769-5100, amnh.org, closes Sunday. (Smith)\n \u2018BANKS VIOLETTE\u2019 This is a big show for Banks Violette. It\u2019s his first New York gallery exhibition in five years. Split between two locales, it includes relics from Mr. Violette\u2019s favored source, heavy metal music: an exploded drum kit; graphite drawings of a skull ring and an inverted American flag; free-standing walls connected to nitrogen tanks; amplifier parts and soundproofing panels cast in salt; and speakers that emit a low, droning rumble. At Gladstone, a large, collapsed-stage sculpture evokes Dan Flavin and Sol LeWitt. Mr. Violette\u2019s attempts at fusing the heroic, theatrical aspects of 1960s and \u201970s art with the masculinist bombast of heavy metal haven\u2019t fully panned out yet, but he remains an interesting artist to watch. Team, 83 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 279-9219, teamgal.com, closes Friday. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300, gladestonegallery.com, closes Friday. (Schwendener)\n \u2605 \u2018CECI N\u2019EST PAS ... THIS IS NOT\u2019 Is the art world your whole world? This group show assumes that it is and holds a mirror up to it. Everywhere you turn, someone is either selling something, or talking about how to sell, or worrying about not selling. Alejandro Diaz sets up a mini-shop to hawk handwritten posters, individually priced at $18.95, plus tax, with a complete set of 30 going for $500. Pablo Helguera, David Kramer, Laura Parnes and Michael Smith dispense cautionary career tips. Neil Goldberg reviews masterpieces that might have been. Cary Leibowitz brazenly drops celebrity names on cheapo coffee mugs. Sara Meltzer Gallery, 525-531 West 26th Street, (212) 727-9330, closes Friday. (Cotter)\n  \u2605 \u2018COLOUR BEFORE COLOR\u2019 The spelling discrepancy in the show\u2019s title is meant to indicate that color photography as we now know it was not the exclusive achievement of Americans like William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, but was also nurtured by a group of European photographers whose efforts range from the subtle still lifes of Luigi Ghirri (which are similar to those of Irving Penn) to claustrophobic close-ups of sunbathers by the Spanish photographer Carlos P\u00e9rez Siquier. The show, organized by the British photographer Martin Parr, is a must-see for anyone interested in the medium. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, hastedhunt.com, closes Friday. (Smith)\n \u2605 \u2018FULL COLOR\u2019 Color Field abstraction is back in sight, and this show offers some classic examples: a 1960 Morris Louis pour painting that looks fresh-minted; a pristine 1970, nontarget Kenneth Noland; an explosive 1980 Friedel Dzubas. Two kooky Anthony Caros keep them company. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com, closes Friday. (Cotter)\n \u2018LAYING BRICKS\u2019 Michael Ned Holte, a young Los Angeles art critic, brings together four young American and European artists who all work additively, whether their efforts tend toward painting or sculpture or are photo-based. \u201cJust one thing after another,\u201d Donald Judd\u2019s explanation of the compositional tactic in his repeating boxes, takes on new meaning here. Wallspace, 619 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 594-9478, wallspacegallery.com, closes Friday. (Smith)\n MARL\u00e8NE MOCQUET: RECENT PAINTINGS This young French painter presents small, vaporous, psychologically charged canvases \u2014 occupied by hapless, mostly hybrid beings \u2014 that might be called illustrational, not the least for the way their titles narrate very specific events. But the paint handling is deft and dazzlingly varied and the color sense exciting. Like Indian miniatures, these Symbolist-Surrealism cartoons reward close viewing. Freight & Volume, 542 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-8700, volumegallery.com, closes Friday. (Smith)\nMETROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,\u2019 The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother, Stephen, was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.). The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling \u201cdrew the line\u201d at C\u00e9zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso \u201cbad painters and fakers.\u201d Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting \u2014 and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org, closes Sunday. (Schwendener)\nTHE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: \u2018PARADISE IN PRINT,\u2019 Watercolors, folio editions, rare books and prints from the 18th through the mid-20th centuries reveal how closely linked natural and human histories have been in the Caribbean over the last 500 years. Engravings and lithographs of cash crops like coffee, chocolate, tobacco and sugar (nicknamed \u201cgreen gold\u201d) are accompanied by images from Mark Catesby\u2019s 18th-century natural history, which served as the model for Audubon\u2019s \u201cBirds of America\u201d; images of African slaves and colonialists; selections from the 19th-century French lithographer Etienne Denisse\u2019s book \u201cFlora of America\u201d; and Nikolai Josephi Jacquin\u2019s extraordinary \u201cSelectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia,\u201d published around 1780 in Vienna and illustrated with watercolors painted directly into the book. (It was purchased for the Botanical Garden by Andrew Carnegie.) Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, (718) 817-8616, nybg.org, closes Sunday. (Schwendener)",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \nMuseums\n\n\u2605 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018THE SHAPES OF SPACE,\u2019 through Sept. 5. The Guggenheim takes time off from thematic blockbusters to bring the public up to date on recent acquisitions, provocatively installed by three younger curators among an astute selection of older works from the collection. The theme is space, one of modern art\u2019s central concerns. The results are mixed, but cause for optimism. It is not every day you can look at a Mondrian while listening to disco and rap emanating from another kind of grid: the flashing patterns of a digitized dance floor by Piotr Uklanski. The atmosphere can get a bit mall-like at times, but this is what every New York museum needs to do more: play with the collection and find new ways to bring it to life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. \n(Roberta Smith)\n \u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,\u2019 through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did comprises most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work\u2019s laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. \n(Michael Kimmelman)\n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN-AMERICAN PORTRAITS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African-American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, a little too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) \n * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) \u2605 THE MET: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge of the department, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter)\n\nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)\n\n\u2605 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018ORGANIZING CHAOS,\u2019 through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn\u2019t rule out many interesting connections. The subject of \u201corganizing chaos\u201d is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimar\u00e3es, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitiello. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)\n\nTHE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018MIDNIGHT\u2019S DAYDREAM,\u2019 through Oct. 28. The three artists in this show were artists in residence at the Studio Museum of Harlem in the last year, but their work represents very different approaches. Titus Kaphar is the classicist, taking European and American portrait paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries and reconfiguring them into strategic compositions. Wardell Milan II is the archetypal collagist, photographing arrangements of art reproductions, family photos and images cut from magazines. Demetrius Oliver is the Conceptualist, working in the trickster vein of David Hammons and Duchamp. All three, however, actively confront race and (art) history, which often seems a mandate for young black artists. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nGalleries: Uptown\n \u2018EMANCIPATORY ACTION: PAULA TROPE AND THE MENINOS\u2019 Paula Trope\u2019s work with the meninos, children who live in the favelas, or shantytowns, in Rio de Janeiro, is similar to Zana Briski\u2019s \u201cKids With Cameras\u201d project, chronicled in the film \u201cBorn Into Brothels.\u201d Like Ms. Briski, Ms. Trope distributes cameras among the children, but the cameras are rudimentary pinhole devices; and the grainy, blurry photographs are less photojournalism than elements in a larger conceptual project. Influenced by Brazilian art from the 1960s and 1970s figures central to Neo-Concretism, Tropicalia and Cinema Novo Ms. Trope cites \u201cotherness\u201d and issues of authorship as central to her project. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, (212) 249-8950, through Sept 1. (Schwendener)\n \u2018OLD SCHOOL\u2019 The contemporary painters in \u201cOld School\u201d are interested in what might be called the proto-Surrealist sensibility of art made centuries before Freud. Anj Smith, Jakub Julian Ziolkowski and Hilary Harkness work well alongside Brueghel. A painting attributed to the School of Caravaggio serves as a reasonable springboard for grotesque still-life reinterpretations by Glenn Brown and John Currin, and portraits by Elizabeth Peyton and Jan van Noordt, among others. \u201cOld School\u201d skips the heavy art history explaining how paintings functioned as religious tracts, sermons on morality and proof of social status. But if you want art history, the Frick is only a block away. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through Aug. 31. (Schwendener)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n\n \u2605 \u2018NEOINTEGRITY\u2019 Everybody knows that artists make the best exhibition curators. They have great eyes, highly personal interests, enthusiasms, opinions and social circles packed with a surprising variety of other artists, including many not on the establishment radar. There are lots of surprises in this summer extravaganza organized by the painter Keith Mayerson, beginning with its size: 190 artists displayed in a space approximately the size of a small one-bedroom apartment. Some of the names are well known (Ross Bleckner, Jane Freilicher, Dana Schutz), others may be new (Chris Bogia, Matt Boruso, Andrew Madrid); all are integral to Mr. Mayerson\u2019s vision of a Muchness Sublime. Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com, through Aug. 24. (Cotter)\n \u2018SUBSTANCE & SURFACE\u2019 This impressively consistent but slyly varied group exhibition takes the modernist monochrome as its not-so-subtle subtext. Nearly everything on view has corners, a single dominating color and adheres to the wall one way or another. The theme is ostensible purity achieved by impure means, including sliced towel, unfurled cassette tape, homemade sandpaper, carpet, painted pebbles and pegboard. This 20th-century staple just keeps keeping on. Bortolami, 510 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com, through Aug. 31. (Smith)\nLast Chance\n \u2018AGITATION AND REPOSE\u2019 This group show opens with a very anxious object: a wall clock with spinning hands. It continues with Rainer Ganahl\u2019s bicycle ride into oncoming traffic, Holly Zausner\u2019s excellent, body-laden film tour of Berlin and Diana Al-Hadid\u2019s impressive sculptural combination of organ pipes and Gothic tracery, and concludes with Claire Watkins\u2019s image of what appears to be a detached nervous system. The real draw, though, is a group of six short videos by, and starring, Roman Signer: in one a helicopter buzzes him in bed; in another hay explodes through the floor as he sits reading; in a third a sudden explosion prompts him to start \u2014 and finish \u2014 a painting. Repose has never been this wonderful artist\u2019s thing. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com; closes today. (Cotter) \n \u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019  Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street,(212) 769-5100, amnh.org, closes Sunday. (Smith)\n \u2018BANKS VIOLETTE\u2019 This is a big show for Banks Violette. It\u2019s his first New York gallery exhibition in five years. Split between two locales, it includes relics from Mr. Violette\u2019s favored source, heavy metal music: an exploded drum kit; graphite drawings of a skull ring and an inverted American flag; free-standing walls connected to nitrogen tanks; amplifier parts and soundproofing panels cast in salt; and speakers that emit a low, droning rumble. At Gladstone, a large, collapsed-stage sculpture evokes Dan Flavin and Sol LeWitt. Mr. Violette\u2019s attempts at fusing the heroic, theatrical aspects of 1960s and \u201970s art with the masculinist bombast of heavy metal haven\u2019t fully panned out yet, but he remains an interesting artist to watch.

    "text": "The developing world's absent providers\n2007-04-20T05:00:00.000Z\nOn June 25, 1980, a good-natured Filipino pool-maintenance man gathered his wife and five children for an upsetting ride to the Manila airport. At 36, Emmet Comodas had held a job at a government sports complex for nearly two decades. On the spectrum of Filipino poverty, that marked him as a man of modest fortune. But a monthly salary of $50 did not keep his family fed.\nHome was a one-room, scrap-wood shanty. He had borrowed money at usurious rates to start a tiny store, which a thief had plundered. His greatest fears centered on his 11-year-old daughter, Rowena, who had a congenital heart defect and who needed care he could not afford.\nEmmet's boss had offered him a pool-cleaning job in Saudi Arabia.\nEmmet would make 10 times as much as he made in Manila. He would also live 7,200 kilometers, or 4,500 miles, from his family in an Islamic autocracy where stories of abused laborers were rife. He accepted on the spot.\nTwo years later, Emmet walked off the returning flight with chocolate for the kids and earrings for his wife, Tita. His 2-year-old son, Boyet, considered him a stranger and cried at his touch. Emmet replaced the shanty's rotted walls and put on a new roof.\nThen after three months at home, he left for Saudi Arabia again.\nAnd again and again. And the Comodas children have copied Emmet's example. All five of them, including Rowena, grew up to become overseas workers. What started as Emmet's act of desperation has become his children's way of life: leaving in order to live.\nAbout 200 million migrants from different countries are scattered across the globe. They sent home an estimated $300 billion last year - nearly three times the world's foreign-aid budgets combined. These sums - \"remittances\" - bring Morocco more money than tourism does. They bring Sri Lanka more money than tea does.\nGrowth in migration has roiled the West, but demographic logic suggests it will only continue. Aging industrial economies need workers. People in poor countries need jobs. Transportation and communication have made moving easier. And the potential economic gains are at record highs.\nIn the Philippines, local idiom stresses the uncertainty of the migrant's lot. An Overseas Filipino Worker - OFW - does not say he is off to make his fortune. He says, \"I am going to try my luck.\"\nNearly 10 percent of the country's 89 million people live abroad.\nAbout 3.6 million are contract workers. Another 3.2 million have migrated permanently - largely to the United States - and 1.3 million more are thought to be overseas illegally. There are a million OFWs in Saudi Arabia alone, followed by Japan, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. They send home $15 billion a year, a seventh of the country's gross domestic product.\nThere is no anti-migration camp in Filipino politics. The political issue is migrant safety. Woe to the Filipino pol who appears not to have migrant welfare in mind. After a Filipino truck driver was kidnapped in Iraq in 2004, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo not only banned all contract work there but also withdrew from the American-led military coalition.\nEven state visits have the tenor of bail runs. The president triumphed in Saudi Arabia last spring when King Adbullah freed more than 400 workers who had been jailed for petty crimes.\nI first met Tita and the kids in 1987, as Emmet was finishing his third contract. I had a fellowship from the Henry Luce Foundation to study urban poverty; a Leveriza nun, Sister Christine Tan, introduced us, and Tita agreed to let me move in.\nEmmet returned a few months into my off-and-on stay. He had missed half the life of his 11-year-old, Roldan, and nearly all of 7-year-old Boyet's. He wanted to stay.\nWith jobs scarce, frustration rose all around. Tita got angry when she heard Emmet urge their oldest child, Rolando, to join the U.S. Navy, and furious when she caught him encouraging Rosalie to go abroad; Tita wanted her to be a nun. Emmet was back in Riyadh within a year.\nOne day he opened the door to find Rolando, who had quit tech school to try his luck as a driver for a Saudi family. Rolando's luck had proven mediocre. He quit after his second contract.\nBy then, Rosalie had finished nursing school in Manila. Four years after graduation, she still earned $100 a month. Saudi hospitals paid nearly four times as much. After borrowing the recruiters' fee from an aunt, Rosalie was Jiddaa-bound.\nA baton was being passed. At 55, Emmet had given nearly 20 years to a succession of Arabian pools. Rosalie, renewing her contract, insisted he go home. The responsibility of supporting the family was hers.\nAs an Islamic state that bans socializing between unmarried women and men, Saudi Arabia held out few hopes for marriage or kids. Rosalie approached her 30th birthday resigned to a dutiful life alone. She celebrated at a Jidda restaurant with Filipino friends; one of them, knowing they had a private room, disregarded the gender rules by bringing along her nephew, a construction engineer. The nephew, Christopher Villanueva, took Rosalie for an after-dinner walk, trailing a few paces behind her in case the religious police happened by.\nWith both of them living in guarded single-sex dorms, their 18-month courtship occurred largely by cellphone. When they flew home in 2002 to marry, they had never been alone together.\nIn the Philippines the following year to deliver her first baby, Rosalie saw an ad seeking nurses in Abu Dhabi that offered twice the salary she had made in Jidda. And Abu Dhabi had no religious police. She caught another plane to the Middle East, this time as a mother. The baby, Christine, soon called her Aunt Rowena \"Mama.\" When a second daughter followed, she considered Rowena her mama, too.\nOverseas prosperity is a gift and an obligation. Rosalie paid to complete her parents' new house and sends them $400 a month. Capitalizing on permissive visa laws, Rosalie has now brought a cousin and three siblings to Abu Dhabi.\nOnce upon a time - say, five years ago - remittances were considered small potatoes. That began to change early this decade, when research by the Inter-American Development Bank showed that the amounts in Latin America were three or four times higher than supposed. Interest surged in 2003 when Dilip Ratha of the World Bank showed the eye-popping sums extended across the globe. Migration has been a prominent development topic ever since.\nWhile the doubling of formal remittances in the past five years partly reflects improved counting, Dilip Ratha argues that most of the gain is real. There are more migrants; their earnings are growing; and plunging transaction fees encourage them to send more money home.\nThe Philippines, which received $15 billion in formal remittances in 2006, ranked fourth among developing countries, behind India ($25 billion), China ($24 billion) and Mexico ($24 billion) - all of which are much larger. Remittances make up 3 percent of the gross domestic product in Mexico but 14 percent in the Philippines. In 22 countries, remittances exceed a tenth of the GDP, including Moldova (32 percent), Haiti (23 percent) and Lebanon (22 percent).\nDespite fears that the money goes to waste, a growing literature shows positive effects. Remittances cut the poverty rate by 11 percent in Uganda and 6 percent in Bangladesh, according to studies cited by the World Bank, and raised education levels in El Salvador and the Philippines. Being private, the money is less susceptible to corruption than foreign aid; it is also more precisely aimed at the needy.\nThe downside is the risk of dependency, whether among individuals waiting for a check or rulers who use the money to avoid economic reforms.\n\"Remittances can't solve structural problems,\" said Kathleen Newland of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington research group. \"Remittances can't compensate for corrupt governments, nepotism, incompetence or communal conflict.\"\nCasting migration as the answer to global poverty alarms some people. It risks obscuring the personal price that migrants and their families pay. It could be used to gloss over, or even justify, the exploitation of workers. And it could offer rich countries an excuse for cutting foreign aid and other development efforts.\nCertainly, soaring remittance tallies cannot measure social costs, to migrants or to those left behind. Among the biggest worries, in the Philippines and beyond, are the \"left behind\" kids, who are alternately portrayed as dangerous hoodlums and consumerist brats.\nResearchers also speak of the \"left out.\" Lacking the money or connections to go abroad, they are marooned on the wrong shore of what is, among the poor themselves, a growing divide.\nThe modest social science that exists on the issue offers some reassurance. At least three studies have examined \"left behind\" families in the Philippines. All found the children of migrants doing as well as, or better than, children whose parents stayed home.\nThe most recent, from the Scalabrini Migration Center in Manila, involved a national survey of 10-to-12-year-olds. The migrants' kids did better in school, had better physical health, experienced less anxiety and were more likely to attend church.\nOne theory is that remittances compensate for the missing parent's care. The study found migrants' kids to be taller and heavier than their counterparts, suggesting higher caloric intake, and much more likely to attend private school. The extended family can also act as a compensating force. And so can modern technology, in an age of cellphones and Webcams.\nAbout 50 kilometers south of Manila, a dirt road ends at a residential compound carved from a small coffee farm. For decades it held nothing but the thatched hut where Tita and her 10 siblings were raised. Now a dozen cement blockhouses are clustered in a U.\nOne look at each home yields a fair guess of how long the owner worked abroad. Nine families in the compound sent workers overseas, and collectively those workers stayed for 131 years (and counting). A walk across the compound cuts through a century of rewards and regrets.\nTita's brother Fortz is one of two men in the family (by some counts, three) whose extramarital affairs overseas produced kids. Tita's sister Peachy learned that her husband had a girlfriend - and a son - when she received a package meant for them. The nine families of overseas workers raised 35 kids, some of whom scarcely saw their fathers.\nBy any measure, the price was high. Yet bookshelves sag with encyclopedia sets. More diplomas appear each year on freshly plastered walls. There are bunk beds, cellphones, stereos and big televisions.\n\"A good provider is someone who leaves,\" Peachy said, without ambivalence.\nTita and Emmet's cottage has a patio, a beamed ceiling, a tiled floor, two kitchens and two toilets that flush. It was built by Rosalie, thousands of kilometers away in Abu Dhabi. She hovers over the compound; no household there is heedless of her example or generosity.\nGoing abroad is difficult, but so is coming home. Since Emmet returned for good, the kids have noticed less tenderness between their parents and more quarreling. Each had grown accustomed to being the boss. One reason Rosalie left her second daughter, Precious Lara, in the Philippines is that she thinks her parents need a child to love.\nIn a guest bedroom there is a large framed photograph of Rosalie, taken on her wedding day. The woman in that picture shows no trace of a birthright of poverty. She turns to the camera wearing an enormous gown and a confident face. Two generations of labor migration have given her more education, more money, and more power and prestige than her mother could have dreamed of on her own wedding day.\nPrecious Lara rarely plays in that room and hardly knows the face, much less the sacrifices her mother has made for the blessings of a migrant's wage.\nJason DeParle, a senior writer for The New York Times, last wrote for the magazine about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.",

    "text": "Between Black and Immigrant Muslims, an Uneasy Alliance\n2007-03-11T05:00:00.000Z\nUnder the glistening dome of a mosque on Long Island, hundreds of men sat cross-legged on the floor. Many were doctors and engineers born in Pakistan and India. Dressed in khakis, polo shirts and the odd silk tunic, they fidgeted and whispered. \nOne thing stood between them and dinner: A visitor from Harlem was coming to ask for money.\nA towering black man with a gray-flecked beard finally swept into the room, his bodyguard trailing him. Wearing a long, embroidered robe and matching hat, he took the microphone and began talking about a different group of Muslims, the thousands of African-Americans who have found Islam in prison. \n\u201cWe are all brothers and sisters,\u201d said the visitor, known as Imam Talib.\nThe men stared. To some of them, it seemed, he was from another planet. As the imam returned their gaze, he had a similar sensation. \u201cThey live in another world,\u201d he later said.\nOnly 28 miles separate Imam Talib\u2019s mosque in Harlem from the Islamic Center of Long Island. The congregations they each serve \u2014 African-Americans at the city mosque and immigrants of South Asian and Arab descent in the suburbs \u2014 represent the largest Muslim populations in the United States. Yet a vast gulf divides them, one marked by race and class, culture and history.\nFor many African-American converts, Islam is an experience both spiritual and political, an expression of empowerment in a country they feel is dominated by a white elite. For many immigrant Muslims, Islam is an inherited identity, and America a place of assimilation and prosperity.\nFor decades, these two Muslim worlds remained largely separate. But last fall, Imam Talib hoped to cross that distance in a venture that has become increasingly common since Sept. 11. Black Muslims have begun advising immigrants on how to mount a civil rights campaign. Foreign-born Muslims are giving African-Americans roles of leadership in some of their largest organizations. The two groups have joined forces politically, forming coalitions and backing the same candidates.\nIt is a tentative and uneasy union, seen more typically among leaders at the pulpit than along the prayer line. But it is critical, a growing number of Muslims believe, to surviving a hostile new era. \n\u201cMuslims will not be successful in America until there is a marriage between the indigenous and immigrant communities,\u201d said Siraj Wahhaj, an African-American imam in New York with a rare national following among immigrant Muslims. \u201cThere has to be a marriage.\u201d\nThe divide between black and immigrant Muslims reflects a unique struggle facing Islam in America. Perhaps nowhere else in the world are Muslims from so many racial, cultural and theological backgrounds trying their hands at coexistence. Only in Mecca, during the obligatory hajj, or pilgrimage, does such diversity in the faith come to life, between black and white, rich and poor, Sunni and Shiite.\n\u201cThis is a new experiment in the history of Islam,\u201d said Ali S. Asani, a professor of Islamic studies at Harvard University.\nThat evening in October, Imam Al-Hajj Talib \u2018Abdur-Rashid drove to Westbury, on Long Island, with a task he would have found unthinkable years ago. \nHe would ask for donations from the immigrant community he refers to, somewhat bitterly, as the \u201cMuslim elite.\u201d\nBut he needed funds, and the doors of immigrant mosques seemed to be opening. Imam Talib and other African-American leaders had formed a national \u201cindigenous Muslim\u201d organization, and he knew that during the holy month of Ramadan, the Islamic Center of Long Island could raise thousands of dollars in an evening. \nIt is a place where BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes fill the parking lot, and Coach purses are perched along prayer lines.\nIn Harlem, many of Imam Talib\u2019s congregants get to the mosque by bus or subway, and warm themselves with space heaters in a drafty, brick building.\nBefore the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Imam Talib had only a distant connection to the Islamic Center of Long Island. In passing, he had met Faroque Khan, an Indian-born doctor who helped found the mosque, but the two had little in common.\nImam Talib, 56, is a thundering prison chaplain whose mosque traces its roots to Malcolm X. He is a first-generation Muslim.\nDr. Khan, 64, is a mild-mannered pulmonologist who collects Chinese antiques and learned to ski on the slopes of Vermont. He is a first-generation American.\nBut in the turmoil that followed Sept. 11, the imam and the doctor found themselves unexpectedly allied. \n\u201cThe more separate we stay, the more targeted we become,\u201d Dr. Khan said.\nEach man recognizes what the other has to offer. African-Americans possess a cultural and historical fluency that immigrants lack, said Dr. Khan; they hold an unassailable place in America from which to defend their faith. \nFor Imam Talib, immigrants provide a crucial link to the Muslim world and its tradition of scholarship, as well as the wisdom that comes with an \u201cunshattered Islamic heritage.\u201d\n Both groups have their practical virtues, too. African-Americans know better how to mobilize in America, both men say, and immigrants tend to have deeper pockets.\nStill, it is one thing to talk about unity, Imam Talib said, and another to give it life. Before his visit to Long Island last fall, he had never asked Dr. Khan and his mosque to match their rhetoric with money.\n\u201cYou have to have a litmus test,\u201d he said.\nOne Faith, Many Histories\nImam Talib and Dr. Khan did not warm to each other when they met in May 2000, at a gathering in Chicago of Muslim leaders. \nThe imam found the silver-haired doctor faintly smug and paternalistic. It was an attitude he had often whiffed from well-to-do immigrant Muslims. Dr. Khan found Imam Talib straightforward to the point of bluntness.\nThe uneasy introduction was, for both men, emblematic of the strained relationship between their communities.\nImam Talib and other black Muslims trace their American roots to the arrival of Muslims from West Africa as slaves in the South. That historical link gave rise to Islam-inspired movements in the 20th century, the most significant of which was the Nation of Islam.\nThe man who founded the Nation in 1930, W. D. Fard, spread the message that American blacks belonged to a lost Muslim tribe and were superior to the \u201cwhite, blue-eyed devils\u201d in their midst. Under Mr. Fard\u2019s successor, Elijah Muhammad, the Nation flourished in the 1960s amid the civil rights struggle and the emergence of a black-separatist movement. \nOverseas, Islamic scholars found the group\u2019s teachings on race antithetical to the faith. The schism narrowed after 1975, when Mr. Muhammad\u2019s son Warith Deen Mohammed took over the Nation, bringing it in line with orthodox Sunni Islam. Louis Farrakhan parted ways with Mr. Mohammed \u2014 taking the Nation\u2019s name and traditional teachings with him \u2014 but the majority of African-American adherents came to embrace the same Sunni practice that dominates the Muslim world.\nStill, divisions between African-American and immigrant Muslims remained pronounced long after the first large waves of South Asians and Arabs arrived in the United States in the 1960s.\nToday, of the estimated six million Muslims who live in the United States, about 25 percent are African-American, 34 percent are South Asian and 26 percent are Arab, said John Zogby, a pollster who has studied the American Muslim population.\n \u201cGiven the extreme from which we came, I would say that the immigrant Muslims have been brotherly toward us,\u201d Warith Deen Mohammed, who has the largest following of African-American Muslims, said in an interview. \u201cBut I think they\u2019re more skeptical than they admit they are. I think they feel more comfortable with their own than they feel with us.\u201d\nFor many African-Americans, conversion to Islam has meant parting with mainstream culture, while Muslim immigrants have tended toward assimilation. Black converts often take Arabic names, only to find foreign-born Muslims introducing themselves as \u201cMoe\u201d instead of \u201cMohammed.\u201d\nThe tensions are also economic. Like Dr. Khan, many Muslim immigrants came to the United States with advanced degrees and quickly prospered, settling in the suburbs. For decades, African-Americans watched with frustration as immigrants sent donations to causes overseas, largely ignoring the problems of poor Muslims in the United States. \nImam Talib found it impossible to generate interest at immigrant mosques in the 1999 police shooting of Amadou Diallo, who was Muslim. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when domestic issues jump up, like police brutality, all the sudden we\u2019re by ourselves,\u201d he said.\nSome foreign-born Muslims say they are put off by the racial politics of many black converts. They struggle to understand why African-American Muslims have been reluctant to meet with law enforcement officials in the wake of Sept. 11. For their part, black Muslim leaders complain that immigrants have failed to learn their history, which includes a pattern of F.B.I. surveillance dating back to the roots of the Nation of Islam.\nThe ironies are, at times, stinging.\n\u201cFrom the immigrant community, I hear that African-Americans have to learn how to work in the system,\u201d said Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations, adding that this was not his personal opinion.\nAt the heart of the conflict is a question of leadership. Much to the ire of African-Americans, many immigrants see themselves as the rightful leaders of the faith in America by virtue of their Islamic schooling and fluency in Arabic, the original language of the Koran.\n\u201cWhat does knowing Arabic have to do with the quality of your prayer, your fast, your relationship with God?\u201d asked Ihsan Bagby, an associate professor of Islamic studies at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. \u201cBut African-Americans have to ask themselves why have they not learned more in these years.\u201d\nEvery year in Chicago, the two largest Muslim conventions in the country \u2014 one sponsored by an immigrant organization and the other by Mr. Mohammed\u2019s \u2014 take place on the same weekend, in separate parts of the city.\nThe long-simmering tension boiled over into a public rift with the 2000 presidential elections. That year, a powerful coalition of immigrant Muslims endorsed George W. Bush (because of a promise to stop the profiling of Arabs). \nThe nation\u2019s most prominent African-American Muslims complained that they were never consulted. The following summer, when Imam Talib vented his frustration at a meeting with immigrant leaders in Washington, a South Asian man turned to him, he recalled, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why all of you African-American Muslims are always so angry about everything.\u201d\nImam Talib searched for an answer he thought the man could understand.\n\u201cAfrican-Americans are like the Palestinians of this land,\u201d he finally said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just some angry black people. We\u2019re legitimately outraged and angry.\u201d\nThe room fell silent.\nSoon after, black leaders announced the creation of the Muslim Alliance in North America, their first national \u201cindigenous\u201d organization.\nBut the fallout over the elections was soon eclipsed by Sept. 11, when Muslim immigrants found themselves under intense public scrutiny. They began complaining about \u201cprofiling\u201d and \u201cflying while brown,\u201d appropriating language that had been largely the domain of African-Americans.\nIt was around this time that Dr. Khan became, as he put it, enlightened. A few weeks before the terrorist attacks, he read the book \u201cBlack Rage,\u201d by William H. Grier and Price M. Cobbs. The book, published in 1968, explores the psychological woes of African-Americans, and how the impact of racism is carried through generations.\n\u201cIt helped me understand that even before you\u2019re born, things that happened a hundred years ago can affect you,\u201d Dr. Khan said. \u201cThat was a big change in my thinking.\u201d \nHe sent an e-mail message to fellow Muslims, including Imam Talib, sharing what he had learned. \nThe Harlem imam was pleased, if not yet convinced.\n\u201cI just encouraged the brother to keep going,\u201d Imam Talib said.\nAn Oasis in Harlem\nOne windswept night in Harlem, cars rolled past the corner of West 113th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue. A police siren blared as men huddled by a neon-lit Laundromat.\nAcross the street stood a brown brick building, lifeless from the outside. But upstairs, in a cozy carpeted room, rows of men and women chanted. \n\u201cYa Hakim. Ya Allah.\u201d O wise one. O God.\nImam Talib led the chant, swathed in a black satin robe. It was Ramadan\u2019s holiest evening, the Night of Power. As the voices died down, he spotted his bodyguard swaying.\n\u201cTake it easy there, Captain,\u201d Imam Talib said. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t jump and shout it\u2019s all right.\u201d\nLaughter trickled through the mosque, where a translucent curtain separated men in skullcaps from women in African-print gowns. \n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to be ourselves, you know?\u201d Imam Talib said. \u201cWithin the tradition.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said one woman. \nThe imam continued: \u201cAnd we can\u2019t let other people, from other cultures, come and try to make us clones of them. We came  here as Muslims.\u201d \nHe was feeling drained. He had just returned from the Manhattan Detention Complex, where he works as a chaplain. Some of the mosque\u2019s men were back in jail. \n\u201cWe need power,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWithout that, we\u2019ll destroy ourselves.\u201d\n Since its birth in 1964, the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood has been a fortress of stubborn faith, persevering through the crack wars, welfare, AIDS, gangs, unemployment, diabetes, broken families and gentrification. \nThe mosque was founded in a Brooklyn apartment by Shaykh-\u2018Allama Al-Hajj K. Ahmad Tawfiq, a follower of Malcolm X. The Sunni congregation boomed in the 1970s, starting a newspaper and opening a school and a health food store. \nWith city loans, it bought its current building. Fourteen families moved in, creating a bold Muslim oasis in a landscape of storefront churches and liquor stores. The mosque claimed its corner by drenching the sidewalk in dark green paint, the color associated with Islam.\nThe paint has since faded. The school is closed. Many of the mosque\u2019s members can no longer afford to live in a neighborhood where brownstones sell for millions of dollars. \nBut an aura of dignity prevails. The women normally pray one floor below the men, in a scrubbed, tidy room scented with incense. Their bathroom is a shrine of gold curtains and lavender soaps. A basket of nylon roses hides a hole in the wall.\nMost of the mosque\u2019s 160 members belong to the working class, and up to a third of the men are former convicts.\n Some congregants are entrepreneurs, professors, writers and musicians. Mos Def and Q-Tip have visited with Imam Talib, who carries the nickname \u201chip-hop imam.\u201d \nMosque celebrations are a blend of Islam and Harlem. In October, at the end of Ramadan, families feasted on curried chicken and collard greens, grilled fish and candied yams. \nJust before the afternoon prayer, a lean man in a black turtleneck rose to give the call. He was Yusef Salaam, whose conviction in the Central Park jogger case was later overturned. \nMany of the mosque\u2019s members embraced Islam in search of black empowerment, not black separatism. They describe racial equality as a central tenet of their faith. Yet for some, the promise of Islam has been at odds with the reality of Muslims.\nOne member, Aqilah Mu\u2019Min, lives in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, a heavily Bangladeshi neighborhood. Whenever she passes women in head scarves, she offers the requisite Muslim greeting. Rarely is it returned. \u201cWe have a theory that says Islam is perfect, human beings are not,\u201d said Ms. Mu\u2019Min, a city fraud investigator. \nIt was the simplicity of Islam that drew Imam Talib.\nRaised a Christian, he spent the first part of his youth in segregated North Carolina. As a teenager, he read \u201cThe Autobiography of Malcolm X\u201d twice. He began educating himself about the faith at age 19, when as an aspiring actor he was cast in a play about a man who had left the Nation of Islam. \nBut his conversion was more spiritual than political, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think that even if I was a white man, I\u2019d still be a Muslim because that\u2019s the orientation of my soul,\u201d the imam said.\nHe has learned some Arabic, and traveled once to the Middle East, for hajj. Yet he feels more comfortable with the Senegalese and Guinean Muslims who have settled in Harlem than with many Arabs and South Asians. \nHe is trying to reach out, but is often disappointed. \n In November, he accepted a last-minute invitation to meet with hundreds of immigrants at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York, an opulent mosque on East 96th Street. \nThe group, the Coalition for Muslim School Holidays, was trying to persuade the city to recognize two Muslim holidays on the school calendar. The effort, Imam Talib learned, had been nearly a year in the making, and no African-American leaders had been consulted.\nHe was stunned. After all, he had led a similar campaign in the 1980s, resulting in the suspension of alternate-side parking for the same holidays.\n\u201cThey are unaware of the foundations upon which they are standing,\u201d he said.\nBacklash in the Suburbs\nBrush Hollow Road winds through a quiet stretch of Long Island, past churches and diners and leafy cul-de-sacs. In this tranquil tableau, the Islamic Center of Long Island announces itself proudly, a Moorish structure of white concrete topped by a graceful dome. \nSleek sedans and S.U.V.\u2019s circle the property as girls with Barbie backpacks hop out and scurry to the Islamic classes they call \u201cSunday school.\u201d\nIt is a testament to America\u2019s influence on the mosque that its liveliest time of the week is not Friday, Islam\u2019s holy day, but Sunday. \nBoys in hooded sweatshirts smack basketballs along the pavement by a sign that reads \u201cNo pray, no play.\u201d Young mothers in Burberry coats exchange kisses and chatter. \nFor members of the mosque \u2014 many of whom work in Manhattan and cannot make the Friday prayer \u2014 Sunday is the day to reflect and connect.\nThe treasurer, Rizwan Qureshi, frantically greeted drivers one Sunday morning with a flier advertising a fund-raiser.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get Barack Obama,\u201d Mr. Qureshi, a banker born in Karachi, told a woman in a gold-hued BMW. \n\u201cWe need some real money,\u201d he called out to another driver.\nThe mosque began with a group of doctors, engineers and other professionals from Pakistan and India who settled in Nassau County in the early 1970s.\n\u201cOur kids would come home from school and say, \u2018Where is my Christmas tree, my Hanukkah lights?\u2019 \u201d recalled Dr. Khan, who lives in nearby Jericho. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want them to grow up unsure of who they are.\u201d\nSince opening in 1993, the mosque has thrived, with assets now valued at more than $3 million. Hundreds of people pray there weekly, and thousands come on Muslim holidays. \nThe mosque has an unusually modern, democratic air. Men and women worship with no partition between them. A different scholar delivers the Friday sermon every week, in English. \nPerhaps most striking, a majority of female worshipers do not cover their heads outside the mosque.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to find the fine line between the religion and the age in which we live,\u201d said Nasreen Wasti, 43, a contract analyst for Lufthansa. \u201cI\u2019m sure I will have to answer to God for not covering myself. But I\u2019m also satisfied by many of the good deeds I am doing.\u201d\nShe and other members use words like \u201cprogressive\u201d to describe their congregation. But after Sept. 11, a different image took hold.\nIn October 2001, a Newsday article quoted a member of the mosque as asking \u201cwho really benefits from such a horrible tragedy that is blamed on Muslims and Arabs?\u201d A co-president of the mosque was also quoted saying that Israel \u201cwould benefit from this tragedy.\u201d\nConspiracy theories about Sept. 11 have long circulated among Muslims, and Dr. Khan had heard discussion among congregants. Such talk, he said, was the product of two forces: a deep mistrust of America\u2019s motives in the Middle East and a refusal, among many Muslims, to engage in self-criticism.\n\u201cYou blame the other guy for your own shortcomings,\u201d said Dr. Khan.\nHe visited synagogues and churches after the article ran, reassuring audiences that the comments did not reflect the official position of the mosque, which condemned the attacks.\nBut to Congressman Peter T. King, whose district is near the mosque, that condemnation fell short. He began publicly criticizing Dr. Khan, asserting that he had failed to fully denounce the statements made by the men. \n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely a radical,\u201d Mr. King said of Dr. Khan in an interview. \u201cYou cannot, in the context of Sept. 11, allow those statements to be made and not be a radical.\u201d\nWhen asked about Mr. King\u2019s comments, Dr. Khan replied proudly, \u201cI thought we had freedom of speech.\u201d\nIt hardly seems possible that Mr. King and Dr. Khan were once friends. \nMr. King used to dine at Dr. Khan\u2019s home. He attended the wedding of Dr. Khan\u2019s son, Arif, in 1995. At the mosque\u2019s opening, it was Mr. King who cut the ribbon.\nAfter Sept. 11, the mosque experienced the sort of social backlash felt by Muslims around the country. Anonymous callers left threatening messages, and rocks were hurled at children from passing cars. \nThe attention waned over time. But Mr. King cast a new light on the mosque in 2004 with the release of his novel \u201cVale of Tears.\u201d\nIn the novel, terrorists affiliated with a Long Island mosque demolish several buildings, killing hundreds of people. One of the central characters is a Pakistani heart surgeon whose friendship with a congressman has grown tense. \n\u201cBy inference, it\u2019s me,\u201d Dr. Khan said of the Pakistani character. (Mr. King said it was a \u201ccomposite character\u201d based on several Muslims he knows.) \nFor Dr. Khan, his difficulties after Sept. 11 come as proof that Muslims cannot stay fragmented. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge for the whole Muslim community \u2014 not just for me,\u201d he said. \u201cUnited we stand, divided we fall.\u201d\nThe Litmus Test\nImam Talib and his bodyguard set off to Westbury before dusk on Oct. 14. They passed a fork on the Long Island Expressway, and the imam peered out the window. None of the signs were familiar.\nHe checked his watch and saw that he was late, adding to his unease. He had visited the mosque a few times before, but never felt entirely at home.\n\u201cI\u2019m conscious of being a guest,\u201d he said. \u201cThey treat me kindly and nicely. But I know where I am.\u201d\n At the Islamic Center of Long Island, Dr. Khan was also getting nervous. Hundreds of congregants had gathered after fasting all day for Ramadan. The scent of curry drifted mercilessly through the mosque.\nDr. Khan sprang to his feet and took the microphone. He improvised.\n\u201cAll of us need to learn from and understand the contributions of the Muslim indigenous community,\u201d he said. \u201cStarting with Malcolm X.\u201d\nIt had been six years since Imam Talib and Dr. Khan first encountered each other in Chicago. Back then, Imam Talib rarely visited immigrant mosques, and Dr. Khan had only a peripheral connection to African-American Muslims.\nIn the 1980s, the doctor had become aware of the high number of Muslim inmates while working as the chief of medicine for a hospital in Nassau County that oversaw health care at the county prison. His mosque began donating prayer rugs, Korans and skullcaps to prisoners around the country. But his interaction with black Muslim leaders was limited until Sept. 11.\nAfter Dr. Khan read the book \u201cBlack Rage,\u201d he and Imam Talib began serving together on the board of a new political task force. Finally, in 2005, Dr. Khan invited the imam to his mosque to give the Friday sermon.\nThat February, Imam Talib rose before the Long Island congregation. Blending verses in the Koran with passages from recent American history, he urged the audience to learn from the civil rights movement. \nDr. Khan listened raptly. Afterward, over sandwiches, he asked Imam Talib for advice. He wanted to thaw the relationship between his mosque and African-American mosques on Long Island. The conversation continued for hours.\n\u201cThe real searching for an answer, searching for a solution, was coming from Dr. Khan,\u201d said Imam Talib. \u201cI could just feel it.\u201d\nDr. Khan began inviting more African-American leaders to speak at his mosque, and welcomed Imam Talib there last October to give a fund-raising pitch for his organization, the Muslim Alliance in North America. The group had recently announced a \u201cdomestic agenda,\u201d with programs to help ex-convicts find housing and jobs and to standardize premarital counseling for Muslims in America.\nAfter the imam arrived that evening and spoke, he sat on the floor next to a blazer-clad Dr. Khan. As they feasted on kebabs, the doctor made a pitch of his own: The teenagers of his mosque could spend a day at Imam Talib\u2019s mosque, as the start of a youth exchange program. The imam nodded slowly. \nMinutes later, the mosque\u2019s president, Habeeb Ahmed, hurried over. The congregants had so far pledged $10,000.\n\u201cAlhamdulillah,\u201d the imam said. Praise be to God. \nIt was the most Imam Talib had raised for his group in one evening.\nAs the dinner drew to a close, the imam looked for his bodyguard. They had a long drive home and he did not want to lose his way again. \nDr. Khan asked Imam Talib how he had gotten lost.\n\u201cInner city versus the suburbs,\u201d the imam replied a bit testily. \nThen he smiled.\n\u201cThe only thing it proves,\u201d he said, \u201cis that I need to come by here more often.\u201d",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \n\u2018UTOPIA IN NEW YORK\u2019 Utopia, an Aboriginal-owned desert reservation the size of Rhode Island, was named in the 1920s by optimistic German immigrants in outback Australia hoping for a prosperous new life. A lively women\u2019s batik group was established there in the early 1980s among the Aboriginal population, but the settlement\u2019s fame peaked in the 1990s with the success of the protean painter Emily Kngwarreye. Known as the desert Monet, she took up painting at the age of 78 and produced an estimated 6,000 paintings in 10 years. In May, in Sydney, one of her paintings became the first work by an Aboriginal artist to exceed $1 million Australian at auction. Unfortunately, none of her paintings are showing in \u201cUtopia in New York,\u201d an otherwise tasty summer sampler of paintings at the Robert Steele Gallery by a dozen artists from the Utopia region, including well-known figures like Gloria Petyarre, Barbara Weir and Minnie Pwerle, whose 2001 acrylic on canvas, inspired by the territory, is at right. Most depict traditional motifs and designs for native flowers and vegetation, like the root pattern of a yam, a staple food. But others are more abstract and bear a visual resemblance to international art movements like optical art and 1970s painterly abstraction. But what jumps out most about these paintings is the color, radiant and intense. People think of the desert as all sandhills and rocks, but it rains out there, and when the desert comes into bloom, you see the most astonishing colors, just as in the paintings. (Through July 21, Robert Steele Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, 212-243-0165, robertsteelegallery.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n\u2605 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: \u2018THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)\n BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage, rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand\u2019s strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)\nCOOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) \nGUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,\u2019 through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat\u2019s invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, bighearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith) \n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,\u2019 through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work\u2019s laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)\nTHE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: \u2018NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though on the whole the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)\nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother, Stephen, was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.). The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling \u201cdrew the line\u201d at C\u00e9zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso \u201cbad painters and fakers.\u201d Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting \u2014 and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nTHE MET: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (See above.) (Glueck)\n THE MET: \u2018HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,\u2019 through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum\u2019s collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: \u201cThe question is not what you look at but what you see.\u201d Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans\u2019s late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore\u2019s landscapes and Rachel Harrison\u2019s photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show \u2014 only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms \u2014 it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Schwendener)\n* THE MET: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter)\n \u2605 THE MET: NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA, through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter\u2019s mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th-century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch\u2019s talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018POIRET: KING OF FASHION,\u2019 through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) \u201cDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition, the latest effort from the Met\u2019s esteemed Costume Institute, does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) \n* THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck) \nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,\u2019 through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures \u2014 and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella\u2019s importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)\nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,\u2019 through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His \u201cTorqued Ellipses\u201d and \u201cTorqued Toruses\u201d and other recent works like \u201cBand\u201d and \u201cSequence\u201d have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That\u2019s about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)\nMUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,\u2019 through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York\u2019s work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)\nNEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: \u2018PARADISE IN PRINT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Watercolors, folio editions, rare books and prints from the 18th through the mid-20th centuries reveal how closely linked natural and human histories have been in the Caribbean over the last 500 years. Engravings and lithographs of cash crops like coffee, chocolate, tobacco and sugar (nicknamed \u201cgreen gold\u201d) are accompanied by images from Mark Catesby\u2019s 18th-century natural history, which served as the model for Audubon\u2019s \u201cBirds of America\u201d; images of African slaves and colonialists; ; selections from 19th-century French lithographer Etienne Denisse\u2019s book \u201cFlora of America;\u201d and Nikolaus Joseph Jacquin\u2019s extraordinary \u201cSelectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia,\u201d published around 1780 in Vienna and illustrated with watercolors painted directly into the book. (It was purchased for the Botanical Garden by Andrew Carnegie.) Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, (718) 817-8616, nybg.org. (Schwendener)\nNEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro- slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Edward Rothstein)\n \u2605 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018ORGANIZING CHAOS, \u2019 through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn\u2019t rule out many interesting connections. The subject is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimar\u00e3es, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitieollo. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Smith)\nWADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, \u2018WHERE WERE WE,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,\u2019 through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein\u2019s brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein\u2019s taste clearly hasn\u2019t won the day, but it\u2019s never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman) \n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018RESISTANCE IS ... ,\u2019 through Sept. 2. This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it\u2019s smart, engaging, and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn\u2019t look or feel more apposite. (See above.) (Benjamin Genocchio)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018RUDOLF STINGEL,\u2019 through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions lately seen at the Whitney. (See above.) (Smith)\n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,\u2019 through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) \nGalleries: 57th Street\nAUTOMATIC Organized by the artist Chris Churchill, this lively exhibition crosses generations and styles to argue that the automatist drawings and rebellious attitudes of artists like Roberto Matta and Arshile Gorky were given figurative form by H. C. Westermann, William and Peter Saul and passed on to a younger generation that includes Jason Fox, Chloe Piene, David Korty and Taylor McKimens. Whatever. There is much to look at and a few notable outside-the-beltway entries, especially works by Isaac Lin, Fritz Welch and Joseph Ayers, who is represented by a giant graphite drawing of a giant whose legs bear an uncanny resemble to the forest he surveys. Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, franklinparrasch.com, through July 28. (Smith)\nGalleries: SoHo\n\u2605 \u2018GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE\u2019 The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called \u201cdrawings without paper\u201d: semigeometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they\u2019re out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego\u2019s art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) \nGalleries: Chelsea\n \u2018CONCRETE WORKS\u2019 What sounds like a ready-mix formula for a summer show is actually an astute selection of works that highlight the currently popular grab-bag approach to art history and the age-old sleight-of-hand tactic that prompts viewers to wonder how artists fabricate their works. Some of the works create conversations about abstraction and process that span decades. Lucy McKenzie\u2019s gray-scale chalk and charcoal work on paper nods to Mondrian and Max Ernst; Walead Beshty\u2019s photographs hang across the room from two fuzzy Laszlo Moholy-Nagy photographs; and a surprising pairing of Albert Oehlen with Man Ray centers on a \u201cdiscussion\u201d of Pollock\u2019s drip process. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, through July 27. (Schwendener)\n  \u2605 ROLE EXCHANGE This elegant exhibition takes an interesting idea and walks with it. The idea is the practice, widespread among artists since the late 1960s, of creating fictional identities, especially in camera-based work. But it is thorough and contains a handful of unfamiliar artists and works. And one effort is especially worth the trip: Kalup Linzy\u2019s fabulously nuanced (and lip-synched) new video, a collaboration with Shaun Leonardo that restates a vintage blues duet as a gay flirtation. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea (212) 239-1181, skny.com, through Aug. 3. (Smith)\n EZRA STOLLER : BUILDINGS OF NEW YORK Ezra Stoller (1915-2004) made a living photographing architecture, but he didn\u2019t consider himself an artist. \u201cI can draw out the strengths in a work that has strength,\u201d he once said, \u201cbut I never claimed my work is art. The art is the architecture.\u201d You feel inclined to disagree when looking at his stunning black-and-white photographs of mid-20th-century buildings. For one thing, Stoller fits nicely into a trajectory of architecturally centered photography that wasn\u2019t always considered \u201cart\u201d (and includes the work of luminaries like Eug\u00e8ne Atget and Margaret Bourke-White). Stoller\u2019s photographs are also filled with sly details that emphasize the inevitable trudge of history and the modern overtaking the traditional and antique. Danziger Projects, 521 West 26th Street, danzigerprojects.com, through July 20. (Schwendener)\nGalleries: Other\n\u2605 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: \u2018PREIS BILDER\u2019 Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn\u2019t get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) \n SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES ...  If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early \u201970s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)\nCHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: \u2018ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY\u2019 The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film\u2019s \u201cfourth wall\u201d by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet.\u201d Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters\u2019s \u201cMerzbau\u201d to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch\u2019s. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener) \nPublic Art\nMAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, \u201cConjoined\u201d and \u201cDefunct,\u201d and a glacierlike boulder, \u201cErratic,\u201d by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is \u201cConjoined,\u201d a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other\u2019s end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Genocchio) \nLast Chance\nDARBY BANNARD: MINIMAL PAINTINGS, 1959-1965 While Darby Bannard tends to be associated with Color Field painting, these little-known early works reveal that he once played for the other team, Minimalism, and may even have helped start it. With their hard-edge, centered squares and circles, the paintings show Mr. Bannard streamlining aspects of Abstract Expressionism in step with artists like Donald Judd and Robert Irwin. The smallest works that hover between Minimalism and Color Field are best, but the show expands the history of a very expansive time. Jacobson Howard, 22 East 72nd Street, (212) 570-2362; closes on Thursday. (Smith) \nPETER FISCHLI AND DAVIS WEISS: BOOKS, EDITIONS AND THE LIKE Drawn primarily from the artists\u2019 archives, and including posters, multiples, books and layouts of books as well as videos \u2014 among them \u201cThe Way Things Go,\u201d their great chain-reaction-in-a-studio \u2014 this exhibition amounts to a rather complete if highly distilled retrospective of their consistently down-to-earth Duchampian view of life and art. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035; closes tomorrow.(Smith)\n GREY ART GALLERY: \u2018BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O\u2019DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND\u2019 Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O\u2019Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It\u2019s a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today\u2019s most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart; closes tomorrow. (Goodbody)\n DAN TOROP: SNOWBOUND Last summer Dan Torop and Justine Kurland organized an exhibition of photographs, \u201cA Rabbit as King of the Ghosts,\u201d which described the photographer as \u201ca seeker of mystery\u201d and photography as an act that \u201ccasts a spell that turns the banal into the supernatural.\u201d This summer Mr. Torop delivers a similar manifesto with his own photographs. Many were taken in northern Iceland and depict a fairy-tale landscape of glaciers, water, mist and celestial effects. A few are like greeting-card images that counter the irony-laden and conceptually rigorous forms of photography that have dominated in the last few decades. Mr. Torop\u2019s dreamy visions register more like a challenge: What, you don\u2019t believe in magic? Derek Eller, 615 West 27th Street, derekeller.com; closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)",

    "text": "George Kaiser Speech on Childhood Education\n2007-02-07T05:00:00.000Z\nThe following speech was given by George Kaiser, a Tulsa billionaire whose foundation finances early-education programs, in Chicago on April 28, 2005.\nOunce of Prevention Conference Comments\nMy Personal Journey to the Revelation of Very Early Childhood Education\n I feel a bit like Admiral Stockdale standing here before you today. You remember Admiral Stockdale, Ross Perot\u2019s Vice Presidential running mate in 1992, who started his debate comments by looking into the camera, like a deer caught in headlights, and saying \u201cWho Am I? Why Am I Here?\u201d\n Most of you, I suspect, have long ago understood the critical importance of Early Childhood Education in providing children with the opportunity for success in life, however defined. And the patron saint of the Ounce, Irving Harris, whom we lost last year, figured it out more than thirty years ago. I am somewhat of a latter day convert. So, maybe Harriet selected me either because the new convert tends to be the zealot or maybe because she thought it would be interesting to hear how a robber baron from Red State America reached the conclusion that may seem foregone to all of you. So, I see my assignment today to depict one man\u2019s journey to the truth \u2014 as perceived within this hall, though not yet by the general public \u2014 and to describe the slight variations of the Educare design that we are implementing in Tulsa. Nevertheless, I still feel peculiar pontificating to the converted today, without having being named on a single ballot in Rome last week.\n I will try hard to make this description of my intellectual journey a brief one because I am fully aware that your capacity to absorb information is far reduced from that of an infant and you have just finished a filling lunch which has diverted your blood flow to other regions. As Illinois\u2019 favorite son, Adlai Stevenson, once commented to a group in the same circumstance, \u201cMy job today is to speak; your job is to listen. I sure hope you don\u2019t finish before I do.\u201d So, I\u2019ll try to keep it short and then give you the opportunity to ask questions or doze off.\nO.K., let me start by describing the logic that got me to where I think we all are \u2014 that sensory stimulation at the earliest possible point in life is the most important thing we can do to provide equal opportunity in our society. I have felt for most of my adult life that we all got where we are by dumb luck, that we have a moral obligation to share our random advantage with those who didn\u2019t win the ovarian lottery and that the purest form of charity is one which intervenes in the cycle of poverty at the earliest possible stage through improved nutrition, healthcare, housing, etc. Of course, the truly purest form of charity would also be anonymous and applied in areas of much greater need like southern Africa or Bangladesh so my self-bestowed halo is a bit tarnished.\nMy second premise is, if America stands for anything, it stands for the principle that all men (originally excluding women and slaves) are created equal or, at least, that they should have an equal opportunity at birth to reach as far as they wish to. Equal Opportunity is really the Social Contract of American life. Yet, as Warren Buffett has observed, \u201call men are created equal and that lasts for fifteen minutes.\u201d I think we all have grown up with a strong emotional commitment to the concept of equal opportunity and a suppressed, secret intellectual conclusion that genes play a more important part in cognitive potential than experience.\nThen, in the next step in my journey, I watched as America declared war on poverty in 1965, to provide that equality of opportunity, and committed literally trillions of dollars to the war over the next 40 years. But so far, Poverty is winning the war. We seem to be dealing with the symptoms of poverty but are not rooting out and modifying the cause, so that the next generation starts about where the last one did. One can\u2019t help but ask why we have been so unsuccessful.\nTwo subsequent discoveries or observations gave me a clue \u2014 one theoretical and one practical: The theoretical one derived from all of the discussion about stem cell research over the past ten years or so. What we seemed to learn from that was that a brain cell at birth, even after nine months of gestation, was essentially undifferentiated, still trying to figure out what it wanted to be when it grew up. You could scrape some cells from the brain and transplant them to the heart, liver or kidneys immediately after birth and the cells would develop as heart, liver or kidney cells. [I guess it must be unintentional early migration of cells in males that causes them to think with organs other than their brains on occasion.]\nWe have all watched the alert eyes of an infant and concluded that she was observing and absorbing far more than she could communicate. And then we have seen her mimic an action that she had seen only one time before. Those largely unformed brain cells and the connections among them \u2014 the synapses and neuron wiring \u2014 are exploding in response to every sensory stimulation. Truly, learning appears to be a reverse geometric progression with experiences at one hour, one day, one month or one year dramatically more influential and formative than later experiences. As has often been quoted, 85% of brain development takes place by age 3 and yet we spend only 4% of our educational dollars by that point. Is it any wonder that traditional Head Start, commencing at age 4, has had somewhat disappointing long term impact?\nAs one well past the age of three and the age of peak mental acuity at 25 or so, I am pleased that even as this geometric progression reverses and comes crashing down later in life, we are rewarded with other tools to fall back on \u2014 guile, wit, intimidation, knowing glances, etc.\nSo, now I had a theoretical construct that could reconcile my emotional belief in nurture and my analytical belief in nature. Yes, people could rise above the condition from which they derived by intensive sensory stimulation of their unformed brain cells at the earliest possible point. Maybe, the perceived fact that smart, rich parents tended to have smart, rich kids was largely due to the fact that they also tended to have stay at home moms or nannies who read to their kids, held them, put mobiles over their cribs, playing those annoying ditties, and sent them off for SAT training at six months.\nWell, we\u2019ve seen so many other laboratory theories or medical experiments on mice that didn\u2019t pan out after large human studies so I was intrigued by this discovery but not convinced. I looked around for practical applications that appeared to stand up over time. I was introduced to Abecedarian by the head of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, a conservative Republican ex-Oklahoma State Senator, and then I got hold of a book of studies of early childhood programs edited by Stephen Barnett at Rutgers. I was struck by the solid indications that programs like the Beethoven Project, out of which Educare grew, and Abecedarian and the Perry High Scope Program did appear to make a major difference in the lives of participants 10, 20 or 30 years later.\nI then tried to determine the common characteristics of these programs that appeared to make them work. I have concluded that those critical elements, in approximate priority order are: 1) Very early entry, preferably within the first few months after birth; 2) Trained, skilled teachers who understand how infant brains receive, absorb and process information; 3) Family support services from talented case workers with manageable loads, who reinforce the classroom experience by assisting the parents with continuing education, access to social services and parenting training; and 4) Intensity of the experience through low ratios and all day, year round programs.\nUpon accepting this revelation, I wanted to find the best applications of it to reassure my conclusion and to provide a model to copy. I turned to Tulsa Community Foundation, which I had helped found a little earlier and, in particular, to Annie vanHanken there, who had been assigned, as one of her roles, to provide research to emerging philanthropists to complete the baking process of their half-baked charitable ideas. [Those of you who are currently celebrating or tolerating Passover know that bread is a whole lot better tasting than its half-baked variation, matzoh.] After looking around a bit, Annie came across the Ounce and Educare and visited with Dan Pederson regarding the Educare replication efforts being pursued by Susan and Peter Buffett through their foundations. I followed her through this path and then had the great pleasure of visiting the Educare mother church here in Chicago near the Robert Taylor complex and meeting with Irving Harris and realizing that he had gone on the same journey long before I had and had reached almost identical conclusions. His wise counsel, delivered with wit, confirmed my conclusion that we needed to proceed with a major effort in my home town of Tulsa.\nI have been blessed with the ability to fund one or more Educare schools personally but I think that proselytization of opinion leaders is at least as important as starting a program because we need to change conventional wisdom about public responsibility for education. In Tulsa County, there are only 104 Federal Early Head Start slots and there are 10,000 kids from zero to three in families below 180 percent of the poverty level. So, we are fulfilling 1 percent of the need. I therefore went out on the hustings to solicit and educate a bit and had the most remarkably positive experience. With only one exception, everyone I asked to help, contributed our request or more and we quickly exceeded our target of $8 million.\nWe have now secured an ideal site for our first school, on park land in the midst of a very depressed, ethnically diverse neighborhood next to an excellent elementary school. We have the almost messianic support of the Superintendent of Schools, the Head Start Designee and the Director of the Department of Human Services, all of whom have graciously committed their time and institutional resources to the project. We have had a large number of architectural design meetings and are close to settling on an exciting structure which will be started during the summer for completion and commencement of programming a year later. We have formed a governing board and will shortly commence our search for an Executive Director.\n We feel a responsibility to Infant/Toddler Education and to Educare beyond building a single school in Tulsa to help a small fraction of those who need the program. We have adopted the following mission statement: \u201cTulsa Educare\u2019s mission is to help break the cycle of poverty through a flagship, very early childhood education program and through the transfer of best practices to other Tulsa programs.\u201d We are doing several things to further the effort well beyond our first campus and we hope that some of our efforts will be instructive to the rest of the system, which would allow us to return the favor of all of the help we have received from Educare.\n The first supplementary effort to export best practices is using some of our excess funding and additional funding that I am securing for the purpose of providing Early Head Start slots in other programs, to supplement the limited number of federal slots. These programs need to commit to the four critical elements I described earlier, though we will allow some slippage in the case load of the family support workers and allow a portion of that service to be provided offsite.\n Second, our school will be built with a healthcare clinic to serve the children in the school and in the next door elementary school.\n Third, we have sponsored an educational program designed by the University of Oklahoma and Tulsa Community College which will offer Associate, Baccalaureate and Masters degrees in Early Childhood Education focusing on infants and toddlers. We have provided some start up costs and endowed professorships and secured state funding for what will be the only infant/toddler focused college program in Oklahoma and one of very few in the United States. We will also provide scholarships, loans and job guarantees to draw attractive candidates to the program.\n Fourth, we have engaged two talented lobbyists to represent us at the state legislature to work toward the kind of matching funding the Ounce has so successfully stimulated in Illinois.\n Fifth, we are already looking toward a second site in Tulsa, for possible commencement two years behind the first one, which may experiment with an exclusively infant/toddler program without federal support.\n Sixth, we are working with some counterparts in Oklahoma City who may be willing to lead a parallel effort there.\n And finally, and I say this with trepidation because I know my offer will be followed up upon within minutes, we would be interested in joining in an expanded Buffett-Harris replication effort if we could interest other participants, to give the program a national scope.\n Now, before I injure my arm from patting myself on the back and before your eyes glaze over further, I should stop talking at you and see if I can talk with you. Do you have any contrary experiences? Do you have some revisions or corrections to anything I have said? Would you like to volunteer your resources to the grand experiment in Tulsa or Chicago or nationally? Or have I just spouted conventional wisdom, at least within this group, and you are ready to move on?\n Thank you.",

He returns, to the Bill Hodges Gallery, with a blistering assembly of works in various mediums from the last couple of decades, among them a pair of closely observed black-and-white screen prints on canvas of the back of his shaved head, above. They resemble studies in phrenology, a pseudoscience sometimes used to justify racism. There is also a nice selection of black-and-white text paintings, including \u201cUntitled (Crowd/The Fire Next Time)\u201d (2000), a photographic image of an African-American crowd at a demonstration on the Mall in Washington in 1995 overlaid with a silkscreen in glistening coal dust of an excerpt from \u201cThe Fire Next Time\u201d by James Baldwin. The text reads: \u201cSomething in me wondered, \u2018What will happen to all the beauty?,\u2019 \u201d in this context suggesting a gentle satire of protest rallies and the civil rights cause. Mr. Ligon\u2019s appetite for traversing racial stereotypes finds vivid expression in his narratives, etchings on handmade paper purporting to be the title page of testimonials on his intrepid life and adventures among white people in the art world. They make you laugh, but like all good socially or politically engaged art, the pieces also have the underappreciated virtue of momentarily letting the viewer see the world through someone else\u2019s eyes. (Through Aug. 25, Bill Hodges Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, Manhattan, 212-333-2640, billhodgesgallery.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\n Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted.

The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage, rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand\u2019s strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)\nCOOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) \nGUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,\u2019 through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat\u2019s invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, bighearted one word and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith) \n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,\u2019 through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work\u2019s laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman) \n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)\nTHE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: \u2018NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though on the whole the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)\nMETROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother, Stephen, was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.). The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling \u201cdrew the line\u201d at C\u00e9zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso \u201cbad painters and fakers.\u201d Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting \u2014 and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nTHE MET: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck)\n THE MET: \u2018HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,\u2019 through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum\u2019s collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: \u201cThe question is not what you look at but what you see.\u201d Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans\u2019s late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore\u2019s landscapes and Rachel Harrison\u2019s photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show \u2014 only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms \u2014 it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Schwendener)\n* THE MET: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter)\n \u2605 THE MET: NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA, through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter\u2019s mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th-century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch\u2019s talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018POIRET: KING OF FASHION,\u2019 through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) \u201cDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition, the latest effort from the Met\u2019s esteemed Costume Institute, does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) \n* THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck) \nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,\u2019 through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures \u2014 and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella\u2019s importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)\nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)\n MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: \u2018THE FRENCH EVOLUTION: RACE, POLITICS & THE 2005 RIOTS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. Alexis Peskine serves as an informed guide to recent events in France, although his position is somewhat complicated. Son of a Franco-Russian father, an architect, and an Afro-Brazilian mother, Mr. Peskine hold a bachelor of fine arts degree from Howard University and a master\u2019s from the Maryland Institute College of Art \u2014 which set him distinctly apart from the working-class youth in the banlieue, or suburb. His training as a graphic artist is evident in paintings that appropriate elements from comics, cartoons and food products, while his interest in hip-hop culminates in a music video titled \u201cRipa\u201d (slang for Paris). Uneven at times, Mr. Peskine\u2019s work is ambitious and reflective. It also succeeds in showing us how in France\u2019s difficulties we feel echoes of our own. At 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Schwendener)\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,\u2019 through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His \u201cTorqued Ellipses\u201d and \u201cTorqued Toruses\u201d and other recent works like \u201cBand\u201d and \u201cSequence\u201d have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That\u2019s about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)\nMUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,\u2019 through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York\u2019s work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)\nNEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: \u2018PARADISE IN PRINT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Watercolors, folio editions, rare books and prints from the 18th through the mid-20th centuries reveal how closely linked natural and human histories have been in the Caribbean over the last 500 years. Engravings and lithographs of cash crops like coffee, chocolate, tobacco and sugar (nicknamed \u201cgreen gold\u201d) are accompanied by images from Mark Catesby\u2019s 18th-century natural history, which served as the model for Audubon\u2019s \u201cBirds of America\u201d; images of African slaves and colonialists; selections from 19th-century French lithographer Etienne Denisse\u2019s book \u201cFlora of America;\u201d and Nikolaus Joseph Jacquin\u2019s extraordinary \u201cSelectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia,\u201d published around 1780 in Vienna and illustrated with watercolors painted directly into the book. (It was purchased for the Botanical Garden by Andrew Carnegie.) Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, (718) 817-8616, nybg.org. (Schwendener)\nNEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro- slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Edward Rothstein)\n\u2605 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018ORGANIZING CHAOS, \u2019 through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn\u2019t rule out many interesting connections. The subject is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimar\u00e3es, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitieollo. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Smith)\nWADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, \u2018WHERE WERE WE,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,\u2019 through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein\u2019s brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein\u2019s taste clearly hasn\u2019t won the day, but it\u2019s never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018RESISTANCE IS ... ,\u2019 through Sept. 2. This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it\u2019s smart, engaging, and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn\u2019t look or feel more apposite. (See above.) (Benjamin Genocchio)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018RUDOLF STINGEL,\u2019 through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions lately seen at the Whitney. (See above.) (Smith)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,\u2019 through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) \nGalleries: Uptown\n \u2018MAGICAL MEANS: MILTON AVERY AND WATERCOLOR\u2019 Milton Avery (1885-1965) painted in watercolor mostly when he was away from his New York studio. Watercolors were light and easy to transport, and during the Depression, when the cost of paper was a consideration, he could use both sides of a sheet. Works spanning more than 30 years are here, including landscapes, portraits, still lifes and abstract compositions. Bulky bathers show him distilling the influence of Matisse and Picasso. Echoes of Ash Can realism are obvious in paintings of train tracks or the boardwalk at Coney Island. Mostly the work shows Avery\u2019s consistent desire to, as he once said, \u201celiminate and simplify, leaving apparently nothing but color and form.\u201d Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Aug. 10. (Schwendener)\nGalleries: 57th Street\nOK 7/13,20 \u2018AUTOMATIC\u2019 Organized by the artist Chris Churchill, this lively exhibition crosses generations and styles to argue that the automatist drawings and rebellious attitudes of artists like Roberto Matta and Arshile Gorky were given figurative form by H. C. Westermann and Peter Saul and passed on to a younger generation that includes Jason Fox, Chloe Piene, David Korty and Taylor McKimens. Whatever. There is much to look at and a few notable outside-the-beltway entries, especially works by Isaac Lin, Fritz Welch and Joseph Ayers, who is represented by a giant graphite drawing of a giant whose legs bear an uncanny resemble to the forest he surveys. Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, franklinparrasch.com, through July 28. (Smith)\nGalleries: SoHo\nJIM ISERMANN: \u2018VINYL SMASH-UP, 1999-2007\u2019 This exhibition sets out to be a mini-retrospective of Jim Isermann\u2019s vinyl decals. Though the pieces are hung in a manner more appropriate to an interior designer\u2019s showroom than to an art gallery, this Electric-Kool-Aid-Acid-Test-colored show will give you a good dose of California-meets-Op-Art aesthetics. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through Aug. 4. (Goodbody)\n \u2018NEW ECONOMY\u2019 This has been a busy year for Jo\u00e3o Ribas, who became a curator at the Drawing Center and now has organized \u201cNew Economy,\u201d a show that looks at art practices in the global information economy. As you might expect, the Internet is addressed, but old-economy titans like Karl Marx and Adam Smith get some play too. Over all, however, the show\u2019s premise feels somewhat dated. Mr. Ribas also has a weakness for the kind of critical-theory jargon that peaked a decade or two ago, quoting Peter Drucker\u2019s 1994 book, \u201cPost-Capitalist Society,\u201d and following that up with a description of the \u201cpostindustrial economic order\u201d as a \u201cknowledge-driven form of post-Fordist capitalism.\u201d Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212) 226-3970, artistspace.org, through July 28. (Schwendener)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n \u2605 COLBY BIRD AND JOSHUA FIELDS This two-person exhibition manages to look both like a one-person show and a group show. The works are disparate, rough around the edges and tilted a little too steeply toward the boys-will-be-boys end of the spectrum. Mr. Bird\u2019s sculptures include a refrigerator precariously packed with malt liquor and a kind of maw made of fluorescent lights and ceiling tile. Mr. Fields focuses on Kurt Cobain\u2019s suicide note; Chris Farley\u2019s birth and death certificates; various feats of urination; tumbleweed fenced inside a real barbed-wire fence; and, in the best work here, a fictional album titled \u201cSuicidal Tendencies.\u201d Two copies of it rotate on turntables on opposite sides of the gallery, making only scratching sounds and no discernible progress. There\u2019s plenty of serious intent, ingenuity and talent here, but the ideas are mostly received. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, crggallery.com, through next Friday. (Smith)\n\u2018CONCRETE WORKS\u2019 What sounds like a ready-mix formula for a summer show is actually an astute selection of works that highlight the currently popular grab-bag approach to art history and the age-old sleight-of-hand tactic that prompts viewers to wonder how artists fabricate their works. Some of the pieces create conversations about abstraction and process that span decades. Lucy McKenzie\u2019s gray-scale chalk and charcoal work on paper nods to Mondrian and Max Ernst; Walead Beshty\u2019s photographs hang across the room from two fuzzy Laszlo Moholy-Nagy photographs; and a surprising pairing of Albert Oehlen with Man Ray centers on a \u201cdiscussion\u201d of Pollock\u2019s drip process. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, through next Friday. (Schwendener)\n SARAH PETERS In an impressive first show, this artist revisits several pictorial conventions of colonial America \u2014 the portrait, the mourning picture and the landscape \u2014 with antic results. Her weapon of choice is black ballpoint pen backed by pencil, deployed in a fidgety yet gossamer cross-hatch style whose precedents include Edward Gorey and the early work of Jim Nutt and Sue Williams. Winkleman Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, (212) 643-3152, through next Friday. (Smith)\n  \u2605 ROLE EXCHANGE This elegant exhibition takes an interesting idea and walks with it. The idea is the practice, widespread among artists since the late 1960s, of creating fictional identities, especially in camera-based work. But it is thorough and contains a handful of unfamiliar artists and works. And one effort is especially worth the trip: Kalup Linzy\u2019s fabulously nuanced (and lip-synched) new video, a collaboration with Shaun Leonardo that restates a vintage blues duet as a gay flirtation. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea (212) 239-1181, skny.com, through Aug. 3. (Smith)\n STRANGE MAGIC The camera-based art of Liz Deschenes, Anne Collier, Amy Granat, Eileen Quinlan and Sara VanDerBeek has found that there are all sorts of new tricks to be conjured inside the triangle defined by the 1980s practices of photo appropriation, rephotography and set-up photography. That all the artists are women harks back to the breakthroughs of the late 1970s, when numerous women used the camera to reimagine Conceptual Art. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through July 28. (Smith)\nGalleries: Other\n MARTIN CREED: FEELINGS Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of bean-bag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an anti-gravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. (845) 758-7598, through Sept. 16. (Smith)\n\u2605 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: \u2018PREIS BILDER\u2019 Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn\u2019t get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith)\n SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES ...  If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early \u201970s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)\nCHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: \u2018ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY\u2019 The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film\u2019s \u201cfourth wall\u201d by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet.\u201d Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters\u2019s \u201cMerzbau\u201d to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch\u2019s. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener) \nPublic Art\nMAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, \u201cConjoined\u201d and \u201cDefunct,\u201d and a glacierlike boulder, \u201cErratic,\u201d by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is \u201cConjoined,\u201d a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other\u2019s end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio) \nLast Chance\n \u2605 \u2018GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE\u2019 The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called \u201cdrawings without paper\u201d: semigeometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they\u2019re out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego\u2019s art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n \u2018UTOPIA IN NEW YORK\u2019 A tasty summer sampler of paintings at the Robert Steele Gallery in Chelsea by a dozen artists from Utopia, an Aboriginal-owned desert reservation the size of Rhode Island. The show includes such well-known figures as Gloria Petyarre, Barbara Weir and Minnie Pwerle. Most depict traditional motifs and designs for native flowers and vegetation, like the root pattern of a yam, a staple food, but others are more abstract and bear a visual resemblance to international art movements like Optical Art and 1970s painterly abstraction. But what gets you most about these paintings is the color, radiant and intense. Robert Steele Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 243-0165, robertsteelegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \n\u2018RESISTANCE IS ...\u2019 The well-trafficked \u201cSummer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era\u201d exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art explores the themes of liberation and dissent in art and society in the 1960s. Expanding on this focus is \u201cResistance Is ...,\u201d a companion show of two dozen artworks about social unrest and upheaval. It is a rather earnest display, but smart, engaging and nicely put together by the curator Tina Kukielski, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several works are documentary photographs of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political action, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon; Gordon Parks (above, his photograph of Black Panthers in San Francisco in 1969); Larry Fink; Gilles Peress; and Garry Winogrand. Eerily pertinent is one of Mr. Peress\u2019s hastily grabbed snapshots of protest posters outside the United States Embassy in Tehran in 1979. It could have been taken just last week. Other artists recapitulate images from documentary photography, television or film, exploring the boundaries of art and political action with a mind toward merging them. There is Andy Warhol\u2019s devastating 1964 screen print of a newspaper photograph of race riots in Birmingham, Ala., but also more urgent, contemporary work like Josephine Meckseper\u2019s video splicing together footage of recent political demonstrations in New York overlaid with an ominous-sounding voice intoning obedience. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn\u2019t look or feel more apposite. (Through Sept. 2, Whitney Museum of American Art, 800-944-8639, whitney.org.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n\u2605 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: \u2018THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand\u2019s strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) GREY ART GALLERY: \u2018BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O\u2019DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND,\u2019 through July 14. Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O\u2019Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It\u2019s a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today\u2019s most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart/. (Bridget L. Goodbody)GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,\u2019 through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat\u2019s invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,\u2019 through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work\u2019s laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. \n(Michael Kimmelman)\n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)\nTHE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: \u2018NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)\nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling \u201cdrew the line\u201d at C\u00e9zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso \u201cbad painters and fakers.\u201d Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting \u2014 and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nTHE MET: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck) THE MET: \u2018HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,\u2019 through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum\u2019s collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: \u201cThe question is not what you look at but what you see.\u201d Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans\u2019s late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore\u2019s landscapes and Rachel Harrison\u2019s photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show \u2014 only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms \u2014 it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Martha Schwendener)* THE MET: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter) \u2605 THE MET: NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA, through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter\u2019s mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic, 19th-century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch\u2019s talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018POIRET: KING OF FASHION,\u2019 through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) \u201cDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition \u2014 the latest effort from the Met\u2019s esteemed Costume Institute \u2014 does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith)* THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck)THE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,\u2019 through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures \u2014 and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella\u2019s importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)THE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,\u2019 through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His \u201cTorqued Ellipses\u201d and \u201cTorqued Toruses\u201d and other recent works like \u201cBand\u201d and \u201cSequence\u201d have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That\u2019s about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)\nMUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,\u2019 through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York\u2019s work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Goodbody)\n THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: \u2018PARADISE IN PRINT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Watercolors, folio editions, rare books and prints from the 18th through the mid-20th centuries reveal how closely linked natural and human histories have been in the Caribbean over the last 500 years. Engravings and lithographs of cash crops like coffee, chocolate, tobacco and sugar (nicknamed \u201cgreen gold\u201d) are accompanied by images from Mark Catesby\u2019s 18th-century natural history, which served as the model for Audubon\u2019s \u201cBirds of America\u201d; images of African slaves and colonialists; and Nikolaus Joseph Jacquin\u2019s extraordinary \u201cSelectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia,\u201d published around 1780 in Vienna, and illustrated with watercolors painted directly into the book. (It was purchased for the botanical garden by Andrew Carnegie.) Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, (718) 817-8616, nybg.org. (Schwendener)\nNEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro-slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. \n(Edward Rothstein)\nWADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Grace Glueck)WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, \u2018WHERE WERE WE,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,\u2019 through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein\u2019s brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein\u2019s taste clearly hasn\u2019t won the day, but it\u2019s never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)\u2018RUDOLF STINGEL,\u2019 through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo-Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions lately seen at the Whitney. (See above.) (Smith)\n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,\u2019 through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) \nGalleries: SoHo\nPETER FISCHLI AND DAVIS WEISS: BOOKS, EDITIONS AND THE LIKE Drawn primarily from the artists\u2019 archives, and including posters, multiples, books and layouts of books as well as videos \u2014 among them \u201cThe Way Things Go,\u201d their great chain-reaction-in-a-studio \u2014 this exhibition amounts to a rather complete if highly distilled retrospective of their consistently down-to-earth Duchampian view of life and art. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, through July 14. (Smith)\n\u2605 \u2018GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE\u2019 The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called \u201cdrawings without paper\u201d: semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they\u2019re out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego\u2019s art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. \n(Cotter) \nGalleries: Chelsea\n EZRA STOLLER : BUILDINGS OF NEW YORK Ezra Stoller (1915-2004) made a living photographing architecture, but he didn\u2019t consider himself an artist. \u201cI can draw out the strengths in a work that has strength,\u201d he once said, \u201cbut I never claimed my work is art. The art is the architecture.\u201d You feel inclined to disagree when looking at his stunning black-and-white photographs of mid-20th-century buildings. For one thing, Stoller fits nicely into a trajectory of architecturally centered photography that wasn\u2019t always considered \u201cart\u201d (and includes the work of luminaries like Eug\u00e8ne Atget and Margaret Bourke-White). Stoller\u2019s photographs are also filled with sly details that emphasize the inevitable trudge of history and the modern overtaking the traditional and antique. Danziger Projects, 521 West 26th Street, through July 20. (Schwendener)\n DAN TOROP: SNOWBOUND Last summer Dan Torop and Justine Kurland organized an exhibition of photographs titled \u201cA Rabbit as King of the Ghosts\u201d that described the photographer as \u201ca seeker of mystery\u201d and photography as an act that \u201ccasts a spell that turns the banal into the supernatural.\u201d This summer Mr. Torop delivers a similar manifesto with his own photographs. Many were taken in northern Iceland and depict a fairy-tale landscape of glaciers, water, mist and celestial effects. A few are like greeting-card images that counter the irony-laden and conceptually rigorous forms of photography that have dominated in the last few decades. Mr. Torop\u2019s dreamy visions register more like a challenge: What, you don\u2019t believe in magic? Derek Eller, 615 West 27th Street, through July 13. (Schwendener)\nGalleries: Other\n\u2605 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: \u2018PREIS BILDER\u2019 Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn\u2019t get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) \n SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES ...  If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early \u201970s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)\nCHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: \u2018ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY\u2019 The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film\u2019s \u201cfourth wall\u201d by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet.\u201d Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters\u2019s \u201cMerzbau\u201d to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch\u2019s. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener) \nPublic Art\nMAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures \u2014 \u201cConjoined\u201d and \u201cDefunct\u201d \u2014 and a glacierlike boulder, \u201cErratic,\u201d by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is \u201cConjoined,\u201d a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin, and the other\u2019s end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio) \nLast Chance\n * THE MET: \u2018VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797\u2019 At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice, the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \n\u2018IN CONTEXT: COLLAGE + ABSTRACTION\u2019 This beautiful, intelligent exhibition of abstract works and collages by more than 50 artists includes some of the more memorable objects in Chelsea right now. It is a song of praise to craftsmanship and making, an unfashionable concept but ultimately at the core of all visual art, at least until the 1960s. In attendance are not only the usual names in this area, including Kurt Schwitters and Robert Motherwell, but also a raft of lesser-known but no less talented artists who have traditionally exhibited on the Upper East Side but haven\u2019t really gotten their due. Several exhibitors make collages by cutting, tearing, folding and jumbling together bits of colored paper, sometimes painted, among them Jack Tworkov, Jerry Jofen, Esteban Vicente, Holli Schorno, Janice Biala, Mario Naves and Fritz Bultman (whose \u201cWaves and Others\u201d is at right). Others prefer structured, ordered patterns that delight the eyes, cutting and combining paper and other materials to create a mandala, a ziggurat, a diamond design or random geometric shapes. Anne Ryan\u2019s circa-1950 collage on Masonite gleams, looking something like a stained-glass window. Rounding out the lineup are some young artists, among them David Poppie, who fashions abstract collages from spent matchbooks. It is hard to say whether he can push the idea or the material much further, but the work stands up in this exalted company. (Through Aug. 10, Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 533 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, 212-675-7490, pavelzoubok .com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n\u2605 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: \u2018THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)\nGUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,\u2019 through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat\u2019s invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, bighearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith) \n \u2605 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018THE SHAPES OF SPACE,\u2019 through Sept. 5. The Guggenheim takes time off from thematic blockbusters to bring the public up to date on recent acquisitions, provocatively installed by three younger curators among an astute selection of older works from the collection. The theme is space, one of modern art\u2019s central concerns. The results are mixed, but cause for optimism. It is not every day you can look at a Mondrian while listening to disco and rap music emanating from another kind of grid: the flashing patterns of a digitized dance floor by Piotr Uklanski. The atmosphere can get a bit mall-like at times, but this is what every New York museum needs to do more: play with the collection and find new ways to bring it to life. (See above) (Smith)\n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,\u2019 through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work\u2019s laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)\nTHE JEWISH MUSEUM: \u2018DATELINE: ISRAEL: NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though on the whole the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)\nMETROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother, Stephen, was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.). The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling \u201cdrew the line\u201d at C\u00e9zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso \u201cbad painters and fakers.\u201d Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting \u2014 and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nTHE MET: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)\n THE MET: \u2018HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,\u2019 through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum\u2019s collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: \u201cThe question is not what you look at but what you see.\u201d Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans\u2019s late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore\u2019s landscapes and Rachel Harrison\u2019s photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show \u2014 only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms \u2014 it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Schwendener)\n* THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter)\n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA,\u2019 through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter\u2019s mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th- century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch\u2019s talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018POIRET: KING OF FASHION,\u2019 through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) \u201cDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition, the latest effort from the Met\u2019s esteemed Costume Institute, does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) \n* THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Dec. 2. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck) \nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)\n MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: \u2018THE FRENCH EVOLUTION: RACE, POLITICS & THE 2005 RIOTS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. Alexis Peskine serves as an informed guide to recent events in France, although his position is somewhat complicated. Son of a Franco-Russian father (an architect) and an Afro-Brazilian mother, Mr. Peskine holds a bachelor of fine arts degree from Howard University and a master\u2019s from the Maryland Institute College of Art \u2014 which set him distinctly apart from the working-class youth in the banlieue, or suburb. His training as a graphic artist is evident in paintings that appropriate elements from comics, cartoons and food products, while his interest in hip-hop culminates in a music video titled \u201cRipa\u201d (slang for Paris). Uneven at times, Mr. Peskine\u2019s work is ambitious and reflective. It also succeeds in showing us how in France\u2019s difficulties we feel echoes of our own. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Schwendener)\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,\u2019 through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His \u201cTorqued Ellipses\u201d and \u201cTorqued Toruses\u201d and other recent works like \u201cBand\u201d and \u201cSequence\u201d have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That\u2019s about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,\u2019 through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York\u2019s work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)\nNEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: \u2018PARADISE IN PRINT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Watercolors, folio editions, rare books and prints from the 18th through the mid-20th centuries reveal how closely linked natural and human histories have been in the Caribbean over the last 500 years. Engravings and lithographs of cash crops like coffee, chocolate, tobacco and sugar (nicknamed \u201cgreen gold\u201d) are accompanied by images from Mark Catesby\u2019s 18th-century natural history, which served as the model for Audubon\u2019s \u201cBirds of America\u201d; images of African slaves and colonialists; selections from the 19th-century French lithographer Etienne Denisse\u2019s book \u201cFlora of America;\u201d and Nikolaus Joseph Jacquin\u2019s extraordinary \u201cSelectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia,\u201d published around 1780 in Vienna and illustrated with watercolors painted directly into the book. (It was purchased for the Botanical Garden by Andrew Carnegie.) Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, (718) 817-8616, nybg.org. (Schwendener)\n NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,\u2019  through Feb. 25. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with \u201csacred\u201d sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole\u2019s epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, \u201cThe Course of Empire,\u201d is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. The exhibition includes works by George Loring Brown, Asher Brown Durand, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church and others. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Schwendener)\nNEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro- slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. (See above.) (Edward Rothstein)\n\u2605 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018ORGANIZING CHAOS,\u2019 through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn\u2019t rule out many interesting connections. The subject is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimar\u00e3es, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitieollo. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org.. (Smith)\nWADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, \u2018WHERE WERE WE,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,\u2019 through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein\u2019s brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein\u2019s taste clearly hasn\u2019t won the day, but it\u2019s never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018RESISTANCE IS ... ,\u2019 through Sept. 2. This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it\u2019s smart, engaging and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn\u2019t look or feel more apposite. (See above.) (Benjamin Genocchio)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018RUDOLF STINGEL,\u2019 through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions lately seen at the Whitney. (See above.) (Smith)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,\u2019 through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) \nGalleries: Uptown\n \u2018MAGICAL MEANS: MILTON AVERY AND WATERCOLOR\u2019 Milton Avery (1885-1965) painted in watercolor mostly when he was away from his New York studio. Watercolors were light and easy to transport, and during the Depression, when the cost of paper was a consideration, he could use both sides of a sheet. Works spanning more than 30 years are here, including landscapes, portraits, still lifes and abstract compositions. Bulky bathers show him distilling the influence of Matisse and Picasso. Echoes of Ashcan realism are obvious in paintings of train tracks or the boardwalk at Coney Island. Mostly the work shows Avery\u2019s consistent desire to, as he once said, \u201celiminate and simplify, leaving apparently nothing but color and form.\u201d Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Aug. 10. (Schwendener)\nGalleries: SoHo\n \u2605 ALEX HAY: \u2018NEW PAINTINGS\u2019 In the 1960s this painter pitted Pop, Photo Realism and abstraction against one another. Now he has turned to \u201cfound\u201d abstractions: enlarged replications of weathered, peeling boards. Made with an elaborate process of stenciling and spray painting, they lean toward the modernist monochrome, while keeping one foot planted in trompe l\u2019oeil. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com, through Aug. 3. (Smith)\nJIM ISERMANN: \u2018VINYL SMASH-UP, 1999-2007\u2019 This exhibition sets out to be a miniretrospective of Jim Isermann\u2019s vinyl decals. Though the pieces are hung in a manner more appropriate to an interior designer\u2019s showroom than to an art gallery, this Electric-Kool-Aid-Acid-Test-colored show will give you a good dose of California-meets-Op-Art aesthetics. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through Aug. 4. (Goodbody)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n \u2018AGITATION AND REPOSE\u2019 This group show opens with a very anxious object: a wall clock with spinning hands, by Via Lewandowsky. It continues with Rainer Ganahl\u2019s bicycle ride into oncoming traffic and Holly Zausner\u2019s body-ladened tour of Berlin, and concludes with Claire Watkins\u2019s sculpture of what appears to be a detached nervous system. The real draw, though, is a group of six short videos by, and starring, the excellent Roman Signer. In one, a helicoptor buzzes him in bed; in another, hay explodes through the floor as he sits reading; in a third, a sudden explosion prompts him to start \u2014 and finish \u2014 a painting. Repose has never been Mr. Signer\u2019s thing. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Aug. 17. (Cotter)\n  \u2605 \u2018COLOUR BEFORE COLOR\u2019 The spelling discrepancy in the show\u2019s title is meant to indicate that color photography as we now know it was not the exclusive achievement of Americans like William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, but was also nurtured by a group of European photographers whose efforts range from the subtle still lifes of Luigi Ghirri (which are similar to those of Irving Penn) to claustrophobic close-ups of sun bathers by the Spanish photographer Carlos P\u00e9rez Siquier. The show, organized by the British photographer Martin Parr, is a must-see for anyone interested in the medium. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, hastedhunt.com, through Aug. 17. (Smith)\n \u2605 \u2018A POINT IN SPACE IS A PLACE FOR AN ARGUMENT\u2019 Despite its title, taken from the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, this group show of 56 works by 30 artists is fairly even-tempered, less about argument than unexpected connections. With special attention to the margins and physical process, it ranges across generations, styles and mediums, gathering together works by Lynda Benglis, Bruce Nauman, Niki de Saint Phalle, Forrest Bess, Joe Overstreet, Cathy Wilkes, Raoul De Keyser, Al Taylor and Andre Cadere. Common ground is a shared opposition to tradition, standard definitions of greatness, accepted notions of material or finish, or the separation of art mediums. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com, through Aug. 10. (Smith)\n \u2018PROMISED LAND\u2019 Blink and you could be standing in the American wing of a big survey museum, only Americana here is delivered with a twist: a painting with a hunter standing over a pile of wildlife booty; a pencil drawing of Ben Franklin sitting cross-legged with an eagle above him ready to pounce; a tattered Confederate flag made with bubble gum and hung from a twig. The show, organized by Elizabeth M. Grady, takes its title from John Salvest\u2019s illuminated sign with black vinyl letters spelling out the words \u201cPromised Land.\u201d Like much of the work here, the sign, bordered with blinking red lights, offers sardonic commentary on the contemporary state of the Union. Morgan Lehman, 317 10th Avenue, at 28th Street, (212) 268-2699, morganlehmangallery.com, through Aug. 4. (Schwendener)\n  \u2605 \u2018ROLE EXCHANGE\u2019 This elegant exhibition takes an interesting idea and walks with it. The idea is the practice, widespread among artists since the late 1960s, of creating fictional identities, especially in camera-based work. But it is thorough and contains a handful of unfamiliar artists and works. And one effort is especially worth the trip: Kalup Linzy\u2019s fabulously nuanced (and lip-synched) new video, a collaboration with Shaun Leonardo that restates a vintage blues duet as a gay flirtation. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, skny.com, through Aug. 3. (Smith)\n \u2018SOURCE CODE\u2019 This is the first of three shows commemorating Eyebeam\u2019s 10th anniversary. The roster includes \u201cartists, technologists, hackers and programmers,\u201d from Cory Arcangel to Radical Software Group, Mark Napier, Carrie Dashow, Nina Katchadourian, Steve Lambert, Golan Levin and Jennifer and Kevin McCoy. \u201cThe Duellists\u201d by MediaShed is a work in which two young men, videotaped on closed-circuit television in a shopping center, engage in a choreographed performance of Parkour, a form of \u201cfree running\u201d that looks like a combination of break dancing, martial arts, acrobatics and skateboarding without the board. Interesting that, in an exhibition centered on technology, a work foregrounding raw human ability steals the show. Eyebeam, 540 West 21st Street, (212) 937-6580, eyebeam.org, through Aug. 11. (Schwendener)\nGalleries: Other\n  MARTIN CREED: \u2018FEELINGS\u2019 Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of beanbag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an antigravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. (845) 758-7598, through Sept. 16. (Smith)\n SOL LEWITT: \u2018DRAWING SERIES ...\u2019 If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early \u201970s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)\nPublic Art\n MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, \u201cConjoined\u201d and \u201cDefunct,\u201d and a glacierlike boulder, \u201cErratic,\u201d by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is \u201cConjoined,\u201d a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other\u2019s end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio) \nLast Chance\n \u2018AUTOMATIC\u2019 Organized by the artist Chris Churchill, this lively exhibition crosses generations and styles to argue that the automatist drawings and rebellious attitudes of artists like Roberto Matta and Arshile Gorky were given figurative form by H. C. Westermann and Peter Saul and passed on to a younger generation that includes Jason Fox, Chloe Piene, David Korty and Taylor McKimens. Whatever. There is much to look at and a few notable outside-the-beltway entries, especially works by Isaac Lin, Fritz Welch and Joseph Ayers, who is represented by a giant graphite drawing of a giant whose legs bear an uncanny resemble to the forest he surveys. Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, franklinparrasch.com, closes tomorrow. (Smith)\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE\u2019 This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage, rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand\u2019s strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Grace Glueck)\n \u2605 COLBY BIRD AND JOSHUA FIELDS This two-person exhibition manages to look both like a one-person show and a group show. The works are disparate, rough around the edges and tilted a little too steeply toward the boys-will-be-boys end of the spectrum. Mr. Bird\u2019s sculptures include a refrigerator precariously packed with malt liquor and a kind of maw made of fluorescent lights and ceiling tile. Mr. Fields focuses on Kurt Cobain\u2019s suicide note; Chris Farley\u2019s birth and death certificates; various feats of urination; tumbleweed fenced inside a real barbed-wire fence; and, in the best work here, a fictional album titled \u201cSuicidal Tendencies.\u201d Two copies of it rotate on turntables on opposite sides of the gallery, making only scratching sounds and no discernible progress. There\u2019s plenty of serious intent, ingenuity and talent here, but the ideas are mostly received. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, crggallery.com, through next Friday. (Smith)\n\u2018CONCRETE WORKS\u2019 What sounds like a ready-mix formula for a summer show is actually an astute selection of works that highlight the currently popular grab-bag approach to art history and the age-old sleight-of-hand tactic that prompts viewers to wonder how artists fabricate their works. Some of the pieces create conversations about abstraction and process that span decades. Lucy McKenzie\u2019s gray-scale chalk and charcoal work on paper nods to Mondrian and Max Ernst; Walead Beshty\u2019s photographs hang across the room from two fuzzy Laszlo Moholy-Nagy photographs; and a surprising pairing of Albert Oehlen with Man Ray centers on a \u201cdiscussion\u201d of Pollock\u2019s drip process. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, closes today. (Schwendener)\nCOOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006\u2019 Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever- expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu, closes on Sunday. (Smith) \n \u2605 \u2018CREATIVE GROWTH\u2019 The talent just about jumps off the wall in this show of work by nine disabled adults who attend the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, Calif. The sensibilities might be divided between those who emphasize order and concentrated forms and those whose dispersed patterns or lines vibrate in time with the chaos of the universe. But either way their efforts, which include painting, drawing and sculpture, mesmerize. Gavin Brown\u2019s Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, gavinbrown.biz, closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n\u2605 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: \u2018PREIS BILDER\u2019 Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn\u2019t get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, closes today. (Smith) \n \u2605 LOU LAURITA: \u2018THERE\u2019S A PARTY GOING ON\u2019 Art and language are one and the same in Lou Laurita\u2019s large gouache paintings, which mix images from coloring books, pornography and 19th-century botanicals with words lifted from song lyrics and personal profiles found on the Internet. The interweaving of elements is ingenious enough to yield several levels of reading \u2014 all the words and images spell out larger words \u2014 but the work moves beyond cleverness to convey yearning, rage and melancholy, usually simultaneously. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224, closes Thursday. (Cotter)\nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,\u2019. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures \u2014 and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella\u2019s importance as an artist. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Smith)\n \u2018NEW ECONOMY\u2019 This has been a busy year for Jo\u00e3o Ribas, who became a curator at the Drawing Center and now has organized \u201cNew Economy,\u201d a show that looks at art practices in the global information economy. As you might expect, the Internet is addressed, but old-economy titans like Karl Marx and Adam Smith get some play too. Over all, however, the show\u2019s premise feels somewhat dated. Mr. Ribas also has a weakness for the kind of critical-theory jargon that peaked a decade or two ago, quoting Peter Drucker\u2019s 1994 book, \u201cPost-Capitalist Society,\u201d and following that up with a description of the \u201cpostindustrial economic order\u201d as a \u201cknowledge-driven form of post-Fordist capitalism.\u201d Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3970, artistspace.org, closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)\n \u2605 \u2018NOT YOUR PARENTS\u2019 MTV: MUSIC VIDEOS FROM HELL\u2019 The six artists and artist teams included in this show do creative things with the music video form, but the most energetically demonic is Kenneth Tin-Kin Hung\u2019s \u201cBecause Washington Is Hollywood for Ugly People.\u201d A hilarious portrayal of the nation\u2019s current, disastrous leadership set to the music of MC Paul Barman, it adds very sharp teeth and a bit of scatology to the hot colors and dense collages of 1960s psychedelia. Although Mr. Hung has a well-known Web site (tinkin.com), this is the first time his work has been exhibited in New York. Don\u2019t miss it. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 7277-3323, postmastersart.com, closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n SARAH PETERS In an impressive first show, this artist revisits several pictorial conventions of colonial America \u2014 the portrait, the mourning picture and the landscape \u2014 with antic results. Her weapon of choice is black ballpoint pen backed by pencil, deployed in a fidgety yet gossamer cross-hatch style whose precedents include Edward Gorey and the early work of Jim Nutt and Sue Williams. Winkleman Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 643-3152, winkleman.com, closes today. (Smith)\n  \u2018STRANGE MAGIC\u2019 The camera-based art of Liz Deschenes, Anne Collier, Amy Granat, Eileen Quinlan and Sara VanDerBeek has found that there are all sorts of new tricks to be conjured inside the triangle defined by the 1980s practices of photo appropriation, rephotography and setup photography. That all the artists are women harks back to the breakthroughs of the late 1970s, when numerous women used the camera to reimagine Conceptual Art. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9100, luhringaugustine.com, closes tomorrow. (Smith)\nCHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: \u2018ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY\u2019 The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film\u2019s \u201cfourth wall\u201d by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet.\u201d Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters\u2019s \u201cMerzbau\u201d to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of overreaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch\u2019s. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, closes on Sunday. (Schwendener) \n  \u2018YOU ALWAYS MOVE IN REVERSE\u2019 Bjarne Melgaard, who had a memorably assaultive solo at the late, lamented Alleged Gallery in Chelsea a few years ago, says that he conceived this group show as a swipe at the \u201cteenage rebellion thing.\u201d He enlisted some good artists to press his point, among them Jason Dodge, Richard Hawkins, Jeff Ono and B. Wutz. But the occasion is mainly notable for marking the return of Lydia Lunch, a true-blue rebel, whose one-time-only performance in the gallery surely outshone the photographs by her in the show. Leo Koenig, 545 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 334-9255, leokoenig.com, closes on Tuesday. (Cotter)",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \n\u2018E PLURIBUS VENOM\u2019 The paradox of well-heeled and wealthy art collectors fawning over rebellious street art is apparent everywhere in the art world. The graffiti artist known as Banksy is the toast of London, while Shepard Fairey is approaching cult status in Los Angeles for his posters and stickers of the face of the professional wrestler Andre the Giant with the word \u201cobey\u201d emblazoned across them. Mr. Fairey, 37, is now having his first major New York gallery exhibition, split between the Jonathan LeVine Gallery in Chelsea and a rented 6,600-square-foot warehouse exhibition space in Brooklyn for huge graffiti installations and murals. (Last week\u2019s opening in Brooklyn was disrupted by a man trying to set off an incendiary device.) There are about 80 works between the two sites, together forming a comprehensive, 20-year survey of his artwork in various mediums: screen prints, stencils, stickers, album covers, collage, spray paint and more. Despite the range of mediums and styles, the imagery comes off as generic, combining decorative elements with political metaphors, like an image of a couple cuddling a bomb. (Right is \u201cWar for Sale.\u201d) It\u2019s Norman Rockwell crossed with the Dead Kennedys crossed with Communist-era propaganda. References to capitalism and war predominate, especially in the Chelsea show, where many works are neatly framed and ready for sale. It is tempting to see this stuff as just another luxury commodity. (Jonathan LeVine Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, ninth floor, 212-243-3822, jonathanlevinegallery.com, through July 21; 81 Front Street, at Washington Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, through July 6.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n? AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: \u2018THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n? AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)\n BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand\u2019s strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)\nCOOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count.

(Smith)\n GREY ART GALLERY: \u2018BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O\u2019DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND,\u2019 through July 14. Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O\u2019Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It\u2019s a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today\u2019s most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart/. (Bridget L. Goodbody)\nGUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,\u2019 through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat\u2019s invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)\n? INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,\u2019 through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work\u2019s laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n? INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)\nTHE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: \u2018NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)\nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling \u201cdrew the line\u201d at C\u00e9zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso \u201cbad painters and fakers.\u201d Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting \u2014 and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nTHE MET: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck) \n THE MET: \u2018HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,\u2019 through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum\u2019s collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: \u201cThe question is not what you look at but what you see.\u201d Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans\u2019s late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore\u2019s landscapes and Rachel Harrison\u2019s photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show \u2014 only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms \u2014 it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Schwendener)\n* THE MET: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (See above.) (Smith)\n ? THE MET: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter)\n ? THE MET: NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA, through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter\u2019s mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic, 19th-century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch\u2019s talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)\n? THE MET: \u2018POIRET: KING OF FASHION,\u2019 through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) \u201cDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition \u2014 the latest effort from the Met\u2019s esteemed Costume Institute \u2014 does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith)\n* THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck)\nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,\u2019 through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures \u2014 and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella\u2019s importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)\nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)\n* THE MET: \u2018VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,\u2019 through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice , the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Cotter)\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,\u2019 through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His \u201cTorqued Ellipses\u201d and \u201cTorqued Toruses\u201d and other recent works like \u201cBand\u201d and \u201cSequence\u201d have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That\u2019s about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)\nMUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,\u2019 through Sept. 4. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York\u2019s work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Goodbody)\nNEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro-slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Edward Rothstein)\nWADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, \u2018WHERE WERE WE,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,\u2019 through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein\u2019s brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein\u2019s taste clearly hasn\u2019t won the day, but it\u2019s never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)\n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,\u2019 through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) \nGalleries: SoHo\nPETER FISCHLI AND DAVIS WEISS: BOOKS, EDITIONS AND THE LIKE Drawn primarily from the artists\u2019 archives, and including posters, multiples, books and layouts of books as well as videos \u2014 among them \u201cThe Way Things Go,\u201d their great chain-reaction-in-a-studio \u2014 this exhibition amounts to a rather complete if highly distilled retrospective of their consistently down-to-earth Duchampian view of life and art. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, through July 14. (Smith)\n? \u2018GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE\u2019 The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called \u201cdrawings without paper\u201d: semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they\u2019re out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego\u2019s art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) \nGalleries: Other\n? MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: \u2018PREIS BILDER\u2019 Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn\u2019t get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) \n SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES ...  If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early \u201970s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, through Sept. 10. (Smith)\n CHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: \u2018ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY\u2019 The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film\u2019s \u201cfourth wall\u201d by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet.\u201d Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters\u2019s \u201cMerzbau\u201d to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch\u2019s. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener) \nPublic Art\nMAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures \u2014 \u201cConjoined\u201d and \u201cDefunct\u201d \u2014 and a glacierlike boulder, \u201cErratic,\u201d by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is \u201cConjoined,\u201d a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin, and the other\u2019s end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, www.madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio)\nLast Chance\n ? BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018GLOBAL FEMINISMS\u2019 Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn\u2019t venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago\u2019s indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn\u2019t keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)\n * FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: PORTRAITS The works in this show reveal Mr. Clemente\u2019s relatively recent endeavors as a suave society portraitist, working on commission in single, daylong sittings. His subjects, while horizontal, don\u2019t so much recline as float toward the picture plane, surveying us with enormous eyes. The images can border on illustration, but sometimes color, space and personality collude to enchanting effect. Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 752-2929; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\nPETER FISCHLI AND DAVID WEISS: EQUILIBRES These photographs of ingenious balancing acts orchestrated from a host of everyday objects and detritus may be 20 years old, but they look as subversive and art-historically savvy as ever. Seeing them (about 80) in bulk underscores the artists\u2019 ability to create small universes out of next to nothing. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n \u2018IN DEFENSE OF ARDOR\u2019 For most of the 2000s, art pundits have campaigned to replace kvetchy postmodernism with a New Sincerity. By why an either/or proposition? Can\u2019t irony be ardent? Can\u2019t ardor be critically self-aware? Can\u2019t passion and reason coexist? In this group show they often do. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, Chelsea, (212) 929-5959, bellwethergallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n? NEUE GALERIE: \u2018VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,\u2019 The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show\u2019s most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: \u201cSelf-Portrait With Straw Hat\u201d (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery\u2019s vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh\u2019s \u201cBedroom\u201d from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele\u2019s obvious homage, \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Bedroom in Neulengbach,\u201d painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org; closes on Monday. (Schwendener) \nMARC QUINN: \u2018SPHINX\u2019 This amusing, if somewhat disturbing, show presents Kate Moss as equal parts classical Greek sculpture, yoga devotee and SuperModel. It strikes a particularly contemporary chord in the way it addresses contemporary society\u2019s obsession with looking good and its confusion about how to get the inside (feelings, spirit, thoughts) to match the outside. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Goodbody)\n THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL,\u2019  This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world\u2019s latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi\u2019s \u201cEndless Column\u201d as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Goodbody)\nRICHARD TUTTLE: \u2018MEMORY COMES FROM DARK EXTENSION\u2019 There is a poetic vision running through this show, resulting in artworks that look both beautiful and intriguing. Each of the approximately 60 small relief constructions is made from simple materials and affixed to the wall with a miniature brace that projects it forward. From a distance, they seem to be floating like so many pieces of space debris. But linking them is a consistent technique: geometric shapes are cut from paper, folded in unusual ways, painted and then combined intuitively with other elements to create objects governed only by the limits of the artist\u2019s imagination. Neither labored nor facile, they have grace, humility and dainty poetic detail that elicit depths of pleasure. This is an inspiring, memorable show.

    "text": "A Dishonorable Affair\n2007-09-23T04:00:00.000Z\nThe struggle, if there was any, would have been very brief.\nFawaz later recalled that his wife, Zahra, was sleeping soundly on her side and curled slightly against the pillow when he rose at dawn and readied himself for work at his construction job on the outskirts of Damascus. It was a rainy Sunday morning in January and very cold; as he left, Fawaz turned back one last time to tuck the blanket more snugly around his 16-year-old wife. Zahra slept on without stirring, and her husband locked the door of their tiny apartment carefully behind him.\nZahra was most likely still sleeping when her older brother, Fayyez, entered the apartment a short time later, using a stolen key and carrying a dagger. His sister lay on the carpeted floor, on the thin, foam mattress she shared with her husband, so Fayyez must have had to kneel next to Zahra as he raised the dagger and stabbed her five times in the head and back: brutal, tearing thrusts that shattered the base of her skull and nearly severed her spinal column. Leaving the door open, Fayyez walked downstairs and out to the local police station. There, he reportedly turned himself in, telling the officers on duty that he had killed his sister in order to remove the dishonor she had brought on the family by losing her virginity out of wedlock nearly 10 months earlier.\n\u201cFayyez told the police, \u2018It is my right to correct this error,\u2019 \u201d Maha Ali, a Syrian lawyer who knew Zahra and now works pro bono for her husband, told me not long ago. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s true that my sister is married now, but we never washed away the shame.\u2019 \u201d\nBy now, almost anyone in Syria who follows the news can supply certain basic details about Zahra al-Azzo\u2019s life and death: how the girl, then only 15, was kidnapped in the spring of 2006 near her home in northern Syria, taken to Damascus by her abductor and raped; how the police who discovered her feared that her family, as commonly happens in Syria, would blame Zahra for the rape and kill her; how these authorities then placed Zahra in a prison for girls, believing it the only way to protect her from her relatives. And then in December, how a cousin of Zahra\u2019s, 27-year-old Fawaz, agreed to marry her in order to secure her release and also, he hoped, restore her reputation in the eyes of her family; how, just a month after her wedding to Fawaz, Zahra\u2019s 25-year-old brother, Fayyez, stabbed her as she slept.\nZahra died from her wounds at the hospital the following morning, one of about 300 girls and women who die each year in Syria in so-called honor killings, according to estimates by women\u2019s rights advocates there. In Syria and other Arab countries, many men are brought up to believe in an idea of personal honor that regards defending the chastity of their sisters, their daughters and other women in the family as a primary social obligation. Honor crimes tend to occur, activists say, when men feel pressed by their communities to demonstrate that they are sufficiently protective of their female relatives\u2019 virtue. Pairs of lovers are sometimes killed together, but most frequently only the women are singled out for punishment. Sometimes women are killed for the mere suspicion of an affair, or on account of a false accusation, or because they were sexually abused, or because, like Zahra, they were raped.\nIn speaking with the police, Zahra\u2019s brother used a colloquial expression, ghasalat al arr (washing away the shame), which means the killing of a woman or girl whose very life has come to be seen as an unbearable stain on the honor of her male relatives. Once this kind of familial sexual shame has been \u201cwashed,\u201d the killing is traditionally forgotten as quickly as possible. Under Syrian law, an honor killing is not murder, and the man who commits it is not a murderer. As in many other Arab countries, even if the killer is convicted on the lesser charge of a \u201ccrime of honor,\u201d he is usually set free within months. Mentioning the killing \u2014 or even the name of the victim \u2014 generally becomes taboo.\nThat this has not happened with Zahra\u2019s story \u2014 that her case, far from being ignored, has become something of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, a rallying point for lawyers, Islamic scholars and Syrian officials hoping to change the laws that protect the perpetrators of honor crimes \u2014 is a result of a peculiar confluence of circumstances. It is due in part to the efforts of a group of women\u2019s rights activists and in part to the specifics of her story, which has galvanized public sympathy in a way previously unseen in Syria. But at heart it is because of Zahra\u2019s young widower, Fawaz, who had spoken to his bride only once before they became engaged. Now, defying his tribe and their traditions, he has brought a civil lawsuit against Zahra\u2019s killer and is refusing to let her case be forgotten.\nNashweh, where Zahra al-Azzo was born in 1990, is the sort of Syrian town that seems literally to crumble at its edges \u2014 its squat cinder-block houses giving way to heaps of decaying construction materials, then to stubbly wheat fields strewn with garbage. The quantities of laundry drying on wires strung above the houses suggest vast extended families. Nashweh is small enough and remote enough that if a stranger steps out of a car, it is a matter of seconds before a troupe of small boys wearing dirty galabias circles round and begins shouting invitations home for tea. Before last year Zahra had spent her entire life there, but recently, when asked if they had known her, a half-dozen town women \u2014 uniformly dressed in head scarves and thin velour house dresses, most over 40 with blue Bedouin facial tattoos \u2014 simply looked away.\nBy local standards, the circumstances of Zahra\u2019s life in Nashweh were perfectly ordinary. In her early childhood the family earned a good living raising Arabian horses, but the Azzos had lately fallen on hard times, and Zahra\u2019s father, according to social workers who talked to Zahra in prison, was rumored to be having an affair.\nAccording to the lawyer Maha Ali, who met Zahra in prison, Zahra first heard the rumors from a friend of her father\u2019s. The man threatened Zahra, telling her that he would reveal the scandal if she didn\u2019t join him outside her house, itself a grave transgression in her conservative society. That Zahra did so, disobeying her family and going out with a man unaccompanied, even under duress, is so scandalous to many Syrians that advocates working on Zahra\u2019s case have tried to obscure this fact, preferring to describe what took place as a simple kidnapping. They also say that at 15 she was na\u00efve in the extreme, so young for her age that she took a teddy bear to bed every night in prison.\nZahra was frightened by the man but apparently believed that if she came out with him, briefly, she could ensure her family\u2019s reputation and safety. Instead, says Yumin Abu al-Hosn, a social worker at the prison, she was taken to Damascus, held in an apartment and raped. Terrified, in a strange and crowded city she had never visited, Zahra didn\u2019t try to run away. She was in the capital with the man for about a week when a tip from a neighbor took the police to the door. The man was taken to jail, where he now awaits trial for kidnapping and rape. Zahra, meanwhile, was taken to a police station for a so-called virginity exam, the hymen examination that, however unreliable at establishing virginity, is standard procedure in Syria in rape cases and common when women are taken into police custody.\nIn the United States, a whitewashed, heavily guarded building like the one where Zahra was then sent for her protection would probably be called a juvenile-detention center, but Arabic offers no such euphemism, so the words for \u201cprison\u201d or \u201cinstitution\u201d are used. Syria does not have shelters where girls or women can go if they are threatened with honor killing; instead, minors are often placed in girls\u2019 prisons for their protection. Like many of the teenagers who arrive there, Zahra felt humiliated at having gone through the forcible genital examination and tried at first for a show of defiance, according to Maha Ali. \u201cI came in and met Zahra,\u201d Ali said. \u201cAnd she just looked at me and said, \u2018God, do I have to tell the story all over again?\u2019 \u201d\nFor girls like Zahra, prison is only a temporary solution. Even the most murderously inclined families often issue emotional court appeals to have their daughters returned to them. Judges usually try to extract sworn statements from male guardians, promises that the girls, if released, will not be harmed. But those promises are often broken.\nAmong Syria\u2019s so-called tribal families \u2014 settled Bedouin clans like the one that Zahra belonged to \u2014 first-cousin marriage is common. So it wasn\u2019t a shock when her family, looking for someone who could marry her while she was in prison and help secure her release, turned to one of her cousins, Fawaz. But Fawaz hadn\u2019t intended to marry a cousin, he told me recently, and was startled when Zahra\u2019s brother Fayyez showed up one day at his home.\n\u201cFayyez started telling us that his sister, Zahra, had been kidnapped,\u201d said Fawaz\u2019s mother, who is usually addressed by the honorific Umm Fawaz, meaning \u201cmother of Fawaz.\u201d She was sitting cross-legged, along with her son and husband, in the front room of the family apartment outside Damascus. The shades were pulled down to keep out the searing late spring heat, and the room was lighted by a single fluorescent tube. Umm Fawaz pointed out the place on the cushions \u2014 arranged, Arab-style, on the floor against the walls \u2014 where Fayyez had sat.\nThe mere fact that Zahra had been taken from her home for a few days signaled dishonor for the family. \u201c \u2018Oh, Auntie, I don\u2019t know what to say,\u2019 \u201d Umm Fawaz recalled Fayyez saying as she adjusted her hijab with one hand and dabbed her eyes with a tissue in the other. \u201cI said: \u2018Don\u2019t be ashamed for your sister. Even in the best families, something like this can happen.\u2019 \u201d Fayyez claimed that despite having been kidnapped, his sister was still a virgin. Slowly, he broached the subject he had come to discuss. Would Fawaz consider marrying Zahra in order to secure her release?\nAt first, Fawaz, a shy, wiry man, politely demurred. He felt sorry for Fayyez, he told me, but he couldn\u2019t help recoiling a little at the story, which in his community constitutes an ugly sexual scandal. Besides, he was already engaged to another girl. After Fayyez left, though, Fawaz and his mother talked over Zahra\u2019s situation. \u201cWe decided to visit the girl, just to see,\u201d Umm Fawaz said. And so several days later the two of them took a taxi to the girls\u2019 prison. They walked past a heavy steel gate, and a guard led them to an office.\nFawaz smiled as he recalled the moment Zahra was brought in. It would be indelicate for him to comment on Zahra\u2019s appearance, so it was Umm Fawaz who talked about Zahra\u2019s beauty (\u201cAs lovely as Sibel Can!\u201d she exclaimed, mentioning a Turkish singer popular in the Arab world).\n\u201cI liked the girl,\u201d said Fawaz, who seemed embarrassed to have admitted such a personal thing in public, and he quickly corrected himself. \u201cI mean, here we fall in love with a girl after we marry her. But I decided to leave my fianc\u00e9e for Zahra. I felt that a normal girl like my fianc\u00e9e would have other chances. With Zahra I thought, my God, she\u2019s such a child to be stuck in this prison.\u201d\nFawaz\u2019s father disapproved, suspecting from the outset that Zahra\u2019s family would kill her once she left prison. But when, months later, Zahra\u2019s family begged the other family to reconsider, Fawaz\u2019s father relented, and Fawaz eventually accompanied Zahra\u2019s father to court to sign her release papers. Zahra and Fawaz were married in a civil ceremony at the prison on Dec. 11, 2006, and then a week later in a formal celebration for the neighborhood, held in the bride\u2019s new home. The few photographs of the wedding were taken with cellphones, so the prints have a blurry, ephemeral quality. In them, Zahra looks stunned and a bit sulky, her hair teased high on her head, her childish features thickly coated with foundation, shocking pink eye shadow and frosted lipstick.\nThe marriage, by all accounts, was happy. \u201cZahra used to call me even after her wedding,\u201d Ali, the lawyer, recalled. \u201c \u2018How is Fawaz?\u2019 I\u2019d ask her. And she\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, Auntie Maha, we\u2019re spending all night up together, talking and having fun.\u2019 Once, her aunt called me. She said: \u2018Don\u2019t tell Zahra I called, but can you talk to her? You have influence on her. Fawaz can\u2019t get up for work because Zahra keeps him up all night.\u2019 \u201d\nFawaz told me that, according to his interpretation of Islam, he was \u201chonoring Zahra again\u201d \u2014 restoring her lost virtue \u2014 by marrying her. In this decision he was supported by his sheik, or religious teacher, who according to Fawaz subscribes to a progressive school of Koranic interpretation. Fawaz and his immediate family, though not well educated, are proud of their open-mindedness, and he boasts about Zahra\u2019s intelligence and literacy. Even so, he and the family rebuffed Zahra\u2019s efforts to describe her ordeal to them, so that to this day they know the details only secondhand. \u201cSo many times, when we were married, she wanted to talk to me about what had happened to her,\u201d Fawaz said. \u201cBut I refused. I told her, \u2018Your past is your past.\u2019 \u201d\nAccording to Fawaz, Zahra had been married just five weeks when her brother, Fayyez, arrived on an unannounced visit, saying he planned to look for work in Damascus. Zahra was happy to see her brother, but Fawaz described feeling painfully torn between his duties to hospitality, a cardinal virtue in Bedouin culture, and his feeling that Fayyez \u2014 sleeping just upstairs in Fawaz\u2019s parents\u2019 apartment \u2014 was a danger to his wife. On the morning Zahra was attacked, Fawaz recalls going upstairs before leaving for work to find Fayyez awake and tapping nervously at his cellphone.\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t afford to have a mobile,\u201d Fawaz said. \u201cI\u2019d been wondering about that. It turned out that his uncle had given him the phone so that he could call and tell the family that he\u2019d killed his sister. We learned later that they had a party that night to celebrate the cleansing of their honor. The whole village was invited.\u201d\nMost honor killings receive only brief mention in Syrian newspapers, but Zahra al-Azzo\u2019s death has been unlike any other. Dozens of articles and television programs have discussed her story at length, fueling an unprecedented public conversation about the roots and morality of honor crimes.\nIn May, hoping to gauge public feeling about Zahra\u2019s case, I spent a couple of hours walking around a crowded lower-middle-class neighborhood in Damascus. In the wealthiest areas of the city, half the people on the streets might be female, but here, in the late evening, there were very few women to be found. In shawarma sandwich shops and juice stalls, most men had heard of Zahra, but more than half of them believed that the practice of honor killing is protected \u2014 or outright required \u2014 by Islamic law. A man named Abu Rajab, who ran a cigarette stall, described it as \u201csomething that is found in religion\u201d and added that even if the laws were changed, \u201ca man will kill his sister if he needs to, even if it means 15 years in prison.\u201d\nYet the notion that Islam condones honor killing is a misconception, according to some lawyers and a few prominent Islamic scholars. Daad Mousa, a Syrian women\u2019s rights advocate and lawyer, told me that though beliefs about cleansing a man\u2019s honor derive from Bedouin tradition, the three Syrian laws used to pardon men who commit honor crimes can be traced back not to Islamic law but to the law codes, based on the Napoleonic code, that were imposed in the Levant during the French mandate. \u201cArticle 192 states that if a man commits a crime with an \u2018honorable motive,\u2019 he will go free,\u201d Mousa said. \u201cIn Western countries this law usually applies in cases where doctors kill their patients accidentally, intending to save them, but here the idea of \u2018honorable motive\u2019 is often expanded to include men who are seen as acting in defense of their honor.\n\u201cArticle 242 refers to crimes of passion,\u201d Mousa continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s Article 548 that we\u2019re really up against. Article 548 states precisely that if a man witnesses a female relative in an immoral act and kills her, he will go free.\u201d Judges frequently interpret these laws so loosely that a premeditated killing \u2014 like the one Fayyez is accused of \u2014 is often judged a \u201ccrime of passion\u201d; \u201cwitnessing\u201d a female relative\u2019s behavior is sometimes defined as hearing neighborhood gossip about it; and for a woman, merely speaking to a man may be ruled an \u201cimmoral act.\u201d Syria, which has been governed since 1963 by a secular Baathist regime, has a strong reputation in the region for sex equality; women graduate from high schools and universities in numbers roughly equal to men, and they frequently hold influential positions as doctors, professors and even government ministers. But in the family, a different standard applies. \u201cHonor here means only one thing: women, and especially the sexual life of women,\u201d Mousa said. The decision to carry out an honor killing is usually made by the family as a group, and an under-age boy is often nominated to carry out the task, to eliminate even the smallest risk of a prison sentence.\nSome advocates claim that Syria has an especially high number of honor killings per capita, saying that the country is second or third in the world. In fact, reliable statistics on honor killing are nearly impossible to come by. The United Nations Population Fund says that about 5,000 honor killings take place each year around the world, but since they often occur in rural areas where births and deaths go unreported, it is very difficult to count them by country. Some killings have been recorded in European cultures, including Italy, and in Christian or Druse communities in predominantly Muslim countries. But it is widely agreed that honor killings are found disproportionately in Muslim communities, from Bangladesh to Egypt to Great Britain.\nThe Grand Mufti Ahmad Badr Eddin Hassoun, Syria\u2019s highest-ranking Islamic teacher, has condemned honor killing and Article 548 in unequivocal terms. Earlier this year, when we met for a rare interview in his spacious office on the 10th floor of Syria\u2019s ministry of religious endowments, he told me, \u201cIt happens sometimes that a misogynistic religious scholar will argue that women are the source of all kinds of evil.\u201d In fact, he said, the Koran does not differentiate between women and men in its moral laws, requiring sexual chastity of both, for example. The commonly held view that Article 548 is derived from Islamic law, he said, is false.\nWith his tightly wound white turban and giant pearl ring, the grand mufti is one of Syria\u2019s most recognizable public figures. He is a charismatic and generally popular sheik, but because he is appointed by the state, many Syrians believe that his views reflect those of the ruling party, and they may find his teachings suspect as a result. In downtown Damascus, one man I interviewed on the street declared that the grand mufti was not a \u201creal Muslim\u201d if he believed in canceling Article 548. \u201cIt\u2019s an Islamic law to kill your relative if she errs,\u201d said the man, who gave his name as Ahmed and said that he learned of Zahra\u2019s story on Syrian television. \u201cIf the sheik tries to fight this, the people will rise up and slit his throat.\u201d\nThere are religious figures who defend the status quo. At a conference on honor killing held this year at Damascus University, Mohammed Said Ramadan al-Bouti, one of Syria\u2019s most esteemed clerics, maintained that the laws should not be changed, defending them on the principle in Shariah law that people who kill in defense of their property should be treated with lenience (he is believed to have moderated his stance since). When, at an earlier conference, the grand mufti announced that he didn\u2019t believe protecting a woman\u2019s virginity was the most important component of honor, many attendees were upset. In response, a group of about a dozen women, all dressed in the long black abayas that in Syria are usually worn by only very conservative women, walked out of the room.\nIn our interview, the grand mufti told me that he believed Article 548 would be struck down by the Syrian Parliament within months, and given his government ties he might be expected to know. Still, women\u2019s rights advocates are not so optimistic. They point out that Syria\u2019s educated elites have long opposed honor killing, though there is often a squeamishness about discussing a practice that is embarrassing to them. They say that some conservative Syrians are having second thoughts about the custom thanks to the efforts of their Islamic teachers, but that their numbers are small.\nBassam al-Kadi, a women\u2019s advocate, told me that Zahra\u2019s case made an ideal rallying point. \u201cWe have hundreds of Zahras,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are some stories that you can campaign with, and others that you can\u2019t.\u201d Zahra, in other words \u2014 extremely young, a victim of rape, married at the time she was killed \u2014 makes a sympathetic figure for a broad Syrian public in a way that, say, someone older who was killed after being seen with her boyfriend in a cafe might not.\nWith tensions like these in play, Syrian women\u2019s advocates are careful to phrase their criticisms of tribal traditions of honor and Article 548 in Islamic terms. Though some will privately admit that they are secularists, even feminists, they keep it quiet. It would be politically impossible to suggest in public, for example, that women have the right to choose their sexual partners. The basic culture of chastity is in no way being publicly rethought. Some advocates say that their cause is damaged if they are perceived as sympathetic to \u201cWestern values,\u201d and even that honor killing is seen by some conservatives as a bulwark against those values. Where 15 years ago Syria banned the import of fax machines and modems, today the Internet is widely accessible. \u201cThere\u2019s been a very complicated reaction to the new availability of Western media in this part of the world,\u201d Kadi, the women\u2019s rights advocate, explained. \u201cWe\u2019re going through a transition, and our values are changing dramatically.\n\u201cOur parents tell us that there was an earlier day when honor meant that you were honorable in your work, that you didn\u2019t take bribes, for example,\u201d Kadi said. \u201cBut now, the political and economic situation is so bad that some degree of corruption is necessary to survive. People will say that you\u2019re a good earner for your family; they won\u2019t blame you. Historically speaking, all our other ideologies have collapsed. No one talks about loyalty to country, about professional honor. Now it\u2019s just the family, the tribe, the woman. That\u2019s the only kind of honor we have left.\u201d\nSyrian activists say that while many in government would like to see Article 548 changed, the government, which is led by a tiny religious minority, the Alawites, may be afraid to risk offending the more conservative elements of Syria\u2019s Sunni majority. In other parts of the Middle East, too, tensions between ruling elites and religious conservatives have complicated efforts to combat honor killing. Rana Husseini, a Jordanian women\u2019s advocate, told me that though an effort to establish harsher punishments for men who kill female relatives received support from members of the royal family, Jordan\u2019s Parliament rejected the law in 2003 after conservative groups opposed it. In Morocco, a campaign to stop honor killing resulted instead in a ruling that, if anything, endorsed the practice, by extending to women who kill in a fit of sexual jealousy the same protection under law that men had.\nYet there are signs of change. In Lebanon last month, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the top Shiite cleric and spiritual leader of Hezbollah, issued a fatwa banning honor killing and describing it as \u201ca repulsive act, condemned and prohibited by religion.\u201d And earlier this year, Egypt\u2019s grand mufti upheld a fatwa stating that Islam permits a woman to have her virginity \u201crefurbished\u201d through hymen surgery, which would allow her to marry and would eliminate the need to cleanse the so-called stain on her family\u2019s honor. He even appeared on national television to advise Egyptian women considering the procedure. Although the ruling has been assailed by conservative scholars, it has been welcomed by those who hope it will prevent future honor killings.\nIn Syria, activists say that the existence of a case like Zahra\u2019s \u2014 which has remained open in part because of the bad blood between Fawaz and Zahra\u2019s family \u2014 has proved essential to keeping up momentum in the campaign to change Article 548. The civil suit brought by Fawaz claims that Fayyez conspired to deceive him, and the existence of the civil case means that, under Syrian law, the criminal case is unlikely to be dropped as quickly as similar ones. Fayyez is in custody awaiting trial (no lawyer has been appointed for him yet), and if Zahra\u2019s death is ruled a murder rather than an honor crime, he could go to prison for 12 to 15 years. Activists say that penalty, whether or not Article 548 is struck down, would stand as a powerful warning to other would-be killers in the name of honor. Fawaz and his family are under enormous pressure from their tribe to drop the case. They have been in touch with Zahra\u2019s family members \u2014 who, they say, do not deny the crime, nor having celebrated it. Zahra\u2019s family has offered Fawaz money and another daughter to marry, he says, if he will abandon the lawsuit that is now the cause of so much public scrutiny.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big scandal now, in the whole neighborhood, the whole community,\u201d Fawaz said. \u201cI can\u2019t even have coffee now with my best friends, because they\u2019re afraid for their sisters.\u201d\nBut Fawaz told me that he didn\u2019t understand his own feelings about honor killing until Zahra\u2019s death, and that he hoped the publicity surrounding her case would help other men to re-evaluate theirs. \u201cIn Zahra\u2019s case, the girl was basically kidnapped,\u201d Fawaz said. \u201cIf she\u2019d been a bad girl, if she\u2019d decided to run away with a man, I\u2019d say, maybe. It\u2019s a brutal solution, but maybe.\u201d\nHis father broke in. \u201cEven then! When a girl does something wrong like that, especially a girl that young, I don\u2019t think that she is responsible. The family is responsible. The father is responsible. I don\u2019t want to give anyone excuses for murder.\u201d\nFawaz nodded. \u201cI start thinking about Zahra lying there, dying, and I don\u2019t think I can believe in that set of values any longer.\u201d ",

    "text": "A Good Provider Is One Who Leaves\n2007-04-22T04:00:00.000Z\nOn June 25, 1980 (a date he would remember), a good-natured Filipino pool-maintenance man gathered his wife and five children for an upsetting ride to the Manila airport. At 36, Emmet Comodas had lived a hard life without growing hardened, which was a mixed blessing given the indignities of his poverty. Orphaned at 8, raised on the Manila streets where he hawked cigarettes, he had hustled a job at a government sports complex and held it for nearly two decades. On the spectrum of Filipino poverty, that alone marked him as a man of modest fortune. But a monthly salary of $50 did not keep his family fed.\nHome was a one-room, scrap-wood shanty in a warren of alleys and stinking canals, hidden by the whitewashed walls of an Imelda Marcos beautification campaign. He had borrowed money at usurious rates to start a tiny store, which a thief had plundered. His greatest fears centered on his 11-year-old daughter, Rowena, who had a congenital heart defect that turned her lips blue and fingernails black and who needed care he could not afford. After years of worrying over her frail physique, Emmet dropped to his moldering floor and asked God for a decision: take her or let him have her.\nGod answered in a mysterious way. Not long after, Emmet\u2019s boss offered him a pool-cleaning job in Saudi Arabia. Emmet would make 10 times as much as he made in Manila. He would also live 4,500 miles from his family in an Islamic autocracy where stories of abused laborers were rife. He accepted on the spot. His wife, Tita, was afraid of the slum where she soon would be raising children alone, and she knew that overseas workers often had affairs. She also knew their kids ate better because of the money the workers sent home. She spent her last few pesos for admission to an airport lounge where she could wave at the vanishing jet, then went home to cry and wait.\nTwo years later, on Aug. 2, 1982 (another date he would remember), Emmet walked off the returning flight with chocolate for the kids, earrings for Tita and a bag of duty-free cigarettes, his loneliness abroad having made him a chain smoker. His 2-year-old son, Boyet, considered him a stranger and cried at his touch, though as Emmet later said, \u201cI was too happy to be sad.\u201d He gave himself a party, replaced the shanty\u2019s rotted walls and put on a new roof. Then after three months at home, he left for Saudi Arabia again. And again. And again and again: by the time Emmet ended the cycle and came home for good, he had been gone for nearly two decades. Boyet was grown.\nDeprived of their father while sustained by his wages, the Comodas children spent their early lives studying Emmet\u2019s example. Now they have copied it. All five of them, including Rowena, grew up to become overseas workers. Four are still working abroad. And the middle child, Rosalie \u2014 a nurse in Abu Dhabi \u2014 faces a parallel to her father\u2019s life that she finds all too exact. She has an 18-month-old back in the Philippines who views her as a stranger and resists her touch. What started as Emmet\u2019s act of desperation has become his children\u2019s way of life: leaving in order to live.\nAbout 200 million migrants from different countries are scattered across the globe, supporting a population back home that is as big if not bigger. Were these half-billion or so people to constitute a state \u2014 migration nation \u2014 it would rank as the world\u2019s third-largest. While some migrants go abroad with Ph.D.\u2019s, most travel as Emmet did, with modest skills but fearsome motivation. The risks migrants face are widely known, including the risk of death, but the amounts they secure for their families have just recently come into view. Migrants worldwide sent home an estimated $300 billion last year \u2014 nearly three times the world\u2019s foreign-aid budgets combined. These sums \u2014 \u201cremittances\u201d \u2014 bring Morocco more money than tourism does. They bring Sri Lanka more money than tea does.\nThe numbers, which have doubled in the past five years, have riveted the attention of development experts who once paid them little mind. One study after another has examined how private money, in the form of remittances, might serve the public good. A growing number of economists see migrants, and the money they send home, as a part of the solution to global poverty. \nYet competing with the literature of gain is a parallel literature of loss. About half the world\u2019s migrants are women, many of whom care for children abroad while leaving their own children home. \u201cYour loved ones across that ocean . . . ,\u201d Nadine Sarreal, a Filipina poet in Singapore, warns: \nWill sit at breakfast and try not to gaze\nWhere you would sit at the table.\nMeals now divided by five\nInstead of six, don\u2019t feed an emptiness.\nEarlier waves of globalization, the movement of money and goods, were shaped by mediating institutions and protocols. The International Monetary Fund regulates finance. The World Trade Organization regularizes trade. The movement of people \u2014 the most intimate form of globalization \u2014 is the one with the fewest rules. There is no \u201cWorld Migration Organization\u201d to monitor the migrants\u2019 fate. A Kurd gaining asylum in Sweden can have his children taught school in their mother tongue, while a Filipino bringing a Bible into Riyadh risks being expelled. \nThe growth in migration has roiled the West, but demographic logic suggests it will only continue. Aging industrial economies need workers. People in poor countries need jobs. Transportation and communication have made moving easier. And the potential economic gains are at record highs. A Central American laborer who moves to the United States can expect to multiply his earnings about six times after adjusting for the higher cost of living. That is a pay raise about twice as large as the one that propelled the last great wave of immigration a century ago.\nWith about one Filipino worker in seven abroad at any given time, migration is to the Philippines what cars once were to Detroit: its civil religion. A million Overseas Filipino Workers \u2014 O.F.W.\u2019s \u2014 left last year, enough to fill six 747s a day. Nearly half the country\u2019s 10-to-12-year-olds say they have thought about whether to go. Television novellas plumb the migrants\u2019 loneliness. Politicians court their votes. Real estate salesmen bury them in condominium brochures. Drive by the Central Bank during the holiday season, and you will find a high-rise graph of the year\u2019s remittances strung up in Christmas lights. \nAcross the archipelago, stories of rags to riches compete with stories of rags to rags. New malls define the landscape; so do left-behind kids. Gain and loss are so thoroughly joined that the logo of the migrant welfare agency shows the sun doing battle with the rain. Local idiom stresses the uncertainty of the migrant\u2019s lot. An O.F.W. does not say he is off to make his fortune. He says, \u201cI am going to try my luck.\u201d\nA kilometer of crimson stretched across the Manila airport, awaiting a planeload of returning workers and the president who would greet them. The V.I.P. lounge hummed with marketing schemes aimed at migrants and their families. Globe Telecom had got its name on the security guards\u2019 vests. A Microsoft rep had flown in from the States with a prototype of an Internet phone. An executive from Philam Insurance noted that overseas workers buy one of every five new policies. Sirens disrupted the finger food, and a motorcade delivered the diminutive head of state, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who once a year offers rice cakes and red carpet to those she calls \u201cmodern heroes.\u201d\nBleary from the eight-hour flight, a few hundred workers from Abu Dhabi swapped puzzled looks for presidential handshakes on their way to baggage claim. Roderick de Guzman, a young car porter, took home the day\u2019s grand prize, a \u201clivelihood package\u201d that included a jeepney, life insurance, $1,000 and a karaoke machine. Too dazed to smile, he held an oversize sweepstakes check while the prize\u2019s sponsors and the president beamed at his side and a squad of news photographers fired away. When it comes to O.F.W.\u2019s, politics and business speak with one voice. Message: We Care.\nOn the way to the photo op, I squeezed into an elevator beside Arroyo. A president and daughter of a president, she is a seasoned pol who attended Georgetown University (Bill Clinton was a classmate) and has a Ph.D. in economics. I asked why she called migrant workers \u201cheroes\u201d and gathered from her impatient look that it was all she could do to keep from saying \u201cdu-uh.\u201d\n \u201cThey send home more than a billion dollars a month,\u201d she said.\n\u201cO.F.W.\u2019s get V.I.P. Treatment, Treats,\u201d reported the next day\u2019s Philippine Daily Inquirer, which runs nearly 600 O.F.W. articles a year. Half have the fevered tone of a gold-rush ad. Half sound like human rights complaints.\n\u201cDeployment of O.F.W.\u2019s Hits 1-M Mark.\u201d\n\u201cRemittances Seen to Set New Record.\u201d\n\u201cHappy Days Here Again for Real Estate Sector.\u201d\n\u201c5 Dead O.F.W.\u2019s in Saudi.\u201d\n\u201cO.F.W. 18th Pinay Rape Victim in Kuwait.\u201d\n\u201cWe Slept With Dog, Ate Leftovers for $200/month.\u201d\nNearly 10 percent of the country\u2019s 89 million people live abroad. About 3.6 million are O.F.W.\u2019s \u2014 contract workers. Another 3.2 million have migrated permanently, largely to the United States \u2014 and 1.3 million more are thought to be overseas illegally. (American visas, which are probably the hardest to get, are also the most coveted, both for the prosperity they promise and because the Philippines, a former colony, retains an unrequited fascination with the U.S.) There are a million O.F.W.\u2019s in Saudi Arabia alone, followed by Japan, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. Yet with workers in at least 170 countries, the O.F.W.\u2019s are literally everywhere, including the high seas. About a quarter of the world\u2019s seafarers come from the Philippines. The Greek word for maid is Filipineza. The \u201cmodern heroes\u201d send home $15 billion a year, a seventh of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Addressing a Manila audience, Rick Warren, the evangelist, called Filipino guest workers the Josephs of their day \u2014 toiling in the homes of modern Pharaohs to liberate their people. \nFor the sheer visuals of the O.F.W. boom, consider Pulong Anahao, a village two hours south of Manila that has been sending Filipinezas to Italy for 30 years. Cement block is the regional style, but these streets boast \u2014 the only verb that will do \u2014 faux Italianate villas. For the social complexity, turn on \u201cDahil sa Iyong Paglisan\u201d (\u201cBecause You Left\u201d), a Tagalog telenovela. Each show explores a familiar type. \u201cDodgie,\u201d a driver in Dubai, is livid at his wife\u2019s profligacy. \u201cDennis\u201d gets fleeced by crooked recruiters on his way to Singapore. \u201cCarlos,\u201d with a wife in Riyadh, is a hapless househusband; he cannot cook or wash, and his son is left out in the rain.\nManila Hospital was aflutter one morning with the taping of the episode about \u201cWally.\u201d A seafarer home from Greece, he demanded to know where his money had gone, only to discover that his pregnant wife had spent it on antiviral medication. His port-of-call promiscuity had given her H.I.V. \n\u201cQui-et!\u201d the director bellowed, with Wally about to learn of his own infection. It took the actor five takes to summon a sufficiently chilling mix of fear and remorse. A giggly nursing student, fresh from a cameo, paused to chat. She was getting a degree to \u2014 what else? \u2014 \u201cgo abroad and try my luck.\u201d\nWhile the Philippines has exported labor for at least 100 years, the modern system took shape three decades ago under Ferdinand Marcos. Clinging to power through martial law, he faced soaring unemployment, a Communist insurgency and growing urban unrest. Exporting idle Filipinos promised a safety valve and a source of foreign exchange. With a 1974 decree (\u201cto facilitate and regulate the movement of workers in conformity with the national interest\u201d), Marcos sent technocrats circling the globe in search of labor contracts. Annual deployments rose more than tenfold in a decade, to 360,000.\nThe \u201cPeople Power\u201d revolution of 1986 replaced him with Corazon Aquino, who as the widow of his slain rival was a figure as un-Marcosian as they come. But the surge in labor migration continued. By the end of her six-year term, annual deployments had nearly doubled. There is no anti-migration camp in Filipino politics. The labor secretary, Arturo Brion, greeted me by saying that he, too, had been an O.F.W., having worked as a lawyer for seven years in Canada. When I asked how a nationalist candidate might fare with a vow to keep workers home, he looked confused. \u201cNobody would vote for him,\u201d he said. \nThe political issue is not migration but migrant safety. The formative moment in O.F.W. history, its Alamo, was the 1995 hanging of Flor Contemplacion, a Filipina maid in Singapore. Though she confessed to killing another Filipina maid and a Singaporean child, she did so in an uncertain mental state with weak legal representation; an 11th-hour witness fingered someone else. President Fidel Ramos\u2019s calls for mercy failed, and the martyred maid\u2019s coffin received a hero\u2019s welcome at home. Congressional elections followed, and the new Legislature passed what is variously called Republic Act 8042 and \u201cthe migrant workers\u2019 Magna Carta.\u201d It pushed the government\u2019s responsibilities beyond migrant deployment to migrant protection.\nWoe now to the Filipino pol who appears not to have migrant welfare in mind. After a Filipino truck driver was kidnapped in Iraq in 2004, Arroyo not only banned all contract work there but also withdrew from the American-led military coalition. Even state visits have the tenor of bail runs. The president triumphed in Saudi Arabia last spring when King Adbullah freed more than 400 workers who had been jailed for petty crimes. But the war in Lebanon last summer threw the Arroyo government into a crisis by displacing thousands of Filipina maids. They returned home with harrowing tales of prewar abuse, including beatings and rape, endured in pursuit of salaries that averaged $200 a month. Embarrassed (and seemingly surprised), the government proposed a \u201cSupermaid\u201d program, a short-term training regimen that would lift the maids\u2019 skills and demand a doubling of their wage. Those not cringing at the name fretted that a pay raise would leave the maids displaced by Bangladeshis.\nWhile every country\u2019s migrants face risks, what makes the Philippines unique is a bureaucracy pledged to reduce them. There is no precise analog for the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration \u2014 O.W.W.A. \u2014 or its savvy director, Marianito Roque, who is one part international rescue worker and one part domestic fixer. A bureaucratic survivor who rose through the ranks, Roque understands the imperative of making the president look good. Christmas offered plenty of opportunity. With legions of workers coming home, Roque staged thank-you fiestas nationwide.\nI pictured them as sedate affairs until I arrived at a mall in Cebu City. Five thousand people pressed against police barricades, aiming cellphone cameras at a fluttering pop star who urged them to buy her music and clothes. O.W.W.A. has its own chorale, which offered the workers \u201cLady Marmalade\u201d \u2014 \u201cVoulez-vous coucher avec moi?\u201d \u2014 an odd choice in a country saturated with fears of overseas adultery. Roque raffled off a mountain of rice cookers and electric fans, and the crowd responded with game-show shrieks. He caught an early-morning flight the next day and stormed through two more fiestas. \nWhen the last rice cooker had been claimed and the last voulez-vous belted out, I spotted a man grinning mischievously, as if he were in on his own private joke. An attractive woman hung on his arm with what I mistook as reunion bliss. The bliss, she happily explained, was in the pay. The man, Pepito Montero, boasted that he earned $8,000 a month on a Saudi oil rig, and a flicker of doubt must have crossed my face. His smile broadened at the chance to produce his retort \u2014 a mass of $100 bills the size of a tennis ball.\nEmmet Comodas migrated to Manila before he migrated abroad. His parents, tenant farmers in the province of Leyte, died before he finished grade school, and he was handed off to an aunt in the capital, 600 miles away. She lived in a muddy squatters\u2019 camp called Leveriza. The alleys were ruled by drunks and gangs, but Emmet wore his geniality as a shield and was quick to make friends. Drawn to commerce more than to school, which he left at 16, Emmet spent much of his youth dodging traffic to sell newspapers and cigarettes. When he grew weary of his aunt\u2019s strictures, he slept on a city bridge.\nAmong his favorite vending sites was a nearby stadium, Rizal Memorial, though without a sales license he had to sneak in early and hide before events. The canteen manager, admiring his pluck, hired him as a cook. With a bounce in his step from his first real job, Emmet was walking home to Leveriza one day when he spotted a woman, beautiful but frail, in an alley ironing clothes. He was afraid to say hello.\nTeresita Portagana came from a higher echelon of the Filipino poor. Her father was a farmhand in nearby Cavite province who managed to buy a few acres of coffee trees. Tita was raised on the farm, the oldest of 11 kids in a close-knit family who shared a single thatched hut. She left school after sixth grade to help her mother manage the growing clan, and when she turned 16 her father sent her to work in a Manila glove factory. She would live with an aunt and send home most of her pay.\nHer excitement at the prospect of city living vanished when she saw her aunt\u2019s neighborhood. Leveriza was not just crowded and dangerous; it stank. Stagnant estuaries, which doubled as sewage pits, were filled with discarded bundles of waste dubbed \u201cflying saucers.\u201d When her father learned that Tita was drawing looks from Leveriza boys, he hurried to Manila and moved her out. \u201cOne relative in Leveriza is enough,\u201d he said. By then Emmet was pressing his case. Tita considered him plain-looking and \u201cpoor as a rat,\u201d but his persistence carried the day. They married on the farm and moved back to Leveriza, where Emmet would be close to work. He was 23, and she had just turned 21.\nSimilar slums were spreading across the developing world, greeting provincial migrants with welcome mats of squalor. How people survived, and at what cost, was a mystery and a concern. As Tita and Emmet were settling in, F. Landa Jocano, an anthropologist trained at the University of Chicago, moved nearby in search of answers, which eventually formed a noted book, \u201cSlum as a Way of Life.\u201d The setting of his Leveriza-like camp was predictably grim \u2014 \u201cwet and muddy,\u201d with a \u201cnauseating smell\u201d and \u201ccardboard hovels\u201d holding six to nine people to the room. But what really stood out were the social conflicts. Despite the Filipinos\u2019 reputation for prizing social accord, husbands beat wives, gangs murdered gangs and tsismis \u2014 gossip \u2014 was a constant preoccupation. \u201cEnvy, jealousy, hatred and other forms of ridicule\u201d coursed through the alleys, and it took a special deftness to thrive. Tita, lacking it, withdrew into herself. \u201cI was talkless,\u201d she said.\nTita and Emmet had three children in four years, and two more later. Their second child. Rowena, was born seven weeks early with a heart defect that went undiagnosed for years. All they knew was that she was constantly sick. The family lived in rented shanties until Emmet won $90 on a horse race and bought a shanty of his own. It was so bug-infested that he burned the walls and rebuilt with secondhand wood. He moved to a pool-cleaning job at the stadium and sold cigarettes on the side. \nStill, the holes in the roof meant the children got wet on rainy nights. When she lacked money for vegetables or fish, Tita served the children rice, and when she lacked enough rice for three meals, she served two. A Sikh they called the \u201cboom-bay\u201d lent money at the standard interest rate, 20 percent per month. Emmet borrowed about $130 to open a tiny grocery store, which he planned to run as a sideline with Tita\u2019s help. The thief who robbed it during Holy Week seemed to know that they were busy with a marathon reading of the \u201cPasyon,\u201d a 24-hour life of Christ. A few months later, Tita became pregnant with their fifth child.\nBy then the Marcos labor decree was five years old, and the machinery was humming. Saudi Arabia was modernizing overnight. It needed roads, schools, apartments, hospitals and laborers to build them. Filipinos worked hard, spoke English and took orders. Tita and Emmet had seen the workers coming home with the Look \u2014 leather jackets, Ray-Bans and enough gold around their necks to turn their skin yellow with a case of Saudi \u201chepa.\u201d But most of the jobs were controlled by recruiting agencies, which charged placement fees of a month\u2019s salary or more. Only the privileged among the poor could leave. \nIn the spring of 1980, Tita\u2019s brother Fortz took a loan from his father to try his luck in Riyadh. He had just landed when Emmet\u2019s boss asked if he wanted to do the same pool-cleaning work in Dhahran. \u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d Emmet said. The firm that managed the stadium had a contract there, so there were no recruiters\u2019 fees. Tita\u2019s brother Fering came the following year, and soon after, her brother Servando. Of the 11 siblings in her generation, nine either became overseas workers or married one. \n\u201cFirst timers\u201d have it rough. Emmet shared a comfortable company apartment and a cook with three other Filipinos, but the loneliness was worse than anything he had known. Outside of work, there was nothing to do. Alcohol and churches were banned. Looking the wrong way at a Saudi woman was an invitation to arrest. (That is one theory behind the Ray-Bans.) Emmet paced Dhahran malls and stared at Dhahran skies, fantasizing that the planes overhead had come to take him home. \nTita\u2019s loneliness was costly, too, but she had Emmet\u2019s earnings. With a monthly salary of $500, he made as much in two years in Dhahran as he did in two decades in Manila, and he sent two-thirds of it home. Tita bought better food, and she bought Rowena medicine. She bought each child a second school uniform, so she would not have to wash every night. She bought an electric fan and a television \u2014 her habit of watching through a neighbor\u2019s window was a source of alleyway discord. Emmet, who talked to the family on cassette tapes, surprised Tita by sending one with a $100 bill inside.\nWhen Emmet got home in 1982, he gave himself a party, patched the walls and replaced the leaky roof. Then he signed another two-year contract. After his second tour, he replaced the wooden walls with cement block and added an upstairs. After his third contract, he paid the government $2,000 and got title to the land. Though neither Tita nor Emmet finished high school, all five children started college; four got degrees. Emmet, overseas paying the bills, missed every graduation. It takes a lot to move him to anger, but even now he gets furious when someone says that overseas workers leave their children to grow up without love. \u201cYou cannot look at each other and say it\u2019s love if your stomach is empty,\u201d he said. \u201cI sacrificed!\u201d\nI first met Tita and the kids in 1987, as Emmet was finishing his third contract. I had a fellowship from the Henry Luce Foundation to study urban poverty; a Leveriza nun, Sister Christine Tan, introduced us, and Tita agreed to let me move in. With Cory Aquino finishing her first year, the country was in transition, and Tita was, too. She was no longer quite so talkless. I awoke in the mornings to the blare of Tagalog news radio and once found her studying an English newspaper with a dual-language dictionary. \u201cWhat\u2019s imperialism?\u201d she asked. When Congress wanted a witness for a hearing on urban poverty, Sister Christine had Tita testify. Tita told me she had been asking God, \u201cWhy are so many Filipinos poor?\u201d When I asked if God had answered, she laughed. \u201cNot yet,\u201d she said.\nMuch of the credit belonged to Sister Christine, who had organized a network of prayer groups and cooperative stores and groomed Tita as a lieutenant. Tita bought and distributed 2,000 eggs a week for the group\u2019s co-op stores, placing them under a fluorescent light at night to keep the rats away. The unpaid work, undertaken in the spirit of community service, brought Tita new confidence. But so perhaps did the modest comforts made possible by Emmet\u2019s wages. By now she had a toilet.\nHer oldest two children spent less time mulling the meaning of life \u2014 Rowena, still poised between sickness and health, was addicted to celebrity gossip \u2014 and her two youngest were little boys. But Rosalie, the middle child, was on a quest. At 16, she was ambitious, sometimes brooding, beautiful and devout; while her sister squealed about movie stars, Rosalie wrote Tagalog plays about class conflict. One depicted Imelda Marcos conniving to raze Leveriza and put up a discoth\u00c3\u00a8que.\nEmmet returned a few months into my off-and-on stay. He had missed half the life of his 11-year-old, Roldan, and nearly the whole life of the 7-year-old, Boyet. He wanted to stay. With jobs scarce, frustration rose all around. Emmet scolded Tita for running up the light bill with her stewardship of the eggs. Tita got angry when she heard Emmet urge their oldest child, Rolando, to join the U.S. Navy, and furious when she caught him encouraging Rosalie to go abroad. Emmet wanted her to be an O.F.W.; Tita wanted her to be a nun. Though Emmet found a temporary job, he was back in Riyadh within a year.\nOne day he opened the door to find his son Rolando on the steps. He had quit tech school to try his luck as a driver for a Saudi family. His luck proved mediocre. The salary was low, his hours were long and his secret courtship of a Filipina maid could have landed him in jail. He quit after his second contract. By then, Rosalie had finished nursing school in Manila, a milestone for the family. She had set her sights on a job in the United States, but narrowly failed the licensing exam. Four years after graduation, she still earned $100 a month. Saudi hospitals paid nearly four times as much. After borrowing the recruiters\u2019 fee from an aunt, Rosalie was Jeddah bound.\nNo one fully understood that a baton was being passed. With the kids grown, Tita soon rented out the house in Leveriza and started building another on her share of the family farm. At 55, Emmet had given his prime years, nearly 20 of them, to a succession of Arabian pools. Rosalie, renewing her contract, insisted he go home. The responsibility of supporting the family was hers.\nAs an Islamic state that bans socializing between unmarried women and men, Saudi Arabia held out few hopes for marriage or kids. Rosalie approached her 30th birthday resigned to a dutiful life alone. She celebrated at a Jeddah restaurant with Filipino friends; one of them, knowing they had a private room, disregarded the gender rules by bringing along her nephew, a construction engineer. The nephew, Christopher Villanueva, took Rosalie for an after-dinner walk, trailing her by a few paces in case the religious police happened by. \u201cI was trembling!\u201d Rosalie said. With both of them living in guarded single-sex dorms, their 18-month courtship occurred largely by cellphone. When they flew home in 2002 to marry, they had never been alone.\nIn the Philippines the following year to deliver her first baby, Rosalie saw an ad seeking nurses in Abu Dhabi. At $1,100 a month, the job paid twice what she made in Jeddah, and Abu Dhabi had no religious police. She aced the test and caught another plane to the Middle East, this time as a mother. Christine \u2014 \u201cTin-Tin\u201d \u2014 was 7 months old when Rosalie tore herself away. The baby stayed on the farm and soon called her Aunt Rowena \u201cMama.\u201d When a second daughter, Precious Lara, followed, she considered Rowena her mama, too. The girls cried when Rosalie held them on visits, filling her with worry and regret.\nOverseas prosperity is a gift and an obligation. \u201cEveryone needs help, and you cannot say no,\u201d said Rosalie, who seems not to mind. She paid to complete her parents\u2019 new house and sends them $400 a month. She sent money for her cousins\u2019 school supplies and helped her uncle buy a cow. She lent hundreds of dollars to godparents, knowing she would never be repaid. Migration operates like compound interest, building upon itself. Capitalizing on permissive visa laws, Rosalie has now brought a cousin and three siblings to Abu Dhabi. Rowena will soon start a secretarial job, and Roldan and Boyet are working with computers. Rosalie has also gotten Tin-Tin back, though not without some continuing distress: the girl, now 4, still treats Rowena like her real mom. \nAlready the family benefactor, Rosalie recently got a big promotion. As a charge nurse at the Al Rahba Hospital, she now earns $2,000 a month \u2014 20 times what she earned a decade ago when she left the Philippines. Plus she has free health care and housing. Nonetheless, she is determined to stamp one more visa on the passport page. After a decade of trying, she has passed the American nursing exam and will soon retake the English test, which she narrowly failed. \u201cThe U.S. is the ultimate,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you make it to the U.S., there is no place else to go.\u201d\nOnce upon a time \u2014 say five years ago \u2014 remittances were considered small potatoes, and possibly rotten ones. Experts saw them as minor amounts, \u201cwasted\u201d on consumption, and to the extent they came from professionals, as reminders of brain drain. That began to change early this decade, when research by the Inter-American Development Bank (commissioned by a remittance enthusiast named Don Terry) showed the amounts in Latin America were three or four times higher than supposed. That work got people talking, but interest surged in 2003 when Dilip Ratha of the World Bank showed the eye-popping sums extended across the globe. Migration has been a prominent development topic ever since. Of the $300 billion that migrants sent home last year, about two-thirds came through formal channels like banks, while the rest is thought to have traveled informally, in pockets or cassette tapes. By contrast, the world spent $104 billion on foreign aid. While the doubling of formal remittances in the past five years partly reflects improved counting, Dilip Ratha argues that most of the gain is real. There are more migrants; their earnings are growing; and plunging transaction fees encourage them to send more money home.\nThe Philippines, which received $15 billion in formal remittances in 2006, ranked fourth among developing countries behind India ($25 billion), China ($24 billion) and Mexico ($24 billion) \u2014 all of which are much larger. In no other sizable country do remittances loom as large as a share of the economy. Remittances make up 3 percent of the G.D.P. in Mexico but 14 percent in the Philippines. In 22 countries, remittances exceed a tenth of the G.D.P., including Moldova (32 percent), Haiti (23 percent) and Lebanon (22 percent).\nDespite fears that the money goes to waste, a growing literature shows positive effects. Remittances cut the poverty rate by 11 percent in Uganda and 6 percent in Bangladesh, according to studies cited by the World Bank, and raised education levels in El Salvador and the Philippines. Being private, the money is less susceptible to corruption than foreign aid; it is also better aimed at the needy and \u201ccountercyclical\u201d \u2014 it rises in response to slumps and natural disasters. By increasing reserves of foreign exchange, remittances reduce government borrowing costs, saving the Philippines about half a billion dollars in interest each year. While 80 percent of the money sent to Latin America is spent on consumption, that leaves nearly $12 billion for investment. And consumption among the poor is hardly a bad thing. \nThe downside is the risk of dependency, among individuals waiting for a check or for rulers (like Marcos) who use the money to avoid economic reforms. The cash could have a stultifying effect, like the \u201ccurse\u201d of too much oil. No country has escaped poverty with remittances alone. \u201cRemittances can\u2019t solve structural problems,\u201d said Kathleen Newland of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington research group. \u201cRemittances can\u2019t compensate for corrupt governments, nepotism, incompetence or communal conflict. People have finally figured out that remittances are important, but they haven\u2019t figured out what to do about it.\u201d\nDrawing boards are filled with schemes to leverage the money for development, in ways large and small. A small Manila nonprofit group, the Economic Resource Center for Overseas Filipinos, has a plan to get overseas workers to buy cows; a dairy farm in the Philippines would raise them, splitting the profits and creating jobs. More grandly, commercial banks in Turkey and Brazil have used the expected flow of future remittances as a form of collateral to issue billions in corporate bonds. This lowers the banks\u2019 borrowing costs and increases the amounts they can lend, making it easier, in theory at least, for businesses to borrow and expand. \nA goal atop everyone\u2019s list is getting more families \u201cbanked.\u201d Opening an account (as opposed to just wiring money) lets migrants establish credit histories for future mortgages or business loans. The deposits expand capital pools. And bank accounts boost savings rates. Some banks turn migrant deposits into tiny loans to village entrepreneurs, linking remittances to the popular realm of microfinance.\nMigrants contribute to development in ways that go beyond remittances. Many countries tap their diasporas for philanthropy. Affluent migrants make investments back home. And the increasingly circular nature of migration means that some migrants return with knowledge and connections. This is a countertrend to brain drain \u2014 \u201cbrain gain\u201d \u2014 with Taiwan the most obvious case. The Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park, a government-subsidized Silicon Valley, has lured home thousands of skilled Taiwanese with research and investment opportunities. The key is having something to lure them to; brain gain has not come to, say, Malawi.\nCasting migration as the answer to global poverty has some people alarmed. It risks obscuring the personal price that migrants and their families pay. It could be used to gloss over, or even justify, the exploitation of workers. And it could offer rich countries an excuse for cutting foreign aid and other development efforts. \u201cThis is a new version of trickledown theory,\u201d warned Stephen Castles of Oxford University at a recent conference in Mexico City. \u201cIt wants to make the poor pay for development.\u201d Rodolfo Garc\u00c3a Zamora, a professor at the Autonomous University of Zacatecas in Mexico, warned the conference against remittance \u201cfetishization.\u201d Even in the remittance-happy Philippines, national law states that the government does not see migration as a development strategy \u2014 though it obviously does.\nCertainly, soaring remittance tallies cannot measure social costs, to migrants or to those left behind. (So many Africans die at sea each year trying to reach European soil that the Straits of Gibraltar have been dubbed \u201cthe largest mass grave in Europe.\u201d) I was with Emmet and his brother-in-law one day when they broke into a nostalgic version of \u201cIt\u2019s So Painful, Big Brother Eddie,\u201d a Tagalog classic from the 1980s that immortalizes every migrant\u2019s fear:\nMy child wrote to me\nI was shocked and I instantly cried.\n\u201cFather come home, make it fast\nMother has another man\nShe\u2019s cheating on you, father. . . .\u201d\nBut what\u2019s painful, I\u2019m wondering\nWhy our two children are now three?\nAmong the biggest worries, in the Philippines and beyond, are the \u201cleft behind\u201d kids, who are alternately portrayed as dangerous hoodlums and consumerist brats. Some people fear that their gadgets and clothes, sent from guilty parents abroad, corrupt village values. A U.N. envoy, examining Filipino migration, had a different concern: \u201cReportedly children of O.F.W.\u2019s are more likely to become involved in delinquency or early marriage.\u201d (Note \u201creportedly.\u201d) One episode of \u201cBecause You Left,\u201d the television show, depicts an adolescent boy whose father is abroad, leaving no one to help him with his first crush. He bonds with the school bully, steals from his mother and tries to rob someone. In addition to the \u201cleft behind,\u201d researchers speak of a more disadvantaged class \u2014 the \u201cleft out.\u201d Lacking the money or connections to go abroad, they are marooned on the wrong shore of what is, among the poor themselves, a growing divide.\nFear about the children is inevitable (and laudable), but the modest social science that exists offers some reassurance. At least three studies have examined \u201cleft behind\u201d families in the Philippines. All found the children of migrants doing as well as, or better than, children whose parents stayed home. The most recent, from the Scalabrini Migration Center in Manila, involved a national survey of 10-to-12-year-olds. The migrants\u2019 kids did better in school, had better physical health, experienced less anxiety and were more likely to attend church. \u201cFor now, the children are fine,\u201d it concluded. Joseph Chamie, editor of The International Migration Review, an academic journal, calls the finding typical. \u201cThere\u2019s not much scientific evidence that children have developmental difficulties when a parent migrates,\u201d he said.\nOne theory is that remittances compensate for the missing parent\u2019s care. The study found migrants\u2019 kids taller and heavier than their counterparts, suggesting higher caloric intake, and much more likely to attend private school. The extended family can also act as a compensating force. And so can modern technology in an age of cellphones and Webcams. There is no doubt that migration has costs. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a focus group without people crying,\u201d said the Scalabrini researcher, Maruja Asis. The point is that not migrating has costs, too \u2014 the cost of wrenching poverty. \nThe Philippines, more than most places, claims to be skilled in managing these costs. As the rare bureaucracy devoted to migrant care, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration draws admirers from across the globe. Any agency pledged to tame a force as brutal as labor migration is bound to have its failures. O.W.W.A. has 300 employees to watch over 3.6 million workers. The general Filipino view is that the agency does a serviceable job during crises abroad (it evacuated 30,000 workers from Kuwait during the first gulf war), while playing politics at home \u2014 investing funds in cronies\u2019 businesses and helping politicians get out the vote.\nBut there is an especially sordid chapter of migrant history that this forgiving account omits, the shipment of bar girls to Japan. Spotting a growth market a decade ago, Philippine recruiters marched armies of young Filipinas through short courses in song and dance, then sent them off to Japanese clubs, with the Philippine government certifying them as \u201coverseas performing artists.\u201d Club owners typically grabbed their passports and told them to do what it took to keep customers drinking; what it took was a mix of tableside affection, off-duty dating and outright prostitution. As both governments lent a hand, Filipinas in skimpy clothes became an export commodity. Their numbers rose from 17,000 in 1996 to more than 70,000 in 2004, as remittances from Japan hit more than $350 million. \nSex work is often a byproduct of extreme poverty. \u201cA man is on top of me,\u201d writes Corazon Amaya-Ca\u00c3\u00b1ete, a Filipina poet in Hong Kong, in the voice of a woman who distracts herself by resurrecting a childhood habit of counting sheep.\nIn exchange for this is money for Mother\u2019s\n medicine\nBuilding the house and\nBuying food for my six siblings\nClothes, shoes, books and tuition for school . . .\nSeventy-seven white sheep!\nSeventy-seven white sheep!\nThe Tagalog wordplay emphasizes the cruelty of her fate: she starts life as a girl counting tupa and awakens to find herself a puta. \u201cOh! I am prostitute!\u201d she screams. (The poem, \u201cSeventy-Seven White Sheep,\u201d was published in a Webzine of Filipino diaspora writings, Our Own Voice.)\nIt was not the Philippines but Japan that finally cleaned things up. It acted only after the U.S. State Department placed it on a 2004 watch list of countries lax toward human trafficking. The embarrassed Japanese now demand two years of performing experience for an entertainer\u2019s visa, which has cut the flow of Filipina bodies by about 95 percent. Remarkably, it did so over the objection of the Philippine government, which sent a protest delegation to Tokyo. \nOr perhaps it is less remarkable than it seems. A handful of advocates condemned the flesh trade, but most Filipinos see it as a consensual, if regrettable, economic exchange, and inevitable in a country where nearly half the population lives on less than $2 a day. Gina gawa ko dahil para sa familya ko goes the Tagalog saying. \u201cI do this for the sake of my family.\u201d\nI asked Nito Roque, the country\u2019s chief migrant protector, how to square the sex trade with the government\u2019s pledge (in Act 8042) to protect workers\u2019 \u201cdignity and fundamental human rights.\u201d His answer says something about the limits of migrant protection, in the Philippines and beyond. \u201cThe contract does not say anything about prostitution \u2014 that is a private matter between the employer and the employee,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody forces anybody to go abroad. It\u2019s the applicant who comes forward and applies for the job.\n\u201cDo they know what they\u2019re getting into? I think so.\u201d\nAbout 30 miles south of Manila, just outside the town of Silang, a dirt road ends at a residential compound carved from a small coffee farm. For decades it held nothing but the thatched hut where Tita and her 10 siblings were raised. Now a dozen cement blockhouses are clustered in a U, some little more than shells and others, like Tita and Emmet\u2019s pink cottage, boasting faux marble tile and lace curtains. One look at each home yields a fair guess of how long the owner worked abroad. Nine families in the compound sent workers overseas, and collectively those workers stayed for 131 years (and counting). A walk across the compound cuts through a century of rewards and regrets.\nTita\u2019s brother Fering is thankful that he returned from Saudi Arabia in time to see his children\u2019s first days of school. Another brother, Fortz, is one of two men in the family (by some counts, three) whose extramarital affairs overseas produced kids. He left for Saudi Arabia with a daughter named Sheryl and returned with another named Sheralyn. Conscripted as a stand-in mom, Tita raised the girl for 10 years \u2014 resentfully at first, because of the cost \u2014 and wept when her real mother took her away. \u201cShe is like having another child,\u201d she said.\nTita\u2019s sister Peachy learned that her husband had a girlfriend \u2014 and a son \u2014 when she received a package meant for them. The first time I asked her whether the time apart had strained their marriage, she politely lied. \u201cNo \u2014 we\u2019re loving each other for ever and ever!\u201d she said. The following day she sought me out with a more candid account. Peachy is a large, cheerful woman, who seems as if nothing could daunt her. \u201cI almost died,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t lose my husband to someone else. That was the saddest moment of my life.\u201d\nPeachy\u2019s sister Patricia thought all was well until a stranger called two years ago and said her husband was having an affair with his wife. \u201cYour husband and his mistress,\u201d the man wrote on the photograph that followed. When Patricia called her husband in Saudi Arabia, he denied all and then stopped taking her calls. He sends little money, and she suspects he has a new child. Their son Jonvic, a dimpled 9-year-old, renders judgments of his father with innocent cheer. \u201cWhat he did to us was worse than if he died, because he violated the Ten Commandments of God,\u201d he said.\nIt was not infidelity that moved another relative to tears but fidelity at any cost. We were breezing through the family photo album when she pointed at a picture from Saudi Arabia that showed her husband at an evangelical church. Church? That is a ticket to deportation or worse. Alarmed that her slip might place him in greater dangers, she started to sob. \u201cI can\u2019t stop him \u2014 that\u2019s where he found his happiness,\u201d she said. When I reached him, he encouraged me to mention his preaching, saying it was his way of thanking God for the chance to work abroad. \u201cI promised the Lord I\u2019ll share the Gospel under any circumstance,\u201d he said.\nThe nine families of overseas workers raised 35 kids, some of whom scarcely saw their fathers. Their combined stories could fill a whole season of \u201cBecause You Left.\u201d One became pregnant at 17 and is now a single mother. Another became addicted to video games and dropped out of school. Yet another started drinking after his father disappeared. One of Tita\u2019s sisters sold a house and a cow to place her son in a Taiwan factory. The son squandered his parents\u2019 life savings within a few months, and his drinking and gambling got him expelled from the country.\nBy any measure, the price was high, yet there it stands \u2014 a semicircle of blockhouses where there once was a mere thatched hut. Bookshelves sag with encyclopedia sets. More diplomas appear each year on freshly plastered walls. There are bunk beds and Bugs Bunny sheets, cellphones, stereos and big televisions. Having nearly lost her marriage to labor migration, Peachy is scarcely heedless of its social costs. \u201cA good provider is someone who leaves,\u201d she said, without ambivalence. \nOne irritant of life in the compound has been the shared well, which dries up and causes contentious waits. Three of the families have drilled wells of their own, with electric pumps. One belongs to Peachy, a gift from her daughter, Ariane, who used her father\u2019s overseas earnings to get a degree in hotel management and earns $1,000 a month as a maid on a cruise ship.\nAnother tank belongs to Tita and Emmet, whose cottage is the compound\u2019s jewel. It has a patio, a beamed ceiling, a tiled sala floor, two kitchens and two toilets that flush. It was built by Rosalie and is a monument to the tenacious child who wrote plays about the rich exploiting the poor and willed her way into the nascent middle class. Although she is thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi, she hovers over the compound; no household there is heedless of her example or generosity.\nThe house is nicer than any that Tita and Emmet have known but quieter too, with four of the couple\u2019s five children a continent away. \u201cI am sad,\u201d Tita said, \u201cbecause they\u2019re in a far place.\u201d She is often weak with ulcers, and Emmet\u2019s hearing has started to fade. They had a chance to sell the fixed-up house in Leveriza for a princely sum, $16,000, but unwilling to part with the place where their children were raised, they rent it to relatives. Restless without work, Emmet is especially susceptible to nostalgia for the bad old days. \u201cI was happier then because I was with my children,\u201d he said. \nGoing abroad is difficult, but so is coming home. Since Emmet returned for good, the kids have noticed less tenderness between their parents and more quarreling. They each grew accustomed to being the boss. One reason Rosalie left her second daughter, Precious Lara, in the Philippines is that she thinks her parents need a child to love. Tita and Emmet sleep beneath a malaria net with the 18-month-old beside them, and Rosalie often calls home two or three times a day. She and her husband have an infant son, Dominique Edward, in Abu Dhabi, whom her parents have never seen. Armed with her first cellphone at 60, Tita has sent so many text messages that she has worn the numbers off the keys. Yawning one night, she laughed and said of herself, \u201cLow batt!\u201d \nOff the sala is a guest bedroom with a large framed photograph of Rosalie, taken on her wedding day. The woman in that picture shows no trace of a birthright of poverty. She turns to the camera wearing an enormous gown and a confident face. Two generations of labor migration have given her more education, more money and more power and prestige than her mother could have dreamed of on her own wedding day. Precious Lara rarely plays in that room and hardly knows the face, much less the sacrifices her mother has made for the blessings of a migrant\u2019s wage.",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \nGRAHAM NICKSON Traditional figurative and landscape painting does not endear a contemporary artist to the art world establishment, or to critics. But such art has a passionate following among a legion of stubborn adherents. The most prominent and talented is probably Graham Nickson, whose work is the subject of a delightful exhibition of watercolors at Salander-O\u2019Reilly Galleries on the Upper East Side. The show heralds an upswing in interest in this artist: a retrospective opens on March 24 in Norway, followed in November by a show at the Naples Museum of Art in Florida that may also travel nationally. In the meantime, those who delight in the watercolor and the simple beauty of nature will find steady pleasure in this exhibition of Mr. Nickson\u2019s renditions of sunrises and sunsets. Painting in one quick hit, without the aid of preparatory drawings, photographs or props, Mr. Nickson is interested in more than just the subtleties of atmosphere and light, though he captures them with the awe-inspiring dexterity of an artist entirely conversant with this tricky medium. So conversant, in fact, that Mr. Nickson\u2019s watercolors expertly push and play about with scale, color, composition and focus, honing in on that mesmerizing, apparitional quality of twilight that has appealed to so many generations of landscape artists before him. (Right, \u201cBora Bora: Uta Maru I, Tahiti, September, 2006.\u201d) He is not always successful in his efforts, but it is the restless search that counts. (Through March 3, Salander-O\u2019Reilly Galleries, 22 East 71 Street, Manhattan, 212-879-6606, salander.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n \u2605 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: MART\u00edN RAM\u00edREZ,  through April 29. Ram\u00edrez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty.) But most of all, Ram\u00edrez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)\n \u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)\n \u2605 ASIA SOCIETY: GLASS, GILDING, AND GRAND DESIGN: ART OF SASANIAN IRAN (224-642 A.D.), through May 20. This glinting, glowing show is a reduction of a much larger Paris exhibition that included material from Iranian museums impossible to bring to the United States. But with some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, it is still substantial and the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400. \n (Holland Cotter)\n \u2605 GREY ART GALLERY: \u2018SEMINA CULTURE: WALLACE BERMAN & HIS CIRCLE,\u2019 through March 31. The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) may ring only a faint bell to many New Yorkers, but he was a central, charismatic figure in an underground of West Coast artists and poets in the 1950s and 60s. A collagist, poet, photographer and the publisher of an influential journal, Semina, he inspired others to make art too, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write. And a traveling love company of them has come to Grey Art Gallery, trailing dreams, delusions and marijuana clouds. New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780. (Cotter)\nGUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018FAMILY PICTURES,\u2019 through April 16. This show sounds ripe with possibilities. The results, however, are more mixed. The exhibition is drawn from the museum\u2019s collection, which explains some of its exclusions and limitations. Many artists you associate with contemporary photography and the family are not in attendance: Richard Bellingham, Tina Barney, Malerie Marder. There is also a sense of false advertising in the exhibition\u2019s title. The museum\u2019s news release extends the exhibition\u2019s exploration into \u201crepresentation of families and children in contemporary art and video.\u201d Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. A good portion of the work falls under this rubric. Rineke Dijkstra\u2019s \u201cBeach Portraits\u201d of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don\u2019t think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children (now grown), has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, and her choice of family as the central focus of artistic practice, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. \n(Martha Schwendener) \n INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON\u2019S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,\u2019 through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive \u2014 the \u201cposthumous\u201d exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It\u2019s an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. \n(Michael Kimmelman) \nINTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018MARTIN MUNKACSI: THINK WHILE YOU SHOOT!\u2019 through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early \u201860s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. (See above.) (Kimmelman) \n * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer, and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. \n(Grace Glueck) \n \u2605 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018PRIVATE TREASURES: FOUR CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTER DRAWINGS,\u2019 through April 8. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The works span more than 400 years, from the 16th to the early 20th century, and include drawings in ink and pencil, watercolor, chalk and gouache. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn\u2019t an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one\u2019s craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example \u2014 and the most historically significant work here \u2014 is a black chalk drawing, \u201cThe Dead Christ\u201d (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don\u2019t know where they came from, where they\u2019re going, or when you\u2019ll see them again. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Schwendener) \nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018ARTISTIC COLLABORATIONS: 50 YEARS OF UNIVERSAL LIMITED ART EDITIONS,\u2019 through May 21. This exhibition marks the half-century milestone for Universal Limited Art Editions in West Islip, N.Y., and its association with the Museum of Modern Art: The museum has acquired one print from every edition made at Universal, more than 1,200 works by nearly 50 artists. Prints by 12 artists are in this show. Among them are lithographs by Jasper Johns, mostly from the 1960s, with his signature maps and flags. Robert Rauschenberg is represented primarily by lithographs from the 1960s that combine found images of figures like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson with the freehand scrawling associated with Abstract Expressionism. It\u2019s hard to fault an exhibition that features prints by masters like Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg. But given the somewhat precarious position of prints in the contemporary art world, the inclusion of younger artists would make a good argument that traditional printmaking is still relevant and holds possibilities for this generation. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. \n(Schwendener) \n \u2605 MOMA: ARMANDO REVER\u00d3N, through April 16. Unless you spotted his single smoke-puff of a painting at MoMA months ago, Armando Rever\u00f3n probably means nothing to you. Why should he? The artist, who died in 1954, spent most of his life in a shack by the sea in his native Venezuela. Many of his contemporaries dismissed him as nuts. His white-on-white pictures are practically unphotographable. But chances are that if you visit this retrospective, you\u2019ll find yourself thinking about him a lot. His art and his story are like few others, and so is the museum\u2019s inspired installation: a single, long corridor with cabinetlike rooms of paintings on either side and, at the very end, against a sea-green wall, a life-size doll with giant bat wings floating overhead. (See above.) (Cotter)\n \u2605 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975, through April 22. Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this brave if confused exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show\u2019s 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal in their way to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins, mixing generations and levels of achievement and continuing the neglect of the main story. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Smith)\nNEUBERGER MUSEUM OF ART: FUGITIVE ARTIST: THE EARLY WORK OF RICHARD PRINCE, 1974-77, through June 24. This artist is one of the most elusive, perverse and sardonic of all of the important appropriation artists to emerge in the early 1980s, so perhaps it is not surprising that he has boycotted this exhibition of little-known early work, all from public and private collections. But that doesn\u2019t stop the 50 pieces on view from revealing his roots in 1970s Conceptual Art; his progress from generic to original and radical; or the depth and duration of his fascination with language, photography, print-making, the more banal forms of urban postwar Americana and a disconnected, decidedly male blankness. If anything, it increases his stature. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Smith)\n  \nGalleries: Chelsea\n \u2605 FREDERICKS & FREISER: BAKER OVERSTREET: NEW PAINTINGS, through March 17. Like Keegan McHargue and Devendra Banhart, this young artist has a penchant for tribal motifs, which he flattens into symmetrical compositions and renders with an outsider roughness. The works in his debut show evoke the imagery of the space-ship-obsessed, self-taught artist Ionel Talpazan, as well as Alfred Jensen and Forrest Bess. Their notion of the visionary is both self conscious and familiar, but they are painted with energetic dispatch and a sure sense of scale, color and wit that encourages you to stay tuned. 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555. (Smith) \nLast Chance\n \u2605 CERES: AGENTS OF CHANGE: WOMEN, ART, AND INTELLECT In a gathering wave of feminist shows this season, this one is a modest-size, timely arrival. Organized by the artist Leslie King-Hammond, with an immaculate installation by Lowery Stokes Sims, it\u2019s a multiethnic, multi-generational pick of work by 19 artists spanning some 40 years. If there\u2019s a theme, it\u2019s a loose one: feminist art happened, in many forms; it is still happening, in many forms. 547 West 27th Street, Suite 201, Chelsea, (212) 947-6100; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\nCHAMBERS FINE ART: QIU ZHIJIE: THE SHAPE OF TIME Chinese calligraphy and landscape painting are rendered postmodern in 24 large color photographs that document the performance-writing (at night, with a flashlight, before a time-lapse camera) of characters for the solar markers of the Chinese year. The haunting results resemble elegant, disembodied neon and are suspended (along with blurred hints of the artist himself) in settings where old China meets new. 210 Eleventh Avenue, at 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-1169; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n CHINA INSTITUTE: \u2018SHU: REINVENTING BOOKS IN CONTEMPORARY CHINESE\u2019 This second installation of a two-part show glances back at the period of artistic expansion in the 1970s, and its contraction, when the Communist Party clamped down on free expression after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Qiu Zhijie\u2019s photographic \u201clibrary,\u201d which papers the walls of the China Institute\u2019s main staircase, makes evident the information explosion in the \u201880s. Among the thousands of titles are Chinese classics, books on natural sciences, and treatises by Plato, Disraeli and Harold Bloom, as well as art books on Indian stupa, Japanese manga and Barbara Kruger. Such a trove might have been considered a treasure before Tiananmen Square; afterward, such resources became sources of angst. The figure that appears throughout Zhang Xiaogang\u2019s 1991 series \u201cPrivate Notes,\u201d for example, looks as if he is losing his mind as he struggles to write letters and decode illegible manuscripts. Without easy access to words, the images imply, there can be no such thing as free expression. 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org; closes tomorrow. \n (Bridget L. Goodbody)\n \u2605 DANZIGER PROJECTS: SEYDOU KEITA AND LOLO VELEKO The great Malian photographer Seydou Keita, who died in 2001, gave us modern Bamako in his black-and-white studio portraits. The young South African photographer Lolo Veleko, a star of \u201cSnap Judgments\u201d at the International Center of Photography last year, gives us contemporary Johannesburg, in fabulous color, in hers. 521 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 629-6778; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\nMOMENTA ART: ELISABETH KLEY A fascination with drag stars like the filmmaker Jack Smith and the Warhol regular Candy Darling and, it would seem, their relationship to the exotic and to non-Western decorative traditions fuels this dense show of collaged ink drawings and sly majolica ceramic vessels. Preening peacocks are another point of departure, and the plethora of eyes, whether in the portraits, the tail feathers or the glazes, creates a watchful intensity that turns the traditional straight, Western gaze back on itself. 359 Bedford Avenue, near South Fourth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-8058; through Monday. (Smith)\n \u2605 NEUE GALLERY: \u2018JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913\u2019 Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \u201ctotal work of art,\u201d orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Behind the dining room is a huge vitrine fitted out with a dazzling variety of Hoffmann-designed useful and decorative objects; other showcases display larger works. Though focused on interiors, the show conveys the basic ideas of a designer immersed in a new vision. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org; closes on Monday. (Glueck)\n STOREFRONT FOR ART AND ARCHITECTURE: \u2018CLIP/STAMP/FOLD\u2019 This show examines the world of small magazines from the early 1960s to the end of the 1970s, when the field of architecture was still marked by a playful intellectual and political independence. It\u2019s packed with gorgeous cover images, from copulating robots to an elephant attacking the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan to a skyscraper made of Swiss cheese. Often thrown together on a shoestring budget, the magazines have an intoxicating freshness that should send a shudder down the spine of those who\u2019ve spent the last decade bathed in the glow of the computer screen. But this is not an exercise in nostalgia. It\u2019s a piercing critique, intended or not, of the smoothness of our contemporary design culture. These magazine covers map out an era when architecture was simmering with new ideas. You\u2019re bound to leave the show with a nagging sense of what was lost as well as gained during the electronic juggernaut of the last three decades. 97 Kenmare Street, between Mulberry and Lafayette Streets, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, storefrontnews.org; closes tomorrow.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.\nSERGIO PREGO To take the fullest pleasure in the exhibition of sculptures and video by the Spanish artist Sergio Prego at Lehmann Maupin Gallery, you must stand perfectly still and quiet in front of \u201cBlack Monday\u201d (2006), a single-channel video of still life photographs of controlled fireworks explosions taken inside an abandoned factory in Bilbao, Spain (above). In all, the artist took more than a thousand photographs of 17 different explosions with 40 cameras. He then scanned them into a computer, cropped them and ran them together. He also composed what he calls \u201ca sequencing of sounds,\u201d a series of repeating ambient electronic noises that serve as the soundtrack. The results are a multifaceted representation of something that is usually invisible to the eye: explosion clouds immobilized in time and space, forming immensely beautiful sculptural shapes. It brings out the inner pyro in all of us. Sometimes these clouds even resemble dancing figures. It is as if you were looking at a three-dimensional sculpture in video, though a few frames later, the form magically evaporates. The video lasts only three and a half minutes, which gives you just enough time to get hooked before it starts all over again. It is like stepping into another dimension. (Sergio Prego, Lehmann Maupin Gallery, 540 West 26th Street, Chelsea, 212-255-2923, lehmannmaupin.com, through Feb. 10.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n \u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. \n(Roberta Smith)\n  COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) \n \u2605 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY\u2019 through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org.\n (Michael Kimmelman) \n \u2605 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,\u2019 through Feb. 19. This show\u2019s 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic\u2019s porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) \n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL \u2014 AN ARTIST\u2019S COUNTRY ESTATE,\u2019 through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house- museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound \u2014 and of the Tiffany residences preceding it \u2014 is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany\u2019s genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,\u2019 through March 4. Saul Steinberg\u2019s famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg\u2019s progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like \u201cFeet on Chair\u201d (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like \u201cStreet War (Cadavre Exquisis)\u201d (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)\n \u2605 MUSEUM OF ARTS & DESIGN: \u2018SIMPLY DROOG: 10 + 3 YEARS OF CREATING DISCUSSION AND INNOVATION,\u2019 through Jan. 14. Droog Design, a many-headed, loosely affiliated collective of usually, but not entirely, Dutch designers and architects has probably generated more discussion than innovation in its 13 years of existence. Presented in a free-flowing, Droog-designed layout, this show vigorously continues the process. It includes about 150 mostly domestic objects by scores of designers. Some are great, some are silly, some are Conceptual Art. But there is plenty to sink your teeth into, especially with help from the small free brochure containing label information and rationales for each item. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org. (Smith)\n \u2605 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG\u2019S NEW YORK,\u2019 through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg\u2019s eyes, could be monuments, too. You may think you know Steinberg\u2019s work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)\nONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: \u2018ATHENS-SPARTA,\u2019 through May 12. Painted vases, pottery, sculptured steles, tiny carved figures, writings inscribed on stone and a selection of coins are among the nearly 300 objects in this show, whose first section begins with objects from both cities during the Geometric Period (1050-700 B.C.) Two other sections deal with the on-again, off-again relationship between the cities in the fifth century B.C. As society evolved from tribal to civil and felt the first stirrings of democracy during the Archaic Period (650-480 B.C.), rigid geometrical motifs were succeeded by more human forms, like the kouroi and korai, the stone or bronze statues, sometimes life-size, representing young men and women and symbolizing a new emphasis on the individual. On view from the sixth century B.C. are two small Attic representations of kourai, dressed statues of maidens, said to represent the Athenian aristocracy in rites celebrating the goddess Athena. Carved in stone, with long, braided hair (one is headless, but her braids are visible) and beautifully articulated drapery that clings to their bodies, they disappeared as a type after the Persian wars. 645 Fifth Avenue, near 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) \n \u2605 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER,\u2019  through Jan. 15. With 46 artists and a mix of usual and unusual suspects, this exhibition forms a black hole in which Dada, Fluxus, Punk, Pop, Conceptual and Neo-Conceptual mingle like cackling furies along with Performance art, feminism, abject art and various forms of appropriation. While its dour tone becomes a bit relentless, it is admirably consistent and shows artists grappling with reality, which has its own kind of comfort. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)\n  P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018THE GOLD STANDARD,\u2019 through Jan 15. Gold is both color and subject in this glittering, pertinent show, installed on creamy yellow walls. Even though a generally dim view of contemporary society prevails, it is scary how good gold makes everything look. (See above.) (Smith) \n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018KIKI SMITH: A GATHERING, 1980-2005,\u2019 through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum\u2019s black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith\u2019s art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org.\n (Holland Cotter)\nLast Chance\nAMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: \u2018A DEAF ARTIST IN EARLY AMERICA: THE WORLDS OF JOHN BREWSTER JR.,\u2019 Few Early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Mr. Brewster was born deaf in an era before remedial help or a common sign language existed. The case the show makes that Mr. Brewster\u2019s disability is reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018LOOKING BACK FROM GROUND ZERO: IMAGES FROM THE BROOKLYN MUSEUM COLLECTION\u2019  This show presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, \u201cBuilding the World Trade Center,\u201d produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. ( Cotter)\n\u2605 FRICK COLLECTION: \u2018DOMENICO TIEPOLO (1727-1804): A NEW TESTAMENT\u2019 The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattista, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary\u2019s mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)\nINTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018ECOTOPIA: THE SECOND I.C.P. TRIENNIAL OF PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO\u2019 Punctuated by big, black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of Al Gore\u2019s \u201cInconvenient Truth.\u201d The work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered. Along the way, some of the current uses for, and technical developments in, photography and video are surveyed, adding to the impression that the I.C.P.\u2019s focus on camera-related media, coupled with its curators\u2019 determination to be purposefully topical, sidesteps many of the pitfalls of the biennial-triennial genre. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)\nMORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION\u2019 AND \u2018MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION\u2019 Memorializing Mozart\u2019s 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots, among them Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, Hubert Robert and Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Jacques-Louis David; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan\u2019s collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard\u2019s many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display \u2014 letters and musical scores, like the autograph manuscript of the \u201cHaffner\u201d Symphony performed at Mozart\u2019s first public concert in Vienna in 1783 \u2014 are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)\n\u2605 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY\u2019 Slavery, some would say, didn\u2019t really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the \u201960s, a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the \u201cEmancipation Approximation,\u201d as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 2 West 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) \u2605 A. L. STEINER: 1 MILLION PHOTOS, 1 EURO EACH (MINIMUM ORDER) AND UNBORROWED FROM THE EYE: LUKE DOWD, SCOTT MYLES, DAVID NOONAN, BRETT CODY ROGERS AND GILES ROUND Contrasts happen. In the outer gallery five young men explore what might be called Neo-Constructivist quasi-painting with a kind of desperate, post-punk glower. In the inner gallery A. L. Steiner\u2019s raunchy, out-there photographs show almost nothing but women having a blast being women. They avoid the all-too-usual connotations of exploitation and sensationalism that plague intimate, often sexual photographs, which is no mean achievement, politically or aesthetically. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9563, johnconnellypresents.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n \u2605 CHEYNEY THOMPSON: \u2018QUELQUES ASPECTS DE L\u2019ART BOURGEOIS: LA NON-INTERVENTION\u2019 A teasing, tantalizing, subtly beautiful show by one of the sharper young artists of the moment explores the tensions between street and studio, skill and skepticism, painting and nonpainting and culture and commerce with seemingly abstract canvases, photographs framed by folding street-vendor tables and tinted off-set lithographs of the gallery\u2019s storage shelves. The title translates as \u201cCertain Aspects of Bourgeois Art: Non-Intervention.\u201d Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8849; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n \u2605 ATELIER VAN LIESHOUT: SLAVECITY In this only partly satirical show, architectural scale models, drawings, sculpture, a map and an extensive business plan propose a highly efficient, completely self-sufficient city whose \u201cparticipants\u201d each have a desk job, a farm job and very little time off. The tyranny of it all is brought home in the second gallery, which contains the \u201cMidi Disciplinator,\u201d a cell built to accommodate 18 people working in shifts, filing logs into sawdust for no good reason. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n  \u2605 \u2018WHEN THE REVOLUTION COMES\u2019 The artist Michael St. John has brought some interesting people together in this scrappy, savory group show. It\u2019s great to revisit Nancy Grossman\u2019s leather-bound heads, looking as radical as they did 30 years ago, and Holt Quentel\u2019s distressed gray banners from the 1980s, out of view since but looking right, right now. Strong young artists like Nate Lowman, Joshua Weintraub and Josh White sustain growing reputations, and a bevy of less familiar figures look good. Also in the gallery: a small solo of vivacious, minutely detailed drawings by Josedgardo Granados that bring pre-Columbian and post-Columbian worlds together in a cultural and psychic revolution still in progress. Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts, 508 West 26th Street, Suite 5A, Chelsea, (212) 463-8500, kathleencullenfinearts.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) \n\u2605 THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: MARK GROTJAHN Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shieldlike frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes on Sunday.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \n\u2018MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE\u2019 Brightening our day is the arrival of the Madison Square Park Conservancy\u2019s public-art series. This year the installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures \u2014 \u201cConjoined\u201d and \u201cDefunct\u201d \u2014 and a glacierlike boulder, \u201cErratic,\u201d by Roxy Paine, a conceptual artist who often juxtaposes nature and modern industrialization. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. They are familiar but inescapably strange. The work that captures your immediate attention is \u201cConjoined,\u201d right, a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. \u201cConjoined\u201d is an eerily apt emblem for our era\u2019s obsession with the promises of cloning and genetic enhancement. As for Mr. Paine, no other artist I know so poetically addresses the fraught intersection of earth and art. (Through Dec. 31, Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, 212-538-4689, www.madisonsquarepark.org.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n\u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. \n(Roberta Smith)\u2605 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018GLOBAL FEMINISMS,\u2019 through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn\u2019t venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago\u2019s indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Nearly devoid of significant painting and sculpture and Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn\u2019t keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Smith)BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand\u2019s strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)FRICK COLLECTION: \u2018GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,\u2019 through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers raking and reaping grain, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org.\n (Glueck)\n GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,\u2019 through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat\u2019s invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) \n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Holland Cotter)\n \u2605 JAPAN SOCIETY: \u2018AWAKENINGS: ZEN FIGURE PAINTING IN MEDIEVAL JAPAN,\u2019 through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Cotter)\nTHE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: \u2018NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)\n \u2605 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018KING OF FASHION,\u2019 through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) \u201cDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition \u2014 the latest effort from the Met\u2019s esteemed Costume Institute \u2014 does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation that is rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) \n THE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,\u2019 through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures \u2014 and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella\u2019s importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)\nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)\n MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,\u2019 through June 17. Even in the contemporary art world the symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of \u201cLas Huelgas Apocalypse\u201d (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery\u2019s perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. \n(Andrea K. Scott)\u2605 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: \u2018THE DISAPPEARED (LOS DESAPARECIDOS),\u2019 through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter)\n MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,\u2019 through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea \u2014 the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture \u2014 should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern\u2019s paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses \u201cperplexing questions,\u201d nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)\u2605 NEUE GALERIE: \u2018VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,\u2019 through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show\u2019s most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: \u201cSelf-Portrait With Straw Hat\u201d (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery\u2019s vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh\u2019s \u201cBedroom\u201d from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele\u2019s obvious homage, \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Bedroom in Neulengbach,\u201d painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) \n THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL,\u2019 through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world\u2019s latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi\u2019s \u201cEndless Column\u201d as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, \u2018WHERE WERE WE,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,\u2019 through Aug. 27. During the middle decades of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, Kirstein endorsed, among others, the artists in the show here. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein\u2019s brother-in-law, and Pavel Tchelitchew. The show also includes Walker Evans. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein\u2019s taste clearly hasn\u2019t won the day, but victory is not everything in matters of artistic rank. If the art isn\u2019t all great, it\u2019s never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. (See above.) \n(Michael Kimmelman) \n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018TARYN SIMON,\u2019 through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America\u2019s underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for \u201cThe Innocents,\u201d a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from \u201cReturn of the Jedi,\u201d at George Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) \nGalleries: Uptown\nCLAUDE MONET (1840-1926): A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL WILDENSTEIN AND KATIA GRANOFF This exhibition of nearly 60 paintings by one of the most beloved painters in the world feels a little like having dinner with a celebrity. The gallery setting eliminates the usual distance; the startling intimacy allows you to experience afresh the momentum and innovations of Monet\u2019s astounding trajectory in the span of three small galleries. Basically, it is a chance to encounter, up close and in detail, the evolving ways of seeing and painting that established the originality, historical importance and continuing irresistibility of Monet\u2019s art. It should not be missed. Wildenstein & Company, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through June 15. (Smith)\nGalleries: SoHo\n\u2605 \u2018GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE\u2019 The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called \u201cdrawings without paper\u201d: semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they\u2019re out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego\u2019s art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. \n(Cotter) \nGalleries: Chelsea\n\u2605 \u2018REBEL, REBEL: REMEMBERING KARLHEINZ WEINBERGER (1921-2006)\u2019 The self-taught Swiss photographer Karlheinz Weinberger, who died last year at 81, began his career taking pictures for a gay club in Zurich, but found his true subject in rebellious, working-class teenagers who dressed to shock in the 1960s and \u201970s. The Weinberger pictures in this show are fairly tame, as if chosen to complement the cooled-out work of the three younger artists \u2014 Ryan McGinley, Walter Pfeiffer and Collier Schorr \u2014 who surround him. But at his best, he\u2019s in a class by himself. Anna Kustera, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, kusteratiltongallery.com, through next Friday. (Cotter)\nLast Chance\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL \u2014 AN ARTIST\u2019S COUNTRY ESTATE\u2019 Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house- museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound, is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany\u2019s genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018KATRIN SIGURDARDOTTIR: HIGH PLANE V\u2019 Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir\u2019s \u201cHigh Plane V,\u201d a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday. (Benjamin Genocchio)\n\u2605 JOHN ZURIER: PAINTINGS It may be a bit late in the game for sincere monochrome paintings, but this San Francisco artist, who made a wan impression at the 2002 Whitney Biennial and is now having his solo debut, often pulls it off. Mainly, he refuses to be programmatic. His colors range from black to bright. The proportions of his canvases are constantly shifting. And his brushwork is an active, varied ingredient, free of bombast. To some extent he reiterates the monochrome the way James McNeill Whistler foretold it, with a bit too much misty preciousness, perhaps, but with genuine feeling. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0441, www.peterblumgallery.com/soho.html; closes tomorrow. (Smith)",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \nASSUME VIVID ASTRO FOCUS: \u2018A VERY ANXIOUS FEELING\u2019 The artists\u2019 collective known as Assume Vivid Astro Focus takes over John Connelly Presents this month with a slightly ridiculous ensemble: an installation of wrapped objects and text-based 3-D wallpaper covering the gallery walls, ceiling and floor; a dark subterranean corridor of pulsing music and flashing neon sculptures; and a cordoned-off room of psychedelic wallpaper, sculptures, video, balloons, streamers and stuffed toys. The room is used for periodic, often bawdy performances, which are part of the installation. Audience members slip under sheaths attached to wallpaper, left, to look through peepholes for a view of the room. I saw Philly, a gender-confused romantic who likes to sing, dance and lament lost loves. The show over all is the antithesis of the polished displays in pristine white galleries that abound throughout Chelsea, and in some ways that is the point. The wallpaper, music, flashing lights, 3-D glasses and other gizmos are used to immerse viewers in a world in which layers of images and ideas collide. Sometimes it can all seem like nonsense, a contrived mess by a bunch of small-minded, overcaffeinated adolescents. But it also paints a vision of what, to some, paradise might be: a playful Technicolor world of roaming, free-formed ideas. (Through June 30, John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, 212-337-9563, www.johnconnellypresents.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n? AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith) \n? ASIA SOCIETY: GLASS, GILDING, AND GRAND DESIGN: ART OF SASANIAN IRAN (224-642), through May 20. This glinting, glowing show is a reduction of a much larger Paris exhibition that included material from Iranian museums impossible to bring to the United States. With some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, this is still substantial and the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)\n? BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018GLOBAL FEMINISMS,\u2019 through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn\u2019t venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago\u2019s indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Nearly devoid of significant painting and sculpture and Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn\u2019t keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Smith)\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin. Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand\u2019s strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)\nCOOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)\nFRICK COLLECTION: \u2018GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,\u2019 through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers raking and reaping grain, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Glueck)\n GREY ART GALLERY: \u2018BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O\u2019DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND,\u2019 through July 14. Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O\u2019Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It\u2019s a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today\u2019s most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart/. (Bridget L. Goodbody)\n GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,\u2019 through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat\u2019s invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Roberta Smith) \n ? JAPAN SOCIETY: \u2018AWAKENINGS: ZEN FIGURE PAINTING IN MEDIEVAL JAPAN,\u2019 through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Holland Cotter)\n THE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: \u2018NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)\n ? THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) \nTHE MET: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck) \n* THE MET: \u2018VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,\u2019 through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Cotter)\n* THE MET: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (See above.) (Smith)\n? THE MET: \u2018LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL \u2014 AN ARTIST\u2019S COUNTRY ESTATE,\u2019 through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house- museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound, is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany\u2019s genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)\n* THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) \nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,\u2019 through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures \u2014 and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella\u2019s importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)\nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)\n MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,\u2019 through June 17. Even in the contemporary art world the symbolism of the Book of Revelation has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of \u201cLas Huelgas Apocalypse\u201d (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery\u2019s perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. \n(Andrea K. Scott)? EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: \u2018THE DISAPPEARED (LOS DESAPARECIDOS),\u2019 through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter)\n MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018ARTISTIC COLLABORATIONS: 50 YEARS OF UNIVERSAL LIMITED ART EDITIONS,\u2019 through May 21. This exhibition observes the half-century milestone for Universal Limited Art Editions in West Islip, N.Y., and its association with the Museum of Modern Art. The museum has acquired one print from every edition made at Universal, more than 1,200 works by nearly 50 artists. Prints by 12 artists are in this show. Among them are lithographs by Jasper Johns, mostly from the 1960s, with his signature maps and flags. Robert Rauschenberg is represented primarily by lithographs from the 1960s that combine found images of figures like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson with the freehand scrawling associated with Abstract Expressionism. It\u2019s hard to fault an exhibition that features prints by masters like Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg and Kiki Smith. But given the somewhat precarious position of prints in the contemporary art world, and with many artists opting to go digital, the inclusion of younger artists would make a good argument that traditional printmaking is still relevant and holds possibilities for this generation. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nMOMA: \u2018COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,\u2019 through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea \u2014 the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture \u2014 should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern\u2019s paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses \u201cperplexing questions,\u201d nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (See above.) (Smith)\n? NEUE GALERIE: \u2018VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,\u2019 through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show\u2019s most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: \u201cSelf-Portrait With Straw Hat\u201d (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery\u2019s vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh\u2019s \u201cBedroom\u201d from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele\u2019s obvious homage, \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Bedroom in Neulengbach,\u201d painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) \nP.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018KATRIN SIGURDARDOTTIR: HIGH PLANE V,\u2019 through May 21. Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir\u2019s \u201cHigh Plane V,\u201d a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)\n THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL,\u2019 through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world\u2019s latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi\u2019s \u201cEndless Column\u201d as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Goodbody)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE,\u2019 through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is \u201cSplitting.\u201d To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark\u2019s formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018TARYN SIMON,\u2019 through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America\u2019s underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for \u201cThe Innocents,\u201d a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from \u201cReturn of the Jedi,\u201d at George Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) \nGalleries: Uptown\n CLAUDE MONET (1840-1926): A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL WILDENSTEIN AND KATIA GRANOFF This exhibition of nearly 60 paintings by one of the most beloved painters in the world feels a little like having dinner with a celebrity. The gallery setting eliminates the usual distance; the startling intimacy allows you to experience afresh the momentum and innovations of Monet\u2019s astounding trajectory in the span of three small galleries. Basically, it is a chance to encounter, up close and in detail, the evolving ways of seeing and painting that established the originality, historical importance and continuing irresistibility of Monet\u2019s art. It should not be missed. Wildenstein & Company, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through June 15. (Smith)\nGalleries: 57th Street\n ? KATHY BUTTERLY: BETWEEN A ROCK AND A SOFT PLACE Although she is a little off her game here, this extraordinarily talented ceramic sculptor continues to impress with exquisitely detailed, radiantly colored, art historically aware, discreetly lascivious little pieces, especially if you have never seen her work before. Still, the question of whether it isn\u2019t time for a change hangs over the proceedings. Tibor deNagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through May 19. (Smith)\n Galleries: SoHo\n ? \u2018GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE\u2019 The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called \u201cdrawings without paper\u201d: semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they\u2019re out of this world, and this survey gives a sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego\u2019s art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) \n? GORDON MATTA-CLARK/ RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA A study in the history of participatory, user-friendly art, this exhibition juxtaposes re-creations of Matta-Clark\u2019s 1972 \u201cOpen House,\u201d a walk-in installation-piece-in-a-dumpster, with Mr. Tiravanija\u2019s \u201cUntitled 1992 (Free),\u201d a soup kitchen serving free Thai curry restaged in a full-scale plywood replica of the SoHo gallery in which it first occurred. Both works disrupt normal gallery operations. Cans of spray paint in the Matta-Clark invite the viewer to make art; the free lunch next door creates an instant community and restates the generosity at the core of most art-making in purely nutritional terms. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com, through May 19. (Smith)\nGalleries: Other\n ? SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES ...  If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early \u201970s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, through Sept. 10. (Smith)\nLast Chance\n ? AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: MART\u00edN RAM\u00edREZ,  Ram\u00edrez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color, and an unforgettable cast of characters. But most of all, he had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. In addition to being one of the season\u2019s best exhibitions and the first of his work in a New York museum, this show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)\n ? JO BAER Ms. Baer is best known for her immaculate early Minimalist paintings and for a 1983 statement in which she declared that the realities of post-1960s power politics had rendered abstraction irrelevant. By that point she had moved to Europe where, in her 80s, she still lives. And she had started painting the figure, which she continues to do with verve, on the evidence of this quietly vehement show. Alexander Gray Associates, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 1019, Chelsea, (212) 399-2636; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n ? LILY LUDLOW Best known as a designer for Imitation of Christ and Somnus, Ms. Ludlow offers a handful of draftsmanly paintings for this solo show. Done on faint dark lines on a white ground, each group picture presents nude, semiclassical figures entangled in what appear to be ethereal, sadistic ballets. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, Chinatown, (212) 925-4631, canadanewyork. com; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)\n  ? LAZHAR MANSOURI: \u2018PORTRAITS OF A VILLAGE: 1950-70\u2019 Mansouri (1932-1985) was born in northeastern Algeria and apprenticed to a local portrait photographer, then set up a studio of his own. Townspeople and neighbors came to have portraits made, either to celebrate an occasion \u2014 a birth, a graduation, a military induction \u2014 or to document a relationship and create personal keepsakes. The pictures at Westwood, all recent prints and larger than the originals would have been, range over 20 years. Whether approached as social and political documents or as objects of beauty, they are moving, burning, life-enlarging things. Westwood Gallery, 568 Broadway, SoHo, (212) 925-5700; closes tomorrow . (Cotter) \nMUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: \u2018POSTMILLENNIAL BLACK MADONNA\u2019 This group show of young artists takes various approaches to the female figure as myth and symbol in contemporary African-American cultures. 80 Hanson Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) \n? RICHARD OELZE: PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS FROM THE 1950S & 1960S Nearly two dozen paintings in the first United States show of this little-known German Surrealist introduce an introvert with a penchant for grisaille grottolike structures that seem built on air, and for soft, fleshy forms that sometimes have eyes or reveal hidden faces or figures. Max Ernst is a big influence, and Pavel Tchelitchew an obvious analogy, but the exquisite rendering and pervasive unquiet are Oelze\u2019s alone. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444; closes tomorrow. (Smith) \nONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: \u2018ATHENS-SPARTA,\u2019 Painted vases, pottery, sculptured steles, tiny carved figures, writings inscribed on stone and a selection of coins are among the nearly 300 objects in this show, whose first section begins with pieces from both cities during the Geometric Period (1050-700 B.C.). Two other sections deal with the on-again, off-again relationship between the cities in the fifth century B.C., Greece\u2019s glory years, and with the wars they fought: the Persian Wars (about 500 to 449 B.C.) and the Peloponnesian War (431 to 404 B.C.). As society evolved from tribal to civil and felt the first stirrings of democracy during the Archaic Period (650 to 480 B.C.), rigid geometrical motifs were succeeded by more human forms, like the kouroi and korai, the stone or bronze statues, sometimes life-size, representing young men and women and symbolizing a new emphasis on the individual. 645 Fifth Avenue, near 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448; closes tomorrow. (Glueck)\n? THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: JEFF WALL. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can\u2019t stop looking at them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org, closes Monday. (Smith)\n ? \u2018PRIME TIME: MICKALENE THOMAS AND SHINIQUE SMITH\u2019  A sparkling double-header by two very different artists with much in common. In paintings encrusted with rhinestones, Ms. Thomas gives 1970s pin-up portraits of African-American women the shimmer of Byzantine mosaics. Ms. Smith turns bundles of cast-off clothes into floral bouquets of exotic patterning. Caren Golden Fine Art, 539 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-8304, carengoldenfineart.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n? HUNTER REYNOLDS: \u2018PATINA DU PREY\u2019S MEMORIAL DRESS, 1993-2007\u2019 In 1993 Hunter Reynolds \u2014 an artist and an H.I.V.-positive gay man \u2014 first performed as his alter ego, Patina du Prey, wearing a black ball gown inscribed with thousands of names of people who had died of AIDS. There were so many names that a second gown had to be made. It is in this heartbreaking show, along with the memorial books of names collected over the years, and blank books for recording names for a new dress. In a world littered with bogus monuments, this is the real, worthy thing. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, third floor, SoHo, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n ? ANNE RYAN Anne Ryan sightings are infrequent these days, partly because the exquisite abstract collages that made her name in New York in the late 1940s and early \u201950s are scarce. There\u2019s just one in this small show at Teller, which is otherwise made up of prints and a few paintings. They are all components of a fascinating and understudied modernist career and life that should be kept on permanent view. Susan Teller Gallery, 568 Broadway, SoHo, (212) 941-7335; closes tomorrow.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \nJOAN MITCHELL: \u2018WORKS ON PAPER 1956-1992\u2019 Cheim & Read brightens up for summer with a dazzling display of works on paper by Joan Mitchell, the American abstract painter who lived and painted in the suburbs of Paris. Among the works on view is a selection of oil sketches on paper from the late 1950s, including the untitled 1958 work above, which all combine a bubbling energy and an angelic levity. Typically, they show a messy arrangement of explosive brush strokes. They are also surprisingly playful. Groups of watercolors and pastels from the 1970s and \u201980s are not so uniformly excellent, but a showing of early 1990s pastels suggests an impressive surge of creativity in her final years. The \u201990s pastels have a passionate intensity, so much so that they sometimes look as if they had been dashed off in a couple of minutes with a few rapid but sure twists and turns of the wrist. Then there are the fluorescent colors, which can take a little getting used to for those more familiar with the muted and more tasteful palette of her earlier years. Over all the show doesn\u2019t exactly tell us anything new about this artist, but the work is so engaging and diverting that in the end it doesn\u2019t really matter. (Through tomorrow, Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-7727, cheimread.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n \u2605 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: \u2018THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early 20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)\u2605 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018GLOBAL FEMINISMS,\u2019 through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn\u2019t venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago\u2019s indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Nearly devoid of significant painting and sculpture and Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn\u2019t keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Smith)BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand\u2019s strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)GREY ART GALLERY: \u2018BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O\u2019DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND,\u2019 through July 14. Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O\u2019Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It\u2019s a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today\u2019s most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart/. (Bridget L. Goodbody)GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,\u2019 through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat\u2019s invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,\u2019 through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work\u2019s laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Holland Cotter)\nTHE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: \u2018NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter) \nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling \u201cdrew the line\u201d at C\u00e9zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso \u201cbad painters and fakers.\u201d Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting \u2014 and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\n \u2605 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018POIRET: KING OF FASHION,\u2019 through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) \u201cDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition \u2014 the latest effort from the Met\u2019s esteemed Costume Institute \u2014 does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith)* THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck)THE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,\u2019 through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures \u2014 and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella\u2019s importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)THE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith) * THE MET: \u2018VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,\u2019 through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice, the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Cotter) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,\u2019 through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His \u201cTorqued Ellipses\u201d and \u201cTorqued Toruses\u201d and other recent works like \u201cBand\u201d and \u201cSequence\u201d have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That\u2019s about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)\n MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,\u2019 through Sept. 4. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York\u2019s work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Goodbody)\nTHE NATIONAL ACADEMY: \u2018182ND ANNUAL: AN EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY ART,\u2019 through June 24. The National Academy has mounted annual exhibitions showcasing living American artists (as opposed to dead Europeans) since it was founded in 1826. The annuals now alternate between invitationals, including nonmembers, and years devoted to academicians, professional artists elected by their peers to be members of the National Academy. This is a members-only year, which means that the work is more conservative \u2014 or \u201ctraditional,\u201d if you like. Heavily weighted toward painting, the exhibition includes lots of heirs to Abstract Expressionism and scores of competent figurative paintings and Expressionist- and Impressionist-inspired still lifes and landscapes. Among the participants are Philip Pearlstein, William Bailey, Will Barnet, Melvin Edwards, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Richard Estes and Lois Dodd. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Schwendener)NEUBERGER MUSEUM OF ART: FUGITIVE ARTIST: THE EARLY WORK OF RICHARD PRINCE, 1974-77, through June 24. Mr. Prince is one of the most elusive, perverse and sardonic of all of the important appropriation artists to emerge in the early 1980s, so perhaps it is not surprising that he has boycotted this exhibition of little-known early work, all from public and private collections. But that doesn\u2019t stop the 50 pieces on view from revealing his roots in 1970s Conceptual Art; his progress from generic to original and radical; or the depth and duration of his fascination with language, photography, printmaking, the more banal forms of urban postwar Americana and a disconnected, decidedly male blankness. If anything, it increases his stature. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Smith)\u2605 NEUE GALERIE: \u2018VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,\u2019 through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show\u2019s most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: \u201cSelf-Portrait With Straw Hat\u201d (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery\u2019s vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh\u2019s \u201cBedroom\u201d from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele\u2019s obvious homage, \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Bedroom in Neulengbach,\u201d painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Schwendener)NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro-slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Edward Rothstein)THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL,\u2019 through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world\u2019s latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi\u2019s \u201cEndless Column\u201d as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Goodbody) WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,\u2019 through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein\u2019s brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein\u2019s taste clearly hasn\u2019t won the day, but it\u2019s never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,\u2019 through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter)Whitney Museum of American Art: \u2018Taryn Simon,\u2019 through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America\u2019s underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for \u201cThe Innocents,\u201d a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from \u201cReturn of the Jedi,\u201d at George Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody)\nGalleries: Uptown\n \u2018CONCEPTUAL PHOTOGRAPHY: 1964-1989\u2019 There are no surprising names in this intriguing little show of one or two works by nearly 30 artists from several generations and countries. But the works themselves are often unusual, especially on the early end, as is the richness with which various subjects and techniques ricochet among them. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through June 23. (Smith)\nGalleries: 57th Street\nPAUL PFEIFFER: \u2018LIVE FROM NEVERLAND\u2019 Michael Jackson\u2019s famously surreal statement regarding charges of child molestation is the subject of this impressive comeback from an artist known for tiny, cannily altered video loops that focus on the isolation of the long-distance celebrity. Narcissism achieves an unexpected grandeur as Mr. Jackson appears in one video, while his words are recited by a chorus of young men and women in another. Adding to the creepiness, the members of the chorus are age-ambiguous, seemingly suspended between childhood and adulthood. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 688-1585 , elproyecto.com, through June 22. (Smith) \u2605 PICASSO, BRAQUE AND EARLY FILM IN CUBISM Cubism and the first moving pictures emerged in the same decade. Coincidence? This thrilling exhibition doesn\u2019t think so. A dense display of major paintings, collages and prints; antique cameras and projectors; and snippets of film that Braque and Picasso are thought to have seen, it examines Cubism in the dim light and flickering images of the movie theater. It is radically reorienting to consider Cubism\u2019s fractured, revolving forms and transparencies as partly influenced by moving pictures. A few of the pictures even resemble movie cameras. Weirdest of all? Thinking of Analytical Cubism\u2019s pale, gleaming dabs of paint as dust motes caught in the projector\u2019s beam. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, pacewildenstein.com, through June 23. (Smith)\n MARC QUINN: \u2018SPHINX\u2019 This amusing, if somewhat disturbing, show presents Kate Moss as equal parts classical Greek sculpture, yoga devotee and SuperModel. It strikes a particularly contemporary chord in the way it addresses contemporary society\u2019s obsession with looking good and its confusion about how to get the inside (feelings, spirit, thoughts) to match the outside. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com, through June 30. (Goodbody)\nGalleries: SoHo\n \u2605 \u2018GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE\u2019 The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called \u201cdrawings without paper\u201d: semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they\u2019re out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego\u2019s art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) \nGalleries: Chelsea\n ART & LANGUAGE, STEPHANIE BROOKS, HELEN MIRRA, IAN WILSON In a four-artist show that is, to say the least, spare, the Minimal-Conceptual veterans Art & Language and Ian Wilson join forces with the relative newcomers Stephanie Brooks and Helen Mirra. For the most part, Art & Language sets the terms, first with \u201cIndex 003\u201d (1973), a kind of teaser about the impossibility of saying nothing, which reads in this context as a defense of the work on view. In addition, everyone else here takes lots of language into their art. Peter Blum Chelsea, 529 West 29th Street, (212) 244-6055, peterblumgallery.com, through June 23. (Smith)\nKATHE BURKHART: \u2018THE LIZ TAYLOR SERIES: SELECTIONS FROM 1983-2007\u2019 The term \u201cpost-feminism\u201d gains significance when looking at Kathe Burkhart\u2019s \u201cLiz Taylor Series\u201d paintings. Unlike 1970s feminist artists, Ms. Burkhart doesn\u2019t just celebrate famous women; she inhabits one. Ms. Taylor serves as a doppelganger for the artist in paintings that combine movie stills and tabloid images with collaged elements and text. Only a few of the 125 paintings in the series appear here, but they demonstrate how feminism can be retooled for every generation. Alexander Gray Associates, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 399-2636, alexandergray.com, through June 23. (Schwendener)\nJAMES CASEBERE: \u2018THE LEVANT\u2019 James Casebere is known for building architectural models and lighting and photographing them to look like actual spaces. His current show centers on architecture from the Levant, an area in the Eastern Mediterranean, and includes works that pay homage to Sinan, the great Ottoman architect, as well as a nocturnally lighted model of a neighborhood in Tripoli. Lush and beautiful and uncanny in their desolation, the works can also feel burdened with heavy-handed politics and historical narratives, or risk sliding into a kind of later-day Orientalism in which architecture, rather than nude women, plays the starring role. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, skny.com, through June 23. (Schwendener) \u2018IN DEFENSE OF ARDOR\u2019 For most of the 2000s, art pundits have campaigned to replace kvetchy postmodernism with a New Sincerity. By why an either/or proposition? Can\u2019t irony be ardent? Can\u2019t ardor be critically self-aware? Can\u2019t passion and reason coexist? In this group show they often do. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 929-5959, bellwethergallery.com, through June 30. (Cotter)\n* FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: PORTRAITS The works in this show reveal Mr. Clemente\u2019s relatively recent endeavors as a suave society portraitist, working on commission in single, daylong sittings. His subjects, while horizontal, don\u2019t so much recline as float toward the picture plane, surveying us with enormous eyes. The images can border on illustration, but sometimes color, space and personality collude to enchanting effect. Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929, through June 30. (Smith)ZOE STRAUSS: \u2018IF YOU READING THIS\u2019 The images by this Philadelphia photographer, installation artist and community advocate depict down-and-out people and places, and show what most Americans don\u2019t want to see. Her style is oddly intimate \u2014 post-Nan Goldin street photography \u2014 but it avoids sentimentality and has an instinctive grasp of both human drama and pictorial composition. The images are not without tenderness, but their harsh, unblinking force is a bit like a punch in the face. Silverstein Photography, 535 West 24th Street, (212) 627-3930, silversteinphotography.com, through June 23. (Smith)\nGalleries: Other\n \u2605 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: \u2018PREIS BILDER\u2019 Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn\u2019t get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) \n SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES ...  If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early \u201970s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, through Sept. 10. (Smith)\n \u2605 \u2018THE MUSEUM OF CRIME AND THE MUSEUM OF GOD\u2019 Put together by the writer Luc Sante from material from his own collection, this assemblage \u2014 with holy cards and vintage mug shots; protective amulets and 1930s crime novels; photographs of murder scenes and of river baptisms \u2014 is essentially about his life and makes a transfixing show. Apexart, 291 Church Street, between Walker and White Streets, TriBeCa, apexart.org, through June 23. (Cotter) \n \u2018THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING: PERSPECTIVES ON THE ART MARKET\u2019 Marcel Duchamp, who tried to redefine art as an active tool for thinking rather than a passive object of looking, hovers like a damaged angel over this think-piece of a group show organized by the 2006-7 Helena Rubenstein Curatorial Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program. The Art Gallery, City University of New York Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, gc.cuny.edu, through June 24. (Cotter)\n CHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: \u2018ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY\u2019 The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film\u2019s \u201cfourth wall\u201d by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet.\u201d Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters\u2019s \u201cMerzbau\u201d to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch\u2019s. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener)\nPublic Art\nMAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures \u2014 \u201cConjoined\u201d and \u201cDefunct\u201d \u2014 and a glacierlike boulder, \u201cErratic,\u201d by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is \u201cConjoined,\u201d a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin, and the other\u2019s end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, www.madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio)Last Chance\n \u2605 \u2018BENEATH THE UNDERDOG\u2019 This ultra-cool, downtown-comes-uptown affair is one of the better gallery shows of the year. And full credit goes to its artist-curators, Nate Lowman and Adam McEwen. They\u2019ve turned Gagosian\u2019s six-room space into a mini-museum of objects that speak of the base, the gross, the fallen, the ruined, the failed. A second show, \u201cMafia (or One Unopened Packet of Cigarettes),\u201d is tucked inside. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, between 76th and 77th Streets, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n \u2018CROSSCURRENTS: DURER TO PICASSO\u2019 A show of prints and drawings that makes imaginative pairings of older works with those of 20th-century artists who are sometimes cued by their contemporaries as well as their ancestors. The evidence is keen in, for example, Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s \u201cTemptation of St. Anthony\u201d (1561), a fervidly drawn scene of grotesque beings and fantastic doings placed near two later Surrealist renditions: a biomorphic figment by Andre Masson, \u201cThe Genius of the Species\u201d (1942), and Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s etching \u201cLandscape in the Manner of Arcimboldo\u201d (1934), a biomorphic-geometric vision. A beguiling show. David Tunick, 19 East 66th Street, (212) 570-0090, tunickart.com; closes today. (Glueck)\n\u2605 JAPAN SOCIETY: \u2018AWAKENINGS: ZEN FIGURE PAINTING IN MEDIEVAL JAPAN,\u2019 Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers an unusually broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org, closes on Sunday. (Cotter) \n \u2605 LOUISE KRUGER: SCULPTURE, 1950S TO THE PRESENT This 21-work survey of mostly carved wood sculpture supplies another chunk in the history of postwar American art. Influenced by folk art and trained for a year by a shipbuilder, Ms. Kruger developed her art sculpture by cutting woodblocks for prints, as an enormous example here attests. Her life-size figures, portrait busts and political asides are in step with other artists of her generation, including Bill King, Marisol, Alex Katz and Ann Arnold. But her works have their own formal quirks, telling abbreviations, lustrous finishes and quiet, watchful force. Lori Bookstein Fine Art, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 750-0949, loribooksteinfineart.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n \u2605 JIM LEE: \u2018ALTAMONT\u2019 This young artist takes tips from lots of approved sources \u2014 Robert Ryman, Richard Tuttle and Ellsworth \u2014 but has some ideas of his own about the art and craft of building paintings and the play between the literal and the visual. The smaller works tend to be better because they are more complicated, but on the whole, and as a whole, the show is a beautiful start.

(Smith)\nMORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,\u2019 Even in the contemporary art world The symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of \u201cLas Huelgas Apocalypse\u201d (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery\u2019s perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org, closes on Sunday. (Andrea K. Scott)\u2605 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: \u2018THE DISAPPEARED (LOS DESAPARECIDOS),\u2019 . The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)\nCLAUDE MONET (1840-1926): A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL WILDENSTEIN AND KATIA GRANOFF This exhibition of nearly 60 paintings by one of the most beloved painters in the world feels a little like having dinner with a celebrity.

(Smith)STOREFRONT FOR ART AND ARCHITECTURE: \u2018CCCP: COSMIC COMMUNIST CONSTRUCTIONS PHOTOGRAPHED\u2019 This show is packed with obscure architectural gems. Covering a period ignored by academics and mainstream architects, it relies almost exclusively on the photographs of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chaubin, who spent five years traveling across the former Soviet Union, uncovering forgotten architectural works in cities like Tbilisi, Yalta and Yerevan. The results are a revelation. Among the outright gems is Georgy Chakhava\u2019s 1975 Roads Ministry building, a monumental grid of interlocking concrete forms rising on a steep, wooded site in Tbilisi, Georgia. Set on an incline between two highways, the building\u2019s heavy, cantilevered forms reflect the Soviet-era penchant for heroic scale. Yet they also relate sensitively to their context, celebrating the natural landscape that flows directly underneath the building. What\u2019s refreshing about this exhibition is its lack of an ideological agenda: it is open to all sorts of possibilities. The Gaud\u00edesque romanticism of a sanitarium in Druskininkai, Lithuania, for example, spins the aesthetic off in yet another direction. Compelling and easy to digest, this show piques our interest in ways that some larger institutions, ever more averse to risk, often fail to do. 97 Kenmare Street, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, storefrontnews.org; closes tomorrow. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)\u2018SUBLIME CONVERGENCE: GOTHIC TO THE ABSTRACT\u2019 This gathering of old master and contemporary paintings reminds us how the art of the past can resonate with that of the present. The emphasis is on the spiritual, with objects by a number of medieval gold-ground painters \u2014 who covered panels with gold leaf to form a radiant background for their imagery \u2014 dramatically displayed along with more recent art of a meditative nature. (Gregorian chant plays softly in the background.) One salient example is Taddeo di Bartolo\u2019s \u201cSt. Francis of Assisi\u201d (about 1395), with its simple Gothic niche as background for the saint in his nuanced bluish-gray robe, accompanied by Brice Marden\u2019s \u201cNumber 1\u201d (1963), another Minimalist composition of four gridded rectangles, each bluntly painted in a shade of gray, that seems to reflect the intensity of the earlier picture. Comparisons like this can go awry, but for the most part this show works. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, rlfeigen.com,; closes today. (Glueck) NICK Z./KAI ALTHOFF: \u2018WE ARE BETTER FRIENDS FOR IT\u2019 The latest variation on the collaborative trashed-gallery convention is a strikingly beautiful, if funky, cavelike environment punctuated by artfully messy tableaus in stark white containers that suggest crash pads and studios while functioning almost like paintings.

Ram\u00edrez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color, and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty). But most of all, Ram\u00edrez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. In addition to being one of the season\u2019s best exhibitions and the first of his work in a New York museum, this show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. \n(Smith) \u2605 ASIA SOCIETY: GLASS, GILDING, AND GRAND DESIGN: ART OF SASANIAN IRAN (224-642), through May 20. This glinting, glowing show is a reduction of a much larger Paris exhibition that included material from Iranian museums impossible to bring to the United States. With some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, this is still substantial and the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)\n \u2605 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018GLOBAL FEMINISMS,\u2019 through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn\u2019t venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago\u2019s indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Nearly devoid of significant painting and sculpture and Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn\u2019t keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Smith)\n BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. (The painting, now making a guest appearance here, was sold by the New York Public Library in 2005 to the forthcoming Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark.) A founder of the Hudson River School but one of its less dramatic painters, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin, rather than the metaphorical view held by Cole and other Hudson River artists that its representation ought to express God\u2019s sublimity. Obeying Ruskin\u2019s call for truth to nature, Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. If the show reveals some of Durand\u2019s weaknesses \u2014 repetitive themes and borrowings from other artists \u2014 it also reveals his strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. (See above.) \n(Grace Glueck)\n COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) \nFRICK COLLECTION: \u2018GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,\u2019 through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers raking and reaping grain, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. \n(Grace Glueck)INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON\u2019S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,\u2019 through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive \u2014 the \u201cposthumous\u201d exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the layout of the scrapbook as Cartier-Bresson originally organized the pictures. It surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org.\n (Michael Kimmelman) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018MARTIN MUNKACSI: THINK WHILE YOU SHOOT!\u2019 through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early \u201960s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. His sports photographs epitomized his special gift for action and movement: capturing a soccer ball just as it neared a goalie\u2019s outstretched hands or a motorcyclist at the instant he splashed through a pool of water. In 1928 he moved to Berlin, where the opportunities were better, and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. He became a celebrity in America. He photographed Fred Astaire dancing and Joan Crawford poolside. In the breezy layouts of Harper\u2019s Bazaar, the work looked brilliant. (See above.) (Kimmelman) \u2605 JAPAN SOCIETY: \u2018AWAKENINGS: ZEN FIGURE PAINTING IN MEDIEVAL JAPAN,\u2019 through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. And it covers an unusually broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. \n(Holland Cotter)\n THE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: \u2018NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)\n \u2605 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * THE MET: \u2018VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,\u2019 through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice, the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) \n(Cotter)\n* THE MET: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (See above.) (Smith) \u2605 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: \u2018THE DISAPPEARED (LOS DESAPARECIDOS),\u2019 through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter)\n MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: \u2018POSTMILLENNIAL BLACK MADONNA,\u2019 through May 13. This group show of young artists takes various approaches to the female figure as myth and symbol in contemporary African-American cultures. 80 Hanson Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492. A complementary show is at the Skylight Gallery of the Restoration Plaza, 1368 Fulton Street, third floor, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 636-6976, through May 5, mocada.org or postbme.com. (Cotter)\n THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,\u2019 through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea \u2014 the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture \u2014 should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern\u2019s paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses \u201cperplexing questions,\u201d nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) \u2605 MOMA: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can\u2019t stop looking at them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org (Smith)\n\u2605 NEUE GALERIE: \u2018VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,\u2019 through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show\u2019s most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: \u201cSelf-Portrait With Straw Hat\u201d (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery\u2019s vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh\u2019s \u201cBedroom\u201d from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele\u2019s obvious homage, \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Bedroom in Neulengbach,\u201d painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE,\u2019 through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. He also saut\u00e9ed a Polaroid of a Christmas tree in grease. The copy he sent to Robert Smithson, golden brown on the outside, is here too, and none too appetizing, I might add. At the center of the exhibition is \u201cSplitting.\u201d To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark\u2019s formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018TARYN SIMON,\u2019 through June 24. There\u2019s something quintessentially American about the way this photography exhibition examines the culture\u2019s irreconcilable differences. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics. Yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America\u2019s underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for \u201cThe Innocents,\u201d a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later, in some cases after decades in prison, cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from \u201cReturn of the Jedi,\u201d at George Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) \n (Bridget Goodbody) \n \u2605 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LORNA SIMPSON,\u2019 through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson\u2019s career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as \u201cidentity art,\u201d but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) \n (Cotter)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n * NANCY BROOKS BRODY Some of the abstract \u201cpaintings\u201d in this beautiful, reticent solo show have been stitched with cotton thread onto paper, creating patterns of linear ridges. Others are made from painstakingly detailed pencil patterns on plaster. The effect is like having Agnes Martin\u2019s bars and bands transmitted as sound waves, a soft, vibrant humming. Ms. Brody\u2019s sculptures of stacked bars of bath soap, used but not used up, are right in the poetic picture. Virgil de Vold\u00e8re Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Room 416, (212) 343-9694, virgilgallery.com, through April 28. (Cotter)\n \u2605 WALTER DE MARIA Counting and space \u2014 important to both Minimal and Conceptual Art \u2014 come together with unusual clarity, if a bit too much in the way of gleaming metal, in two large installations by the creator of \u201cThe Lightning Field\u201d earthwork. Both pieces consist of several dozen shiny meter-long stainless-steel rods presented in spaces that couldn\u2019t be much more pristine. Experience the spatial levitation and note the number of sides on the rods; in both cases, they increase row by row. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, and 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com., through May 5. (Smith)\n ORLY GENGER: MASSSPEAK More than three tons of nylon climbing rope knotted into mats and arranged in mounds that sometimes touch the ceiling add to the tradition of filling gallery space with unusual quantities of just one thing for an effect that is at once dour and hilarious, like a playground designed by a Welsh miner. Larissa Goldston, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 206-7887, larissagoldston.com., through May 5. (Smith)\n \u2605 GORDON MATTA-CLARK/ RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA A study in the history of participatory, user-friendly art, this exhibition juxtaposes re-creations of Matta-Clark\u2019s 1972 \u201cOpen House,\u201d a walk-in installation-piece-in-a-dumpster, with Mr. Tiravanija\u2019s \u201cUntitled 1992 (Free),\u201d a soup kitchen serving free Thai curry restaged in a full-scale plywood replica of the SoHo gallery in which it first occurred. Both works disrupt normal gallery operations. Cans of spray paint in the Matta-Clark invite the viewer to make art; the free lunch next door creates an instant community and restates the generosity at the core of most art-making in purely nutritional terms. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com, through May 19. (Smith)\n \u2605 JONATHAN MONK: \u2018SOME KIND OF GAME BETWEEN THIS AND THAT\u2019 As usual, this Conceptually inclined Scottish artist concentrates on sly tributes to, or plays on, works by other artists, among them Bruce Nauman, Chris Burden, John Baldessari and Ren\u00e9 Magritte. The slightest pieces are best, including drawings done on old books and \u201cThe Cheat,\u201d in which \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d consist of an early silent film accompanied by a boom box tuned to a classical music station. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com, through May 5.(Smith)\n \u2605 LAMAR PETERSON Best known for his fanciful, Pop-inflected paintings of African-American suburban life, this young painter smashes that subject to smithereens in his new work, a promising advancement that is already yielding rewards. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, fredericksfreisergallery.com, through April 28. (Cotter)\n JAMES TURRELL: \u2018LIGHT LEADINGS\u2019 From an artist known for meditative light installations, a show of sped-up versions made with computerized neon and holographic works reminiscent of Malevich abstractions. They amount to gorgeous, high-priced, high-tech equivalents of lava lamps, in which color comes either in diaphanous clouds or with hard edges. PaceWildenstein Gallery, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000, pacewildenstein.com, through April 28. (Smith)\nGalleries: Other\n\u2018GIFTS OF THE FOREST: NATIVE TRADITIONS IN WOOD AND BARK\u2019 Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that carry on tribal traditions, like the simple and beautiful wooden flute made in 1999 by Hawk Henires (Nipmuc) and adorned with an elegantly carved bird motif. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, carved bowls and spoons, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, birch bark canoe models, an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, ubs.com, through April 27. (Glueck) \n\u2605 \u2018THOMAS STRUTH: MAKING TIME\u2019 Through the 1990s, the German photographer Thomas Struth became an art world celebrity for his outsize, absorbing portraits of crowds interacting with artwork in the world\u2019s great museums. As a follow-up, he is presenting the American premiere of two new series of pictures of audiences beholding single masterpieces in the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid, and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The show, which cannily allows us to look safely at others looking at art, is one of the most visually sumptuous and thought-probing in the city. Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, mariangoodman.com, through April 28. (Benjamin Genocchio)\nLast Chance\n\u2605 CHELSEA ART MUSEUM: \u2018DANGEROUS BEAUTY\u2019 A somewhat timely update of a well-worn idea, this show of contemporary works in a variety of mediums by 18 artists examines the beauty myth in art, advertising and the fashion industry. Eloquent but blunt imagery of anorexic girls, chiseled male beefcake and close-ups of surgically deformed faces predominates, reminding us of the violent extremes to which some people will go in pursuit of society\u2019s ideal of beauty and a designer body. The rest of the show \u2014 often pointing an accusatory finger at skinny models, cosmetic labels and the mass media \u2014 feels familiar in its critique, but the basic premise about the ideology of beauty in our culture is beyond argument. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719, chelseaartmuseum.org., closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)\n  \u2605 JOAN JONAS An extraordinary double show from a performance-installation-video artist who emerged in the late 1960s and has only gotten better. The centerpiece is a walk-in-collage of sculpture, props and video projections derived from a new performance work, \u201cThe Shape, the Scent, the Feel of Things,\u201d accompanied by a film of the performance. Based on a memoir by the art historian Aby Warburg, and accompanied by music composed and played by the jazz pianist Jason Moran, it combines a Fluxus playfulness with task-oriented gestures of early \u201970s dance to achieve a mysterious visual poetry reminiscent of Joseph Cornell, decanted. Yvon Lambert New York, 550 West 21st Street and 564 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-3611, yvon-lambert.com; closes on Thursday. (Smith)\n\u2605 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975 Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this brave if confused exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show\u2019s 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal in their way to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins, mixing generations and levels of achievement and continuing the neglect of the main story. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) \u2605 \u2018PAINTINGS, FLAGS & IRON: HAITIAN ART FROM THE LAST FIFTY YEARS\u2019 This splendid exhibition offers total immersion in the originality and continued vitality of Haiti\u2019s self-taught artists. Works by well-known painters like Hector Hyppolite, Toussaint Auguste and Rigaud Benoit range across religion, history and everyday themes. They include still lifes, landscapes and Pierre Joseph Valcin\u2019s enthralling rendering of a maternity ward. The forged and welded sculptures of Georges Liautaud and Gabriel Bien-Aim\u00e9 are on a par with Bill Traylor\u2019s antic silhouette drawings. And there are no words for the extravagantly sequined and beaded flags depicting Voodoo spirits and saints, except fabulous. Edward Thorp Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6565, edwardthorpgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \n\u2018MEMORY COMES FROM DARK EXTENSION\u2019 Hints of Surrealism flit through Richard Tuttle\u2019s handsome and lovingly assembled small relief sculptures at Sperone Westwater. But Minimalism is the touchstone, as it has been throughout this 66-year-old artist\u2019s long, distinguished career as an improvisational objectmaker. In July 2005 he was honored with a retrospective that toured nationally. There is a poetic vision running through the present show, resulting in artworks that look both beautiful and intriguing. Each construction is made from simple materials (typically paper, plastic, wood, wire, foil, paint, pencil) and affixed to the wall with a miniature brace that projects it forward. From a distance the sculptures seem to be floating, like pieces of space debris. Up close you are reminded of the unstable scaffoldings of Picasso\u2019s object constructions and papiers coll\u00e9s (collages of pasted paper) and the delicate wood relief sculptures of Hans Arp. A consistent, individual technique links the approximately 60 works here: geometric shapes are cut from paper, folded in unusual ways, painted and then combined intuitively with other elements to create objects governed only by the limits of the artist\u2019s imagination. Neither labored nor facile, their grace, humility and dainty-poetic detail elicit depths of pleasure from the viewer. This is an inspiring, memorable show. (Through June 30, Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, 212-999-7337, speronewestwater.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n \u2605 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: \u2018THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)\u2605 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018GLOBAL FEMINISMS,\u2019 through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn\u2019t venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago\u2019s indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Nearly devoid of significant painting and sculpture and Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn\u2019t keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Smith)BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand\u2019s strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)GREY ART GALLERY: \u2018BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O\u2019DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND,\u2019 through July 14. Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O\u2019Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It\u2019s a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today\u2019s most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart/. (Bridget L. Goodbody)GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,\u2019 through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat\u2019s invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,\u2019 through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work\u2019s laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)\nTHE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: \u2018NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter) \nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,\u2019 through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling \u201cdrew the line\u201d at C\u00e9zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso \u201cbad painters and fakers.\u201d Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting \u2014 and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nTHE MET: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck)* THE MET: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with \u201cJourneys.\u201d Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter) \u2605 THE MET: NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA, through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter\u2019s mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic, 19th-century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch\u2019s talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018POIRET: KING OF FASHION,\u2019 through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) \u201cDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition \u2014 the latest effort from the Met\u2019s esteemed Costume Institute \u2014 does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith)* THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck)THE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,\u2019 through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures \u2014 and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella\u2019s importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)THE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)* THE MET: \u2018VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,\u2019 through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice , the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,\u2019 through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His \u201cTorqued Ellipses\u201d and \u201cTorqued Toruses\u201d and other recent works like \u201cBand\u201d and \u201cSequence\u201d have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That\u2019s about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,\u2019 through Sept. 4. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York\u2019s work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Goodbody)\u2605 NEUE GALERIE: \u2018VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,\u2019 through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show\u2019s most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: \u201cSelf-Portrait With Straw Hat\u201d (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery\u2019s vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh\u2019s \u201cBedroom\u201d from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele\u2019s obvious homage, \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Bedroom in Neulengbach,\u201d painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener)NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro-slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400,nyhistory.org. (Edward Rothstein)THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL,\u2019 through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world\u2019s latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi\u2019s \u201cEndless Column\u201d as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Goodbody)WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, \u2018WHERE WERE WE,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,\u2019 through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein\u2019s brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein\u2019s taste clearly hasn\u2019t won the day, but it\u2019s never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,\u2019 through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter)Galleries: 57th Street\nMARC QUINN: \u2018SPHINX\u2019 This amusing, if somewhat disturbing, show presents Kate Moss as equal parts classical Greek sculpture, yoga devotee and SuperModel. It strikes a particularly contemporary chord in the way it addresses contemporary society\u2019s obsession with looking good and its confusion about how to get the inside (feelings, spirit, thoughts) to match the outside. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com, through June 30. (Goodbody)\nGalleries: SoHo\n PETER FISCHLI AND DAVIS WEISS: BOOKS, EDITIONS AND THE LIKE Drawn primarily from the artists\u2019 archives, and including posters, multiples, books and layouts of books as well as videos \u2014 among them \u201cThe Way Things Go,\u201d their great chain-reaction-in-a-studio \u2014 this exhibition amounts to a rather complete if highly distilled retrospective of their consistently down-to-earth Duchampian view of life and art. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, through July 14. (Smith)\n\u2605 \u2018GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE\u2019 The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called \u201cdrawings without paper\u201d: semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they\u2019re out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego\u2019s art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) \nGalleries: Chelsea\n \u2018IN DEFENSE OF ARDOR\u2019 For most of the 2000s, art pundits have campaigned to replace kvetchy postmodernism with a New Sincerity. By why an either/or proposition? Can\u2019t irony be ardent? Can\u2019t ardor be critically self-aware? Can\u2019t passion and reason coexist? In this group show they often do. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 929-5959, bellwethergallery.com, through June 30. (Cotter)\n* FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: PORTRAITS The works in this show reveal Mr. Clemente\u2019s relatively recent endeavors as a suave society portraitist, working on commission in single, daylong sittings. His subjects, while horizontal, don\u2019t so much recline as float toward the picture plane, surveying us with enormous eyes. The images can border on illustration, but sometimes color, space and personality collude to enchanting effect. Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929, through June 30. (Smith) PETER FISCHLI AND DAVID WEISS: EQUILIBRES These photographs of ingenious balancing acts orchestrated from a host of everyday objects and detritus may be 20 years old, but they look as subversive and art-historically savvy as ever. Seeing them (about 80) in bulk underscores the artists\u2019 ability to create small universes out of next to nothing. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, through June 30. (Smith)\nGalleries: Other\n\u2605 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: \u2018PREIS BILDER\u2019 Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn\u2019t get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) \n SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES ...  If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early \u201970s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, through Sept. 10. (Smith)\nCHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: \u2018ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY\u2019 The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film\u2019s \u201cfourth wall\u201d by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet.\u201d Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters\u2019s \u201cMerzbau\u201d to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch\u2019s. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener)\nMAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures \u2014 \u201cConjoined\u201d and \u201cDefunct\u201d \u2014 and a glacierlike boulder, \u201cErratic,\u201d by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is \u201cConjoined,\u201d a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin, and the other\u2019s end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, www.madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio)Last Chance\n \u2605 ALISON BRADY: SWEET AFFLICTION Starring herself, the large color images of this young photographer seem descended from the sweetly kinky late Surrealism of Jimmy DeSana (1949-1990), especially in their penchant for conjuring otherness out of the oddest things, including luncheon meat, eggs and pantyhose. Massimo Audiello, 526 West 26th Street , Chelsea, (212) 675-9082; closes tomorrow. (Smith) \nART & LANGUAGE, STEPHANIE BROOKS, HELEN MIRRA, IAN WILSON In a four-artist show that is, to say the least, spare, the Minimal-Conceptual veterans Art & Language and Ian Wilson join forces with the relative newcomers Stephanie Brooks and Helen Mirra. For the most part, Art & Language sets the terms, first with \u201cIndex 003\u201d (1973), a kind of teaser about the impossibility of saying nothing, which reads in this context as a defense of the work on view. In addition, everyone else here takes lots of language into her art. Peter Blum Chelsea, 529 West 29th Street, (212) 244-6055, peterblumgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)KATHE BURKHART: \u2018THE LIZ TAYLOR SERIES: SELECTIONS FROM 1983-2007\u2019 The term \u201cpost-feminism\u201d gains significance when looking at Kathe Burkhart\u2019s \u201cLiz Taylor Series\u201d paintings. Unlike 1970s feminist artists, Ms. Burkhart doesn\u2019t just celebrate famous women; she inhabits one. Ms. Taylor serves as a doppelganger for the artist in paintings that combine movie stills and tabloid images with collaged elements and text. She is a channel for angst, rage and campy excess, ranting in a still from \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d or lounging on a bed in a painting based on a still lifted from \u201cCat on a Hot Tin Roof.\u201d Only a few of the 125 paintings in the series appear here, but they demonstrate how feminism can be retooled for every generation. Alexander Gray Associates, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 399-2636, alexandergray.com; closes tomorrow. (Schwendener) JAMES CASEBERE: \u2018THE LEVANT\u2019 James Casebere is known for building architectural models and lighting and photographing them to look like actual spaces. His current show centers on architecture from the Levant, an area in the Eastern Mediterranean, and includes works that pay homage to Sinan, the great Ottoman architect, as well as a nocturnally lighted model of a neighborhood in Tripoli. Lush and beautiful and uncanny in their desolation, the works can also feel burdened with heavy-handed politics and historical narratives, or risk sliding into a kind of later-day Orientalism in which architecture, rather than nude women, plays the starring role. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, skny.com, closes tomorrow. (Schwendener) \u2018CONCEPTUAL PHOTOGRAPHY: 1964-1989\u2019 There are no surprising names in this intriguing little show of one or two works by nearly 30 artists from several generations and countries. But the works themselves are often unusual, especially on the early end, as is the richness with which various subjects and techniques ricochet among them. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) DIDIER MASSARD: \u2018TERRITORIES\u2019 Didier Massard fabricates models of landscapes, seascapes and underwater scenes in his Paris studio and photographs them, without subsequent digital manipulation. The fakery was made more explicit in past shows. Here Mr. Massard explores primordial glaciers, wetlands and underwater worlds. His photographs can feel at times overly mannered and precious, and he is prone to the kind of na\u00efve, wide-eyed wonder that\u2019s become endemic in recent contemporary art. He escapes this, however, in images like \u201cRhinoceros,\u201d a dark, misty photograph that recalls images by D\u00fcrer or Jean-Baptiste Oudry and makes you care about the fate of nature, even when it is fake. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-2410, saulgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Martha Schwendener)\n \u2605 \u2018THE MUSEUM OF CRIME AND THE MUSEUM OF GOD\u2019 Put together by the writer Luc Sante from material from his own collection, this assemblage \u2014 with holy cards and vintage mug shots; protective amulets and 1930s crime novels; photographs of murder scenes and of river baptisms \u2014 is essentially about his life and makes a transfixing show. Apexart, 291 Church Street, between Walker and White Streets, TriBeCa, apexart.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) \nTHE NATIONAL ACADEMY: \u2018182ND ANNUAL: AN EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY ART,\u2019. The National Academy has mounted annual exhibitions showcasing living American artists (as opposed to dead Europeans) since it was founded in 1826. The annuals now alternate between invitationals, including nonmembers, and years devoted to academicians, professional artists elected by their peers to be members of the National Academy. This is a members-only year, which means that the work is more conservative \u2014 or \u201ctraditional,\u201d if you like. Heavily weighted toward painting, the exhibition includes lots of heirs to Abstract Expressionism and scores of competent figurative paintings and Expressionist- and Impressionist-inspired still lifes and landscapes. Among the participants are Philip Pearlstein, William Bailey, Will Barnet, Melvin Edwards, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Richard Estes and Lois Dodd. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org, closes on Sunday. (Schwendener)NEUBERGER MUSEUM OF ART: FUGITIVE ARTIST: THE EARLY WORK OF RICHARD PRINCE, 1974-77,. Mr. Prince is one of the most elusive, perverse and sardonic of all of the important appropriation artists to emerge in the early 1980s, so perhaps it is not surprising that he has boycotted this exhibition of little-known early work, all from public and private collections. But that doesn\u2019t stop the 50 pieces on view from revealing his roots in 1970s Conceptual Art; his progress from generic to original and radical; or the depth and duration of his fascination with language, photography, printmaking, the more banal forms of urban postwar Americana and a disconnected, decidedly male blankness. If anything, it increases his stature. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org, closes on Sunday. (Smith)PAUL PFEIFFER: \u2018LIVE FROM NEVERLAND\u2019 Michael Jackson\u2019s famously surreal statement regarding charges of child molestation is the subject of this impressive comeback from an artist known for tiny, cannily altered video loops that focus on the isolation of the long-distance celebrity. Narcissism achieves an unexpected grandeur as Mr. Jackson appears in one video, while his words are recited by a chorus of young men and women in another. Adding to the creepiness, the members of the chorus are age-ambiguous, seemingly suspended between childhood and adulthood. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 688-1585, elproyecto.com, closes today. (Smith)\n \u2605 PICASSO, BRAQUE AND EARLY FILM IN CUBISM Cubism and the first moving pictures emerged in the same decade. Coincidence? This thrilling exhibition doesn\u2019t think so. A dense display of major paintings, collages and prints; antique cameras and projectors; and snippets of film that Braque and Picasso are thought to have seen, it examines Cubism in the dim light and flickering images of the movie theater. It is radically reorienting to consider Cubism\u2019s fractured, revolving forms and transparencies as partly influenced by moving pictures. Weirdest of all? Thinking of Analytical Cubism\u2019s pale, gleaming dabs of paint as dust motes caught in the projector\u2019s beam. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, pacewildenstein.com, closes tomorrow. (Smith) \u2018THE PLAYERS\u2019 Fifteen artists explore the relationship between sports, history and culture. Patrick Barth uses anonymous contemporary athletes as models for an illustration of a battle in the Iliad; Kadir Nelson paints elite street basketball teams playing on a court in Harlem. Michelle Elzay photographs fencers, and Susannah Ray captures surfers; David Rathman paints boxers, and Freddy Rodriguez\u2019s paintings pay homage to the \u201cApostles of Dominican Baseball.\u201d Nancy Hwang\u2019s digitally manipulated version of a famous photograph of Warhol and Basquiat in boxing gloves recreates the image for a population for whom the art world serves as a surrogate for sports, replete with similar narratives of achievement, failure and redemption. Arsenal Gallery in Central Park, 830 Fifth Avenue, at 64th Street; closes on Wednesday. (Schwendener)\n \u2018THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING: PERSPECTIVES ON THE ART MARKET\u2019 Marcel Duchamp, who tried to redefine art as an active tool for thinking rather than a passive object of looking, hovers like a damaged angel over this think-piece of a group show organized by the 2006-7 Helena Rubenstein Curatorial Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program. The Art Gallery, City University of New York Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, gc.cuny.edu; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)\n ZOE STRAUSS: \u2018IF YOU READING THIS\u2019 The images by this Philadelphia photographer, installation artist and community advocate depict down-and-out people and places, and show what most Americans don\u2019t want to see. Her style is oddly intimate \u2014 post-Nan Goldin street photography \u2014 but it avoids sentimentality and has an instinctive grasp of both human drama and pictorial composition. The images are not without tenderness, but their harsh, unblinking force is a bit like a punch in the face. Silverstein Photography, 535 West 24th Street, (212) 627-3930, silversteinphotography.com, closes tomorrow. (Smith)\nWhitney Museum of American Art: \u2018Taryn Simon,\u2019 through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America\u2019s underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for \u201cThe Innocents,\u201d a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from \u201cReturn of the Jedi,\u201d at George Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. Closes on Sunday. (See above.) (Goodbody)",

Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. \n(Roberta Smith) \u2605 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018GLOBAL FEMINISMS,\u2019 through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn\u2019t venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago\u2019s indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Nearly devoid of significant painting and sculpture and Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn\u2019t keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Smith)BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) GREY ART GALLERY: \u2018BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O\u2019DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND,\u2019 through July 14. Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O\u2019Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It\u2019s a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today\u2019s most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart/. (Bridget L. Goodbody)\n GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,\u2019 through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat\u2019s invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) \n \u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,\u2019 through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work\u2019s laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. \n(Michael Kimmelman) \n\u2605 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,\u2019 through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It\u2019s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who\u2019s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)\n \u2605 JAPAN SOCIETY: \u2018AWAKENINGS: ZEN FIGURE PAINTING IN MEDIEVAL JAPAN,\u2019 through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Cotter)\nTHE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: \u2018NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,\u2019 through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States \u2014 and a single artist from Palestine \u2014 have been added to the mix. There\u2019s some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018POIRET: KING OF FASHION,\u2019 through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) \u201cDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition \u2014 from the Met\u2019s Costume Institute \u2014 does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) \n THE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,\u2019 through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures \u2014 and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella\u2019s importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)\nTHE MET: \u2018FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,\u2019 through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn\u2019t do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)\n* THE MET: \u2018VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,\u2019 through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice , the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Cotter)\n MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,\u2019 through June 17. The symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of \u201cLas Huelgas Apocalypse\u201d (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery\u2019s perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. \n(Andrea K. Scott)\u2605 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: \u2018THE DISAPPEARED (LOS DESAPARECIDOS),\u2019 through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter)\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,\u2019 through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea \u2014 the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture \u2014 should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern\u2019s paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses \u201cperplexing questions,\u201d nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)NEUBERGER MUSEUM OF ART: FUGITIVE ARTIST: THE EARLY WORK OF RICHARD PRINCE, 1974-77, through June 24. Mr. Prince is one of the most elusive, perverse and sardonic of all of the important appropriation artists to emerge in the early 1980s, so perhaps it is not surprising that he has boycotted this exhibition of little-known early work, all from public and private collections. But that doesn\u2019t stop the 50 pieces on view from revealing his roots in 1970s Conceptual Art; his progress from generic to original and radical; or the depth and duration of his fascination with language, photography, printmaking, the more banal forms of urban postwar Americana and a disconnected, decidedly male blankness. If anything, it increases his stature. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Smith)\u2605 NEUE GALERIE: \u2018VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,\u2019 through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show\u2019s most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: \u201cSelf-Portrait With Straw Hat\u201d (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery\u2019s vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh\u2019s \u201cBedroom\u201d from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele\u2019s obvious homage, \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Bedroom in Neulengbach,\u201d painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) STOREFRONT FOR ART AND ARCHITECTURE: \u2018CCCP: COSMIC COMMUNIST CONSTRUCTIONS PHOTOGRAPHED,\u2019 through June 16. Covering a period ignored by academics and mainstream architects, this show is packed with obscure architectural gems. It relies almost exclusively on the photographs of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chaubin, who spent five years traveling across the former Soviet Union, uncovering forgotten architectural works in cities like Tbilisi, Yalta and Yerevan. The results are a revelation. Among the outright gems is Georgy Chakhava\u2019s 1975 Roads Ministry building, a monumental grid of interlocking concrete forms rising on a steep wooded site in Tbilisi, Georgia. Rising on an incline between two highways, the building\u2019s heavy, cantilevered forms reflect the Soviet-era penchant for heroic scale. Yet they also relate sensitively to their context, celebrating the natural landscape that flows directly underneath the building. What\u2019s refreshing about this exhibition is its lack of an ideological agenda: it is open to all sorts of possibilities. The Gaudiesque romanticism of a sanitarium in Druskininkai, Lithuania, for example, spins the aesthetic off in yet another direction. Compelling and easy to digest, this show piques our interest in ways that some larger institutions, ever more averse to risk, often fail to do. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) \n THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL,\u2019 through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world\u2019s latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi\u2019s \u201cEndless Column\u201d as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Goodbody)\nWADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, \u2018WHERE WERE WE,\u2019 through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,\u2019 through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein\u2019s brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein\u2019s taste clearly hasn\u2019t won the day, but it\u2019s never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. (See above.) (Kimmelman) \nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE,\u2019 through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is \u201cSplitting.\u201d To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark\u2019s formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Kimmelman) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018TARYN SIMON,\u2019 through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America\u2019s underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for \u201cThe Innocents,\u201d a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from \u201cReturn of the Jedi,\u201d at George Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) \nGalleries: Uptown\nCLAUDE MONET (1840-1926): A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL WILDENSTEIN AND KATIA GRANOFF This exhibition of nearly 60 paintings by one of the most beloved painters in the world feels a little like having dinner with a celebrity. The gallery setting eliminates the usual distance; the startling intimacy allows you to experience afresh the momentum and innovations of Monet\u2019s astounding trajectory in the span of three small galleries. Basically, it is a chance to encounter, up close and in detail, the evolving ways of seeing and painting that established the originality, historical importance and continuing irresistibility of Monet\u2019s art. It should not be missed. Wildenstein & Company, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through June 15. (Smith)\nGalleries: SoHo\n  \u2605 \u2018GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE\u2019 The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called \u201cdrawings without paper\u201d: semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they\u2019re out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego\u2019s art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. \n(Cotter) \nGalleries: Other\n\u2605 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: PREIS PAINTINGS Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm into surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn\u2019t get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink inveigles for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) \nSOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES ... If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early \u201970s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, through Sept. 10. (Smith)\nJOAQU\u00cdN TORRES-GARC\u00cdA This choice exhibition concentrates on small, lively ink drawings from the early 1930s, when Torres-Garc\u00eda ironed out Cubism into a compartmentalized grid that could either be abstract \u2014 like Mondrian\u2019s work \u2014 or a container for assorted symbols and hieroglyphs. Two earlier paintings underscore that, either way, his inspiration came from combined order and disorder of bustling city views. CDS Gallery, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555, through June 9. (Smith) \nPublic Art\nMADISON SQUARE PARK: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures \u2014 \u201cConjoined\u201d and \u201cDefunct\u201d \u2014 and a glacierlike boulder, \u201cErratic,\u201d by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is \u201cConjoined,\u201d a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, www.madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio) \nLast Chance\nFRICK COLLECTION: \u2018GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,\u2019. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers raking and reaping grain, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org.; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)\n \u2605 \u2018REBEL, REBEL: REMEMBERING KARLHEINZ WEINBERGER (1921-2006)\u2019 The self-taught Swiss photographer Karlheinz Weinberger, who died last year at 81, began his career taking pictures for a gay club in Zurich, but found his true subject in rebellious, working-class teenagers who dressed to shock in the 1960s and \u201970s. The Weinberger pictures in this show are fairly tame, as if chosen to complement the cooled-out work of the three younger artists \u2014 Ryan McGinley, Walter Pfeiffer and Collier Schorr \u2014 who surround him. But at his best, he\u2019s in a class by himself. Anna Kustera, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, kusteratiltongallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. \n\u2018THOMAS STRUTH: MAKING TIME\u2019 Through the 1990s the German photographer Thomas Struth became an art-world celebrity for his outsize, absorbing portraits of crowds interacting with artwork in the world\u2019s great museums. As a follow-up, he is presenting the American premiere of two new series of pictures of audiences beholding single masterpieces in the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The show, at Marian Goodman Gallery in Midtown, is one of the most visually sumptuous and thought-provoking in the city. Both series of photographs are from 2005, though they are completely different in style, tone, spirit and intent. The pictures of students and tourists at the Prado (above), milling about and chatting in front of various paintings of great attention, fame and devotion, contrive to get us thinking about a cocktail of cultural concerns \u2014 the aura of masterpieces, museums as promenades, art tourism \u2014 to which he adds a touch of farce. Almost nobody in the pictures is looking at the paintings. By contrast, the pictures of crowds pressed in close around Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cLitta Madonna\u201d and \u201cBenois Madonna\u201d at the Hermitage are deviously direct, the artist zooming in his lens on the facial expressions of the crowd to the exclusion of the paintings. These pictures are a sort of guilty pleasure, owing almost entirely to the cleverness of the artist, who allows us safely to look at others looking at art. You only hope that he is not lurking around the gallery here somewhere with a camera at the ready. (Through April 28, Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, Manhattan, 212-977-7160, mariangoodman.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n \u2605 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: MART\u00edN RAM\u00edREZ,  through May 13. Ram\u00edrez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color, and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty). But most of all, Ram\u00edrez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. In addition to being one of the season\u2019s best exhibitions and the first of his work in a New York museum, this show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. \n(Smith)\n\u2605 ASIA SOCIETY: GLASS, GILDING, AND GRAND DESIGN: ART OF SASANIAN IRAN (224-642 A.D.), through May 20. This glinting, glowing show is a reduction of a much larger Paris exhibition that included material from Iranian museums impossible to bring to the United States. With some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, this is still substantial and the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) \u2605 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018GLOBAL FEMINISMS,\u2019 through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn\u2019t venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago\u2019s indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn\u2019t keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Smith)\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School but one of its less dramatic painters, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin, rather than the metaphorical view held by Cole and other Hudson River artists that its representation ought to express God\u2019s sublimity. Obeying Ruskin\u2019s call for truth to nature, Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage, rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. If the show reveals some of Durand\u2019s weaknesses \u2014 repetitive themes and borrowings from other artists \u2014 it also reveals his strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. (See above.) (Grace Glueck).\n\u2605 CHELSEA ART MUSEUM: \u2018DANGEROUS BEAUTY,\u2019 through April 21. A somewhat timely update of a well-worn idea, this show of contemporary works in a variety of mediums by 18 artists examines the beauty myth in art, advertising and the fashion industry. Eloquent but blunt imagery of anorexic girls, chiseled male beefcake and close-ups of surgically deformed faces predominates, reminding us of the violent extremes to which some people will go in pursuit of society\u2019s ideal of beauty and a designer body. The rest of the show \u2014 often pointing an accusatory finger at skinny models, cosmetic labels and the mass media \u2014 feels familiar in its critique, but the basic premise about the ideology of beauty in our culture is beyond argument. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719, chelseaartmuseum.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) FRICK COLLECTION: \u2018GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,\u2019 through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Glueck)\nGUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018FAMILY PICTURES,\u2019 through April 16. This show sounds ripe with possibilities. The results, however, are more mixed. The exhibition is drawn from the museum\u2019s collection, which explains some of its exclusions and limitations. Many artists you associate with contemporary photography and the family are not in attendance: Richard Bellingham, Tina Barney, Malerie Marder. There is also a sense of false advertising in the exhibition\u2019s title. The museum\u2019s news release extends the exhibition\u2019s exploration into \u201crepresentation of families and children in contemporary art and video.\u201d Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. Rineke Dijkstra\u2019s \u201cBeach Portraits\u201d of adolescents awkwardly posing against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don\u2019t think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children, has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) \nINTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON\u2019S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,\u2019 through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive \u2014 the \u201cposthumous\u201d exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the layout of the scrapbook as Cartier-Bresson originally organized the pictures. It surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. Here are the familiar and, more interestingly, some less familiar, shots of crowds in Hyde Park in London at George VI\u2019s coronation, of picnickers on the banks of the Marne in France and whores in Valencia, Spain. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman)INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018MARTIN MUNKACSI: THINK WHILE YOU SHOOT!\u2019 through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early \u201960s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. His sports photographs epitomized his special gift for action and movement: capturing a soccer ball just as it neared a goalie\u2019s outstretched hands or a motorcyclist at the instant he splashed through a pool of water. In 1928 he moved to Berlin, where the opportunities were better, and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. He became a celebrity in America. He photographed Fred Astaire dancing and Joan Crawford poolside. In the breezy layouts of Harper\u2019s Bazaar, the work looked brilliant. (See above.) (Kimmelman)THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Glueck) \n * THE MET: \u2018VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,\u2019 through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice, the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Cotter)\n * THE MET: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (See above.) (Smith)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL \u2014 AN ARTIST\u2019S COUNTRY ESTATE,\u2019 through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house- museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound, is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany\u2019s genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith) * THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck)MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,\u2019 through June 17. Even in the contemporary art world the symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of \u201cLas Huelgas Apocalypse\u201d (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery\u2019s perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott)\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018ARTISTIC COLLABORATIONS: 50 YEARS OF UNIVERSAL LIMITED ART EDITIONS,\u2019 through May 21. This exhibition observes the half-century milestone for Universal Limited Art Editions in West Islip, N.Y., and its association with the Museum of Modern Art. The museum has acquired one print from every edition made at Universal, more than 1,200 works by nearly 50 artists. Prints by 12 artists are in this show. Among them are lithographs by Jasper Johns, mostly from the 1960s, with his signature maps and flags. Robert Rauschenberg is represented primarily by lithographs from the 1960s that combine found images of figures like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson with the freehand scrawling associated with Abstract Expressionism. It\u2019s hard to fault an exhibition that features prints by masters like Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg and Kiki Smith. But given the somewhat precarious position of prints in the contemporary art world, and with many artists opting to go digital, the inclusion of younger artists would make a good argument that traditional printmaking is still relevant and holds possibilities for this generation. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener)\nMOMA: \u2018COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,\u2019 through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea \u2014 the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture \u2014 should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern\u2019s paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Although it promises work that addresses \u201cperplexing questions,\u201d nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 MOMA: ARMANDO REVER\u00d3N, through April 16. Unless you spotted his single smoke-puff of a painting at MoMA months ago, Armando Rever\u00f3n probably means nothing to you. Why should he? The artist, who died in 1954, spent most of his life in a shack by the sea in his native Venezuela. Many of his contemporaries dismissed him as nuts. His white-on-white pictures are practically unphotographable. But chances are that if you visit this retrospective, you\u2019ll find yourself thinking about him a lot. His art and his story are like few others, and so is the museum\u2019s inspired installation: a single, long corridor with cabinetlike rooms of paintings on either side and, at the very end, against a sea-green wall, a life-size doll with giant bat wings floating overhead. (See above.) (Cotter)\n \u2605 MOMA: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can\u2019t stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith)\n\u2605 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975, through April 22. Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this brave if confused exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show\u2019s 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal in their way to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins, mixing generations and levels of achievement and continuing the neglect of the main story. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Smith)NEUBERGER MUSEUM OF ART: FUGITIVE ARTIST: THE EARLY WORK OF RICHARD PRINCE, 1974-77, through June 24. Mr. Prince is one of the most elusive, perverse and sardonic of all of the important appropriation artists to emerge in the early 1980s, so perhaps it is not surprising that he has boycotted this exhibition of little-known early work, all from public and private collections. But that doesn\u2019t stop the 50 pieces on view from revealing his roots in 1970s Conceptual Art; his progress from generic to original and radical; or the depth and duration of his fascination with language, photography, printmaking, the more banal forms of urban postwar Americana and a disconnected, decidedly male blankness. If anything, it increases his stature. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Smith) \u2605 NEUE GALERIE: \u2018VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,\u2019 through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show\u2019s most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: \u201cSelf-Portrait With Straw Hat\u201d (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery\u2019s vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh\u2019s \u201cBedroom\u201d from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele\u2019s obvious homage, \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Bedroom in Neulengbach,\u201d painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Schwendener)NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro-slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Edward Rothstein)\n ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: \u2018ATHENS-SPARTA,\u2019 through May 12. Painted vases, pottery, sculptured steles, tiny carved figures, writings inscribed on stone and a selection of coins are among the nearly 300 objects in this show, whose first section begins with pieces from both cities during the Geometric Period (1050-700 B.C.). Two other sections deal with the on-again, off-again relationship between the cities in the fifth century B.C., Greece\u2019s glory years, and with the wars they fought: the Persian Wars (about 500 to 449 B.C.) and the Peloponnesian War (431 to 404 B.C.), in which Sparta defeated Athens, only to fade not long after. As society evolved from tribal to civil and felt the first stirrings of democracy during the Archaic Period (650-480 B.C.), rigid geometrical motifs were succeeded by more human forms, like the kouroi and korai, the stone or bronze statues, sometimes life-size, representing young men and women and symbolizing a new emphasis on the individual. Usually they bore relief images of the deceased and were set on graves as markers and memorials. On view from the sixth century B.C. are two small Attic representations of korai, dressed statues of maidens, said to represent the Athenian aristocracy in rites celebrating the goddess Athena. Carved in stone, with long, braided hair (one is headless, but her braids are visible) and beautifully articulated drapery that clings to their bodies, they disappeared as a type after the Persian wars. 645 Fifth Avenue, near 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) \n P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018KATRIN SIGURDARDOTTIR: HIGH PLANE V,\u2019 through May 7. Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir\u2019s \u201cHigh Plane V,\u201d a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Genocchio) \u2605 UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: \u2018CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,\u2019 through April 29. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art \u2014 Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter \u2014 were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists, including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. The entirely nonobjective Suprematist work of Kasimir Malevich, for instance, was based in part on Ukrainian folk motifs, and the exuberant Cubist-Futurist theater designs and paintings by Alexandra Exter relate to icons and patterns from village embroideries and weavings and bright peasant costumes. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. Stressing as it does the importance of Ukrainian participation in Modernist art, the show is equally significant in its exposure to Americans of lively talents, largely unknown. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck) WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org (Glueck)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE,\u2019 through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. He also saut\u00e9ed a Polaroid of a Christmas tree in grease. The copy he sent to Robert Smithson, golden brown on the outside, is here too, and none too appetizing, I might add. At the center of the exhibition is \u201cSplitting.\u201d To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark\u2019s formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Kimmelman) \u2605 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LORNA SIMPSON,\u2019 through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson\u2019s career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as \u201cidentity art,\u201d but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n JEAN SHIN: KEY PROMISES The idea is obvious, if you\u2019re as keen as this artist on recycling everyday objects: an installation using the word commands of countless computer keyboards to orchestrate a flow of suggested actions, desires and emotional states across four walls of a small gallery. From esc and shift to return and home. Art lite, perhaps, but expertly done. Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-0992, frederieketaylorgallery.com, through tomorrow. (Smith)\nGalleries: Other\n\u2018GIFTS OF THE FOREST: NATIVE TRADITIONS IN WOOD AND BARK\u2019 Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that carry on tribal traditions, like the simple and beautiful wooden flute made in 1999 by Hawk Henires (Nipmuc) and adorned with an elegantly carved bird motif. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, carved bowls and spoons, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, birch bark canoe models, an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, through April 27. (Glueck)  \u2605 \u2018EARLY CHINESE BUDDHIST SCULPTURE,\u2019 Asia Week is over, but its essence lingers on in this exhibition of beautiful carved stone figures of Buddhas and bodhisattvas dating from the Northern Wei to Tang periods in China. This is the type of work that elicited rapturous responses when shown in London and Washington a few seasons back. Throckmorton Fine Art, 145 East 57th Street, third floor, (212) 223-1059, through April 14. (Cotter)\nLast Chance\n\u2605 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018PRIVATE TREASURES: FOUR CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTER DRAWINGS,\u2019 through Sunday. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The works span more than 400 years, from the 16th to the early 20th centuries, and include drawings in ink and pencil, watercolor, chalk and gouache. The strongest concentration is in Italian drawings. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn\u2019t an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one\u2019s craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example \u2014 and the most historically significant work here \u2014 is a black chalk drawing, \u201cThe Dead Christ\u201d (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don\u2019t know where they came from, where they\u2019re going, or when you\u2019ll see them again. (See above.) (Schwendener)\n * JOHANNES VANDERBEEK The debut solo show of this young artist at Feuer is a poetic, storybook tableau with a full-scale sculpture of a medieval knight reclining on his tomb and a walled-up archway set in the gallery wall. Both are made entirely of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 made from old copies of Time and National Geographic. The beautiful little tree that stands between them is also of paper and paste.

Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party in 1966 in Oakland, Calif. In hindsight the party had a fairly reasonable agenda for social change and the empowerment of African-Americans \u2014 employment, education, decent housing, social justice and political representation \u2014 but it was branded as a shadowy revolutionary organization and a threat to national security. This new exhibition commemorates the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Black Panther Party, bringing together almost 100 photographs of the group\u2019s leaders, demonstrations and other activities from about 1967 to 1973 by Stephen Shames, the party\u2019s unofficial official photographer. Most of the images are small black-and-white prints, but they have a disquieting, momentous presence. One especially powerful image, above, shows the militant posturing of a pair of Panther security guards (Glen Wheeler, left, and Claudia Grayson) outside a funeral for a slain party member at a church in Oakland in 1971. Mr. Shames photographed not only the public face of the movement but also private moments, including secret meetings of Panther leaders and their home life. Simple but thoughtful, the photographs humanize the group whose driving ambition was equality. (Through May 26, Steven Kasher Gallery, 521 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, 212-966-3978, stevenkasher.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n\u2605 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: MART\u00edN RAM\u00edREZ,  through May 13. Ram\u00edrez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color, and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty). But most of all, Ram\u00edrez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. In addition to being one of the season\u2019s best exhibitions and the first of his work in a New York museum, this show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples \u2014 larded with fascinating facts and tales \u2014 ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)\u2605 ASIA SOCIETY: GLASS, GILDING, AND GRAND DESIGN: ART OF SASANIAN IRAN (224-642), through May 20. This glinting, glowing show is a reduction of a much larger Paris exhibition that included material from Iranian museums impossible to bring to the United States. With some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, this is still substantial and the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) \u2605 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018GLOBAL FEMINISMS,\u2019 through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn\u2019t venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago\u2019s indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn\u2019t keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Smith)\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,\u2019 through July 29. This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece \u201cKindred Spirits\u201d (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School but one of its less dramatic painters, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin, rather than the metaphorical view held by Cole and other Hudson River artists that its representation ought to express God\u2019s sublimity. Obeying Ruskin\u2019s call for truth to nature, Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks, while his larger and more elaborate pictures are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. If the show reveals some of Durand\u2019s weaknesses \u2014 repetitive themes and borrowings from other artists \u2014 it also reveals his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. (See above.) \n(Grace Glueck)\n\u2605 CHELSEA ART MUSEUM: \u2018DANGEROUS BEAUTY,\u2019 through April 21. A somewhat timely update of a well-worn idea, this show of contemporary works in a variety of mediums by 18 artists examines the beauty myth in art, advertising and the fashion industry. Eloquent but blunt imagery of anorexic girls, chiseled male beefcake and close-ups of surgically deformed faces predominates, reminding us of the violent extremes to which some people will go in pursuit of society\u2019s ideal of beauty and a designer body. The rest of the show \u2014 often pointing an accusatory finger at skinny models, cosmetic labels and the mass media \u2014 feels familiar in its critique, but the basic premise about the ideology of beauty in our culture is beyond argument. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719, chelseaartmuseum.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. Like its two predecessors this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling \u2014 more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) FRICK COLLECTION: \u2018GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,\u2019 through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Glueck)\nINTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON\u2019S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,\u2019 through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive \u2014 the \u201cposthumous\u201d exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the layout of the scrapbook as Cartier-Bresson originally organized the pictures. It surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org.\n (Michael Kimmelman)INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: \u2018MARTIN MUNKACSI: THINK WHILE YOU SHOOT!\u2019 through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early \u201960s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. His sports photographs epitomized his special gift for action and movement. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode. He became a celebrity in America. He photographed Fred Astaire dancing and Joan Crawford poolside. In the breezy layouts of Harper\u2019s Bazaar, the work looked brilliant. (See above.) (Kimmelman) \u2605 JAPAN SOCIETY: \u2018AWAKENINGS: ZEN FIGURE PAINTING IN MEDIEVAL JAPAN,\u2019 through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. And it covers an unusually broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Cotter)THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community.

At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice, the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)\n * THE MET: \u2018INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,\u2019 through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met\u2019s vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don\u2019t miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (See above.) (Smith)\n\u2605 THE MET: \u2018LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL \u2014 AN ARTIST\u2019S COUNTRY ESTATE,\u2019 through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house- museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound, is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany\u2019s genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith) * THE MET: \u2018ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,\u2019 through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer; John Cederquist\u2019s elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l\u2019oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman\u2019s fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck)MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,\u2019 through June 17. Even in the contemporary art world the symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of \u201cLas Huelgas Apocalypse\u201d (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery\u2019s perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org.\n (Andrea K. Scott)\n \u2605 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: \u2018THE DISAPPEARED (LOS DESAPARECIDOS),\u2019 through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter)\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018ARTISTIC COLLABORATIONS: 50 YEARS OF UNIVERSAL LIMITED ART EDITIONS,\u2019 through May 21. This exhibition observes the half-century milestone for Universal Limited Art Editions in West Islip, N.Y., and its association with the Museum of Modern Art. The museum has acquired one print from every edition made at Universal, more than 1,200 works by nearly 50 artists. Prints by 12 artists are in this show. Among them are lithographs by Jasper Johns, mostly from the 1960s, with his signature maps and flags. Robert Rauschenberg is represented primarily by lithographs from the 1960s that combine found images of figures like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson with the freehand scrawling associated with Abstract Expressionism. It\u2019s hard to fault an exhibition that features prints by masters like Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg and Kiki Smith. But given the somewhat precarious position of prints in the contemporary art world, and with many artists opting to go digital, the inclusion of younger artists would make a good argument that traditional printmaking is still relevant and holds possibilities for this generation. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,\u2019 through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea \u2014 the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture \u2014 should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern\u2019s paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Although it promises work that addresses \u201cperplexing questions,\u201d nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)\n \u2605 MOMA: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can\u2019t stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith)\n\u2605 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975, through April 22. Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this brave if confused exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show\u2019s 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal in their way to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins, mixing generations and levels of achievement and continuing the neglect of the main story. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Smith)NEUBERGER MUSEUM OF ART: FUGITIVE ARTIST: THE EARLY WORK OF RICHARD PRINCE, 1974-77, through June 24. Mr. Prince is one of the most elusive, perverse and sardonic of all of the important appropriation artists to emerge in the early 1980s, so perhaps it is not surprising that he has boycotted this exhibition of little-known early work, all from public and private collections. But that doesn\u2019t stop the 50 pieces on view from revealing his roots in 1970s Conceptual Art; his progress from generic to original and radical; or the depth and duration of his fascination with language, photography, printmaking, the more banal forms of urban postwar Americana and a disconnected, decidedly male blankness. If anything, it increases his stature. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Smith) \u2605 NEUE GALERIE: \u2018VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,\u2019 through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show\u2019s most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: \u201cSelf-Portrait With Straw Hat\u201d (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery\u2019s vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh\u2019s \u201cBedroom\u201d from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele\u2019s obvious homage, \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Bedroom in Neulengbach,\u201d painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Schwendener)NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro-slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. \n(Edward Rothstein) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: \u2018ATHENS-SPARTA,\u2019 through May 12. Painted vases, pottery, sculptured steles, tiny carved figures, writings inscribed on stone and a selection of coins are among the nearly 300 objects in this show, whose first section begins with pieces from both cities during the Geometric Period (1050-700 B.C.). Two other sections deal with the on-again, off-again relationship between the cities in the fifth century B.C., Greece\u2019s glory years, and with the wars they fought: the Persian Wars (about 500 to 449 B.C.) and the Peloponnesian War (431 to 404 B.C.), in which Sparta defeated Athens, only to fade not long after. As society evolved from tribal to civil and felt the first stirrings of democracy during the Archaic Period (650 to 480 B.C.), rigid geometrical motifs were succeeded by more human forms . On view from the sixth century B.C. are two small Attic representations of korai, dressed statues of maidens, said to represent the Athenian aristocracy in rites celebrating the goddess Athena. 645 Fifth Avenue, near 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck)\n P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018KATRIN SIGURDARDOTTIR: HIGH PLANE V,\u2019 through May 7. Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir\u2019s \u201cHigh Plane V,\u201d a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Genocchio) \u2605 UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: \u2018CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,\u2019 through April 29. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art \u2014 Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter \u2014 were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists, including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. Stressing as it does the importance of Ukrainian participation in Modernist art, the show is equally significant in its exposure to Americans of lively talents, largely unknown. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck) WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,\u2019 through Dec. 9. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you\u2019ll find treasures like \u201cSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\u201d (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico\u2019s poignant, poetic fragment \u201cHead of an Angel\u201d (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, \u201cSaint Serapion\u201d (1628). But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer\u2019s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE,\u2019 through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. At the center of the exhibition is \u201cSplitting.\u201d To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark\u2019s formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Kimmelman) \u2605 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018LORNA SIMPSON,\u2019 through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson\u2019s career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as \u201cidentity art,\u201d but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n\u2605 \u2018PAINTINGS, FLAGS & IRON: HAITIAN ART FROM THE LAST FIFTY YEARS\u2019 This splendid exhibition offers total immersion in the originality and continued vitality of Haiti\u2019s self-taught artists. Works by well-known painters like Hector Hyppolite, Toussaint Auguste and Rigaud Benoit range across religion, history and everyday themes. They include still lifes, landscapes and Pierre Joseph Valcin\u2019s enthralling rendering of a maternity ward. The forged and welded sculptures of Georges Liautaud and Gabriel Bien-Aim\u00e9 are on a par with Bill Traylor\u2019s antic silhouette drawings. And there are no words for the extravagantly sequined and beaded flags depicting Voodoo spirits and saints, except fabulous. Edward Thorp Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 691-6565, edwardthorpgallery.com, through April 21. (Smith)\n \u2605 LAMAR PETERSON Best known for his fanciful, Pop-inflected paintings of African-American suburban life, this young painter smashes that subject to smithereens in his new work, a promising advancement that is already yielding rewards. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, fredericksfreisergallery.com, through April 28. (Cotter)\nGalleries: Other\n\u2018GIFTS OF THE FOREST: NATIVE TRADITIONS IN WOOD AND BARK\u2019 Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that carry on tribal traditions, like the simple and beautiful wooden flute made in 1999 by Hawk Henires (Nipmuc) and adorned with an elegantly carved bird motif. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, carved bowls and spoons, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, birch bark canoe models, an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, through April 27. (Glueck) \n\u2605 \u2018THOMAS STRUTH: MAKING TIME\u2019 Through the 1990s, the German photographer Thomas Struth became an art world celebrity for his outsize, absorbing portraits of crowds interacting with artwork in the world\u2019s great museums. As a follow-up, he is presenting the American premiere of two new series of pictures of audiences beholding single masterpieces in the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid, and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The show, which cannily allows us to look safely at others looking at art, is one of the most visually sumptuous and thought-probing in the city. Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, mariangoodman.com, through April 28. (Genocchio)\nLast Chance\n \u2605 KRISTIN BAKER: SURGE AND SHADOW In these clever, ambitious mergers of Pop, Minimalism and Abstract Expressionism, abstract painting takes another turn for the spectacular, aided by the freshly white-on-white Deitch space. Cataclysmic compositions and an all-plastic, labor-intensive process strike the eye with a dazzling newness, but the eye adjusts and is eventually bored. A series of smaller studies evades the prescribed soullessness. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n \u2605 \u2018EARLY CHINESE BUDDHIST SCULPTURE,\u2019 Asia Week is over, but its essence lingers on in this exhibition of beautiful carved stone figures of Buddhas and bodhisattvas dating from the Northern Wei to Tang periods in China. This is the type of work that elicited rapturous responses when shown in London and Washington a few seasons back. Throckmorton Fine Art, 145 East 57th Street, third floor, (212) 223-1059; closes tomorrow. \n(Cotter)\nGUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018FAMILY PICTURES\u2019 This show sounds ripe with possibilities. The results, however, are more mixed. The exhibition is drawn from the museum\u2019s collection, which explains some of its exclusions and limitations. Many artists you associate with contemporary photography and the family are not in attendance: Richard Bellingham, Tina Barney, Malerie Marder. There is also a sense of false advertising in the exhibition\u2019s title. The museum\u2019s news release extends the exhibition\u2019s exploration into \u201crepresentation of families and children in contemporary art and video.\u201d Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; closes on Monday. (Schwendener) \n * ANYA KIELAR: \u2018LADY\u2019 The traditions of photomontage, collage and assemblage are sliced, diced and reconfigured here with surgical precision, feminist wit and a terrific sense of light, dark and color. The works range from two to three dimensions, with the best \u2014 mysterious boxed collages that cross Hannah Hoch with Kembra Phaler \u2014 landing squarely in between. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949, danielreichgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n\u2605 MOMA: ARMANDO REVER\u00d3N  Unless you spotted his single smoke-puff of a painting at MoMA months ago, Armando Rever\u00f3n probably means nothing to you. Why should he? The artist, who died in 1954, spent most of his life in a shack by the sea in his native Venezuela. Many of his contemporaries dismissed him as nuts. His white-on-white pictures are practically unphotographable. But chances are that if you visit this retrospective, you\u2019ll find yourself thinking about him a lot. His art and his story are like few others, and so is the museum\u2019s inspired installation: a single, long corridor with cabinetlike rooms of paintings on either side and, at the very end, against a sea-green wall, a life-size doll with giant bat wings floating overhead. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Cotter) WILHELM SASNAL A truncated, slightly altered version of a Polish film from the 1960s provides the frame or caption for often drab, studiously incomplete paintings that reciprocate with hints of cinematic light or depictions of movie screens. A genuine sense of postwar Communist bloc deprivation is evoked, without giving the viewer much to work with.

    "text": "Talk to the Newsroom:\nStyle Editor Trip Gabriel\n2007-02-12T15:17:00.000Z\nTrip Gabriel, The Times's style editor, answered questions from readers in February 2007. Following are the questions and his answers.\nMr. Gabriel oversees the Sunday Styles and Thursday Styles sections, as well as fashion coverage in the daily paper. He is a former reporter in the Style department. Before coming to The Times in 1994, he was a contributing editor of Rolling Stone and a frequent contributor to The Times Magazine and other publications. \nSeveral other editors have answered questions in this column, including Executive Editor Bill Keller, Science Editor Laura Chang, Sports Editor Tom Jolly and Obituaries Editor Bill McDonald. Their responses and those of other Times editors are on the Talk to the Newsroom page.\nThese discussions will continue in future weeks with other Times editors.\nIs Style Only for the Upper Class?\nQ. While I always look at the section with interest, I sometimes can't shake the feeling that Style is defined by any two of a writer's friends with too much money and time on their hands. The \"A Night Out With...\" pieces, for instance, often suggest nightspots that most people couldn't poke their noses in if they didn't know the right people. Even some of the bylines of those articles reek of highfalutin-ness; how am I supposed to take an article seriously when it's written \"By Zo\"? I don't get the sense from your section that anyone who lives paycheck to paycheck has Style. Does \"Style,\" by definition, percolate downward from the upper class? And can it be affordable?\n-- John Dillon, New Haven \nA. Thank you for your question. This is the kind of thing we talk about regularly in our department. Indeed, it can sometimes seem that the accoutrements of the stylish life --\u00ad fashion, entertainment, destinations --\u00ad as presented in Thursday Styles and Sunday Styles are expensive. Fortunately, there are many exceptions. A few quick examples: a Pulse column on Valentine\u2019s Day cards from $3; a Dress Codes column last week on stylish white, men\u2019s sneakers included a pair for $40; and a Skin Deep column about the \u201ccosmetics restriction diet\u201d reported that all your skin really needs is a few products from the drug store under $30.\nThe bigger point, to me, is that what we call our Styles coverage is really not about stuff. It\u2019s not primarily about getting and spending. It\u2019s about people and their behavior, and I imagine I\u2019ll have more to say about that as this conversation unfolds.\nBy the way, I think you may overestimate the exclusivity of New York night spots. I did a spot check of the past half dozen \u201cNight Out With...\u2019\u2019 columns, and I\u2019m sure you can get a reservation at any of the restaurants mentioned without knowing anyone. And not all of the places are expensive. The writers of \u201cAqua Teen Hunger Force\u2019\u2019 spent their night out at Daddy D\u2019z BBQ in Atlanta. (Motto: \u201cWe ain\u2019t pretty, but we\u2019re good.\u2019\u2019)\nAs for a writer named Zo, you\u2019ve created a great mystery in my department; no one can recall making such an assignment. Be assured that all our writers are real people, not pseudonyms, and none of them are particularly highfalutin.\nMystery solved: The byline on the article you mentioned appeared in the newspaper as Zoe (with two dots, or diaresis, on the E) Wolff, but our archives on the Web site cut off the byline because it was unable to \"read\" the character with the diaresis. Our Web site staff has fixed the problem. Thanks for the heads up.\nTo Pleat or Not to Pleat?\nQ. Can't seem to get a read on if pleats on men's trousers are back, never left, or have been banished for all time. Not talking about the multipleat 1980 style Zoot suit type, just the basic pleats. I'm a slender 6-foot guy, and was brought up reading that as such, you wanted pleats. Now I hear conflicting info from clothing salesmen.\n \n-- Josh Taylor\nA. Oh dear, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to be a tough week if there are many questions like this. Though I oversee sections with \u201cStyles\u201d in the title, I am no authority on how to dress. Fortunately there are people on the fashion staff in my department who really know their stuff. I relayed your question to Eric Wilson, a fashion reporter, and here is what he said:\n\u201cUnlike women, men have traditionally been slow to adapt to new styles. It took a decade for flat-front pants, originally shown in the collections of Helmut Lang, Calvin Klein and Miuccia Prada in the early 1990's, to catch on in the mainstream. Now they are the norm at retailers from Eddie Bauer to J.Crew. As store clerks will tell you, flat-front pants make most men look slimmer and taller.\n\u201cBut pleats have been eradicated from fashion for long enough now that some designers are beginning to experiment with them again. Stefano Pilati, the designer for Yves Saint Laurent, has been showing them since fall 2005, and now we see little pleats or big reverse pleats at other influential men\u2019s collections like Dior Homme, Cloak and Michael Bastian. Both styles look good now, although pleats generally favor the tall and lean. Justin Timberlake, for example, has been wearing tweedy YSL three-piece suits with pleated pants in his concert appearances. So you could say they are coming back, but I\u2019d give it another few years before pleated pants again become commonplace.\u2019\u2019\nWhy Are There So Many Ads?\nQ. My big complaint is that the section looks like it\u2019s created just for advertisers and society people, not for general readers. I don\u2019t think your latest section in Sunday\u2019s Times had much more than 50 percent editorial. There are already many magazines out there where you can\u2019t find the editorial amid all the ads, why do readers have to see this in your newspaper?\n-- Bill Fischer, Annandale, Va.\nA. We run about the same number of columns of news each week; the ads expand or contract depending on the season, the strength of the economy and the budgets of marketers. I share your impression that the ads sometimes seem to compete with the editorial content, but look at this way: without ads we wouldn\u2019t be able to report, edit and publish the articles in Styles, or any other department of the paper.\nStyles and Trends on the Street\nQ: I like Bill Cunningham\u2019s photographs, but sometimes they seem to promote certain products; for example in a recent photo essay on shiny bags, most of the women carry one brand. This does not suggest a style, but a trend, and an expensive one at that. Do you at the Times get products for exposure such as this?\nA. Unlike reporters and critics who interpret fashion directions from the runways, Bill Cunningham, The Times\u2019s resident genius of street fashion photography, documents what people actually wear (and carry). With his camera, he seems to connect the dots before anyone else. If the streets are a parade of women in bulky sweaters with wide leather belts, or there is an outbreak of head-to-toe winter white or every other woman on Madison Avenue seems to be carrying a silver or gold handbag, you can be sure it\u2019s Bill\u2019s eye that has made the connection. It\u2019s never the case that a trend or product was suggested to us by a company.\nAre There Fees for Wedding Announcements?\nQ. Does The Times charge a fee to get a wedding announcement listed? How about the highlighted wedding?\nA. No, no fees are charged for announcements in the Weddings & Celebrations pages, or for the Vows column that features one couple\u2019s story. There is a link on the Web page for Weddings & Celebrations explaining how to submit an announcement, or you can call a recorded message at (212) 556-7689. The information is supplied by couples and verified by Times reporters. Coming soon: videos shot by couples about how they met, to appear with their announcement on the Web. Look for details about submitting videos on the Weddings & Celebrations page this Wednesday,\u00ad Valentine\u2019s Day, of course.\nNavigating the Styles Path \nQ. I would like to compliment you on having such great writers contributing to the Styles sections. I particularly appreciate Guy Trebay and Cathy Horyn; both combine wonderful prose with insightful commentary about the culture of our times. I always read the last paragraph of a Guy Trebay article in order to learn his latest \u201cpost-modern\u201d take on culture, politics and power. Horyn\u2019s thoughts on the relationship between fashion and culture are much appreciated.\nMy question for you as editor of these sections is: How do you navigate among issues such as objectivity in reporting, subject matter and appropriateness for the Styles sections, and some of your writers\u2019 penchants for political and social commentary? About a year ago it occurred to me that the Styles Sections were out ahead of the rest of The Times in their critique of American politics, culture and social life. I suppose this makes sense since we are living in a society and time dominated by the industries of culture and style. But, that is hardly the conventional/historical tradition of the sections as a repository for fashion fluff and the doings of New York\u2019s social elite, subjects once thought to be close to the heart of the \u201cwoman of the house.\u201d\n-- E. Taylor\nA. That\u2019s a lot to chew on. I think you\u2019ve placed your finger on how Cathy Horyn and Guy Trebay have transformed the job of fashion critic and reporter into that of cultural critic; they see beyond, around and through clothes. That is, in part, why they have followings among many readers who aren\u2019t just trying to pick out a wardrobe. (When Cathy or Guy writes as a critic, rather than a reporter, we label those articles \u201cFashion Review\u201d or \u201cFashion Diary.\u2019\u2019)\nIn determining what\u2019s appropriate for the Styles sections, I have a rule of thumb: If people are talking about it at cocktail parties or around the dinner table, we want to find an angle. This is how I see the evolution of the two Styles sections from the days you refer to when Style news was \u201cwomen\u2019s news.\u2019\u2019 In fact, the paper used to have a page in the 1960's called \u201cFood, Family, Fashion, Furnishings,\u2019\u2019 also known as the four F\u2019s, to which many people might have added a fifth F, for \u201cfluff.\u2019\u2019\nBut nowadays Styles looks at how we live our lives \u00ad-- all kinds of social trends, raising children, relationships, how we experience new technologies and even the occasional exegesis of the trucker hat or kaffiyeh. Which may tell us something about geo-politics, or at the very least when a trend is best left alone.\nWhat Makes a Styles Story?\nQ. You\u2019re doing a fascinating job with the section ... is there a thought-through \"mix\" for your pieces? Is it gut? And what makes a piece pop ... or resonate? Keep rocking. You\u2019re getting it done in a way that\u2019s both smart and utterly current! Bravo.\n-- Holly Gleason, Nashville\nA. Just so readers know, Ms. Gleason and I aren't related, and she doesn\u2019t owe me any money. We've never met.\nThe Styles sections are a bit like magazines in the sense that the mix of stories, especially on the cover, is all important. And because there is little hard news on our beat -- \u00ad no Style press conferences to cover --\u00ad the gut instincts of editors and reporters about what to include is crucial. Reporters require a strong spirit of enterprise. The reward is that when they hit the target, or a piece \"pops,\" people talk about it. Ask Warren St. John, who identified the metrosexual in Styles in 2003. Or Guy Trebay, who profiled real-life gay cowboys in Wyoming in 2005 when \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u2019\u2019 was released.\nDressing for Success Just Out of College\nQ. I am a recent college grad and would love to develop a business style to help me climb the corporate ladder. Toward that end I\u2019ve been studying how successful men dress. There\u2019s this guy -- a wildly eccentric Tuscan man, famed for strutting around Manhattan in $10,000 Italian suits while hobnobbing with billionaires who nosh in his restaurant at noontime. He also dons Lucchese cowboy boots almost every day. Is this the kind of style I can adopt and make my own?\n-- Quint Jibril, Pelham, N.Y.\nA. All right, back to Eric Wilson for specific fashion advice:\n\u201cManhattan is full of Italian restaurants managed by men who are both eccentrically and impeccably dressed. Walking into their restaurants, a patron should know right away to whom he or she should genuflect.\n\u201cAs to the broader issue of developing a style for business, that all depends on your business, not to mention your personal threshold for being teased for wearing cowboy boots. Since you are starting out, a $10,000 suit strikes me as a less sensible investment than more basic styles that can be put together for under $500 at H&M and easily replaced if they turn out to be fashion flops. Remember that looking like you spent too much on your clothes can also be a hindrance on the corporate ladder. Conversely, always splurge on a good pair of shoes. A $500 pair of Prada loafers will outlast any five pairs of $100 shoes.\u2019\u2019\nAnnouncements of Same-Sex Unions\nQ. Hello from a faithful reader in the Midwest. I'm delighted that the Styles section includes same-sex unions in the wedding lists. Fantastic! What kinds of responses have you gotten to this over the past few years? I haven't yet seen one of the more in-depth articles about how couples met and how their relationship developed with a focus on a gay or lesbian couple, though. It's very encouraging to those of us in less cosmopolitan (and less diverse) communities. I read through the list of weddings and celebrations every week in hopes of seeing more same-sex couples, as a way to find some hope as a single lesbian in the so-called \"heartland.\"\n-- Phoebe Nielsen \nA. At the time we printed the first same-sex announcement in 2002 (and changed the name of the pages from \"Weddings\" to \"Weddings/Celebrations\"), we received several dozen letters, almost all positive. Frankly, from the strenuous internal discussions that preceded the change, I expected there would be protesters on 43rd Street, but in the end there was almost no controversy. We rarely hear comments these days, pro or con. Our readers seem to accept the formalizing of same-sex unions as part of modern life.\nAs for including gay and lesbian couples in the longer Vows column, there have been several, among them the musician Janis Ian and Patricia Snyder, who married in Canada; and the playwright Tony Kushner and Mark Harris, an editor, who had a commitment ceremony in New York. In 2005 the column described the wedding in Massachusetts of Carl Stanley McGee, a lawyer from Alabama, whose family was less upset that he was marrying a man, John Huston Finley IV, than a Democrat.\nInner Workings of \"Weddings/Celebrations\"\nQ. Something I've always been curious about how wedding announcements are chosen? What's the ratio of submissions to those printed? In addition, how do you select the wedding that is highlighted each Sunday?\n-- Patrick L. Eleey\nQ. Do you prohibit pictures of the couple dressed more formally than what we know as business casual and pictures of the bride alone? So few of your published shots have the subjects in tailored clothing, jackets/ties, dresses or dressy sportswear for women. I recognize that you have banished pre-staged wedding dress shots.\n-- J Gettinger, New York, NY.\nA. For the answers to these questions about the internal workings of \"Weddings/Celebrations,\" I turn to Robert Woletz, our society editor, who over 10 years has greatly expanded the cultural, ethnic and geographic range of couples included. Here's what Bob says:\n\"We make selections primarily based on the couple's achievements, and we're always on the lookout for couples with entertaining stories about their courtships. We have space to publish only a small handful of the submissions, which rise and fall with the seasons. In May, June and September, we may receive 300 to 400 a week and only have room for about one in 10.\"\n\"As for the photos, a decade ago The Times published formal photos exclusively. The policy changed when couples, and some of their photographers, expressed a desire to submit images of brides and bridegrooms in less formal settings and clothing. While we would gladly publish photos of brides in their gowns or couples in formal wear, it is now rare that they submit them.\"\nA Gay Focus in Styles?\nQ. Once upon a time, the lifestyle sections of a newspaper were called the \"women\u2019s pages.\" Now, of course, we know the sections are for everyone. Still, with some snark, Gawker.com and others sometimes call the section \u201cThursgay Styles,\u201d implying the section is for gay men or perhaps women and gay men. How do you feel about this diminutive nickname for your section?\n-- Chris Phillips, Brooklyn\nA. An interesting question. As far as \u201cThursgay Styles,\u2019\u2019 it strikes me as kind of retro that a blog presenting itself as cutting edge about media and celebrity gossip would equate an interest in men\u2019s fashion with being gay. Wasn\u2019t that your grandfather\u2019s thing? Thursday Styles includes a small amount of men\u2019s fashion, mainly an every-three-weeks column, Dress Codes, but we are much more likely to cover aspects of gay life in Sunday Styles.\nOn the broader topic, there is no question that a lot of the influence in the style world originates with gay men. Have you noticed that straight male hipsters this winter have bushy beards and long, stringy hair, like George Harrison, circa \u201cThe Concert for Bangladesh\u201d? It\u2019s a look that comes in no small part from the subculture of gay men known as bears, who affect lumberjack whiskers and plaid shirts. Which is a reaction to the clean-shaven, waxed and moisturized look for men. And that leads right to the next question \u2026\nQ. A while back there was the famous Sunday Styles article about the coming out of the \"metrosexual.\" That article seemed to cause a lot of grief. I remember one other article that seemed to push the phrase \"gay vague\" into the lexicon, and I\u2019m wondering where these articles are coming from, if there is an internal debate, have there been any regrets, and what\u2019s the need for these kind of labels around gayness and straight men?\nA. Our piece on metrosexuals, which didn\u2019t coin the term but pushed it into the spotlight, appeared a month before the launch of \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u2019\u2019 in 2003; the other story you refer to, from 2005, noted that many men, gay and straight, \u201chave migrated to a middle ground where the cues traditionally used to pigeonhole sexual orientation \u00ad-- hair, clothing, voice, body language --\u00ad are more and more ambiguous.\u2019\u2019\nEven though both articles had long shelf lives in the public consciousness, and in some ways were controversial, the only debates we had over publishing them were the same as with every trend story: Is there enough evidence to support the story? Is it balanced and thoroughly reported? How in heck can we get great art to go with it?\nSunday Styles has no overarching thesis or agenda about gayness or straightness, but it\u2019s clear the issues around sexual orientation in our society are evolving very rapidly, and often play out in the worlds of style. So we cover them.\nThe Wall Between Editorial and News\nQ. Although I recognize that there is a strong wall between editorial and the newsroom at The Times, the disconnect with regard to the Styles sections is staggering. The Times editorial stance is certainly liberal, as shown by its pursuit of social justice, opposition to tax cuts and the regular editorials decrying greed on Wall Street. On the other hand, the Styles sections are healthily laced with reviews of $10,000 handbags, articles about couture houses and long pieces about the pleasures of private jet ownership. Do you not consider that the Styles sections\u2019 (generally slavishly approving) coverage of these subjects is merely feeding (and creating) the wealth obsession that the Times editorials are regularly decrying? Furthermore, does the Times\u2019 income from luxury advertising associated with Styles sections undermine the righteousness of its editorial stance?\n-- Andrew S., New York\nA. You\u2019re right, there is a wall between the editorial department and the newsroom, so I have no answer to your larger philosophical question; we\u2019re not asked to consider if our coverage supports or contradicts positions of the editorial page, nor, I suspect you agree, should we.\nBut I\u2019m going to take strong exception to the premise underlying your question, that the Styles sections offer \u201cgenerally slavish approval\u2019\u2019 of luxury goods, designer clothes and a plutocrat lifestyle. First of all, that would be news to the fashion designers who regularly ban our critics from runway shows after an unfavorable review. The last time we wrote at length about expensive handbags it was to report that the most expensive ones, $650 and up, were selling strongly \u00ad-- that\u2019s news, objectively delivered \u00ad-- and the story didn\u2019t gush over the bags, it raised a skeptical eyebrow, noting, \u201cIn their pursuit of the season's most coveted bags, many are giving common sense the slip.\u201d\nLook at today\u2019s Thursday Styles section: A cover story examines laws aimed at regulating chemicals in makeup. The Critical Shopper columnist visits a vintage dress store where she buys a $185 dress. A Gear Test of scales that measure body fat finds the best one is also the cheapest, $34.98 from Sam\u2019s Club.\nSo give us a break. It\u2019s a bum rap that we fawn over the rich or equate being \u201cstylish\u201d with the consumption of luxury goods that are out of reach of most people. If anything, the tone of these sections is irreverent when looking at the lifestyles of the wealthy -- just as it is when looking at bohemians, artists, celebrities and others whose tastes often filter down, or up, to shape mass taste in America.\nStyle on Limited Budget and Time?\nQ. Focusing for the moment on the part of the Styles sections that are about buying things, the question is not whether some of the things that are recommended could be affordable to people other than the very rich. The question is whether people who don't have that much free time to shop, and don't make much money (the vast majority of Americans) can have style in the ensembles that they wear, and if so, how. A single $40 pair of sneakers does not make someone have style, and neither does a $600 pair of sneakers. The real question that John Dillon is asking is, taking the average person's salary and rent in New York, after taxes and food and transportation and entertainment, how much is it reasonable for someone to spend on clothing (and tailoring) in a year?\nAnother way to ask the question is: The vast majority of people pictured in your sections have tailored clothes. Do you think the majority of New Yorkers can afford tailored clothes? If not, what can they do so as to have style? Does it require a long-term plan of using your disposable income in the right places? Is it smarter to shop at more expensive stores that have a wider range of sizes, or at cheaper stores, followed by some relatively inexpensive tailoring? How can a person on a modest salary with limited spare time accomplish this feat? I am not being facetious -- I actually would be interested in seeing how one would allocate one's time in order to do it. I think that your section would increase in readership significantly if it spoke to this problem, which is a prerequisite to \"style.\"\n-- Benjamin Galynker, Brooklyn\nA. I take your point, and it's a good one. As I think I've established, I am no authority on how to dress well, so I can't immediately say how one acquires a sense of style on a budget and with limited time (and Mr. Wilson is out of the office on assignment). But you raise interesting issues we should think about for future coverage. Please stay tuned.\nLooking High and Low\nQ. Looking at the style/economic class argument that seems to be unfolding, I feel people are talking about it in the wrong order. Of course the Styles sections focus on the interests and behaviors of wealthy people, but that's not to be interpreted as \"the rich have better taste.\" Rather, they are the ones with the expendable income and free time necessary to lavish large quantities of time and energy on the enterprise, and they tend to be the first to develop highly specific, interesting and unusual tastes. Most people are too busy to keep abreast of the latest fashion developments. Isn't this what the Styles sections aim to cover -- the most recent and unexpected events in a field that is largely superfluous (though still very interesting)? The entire section is not an editorial, and should not be asked to take a moral stance on the issue.  \n-- Nan Wakefield, Austin, Texas\nA. That the sort-of-idle rich are style leaders because they can devote themselves to cultivating their tastes is an interesting view, though I don't really agree with you. Our reporting on so-called high society in the past couple of year has pointed out that whereas designers, like Bill Blass, once looked to the tastes of Park Avenue dames for inspiration, nowadays many younger socialites (and Hollywood stars) are given their finery by designers who are looking to exploit them as walking billboards.\nOriginal and influential style comes from everywhere, high and low, rich and poor, young and old. Think of hip hop street fashion, or the blue-collar Carhartt guy look still popular in Williamsburg, or the Factory-era Edie Sedgwick, whose style is being revived. We aim to cover all of it.\nGetting Paid\nQ.  Isn't youth style more than somewhat exploitative in that urban (read: black) styles set American, then international trends, with no payoffs to the black originators?  \n-- Arnie Tracey\nA.  Ask Russell Simmons (who founded the Phat Farm clothing brand), Sean Combs (Sean John), Damon Dash (Rocawear) or Pharrell Williams (Billionaire Boys Club) about getting paid.\n\nQ. I love wearing mini jean skirts summer or winter. Even though I see a lot of women wearing them during the summer, I don\u2019t see many wearing them during the winter. Is it a fashion faux pas to wear jean mini skirts during the winter? Is age an issue when wearing jean mini skirts?\n>-- Betty\nA. A very stylish member of our fashion staff, who is shy about seeing her name in print, offers this advice: \u201cWeather permitting, denim miniskirts are a perfectly appropriate look for winter. Pull on some opaque tights (I favor Wofford cotton velvet), a pair of chunky boots and, say, a cropped jacket or bulky sweater, and you\u2019re good to go. As for age being an issue when wearing denim, bite your tongue.\u2019\u2019\n\nQ. Is there a way to get to a fashion show without being a model or a designer and having no connections.\n-- Albina\nA. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s a tough ticket to get. Fashion Week in New York is a trade event, meaning you have to be invited by the designers (or really by their publicity arms), and only press, store buyers and \u201cspecial guests\u2019\u2019 like socialite customers and celebrities are generally included. The best way for a civilian to see a show is to have a friend in the business who can get you a seat. Fashion students are often allowed to wait for standing-room admission. Or why not start a fashion blog and register next season as a member of the press. See the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Web site for registration information.\nFollowing Leaders or Followers?\nQ. As a former New York fashion designer who was paid to predict \"style\" months in advance, I often feel your Styles sections trail after followers, not leaders. New fashion trends rarely start on couture runways. They start in the streets, on the backs of art students who wouldn\u2019t be caught dead toting a plastic handbag that costs more than their rent (even if they could afford it). Why celebrate the insecurity of Fifth Avenue\u2019s fashion sheep -- when there\u2019s so much creativity and excitement riding the A train?\n-- Stacia Friedman\nA. Yesterday\u2019s Thursday Styles looked at the thrift store fashions that models show up in backstage, which often influence designers and street trends. A story not long ago on \u201cthe Retro Kids,\u2019\u2019 eight friends from Brooklyn and Queens, described their obsession with 80's hip hop looks. The \u201cLife as a Runway\u2019\u2019 photo feature about every two weeks documents the unexpected (but not unstudied) dress codes one finds at a poetry reading, an Atlantic City casino, a museum dance party, etc. We ride the A train, and the N, G and F.\n \nNot Everyone's Cup of Tea\nQ. I\u2019ve been reading The Times --\u00ad America\u2019s Newspaper of Record --\u00ad for 40 years. The Sunday Styles section is obscene to me and I suspect other readers. If I wanted a copy of People or Us, I\u2019d pick one up. If you spent the money covering the news of the world better, we\u2019d be better off as a people.\n-- Ross Salinger\nA. I\u2019m sorry you feel that way. The wonderful thing about a newspaper as broad as The Times is there\u2019s something for almost everyone. If we lost the subscriptions of people who love the Styles sections, not to mention the ads the sections attract, there would be less money to cover the kind of news you prefer. This realization was made in the 1970\u2019s (not long after you started reading the paper), when my predecessors in the Style department created sections like Weekend and House & Home. They saved the newspaper financially at the time, and though the news in our feature sections is typically labeled \"soft,'' the reporting and thinking are not. I\u2019m sure we will move into the future with our readers, inventing new areas of coverage as it becomes evident, while remaining completely faithful to the journalistic standards The Times stands for.\nDoor Policies and Discrimination\nQ. You frequently report on the restrictive door policies of clubs. Although licensed by the state to serve liquor to everyone, they decide, usually by a combination of dress and looks, who gets in and who does not. The discriminatory ramifications of that policy are so obvious that I wonder if you are troubled by reporting them.\n--\u00ad Howard Burkat\nA. One of the things I really like about our \u201cBoite\u201d column in Sunday Styles, which covers night clubs, is the sidebar spelling out the unspoken dress code, and other tips for besting the doorman at his game.\nIs Gay News Ghettoized?\nQ. I never got a response to the e-mail below, sent back in 2005. It appears, unfortuantely, that little has changed since then, so maybe you\u2019ll do your readers a favor and attempt a reply this week:\n\"This message comes to you from an avid fan and daily reader of The New York Times online edition. In recent weeks, I have noticed a disturbing trend in the positioning of articles in The New York Times. On July 17, you ran an interesting and timely story by Alex Williams about a gay teenager\u2019s struggle with attending a camp where he would be \u201cstraightened out.\u2019\u2019 Why did this story, involving family legal rights and the psychology of homosexuality, appear only in the Styles section? That section is generally the home of stories like today\u2019s: lip gloss, cosmetic surgery and dress shops. The answer, I fear, is a troubling one: gay news belongs in the dress-shop section of the paper, because gays simply adore fashion, jewelry and other shiny things.\n\"I hope The New York Times understands that most gay men are far more interested in political issues and cultural affairs than in lip gloss. Before you continue down this slippery slope, please check your sexual prejudices. Even when accompanied by slick graphics and interactive media, bigotry isn\u2019t pretty.''\n--\u00ad Marc Lallanilla\nA. Let me apologize for not replying in 2005. The issue you discuss occasionally comes up when we run certain kinds of stories in Sunday Styles, not only on gay rights but also politics. (A piece last year asking if America is ready to elect a woman president got a lot of angry mail, not because of the story but because it ran in Sunday Styles --\u00ad and because it was illustrated with a pink handbag with a presidential seal.) The perception that \"serious'' news is being ghettoized in the Styles sections is even stronger with some readers on the Web, where our stories run under the heading \u201cFashion & Style.\u2019\u2019\nTo set your mind at ease, there is no top-down directive to include such articles in the Styles sections; they run here because we editors in the department liked them and assigned them and thought they would benefit from the longer, more magazinelike treatment we can give them. Mostly they appear in Sunday Styles because we define style so broadly, which I\u2019ve tried to explain in this conversation. \u201cStyles\u2019\u2019 is not just lip gloss and dress shops; it is how we live our lives today, including new perspectives on dating and mating (see the \u201cModern Love\u2019\u2019 column), workplace trends, the culture of online behavior, parenting, socializing (and social climbing!), changing attitudes about the roles of men and women and, yes, changing attitudes about sexual orientation. Because our country's accommodation of its gay minority is unfolding so quickly, in ways that are as much social as political, we look at the subject regularly. The July 2005 story you referred to seemed right for Styles in part because the teenager sent to a \"re-education\" camp posted a diary of his ordeal on a new social networking site few had heard of, called MySpace.\nAnd now, I feel the need for an easy one\u2026\nQ. What are the spring colors this year?\nA. Silver, gold, hot pink, yellow and orange. You read it here first.",

    "text": "The Republicans Candidate Debate \n2007-08-05T04:00:00.000Z\n The following is a transcript of the Republican candidates debate hosted by ABC News and moderated by George Stephanopoulos, of ABC News, and David Yepsen, of the Des Moines Register.\n CANDIDATES: SENATOR SAM BROWNBACK REPRESENTATIVE DUNCAN HUNTER  FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN: REPRESENTATIVE TOM TANCREDO FORMER MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI REPRESENTATIVE RON PAUL FORMER GOV. TOMMY G. THOMPSON FORMER GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Our goal today is to get a real debate going among all of you, to find out where you stand on the issues, but also to figure out the real differences that separate you. And in that spirit, here in Iowa you\u2019ve already been going at each other, somewhat beneath the radar screen, on the issue of abortion. \n Senator Brownback, your campaign has been making phone calls to Iowa voters about Mitt Romney, and I want to show it for our viewers. It\u2019s called an urgent action alert.\n (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n ANNOUNCER: Mitt Romney is telling Iowans that he is firmly pro- life. Nothing could be further from the truth. As late as 2005, Mitt Romney pledged to support and uphold pro- abortion policies and pass taxpayer funding of abortions in Massachusetts.\n His wife, Ann, has contributed money to Planned Parenthood. Mitt told the National Abortion Rights Action League that, \u201cYou need someone like me in Washington.\u201d\n (END AUDIO CLIP)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Brownback, do you stand by that attack?\nBROWNBACK: I certainly do. There\u2019s one word that describes that ad, and it\u2019s \u201ctruthful.\u201d That\u2019s a truthful ad. And that\u2019s what campaigns are about, too, George, is for as far as getting the truth out, expressing the differences between candidates.\n These are good people that are up on this stage. \n That\u2019s a truthful ad. I am pro-life.\n I think this is a core issue for our party. I think it\u2019s a big issue for our country. I\u2019m pro-life and I\u2019m whole life. I think that all life at all stages is sacred and it\u2019s beautiful. I think it\u2019s something we ought to fight for, it\u2019s what this party has stood for, it\u2019s what we should stand for.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney, everything in that ad true?\nROMNEY: Virtually nothing in that ad is true.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: What\u2019s wrong with it?\nROMNEY: The single word I\u2019d use would be \u201cdesperate\u201d or perhaps \u201cnegative.\u201d Frankly... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But before we move on, you said it\u2019s not true. We have it up on the screen. What is untrue? \nROMNEY: I am pro-life. That\u2019s the truth. And several years ago, when we faced the issue of cloning of embryos in our state, I wrote an op-ed piece in the Boston Globe and said I\u2019m pro-life. \nROMNEY: And every action I\u2019ve taken as governor of Massachusetts has been pro-life. This is a very difficult decision. We\u2019re involved in the lives of two people: a mom and an unborn child. And yet I\u2019ve come down on the side of saying I\u2019m in favor of life. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But are any of the specific -- any of the specific charges there untrue? \nROMNEY: The Massachusetts Citizens for Life just several months ago brought me in and gave me an award for my public leadership on the basis of being pro-life. So the best way you can learn about someone is not by asking their opponent, but ask them, \u201cWhat do you believe, and what\u2019s your view?\u201d And I am pro-life. And virtually every part of that ad is inaccurate. I\u2019m pro-life. My positions are pro-life. The idea that, for instance, I\u2019ve been in favor of taxpayer funding of abortion; that\u2019s wrong. I oppose taxpayer funding of abortion. In our state we passed a medical plan that reduces the number of people who received state funding for abortion. So the ad is just completely wrong. \nBROWNBACK: George, if I could, there\u2019s -- you can go up on YouTube and see the governor himself and speaking himself... \nROMNEY: Ah, that\u2019s the -- consider the source. \nBROWNBACK: ... about where he is on this position, and in 1994 say, \u201cI\u2019m governor...\u201d \n(CROSSTALK) \nROMNEY: Look, look. I was pro-choice. I am pro-life. And I\u2019m tired of a... \nBROWNBACK: And it is a truthful position. Every piece of that is truthful. You can got to YouTube and look for the governor, what he says himself. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney -- Governor Romney... \nROMNEY: You can go back to YouTube and look at what I said in 1994. I never said I was pro-choice, but my position was effectively pro-choice. I\u2019ve said that time and time again. I changed my position. When I was governor and when I faced an issue of a life or death, when the first time a bill came to my desk that related to the life of an unborn child, I came down on the side of life. \nROMNEY: And I put that in The Boston Globe and explained why. And I get tired of people that are holier than thou because they\u2019ve been pro-life longer than I have. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney, you\u2019ve also been drawing...\nROMNEY: But I\u2019m proud of the fact.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You have also been drawing contrasts with Mayor Giuliani during this campaign. I want to show our viewers something you said about Mayor Giuliani on the Christian Broadcasting Network this spring.\n (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nROMNEY: He is pro-choice and pro-gay marriage and anti-gun, and that\u2019s a tough combination in a Republican primary. (END VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Do you stand by that? And what is it that you fear a President Giuliani would do on those issues?\nROMNEY: I think Rudy Giuliani is a terrific American and a wonderful mayor. That was very early in the process. I think I\u2019ve got a better view...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: In March.\nROMNEY: Yes, it was in March. He wasn\u2019t a candidate yet. I think I have a better perspective on his views now -- not entirely, but a pretty good view on his positions. And I\u2019d rather let him speak for him, his own positions, than me speak for them. And I\u2019ve done by best to let other candidates speak about their own positions. \n So I\u2019m not going to try and elaborate on his positions. I can tell you that I am pro-life and that I\u2019m opposed to same- sex marriage, and I support the Second Amendment. Those are my views. Why don\u2019t we let each of us describe our own views, as opposed to taking time to describe those of our colleagues?\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Was that accurate what Governor Romney said?\nGIULIANI: Somehow, I knew you were going to ask me the question about this. \n(LAUGHTER)\n The reality is that I support the Second Amendment, as Governor Romney says.\n I clearly believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman, although I did support domestic partnerships and still do, a contractual relationship. \n And I believe the best way we can have common ground in this debate that you\u2019re hearing is if we put our emphasis on reducing abortions and increasing the number of adoptions, which is something that I did as mayor of New York City.\nGIULIANI: But I think ultimately that decision that has to be made is one that government shouldn\u2019t make. Ultimately, a woman should make that with her conscience and ultimately with her doctor. \n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Thompson, let me bring you in here, because Michael Gerson, President Bush\u2019s former speechwriter, now a columnist for The Washington Post, wrote a column about Mayor Giuliani a few weeks ago, where he said one of the consequences -- because of the mayor\u2019s pro-life position -- of a Giuliani victory would be to place the Republican nominee in direct conflict with the Roman Catholic Church.\n How big a problem is that?\nTHOMPSON: I think it\u2019s a problem. I think it\u2019s a problem not only for the Roman Catholic Church, but it\u2019s a problem with the Constitution and the platform of the Republican Party.\n Every year the Republican Party, both at the state level in Iowa, nationally, are parties that come out very avidly and passionately on being pro-life. And I think any candidate that\u2019s pro-choice is going to have a difficulty with the party faithful and those individuals that have come to this district and the state and national meetings and have avowed time and time again that this party, the Republican Party, is a party of pro-life. \n So anybody that\u2019s not pro-life is going to have difficulties. That\u2019s the question.\n Beyond that, however, I think you\u2019ve got to look beyond just one issue. And the issue that really concerns me, of course, is the health issues of America. \n And we get tied up in one particular issue and we really don\u2019t go to some of the major issues that are affecting America -- not that pro-life isn\u2019t -- but we have to get down -- and this debate should be about the major issues affecting the voters of Iowa and nationally, instead of trying to choose one person against another on this campaign.\nTHOMPSON: Every single one of us up here have got issues, positions, and every single one of us believe very strongly of those. And I think that speaks highly of the Republican Party.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You bring up an important point, and let me bring this to Senator McCain. Because some people have made the argument...\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: ... some people have made the argument that in this election especially, that Mayor Giuliani would be absolutely the strongest candidate, in part because of his pro-choice positions, but even more than that, in the general election, the most important issue is going to be national security, and an issue like abortion should be de-emphasized. \n Do you agree with that?\nMCCAIN:: I think the respect and commitment to the rights of the unborn is something I\u2019ve fought for, and it has a lot to do with national security. Because it depends on -- it says very much what kind of a country we are and our respect for human life, whether it be here in the United States or whether it be in China or Bangladesh or the Congo or anyplace else in the world. So I think it is connected. But I also firmly believe that the challenge of the 21st century is the struggle against radical Islamic extremism. It is a transcendent issue. It is hydra-headed. It will be with us for the rest of the century.\n I have served my nation and my country and the people of this country for all of my adult life. I am the most prepared. I have been involved in these issues. I have served this nation in the military and in the Congress, and I\u2019m the best prepared and equipped and need no on-the-job training to meet that challenge.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You have also addressed the issue of Iraq, probably more -- as much as, if not more than any other candidate.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And I want to turn to that as well. Because we did a poll of Iowa voters, as you saw. And we asked the voters there for questions.\n We got more questions on Iraq and the war than any other single subject. Here was one of them.\n (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n QUESTION: Hi. I\u2019m Jill Husker (ph) from Grinnell, Iowa. My question is, if you were president, what would be your strategy for ending the war in Iraq?\n (END VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Paul, what would it be? \nPAUL: Just come home. We just marched in. We can just come back.\n(APPLAUSE)\n We went in there illegally. We did not declare war. It\u2019s lasting way too long. We didn\u2019t declare war in Korea or Vietnam. The wars were never really ended. We lose those wars. We\u2019re losing this one. We shouldn\u2019t be there. We ought to just come home. \n(APPLAUSE)\n The number one reason it\u2019s in our national self-interest and for our national security, think of our defenses now, how rundown they are. What is the morale of our military today when they\u2019re sent over there for 12 months and then they\u2019re kept for another three months? They come home and, with less than a year\u2019s rest, they\u2019re sent back again. Congress is currently trying to change the rules so we give these men an adequate rest.\n This war is not going well because the foreign policy is defective.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Hunter?\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUNTER: Yes, George, I\u2019ve been here before. I was here when we stood up to the Russians in Central Europe when they were ringing our allies with SS-20 missiles. We stood up them and we finally brought that wall down.\n I was here when we did Central America, when the liberals were raging that we had to get out of Salvador. Today, Salvadoran troops are standing side-by-side with Americans in Iraq. \n And let me tell you something I\u2019m tired of. I watched the Democrat debate. I watched them say, as my colleague has said, \u201cJust bring them home. Come home.\u201d And it was a race to see who could stampede for the exit the quickest. \n And you know something? The Marines in Anbar province, which is almost half of Iraq, have turned that situation around. They brought the communities there on our side, fighting back against Al Qaida. Not a single Democrat...\n(APPLAUSE)\n Not a single Democrat candidate paused in their rush for the exit to say to our Marines, \u201cGood job. You guys are fighting and achieving, with blood, sweat and tears, what this country needs.\u201d We\u2019ve got our best military leadership in Iraq right now. We are standing up the Iraq military, the 129 battalions. When they are stood up, when they\u2019re reliable, battle-ready, they rotate onto the battlefield, they displace American heavy combat forces. That\u2019s the right way to leave, not a stampede for the exit. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Hunter, thank you. \n So we\u2019ve got the poles of this debate Governor Huckabee...\n(APPLAUSE)\n I\u2019ll come back to you in a second. \n We\u2019ve got the poles of this debate. Congressman Paul says, \u201cCome home.\u201d Congressman Hunter says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay.\u201d Is there a middle ground in this debate?\nHUCKABEE: Certainly there\u2019s a middle ground, George. And the middle ground is that we win this war and we do it with honor. We don\u2019t just stay indefinitely. We put some pressure -- just like we have been the last week, with Secretary Rice and Secretary Gates -- on the Saudis.\nHUCKABEE: Look, we\u2019ve made them rich. Every time somebody in this room goes to the gas pump, you\u2019ve helped make the Saudi royal family a little wealthier. And the money that has been used against us in terrorism has largely come from the Middle East.\n There\u2019s two things we\u2019ve got to do. \n Number one, we\u2019ve got to insist that the people in that neighborhood take a far greater role militarily and financially in solving the problem. It\u2019s their neighborhood.\n But the second thing we\u2019d do, for our own national security, is end our dependence on foreign oil. And let\u2019s not play around and say \u201c30 years,\u201d let\u2019s get it done. Let\u2019s get it done now. And let\u2019s make sure that we don\u2019t have to depend upon their oil for our future energy needs.\n BROWNBACK (?): George? George?\nHUCKABEE: If we can feed ourselves, if we can fuel ourselves, if we can manufacture the weapons to fight for ourselves, we\u2019re a free people. If we can\u2019t do those three things, we\u2019re not free. \n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I\u2019m going to bring everyone in on this.\n Senator Brownback, go ahead.\nBROWNBACK: There\u2019s another piece to this as well. And that is, is that you\u2019ve got the military performing, I think, very well, doing an outstanding job, but the political situation continues to deteriorate on the ground in Iraq. You\u2019ve got the Iraqi politicians not even meeting now. You\u2019ve got a weak leadership that\u2019s taking place there.\n I think the key missing element here is political resolve on the ground. We need a political surge, like Thomas Friedman has written about. We need to put a three-state solution in place, like was in Iraq prior to World War I, where you have a north that\u2019s Kurdish, which is right now; a west that\u2019s Sunni, which is right now; and a Shia south, with Baghdad as the federal city.\n A weak, soft partition: that\u2019s the piece missing...\n(CROSSTALK)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And that is -- that is your plan.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let me bring Senator McCain in on this. Senator Brownback -- Senator McCain, Senator Brownback talked about the lack of political progress. \n It\u2019s actually written into the law right now benchmarks that the Iraqi government has to meet. It is also very, very clear that they are not going to meet those benchmarks by the time General Petraeus reports in September.\n If they fail to meet these benchmarks which are written into the law, will you still continue to support the surge?\nMCCAIN:: Of course. They are making progress, and we are winning on the ground. And there are political solutions being arrived at all over Iraq today, not at the national level.\n I\u2019m disappointed, of course, that the Maliki government has not done what they need to do. But I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s not only in the national interest of the Iraqis, it\u2019s an American national interest. We are winning. \n We must win. If we lose, there\u2019ll be catastrophic consequences and genocide, and we will be back. This is a seminal moment in American history. We must succeed. \n There will be a big debate coming up in September on the floor of the Senate. We will win that debate because the American people understand the consequences of failure.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Giuliani...\nMCCAIN:: Morale is good. Morale is good amongst our military. I can tell you that. \n A three-state solution -- we just saw it when the Iraqi people joined together with Iraqi flags celebrating a victory in a soccer match. \n We are winning. We must win. And we will not set a date for surrender, as the Democrats want us to do.v \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Giuliani, is there any difference... \n(APPLAUSE)\n Is there any difference between you and Senator McCain on this issue? Would you also continue to...\nGIULIANI: I just noticed the question before, Senator McCain said something -- in four Democratic debates, not a single Democratic candidate said the word \u201cIslamic terrorism.\u201d Now, that is taking political correctness to extremes.\nGIULIANI: It really is.\n(APPLAUSE)\n The reality is that you do not achieve peace through weakness and appeasement. Weakness and appeasement should not be a policy of the American government. We should seek a victory in Iraq and in Baghdad, and we should define the victory.\n And I thought the piece by O\u2019Hanlon and Pollack last week in the New York Times, which, I have to frankly tell you, when I read it in the morning, I read it twice, and I checked -- New York Times? But it was the New York Times. It was.\n(LAUGHTER)\n And it said, \u201cWe just might win in Iraq.\u201d \n Now, why we would want to retreat in the face of at least some empirical evidence that General Petraeus and... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But that\u2019s military -- that\u2019s military progress. No political progress. You\u2019d continue to support the surge even if there\u2019s no political progress. \nGIULIANI: The reality is that if we can bring stability to Iraq, and we can give them a chance to develop stability, that\u2019s what we should be trying to accomplish. This is part of an overall terrorist war against the United States. And that\u2019s why I noted Senator McCain\u2019s statement about Islamic extreme terrorism. This is part of an overall war against us by the terrorists. It\u2019s a battle in that war. America should win that battle. And winning that battle is to have an Iraq that helps us against the Islamic terrorists. \nROMNEY\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney, are you, Mayor Giuliani and Senator McCain all in the same place right now on Iraq? \nROMNEY: I think we\u2019re pretty much in the same place. It is critical for us to win this conflict. It is essential, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to continue to pursue this effort. And we\u2019re going to get a report from General Petraeus on the success. And I agree the Brookings Institution report over the weekend was a very encouraging indication that we\u2019re making progress. That\u2019s great news. At the same time, you look at that Democratic debate, I had to laugh at what I saw Barack Obama do. I mean, in one week he went from saying he\u2019s going to sit down, you know, for tea, with our enemies, but then he\u2019s going to bomb our allies. I mean, he\u2019s gone from Jane Fonda to Dr. Strangelove in one week.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We\u2019re going to get to that. We\u2019re going to get to that in a little bit. \n(APPLAUSE) \nROMNEY: Let me continue. Hold on. I had more time, let me continue. I want to make one other point. \nROMNEY: And that is, while we are waking up here in the United States and thinking about our barbecue in the afternoon and what\u2019s on TV, what baseball game is on, there are lot of families in this country, hundreds of thousands of people, who are waking up wondering whether their loved one is still alive. We have families who made a huge surge of sacrifice to support this surge. And it\u2019s time, in my view, for the people of America to show a surge of support, including our leaders in Washington, for these families and for the troops. Let\u2019s get behind them and give them everything we have: our prayers, our encouragement, our funds, anything to make sure this surge is successful because it counts for America. \n(APPLAUSE) \n(CROSSTALK) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I\u2019m looking at you right now. Do you differ at all from Mayor Giuliani, Governor Romney or Senator McCain? Then Senator Thompson and Ron Paul get the last word on this round. Go ahead, Congressman Tancredo. \nTANCREDO: There are a number of things, of course, with regard to Iraq that I think we have found some common ground on, but the reality is this: that it is absolutely true I think that we are in a war with radical Islam. That is the war. A battle is being fought in Iraq. Now, can we win the military battle on the ground? Yes, we can. Our guys are the best in the world, and the people that are serving there cannot be faulted in any way. One of the things, however, that I must say I am concerned about are the rules of engagement, that apparently are restricting the ability of our people to do their job and to protect themselves. No one should ever go into harm\u2019s way, no president should ever send anyone in this military into harm\u2019s way and keep one arm tied behind them. These rules of engagement have got to be reviewed, and no president should ever pursue them in this wan, or let people go into battle and be actually at risk. \nTANCREDO: I unveiled a statue for a guy by the name of Danny Dietz in my district, a Navy SEAL. Danny Dietz is dead because the rules of engagement did not allow them to do what they needed to do over there. That is unacceptable. In the broader picture, of course, you are absolutely right. We have to do something about the fact that there is no political or economic solution being developed by the Iraqis. And you have to push them into it. America cannot be the police force in Iraq. It cannot remove itself entirely from Iraq, but Iraq has got to take control of Iraq. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Thompson, and then Congressman Paul, you get the last word. \n(APPLAUSE) \nTHOMPSON: Thank you very much. I\u2019ve laid out a whole plan to really win the peace in Iraq. I\u2019ve laid out a plan that we have to defend and give all our resources and every single tool possible to our fighting men and women. I have been with them, like a lot of the people up here have, and they\u2019re the finest young men and women we\u2019ll ever have in our military. But beyond that, it is not fair to America and to Americans to shoulder all of the burden. To pay for a war that\u2019s costing us $10 billion a month -- and we\u2019re not funding, we\u2019re just passing on to our children and grandchildren -- not requiring the Iraqi government to stand up and vote, that\u2019s a failure of Congress and the president of the United States. Because they do need to demand that that government makes a political statement, and help pay for that war, and help fight to win that war. Secondly, I differ with Senator Brownback. They can\u2019t even decide in parliament in Iraq whether or not they\u2019re going to be able to take a month or six weeks off for summer. \nTHOMPSON: How will they ever decide three particular divisions? They\u2019ve already got that country divided into 18 states that have been there since 1921. And if, in fact, you\u2019re going to elect people, why don\u2019t you a elect state leader, like you do in Iowa, like we do in Wisconsin, all over America? And those individual governments will be Shiite, Sunnis and Kurds. And it will stop the civil war. And split the oil revenue between the federal government, the state governments, and every man and woman and child, like we do in Alaska, and give those individuals the opportunity to build their country. That will make a stable Iraq. (inaudible) \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Paul, you get the last word on this round. \nPAUL: I, of course, opposed the war a long time before it started. The neoconservatives promoted this war many, many years before it was started. It had nothing to do with Al Qaida. There was no Al Qaida in Iraq. There were no weapons of mass destruction. Just think of the weapons the Soviets had in the \u201960s and the \u201970s. And we did not have to go to nuclear war with them. There\u2019s no reason to go to war against these men in these Third World nations. At the same time, those individuals who have predicted these disastrous things to happen if we leave Iraq are the same ones who said, \u201cAs soon as we go in, it will just be duck soup, it\u2019ll be over in three months and it won\u2019t cost us anything because the oil will pay for it.\u201d \n(APPLAUSE) \nMCCAIN: (?): Have you forgotten about 9/11? \nPAUL: And at the same time... \nMCCAIN: (?): Have you forgotten about... \nPAUL: Just a moment -- at the same time, the individuals who predicted the disaster, of course, the domino theory, in Vietnam -- I was called to duty. I accepted that duty in the \u201960s. I served five years in the military. When we left there, it was tough, yes. But now we trade with Vietnam. We talk to them. The president\u2019s come to this country. We go back and forth. We invest in that country. We can achieve much more in peace than we can ever achieve in these needless, unconstitutional, undeclared wars. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator McCain? \nMCCAIN:: Let me just say, George, all of us feel frustration, sometimes anger and sorrow over what\u2019s happened in this war. \nMCCAIN:: It was very badly mismanaged for nearly the first four years. I was one of the greatest critics. We do now have a strategy that is succeeding. We do have a military whose morale is up because they see this success. This has consequences far beyond Iraq, throughout the entire region. Look at the behavior of the Iranians, the Syria, the uneasiness of our so-called allies of the region. This is an historic moment in history. And I\u2019m going to be judged by history, not by public opinion polls. And I believe that we can and must prevail, and we\u2019ve got the strategy and the general that can do it. Give us some time for it to succeed. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to move on now to domestic issues. Health care, one of the number-one domestic issues we heard about in our poll. You hear about it every day out on the campaign trail. This week, the Senate debating whether or not to expand health insurance to children in the United States. And for this, I\u2019m want to turn to the question from David Yepsen. \nYEPSEN: Governor Huckabee, Senator Grassley helped fashion a compromise plan to cover 3.2 million more children by raising the cigarette tax -- poor children. President Bush has threatened to veto. Who do you side with, President Bush or Senator Grassley? \nHUCKABEE: I think I\u2019d like to side with the people of America who really are looking for a lot better action than they\u2019re getting out of their president or Congress. You know, if you want to know how to fix it, I\u2019ve got a solution. Either give every American the same kind of health care that Congress has, or make Congress have the same kind of health care that every American has. \n(APPLAUSE) They\u2019ll get it fixed. And the issue in this country is that we really have an incredible problem because our system is upside-down. It focuses on intervention at the catastrophic level of disease rather than really focusing on prevention. So we\u2019ve got a system that, no matter how much money we pour into it, we\u2019re not going to fix it. \nHUCKABEE: We\u2019re not going to fix it until we begin to address the fact that this country has put its focus not on wellness, not on prevention, not on health, but on sickness. And that\u2019s the single most important and urgent thing that has to be done. And if we don\u2019t do that, then we\u2019re going to continue just pouring money -- and it\u2019s almost like having a boat that\u2019s taking on water, and rather than plugging the hole, we want to get a bigger bucket to take the water out of the boat. \nYEPSEN: Governor Thompson, same question to you. Who do you side with in that dispute, the president or Iowa\u2019s senior senator? \nTHOMPSON: David, I want you to know that health care is one of my major dominant fields. I was secretary of health. Neither one of them are right. The problem is, is Governor Huckabee is absolutely correct. We\u2019ve got a sickness, illness and disease society. We spend 90 percent of $2 trillion, ladies and gentlemen -- that\u2019s 16 percent of the gross national product -- on getting people well after they get sick. Less than 10 percent of the money keeping you out of the hospital, out of the nursing home. Does anybody in America think that\u2019s a smart idea? I think it\u2019s dumb. Let\u2019s go to wellness and prevention. Number two, let\u2019s start managing diseases in America. Let\u2019s make sure that individuals that are chronically ill and physically disabled are able to get the quality of health and therefore get the quality of life. They take up 66 percent of the cost. You could reduce that down to 50 percent. \nYEPSEN: Congressman Tancredo... \nTHOMPSON: Number three -- I just would like to say -- on the uninsured, you could get one form, like we do on the 1040 for taxes, one form for the employment system, and you could save $137 billion. That would cover all of the uninsured in America without raising taxes, ladies and gentlemen. \nYEPSEN: Congressman Tancredo, how do you cover this (ph)? \n(APPLAUSE) \nTANCREDO: Let me suggest -- let me suggest we think about something in the area of health care that perhaps is unique, different and scary to some people, but that is this: The government -- it\u2019s not the responsibility of the federal government to provide womb-to- tomb health care for America. \n(APPLAUSE) And so, we constantly debate on exactly what way we want to push government control of this issue, but in every way we\u2019re doing it, it\u2019s unhealthy. It is unhealthy to have a government health-care plan in America. There are some things we can do, absolutely. The expansion of health savings accounts that increases individual responsibly. The allowing for people to actually take -- the reimportation of prescription drugs. And not only that, but let\u2019s do something about the 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens in this country that are taking a large part of our health-care dollars. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Gentlemen, I want to give this back to David Yepsen in a second, but I just want to clear something up first. Congressman Tancredo, I know you voted against the expansion of the children\u2019s health insurance this week. \nTANCREDO: You bet I did. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: This is just yes or no, Governor Thompson: Are you for the expansion or with President Bush on the veto? \nTHOMPSON: I am for expanding SCHIP, but not the way Congress has done it. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK, so that\u2019s a no. And the same thing for you, Governor Huckabee. \nHUCKABEE: The problem with it, it actually would bring cuts to the Medicare alternative, which is the worst thing we could do, because it then takes money away from seniors. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Now, I also... \nHUCKABEE: So, again, it\u2019s just not a good solution... \n(CROSSTALK) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Now, again, I also know that, Congressman Paul and Congressman Hunter and Senator Brownback and Senator McCain, you all voted against expansion, as well. So the only two gentlemen left here are Governor Romney and Mayor Giuliani. Are either one of you for the expansion of children\u2019s health insurance, as outlined by Senator Grassley? \nROMNEY: Look, it\u2019s critical to insure more people in this country. It doesn\u2019t make sense to have 45 million people without insurance. It\u2019s not good for them because they don\u2019t get good preventative care and disease management, just as these folks have spoken about. But it\u2019s not good for the rest of the citizens either, because if people aren\u2019t insured, they go to the emergency room for their care when they get very sick. That\u2019s expensive. They don\u2019t have any insurance to cover it. \nROMNEY: So guess who pays? Everybody else. So it\u2019s not good for the people that aren\u2019t insured. It\u2019s not good for everybody else. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So you\u2019re against... \nROMNEY: We have to -- no, no, let me finish. Green light\u2019s on. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK. \n(LAUGHTER) \nROMNEY: We have to get -- no, they just turned it off. Leave it on. \n(LAUGHTER) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I control it. \nROMNEY: We have to have our citizens insured, and we\u2019re not going to do that by tax exemptions, because the people that don\u2019t have insurance aren\u2019t paying taxes. What you have to do is what we did in Massachusetts. Is it perfect? No. But we say, let\u2019s rely on personal responsibility, help people buy their own private insurance, get our citizens insured, not with a government takeover, not with new taxes needed, but instead with a free-market based system that gets all of our citizens in the system. No more free rides. It works. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But a no on the Grassley bill. Mayor Giuliani, go ahead. \nGIULIANI: The bill had two very unfortunate parts to it. One, it would reduce Medicaid Advantage, which is a very, very successful program that actually does bring about some form of a free- market solution. And second, it would have the really odd effect of moving children who presently have private insurance to becoming wards of the state, basically having them move in the direction of -- and I know the Democrats get all upset when you say this, but they\u2019re taking us toward socialized medicine. If we want the kind of results they have in England or France or Canada or Cuba, like Michael Moore wants us to do, then we should go in that direction. But that would be a terrible thing to do. What we should do is increase the number of people who have private insurance. In order to do that, we should give them a major tax deduction, $15,000, let them have a health savings account as part of that. They\u2019ll have an incentive to own their own health insurance. That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s wrong with the market here. It is not really good to move this thing in terms of more government control of health care. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But just for the record, everyone is against the expansion as Grassley outlined. Go ahead. \nYEPSEN: Congressman Hunter? \nHUNTER: Yeah. Let\u2019s get back to freedom. One thing you can\u2019t do right now, if you\u2019re an American who has a health insurance plan is you can\u2019t buy health insurance across state lines. Now, we\u2019ve seen studies that have shown that the same coverage that costs 750 bucks a month in Massachusetts, you can buy in Missouri for 170 bucks a month. \nHUNTER: But you can\u2019t buy your health insurance across state lines like Americans buy lots of stuff across state lines. George, you know, I had a senior citizen come into my office one day. She had a $10 wrist brace on. And she said, \u201cI was told not to complain about this, because government is paying for it.\u201d She gave me the bill. It was $525. That -- you\u2019re going to see a lot of $525 wrist braces if we pass -- if we continue to pass this SCHIP which really is the first extension of socialized medicine. This is socialized medicine. It\u2019s going to go to families that make $60,000 a year. Those aren\u2019t poor children. \n(APPLAUSE) \nYEPSEN: Senator Brownback, the bill would raise tobacco tax, as you know. How do we pay for health care in this country without raising some additional revenues? \nBROWNBACK: Well, that\u2019s why I voted against the bill. But it wasn\u2019t just that. The piece of it that I think you have to recognize is that you\u2019ve got a fundamental decision to make here on health care, which is 16 percent of the economy, going north fast, probably headed to 20 percent of our total economy. Do you think the solution to providing more and better health care is, one, that we should have more government solutions involved, or should there be more market-based solutions involved? And I think clearly the answer here is you need more market forces in health care. That\u2019s what we need to do. \n(APPLAUSE) Instead, you\u2019ve got the Democrats doing a step-by-step march toward a socialized one government-pay system. And they\u2019re very happy to do it that way. But we can get better health care going this way. And we can hold the price of it down and not bust the federal treasury at the same time. We can get (inaudible). \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, we didn\u2019t get a debate among all of you, but maybe we\u2019ll get one with Senator Grassley later, after the debate. (UNKNOWN): Maybe he won\u2019t endorse anybody after this. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: After this, that\u2019s right. I want to move on to something... \nTHOMPSON: But, George... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Excuse me, Governor Thompson, I want to move on now to something that Governor Romney brought up just a little while ago, and that was the comments earlier this week of Senator Obama, where he talked about going into Pakistan even if President Musharraf didn\u2019t agree. Here\u2019s what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BARACK OBAMA, D-ILL.: It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an Al Qaida leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets, and President Musharraf will not act, we will. (END VIDEO CLIP) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney, you said you didn\u2019t agree with Obama\u2019s plan and you called it \u201cill-timed and ill-considered.\u201d Mayor Giuliani, on \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d the other night, you said, \u201cI would take that option.\u201d Why don\u2019t you guys take two minutes and debate this issue out? \nGIULIANI: Well, I believe that is an option that should remain open. I believe the senator didn\u2019t express it the right way. I think the senator, if he could just say it over again, might want to say that we would encourage Musharraf to allow us to do it if we thought he couldn\u2019t accomplish it. But the reality is, America cannot take... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But if he said no, you\u2019d go in. \nGIULIANI: I didn\u2019t say I would go in. I said I wouldn\u2019t take the option off the table. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: No, well, you actually said, \u201cI would take that option.\u201d \nGIULIANI: I said I would keep that option open. In any event... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: No, you said, \u201cIf we have a chance to catch bin Laden and we\u2019ve got to do it ourselves because we\u2019re not sure if somebody is going to do it correctly, yeah, I think I would take that option.\u201d \nGIULIANI: Well, I would take that action if I thought there was no other way to crush Al Qaida, no other way to crush the Taliban, and no other way to be able to capture bin Laden. I think Pakistan has, unfortunately, not been making the efforts that they should be making. I think we should encourage them to do it, we should put the pressure on them to do it, and we should seek their permission of we ever had to take action there as we were able to get their permission -- Undersecretary or Deputy Secretary Armitage was very effective in getting Musharraf\u2019s permission for us to act in Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2001 and 2002. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney? \nROMNEY: Yes, I think Barack Obama is confused as to who are our friends and who are our enemies. In his first year, he wants to meet with Castro and Chavez and Assad, Ahmadinejad. Those are our enemies. Those are the world\u2019s worst tyrants. And then he says he wants to unilaterally go in and potentially bomb a nation which is our friend. We\u2019ve trying to strengthen Musharraf. We\u2019re trying to strengthen the foundations of democracy and freedom in that country so that they will be able to reject the extremists. We\u2019re working with them -- we\u2019re working with them... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But if your CIA director called them and said, \u201cWe had Osama bin Laden in our sights, Musharraf says no,\u201d what do you do? \n(CROSSTALK) \nROMNEY: It\u2019s wrong for a person running for the president of the United States to get on TV and say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go into your country unilaterally.\u201d Of course, America always maintains our option to do whatever we think is in the best interests of America. But we don\u2019t go out and say, \u201cLadies and gentlemen of Germany, if ever there was a problem in your country, we didn\u2019t think you were doing the right thing, we reserve the right to come in and get them out.\u201d \nROMNEY: We don\u2019t say those things. We keep our options quiet. We do not go out and say to a nation which is working with us, where we have collaborated and they are our friend and we\u2019re trying to support Musharraf and strengthen him and his nation, that instead that we intend to go in there and potentially bring out a unilateral attack. Recognize to win the war on jihad, we have to not only have a strong military of our own -- and we need a stronger military -- we also need to have strong friends around the world and help moderate Muslims reject the extreme. Because ultimately the only people who can finally defeat these radical Islamic jihadists are the Muslims themselves. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So what I am hearing is from both you is... \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: ... what I\u2019m hearing is you keep this option on the table, but it is foolish to talk about it in public. Does anybody disagree with that? \nHUNTER: Yes, I disagree with it. \n(CROSSTALK) \nHUNTER: George, let me tell you, Barack Obama didn\u2019t understand, there are now 100,000 Pakistani troops who have been moved to the border. They have moved two divisions to the border, in fact, one of them out of the high country on the Indian border. You right now have operations that are being taken in cooperation with American forces in Afghanistan. The last thing you do when you are trying to convince your allies all over the world to work with you is when you have one country which has taken 100,000 military personnel and moved them into that place -- and we all know what the problem is. The problem is that you have the tribal chiefs in that strip in Pakistan accommodating the Taliban and Al Qaida. When you have a country which is cooperating, you don\u2019t tell them you are going to unilaterally move against them, or you are somehow going to undertake this by yourself. \nHUNTER: Those mountain ranges in Pakistan are 16,000 feet high. We need the Pakistani army to work that with American support. That\u2019s the right way. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to stay on this subject. \n(APPLAUSE) I want to stay on this subject but broaden out the conversation a little bit. And the way I want to get into it is with a bit from President Bush\u2019s second inaugural address, where he made the spreading of democracy the core of his foreign policy. Here\u2019s what he said: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. (END VIDEO CLIP) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Huckabee, since then, since that speech, there have been free elections in Gaza; they elected Hamas. There have been free elections in Lebanon; they empowered Hezbollah. There have been free elections in Iran; they elected President Ahmadinejad. Has President Bush\u2019s policy been a success? And would the spread of democracy be the core of your foreign policy? \nHUCKABEE: Well, the problem is, George, sometimes when you get what you want, you don\u2019t want what you get. And this is a great case of that happening. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the job of the United States to export our form of government. It\u2019s the job of the United States to protect our citizens, to secure our own borders, which we have failed to do for over 20 years. It\u2019s the job of our government to make us free and us safe, and to create an enviable kind of government and system that everybody else will want, much in the same way I think we ended up seeing the fall of the Soviet Union. And as far as how do we get there... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So it wouldn\u2019t be the core of your foreign policy? \nHUCKABEE: Absolutely not, because I don\u2019t think we can force people to accept our way of life, our way of government. What we can to is to create the strongest America: change our tax system, make it so that people are healthier, create the enviable education system on this planet, make sure that jobs come back to this country rather than disappear from this country. \nHUCKABEE: And if we do that kind of approach, we\u2019ll have the sort of freedom internally, secure borders, a safer nation. That makes a whole lot more sense to me than spending billions and billions and billion of dollars to try to prop up some government we don\u2019t even like when we get it. And people in this country are losing their jobs, losing their health insurance, and their kids are sitting with their heads on their desks, sound asleep in school. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Paul? \nPAUL: Our responsibility is to spread democracy here, make sure that we have it. This is a philosophic and foreign policy problem, because what the president was saying was just a continuation of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s \u201cmaking the world safe for democracy.\u201d There\u2019s nothing wrong with spreading our values around the world, but it is wrong to spread it by force. We should spread it by setting an example and going and doing a good job here. Threatening Pakistan and threatening Iran makes no sense whatsoever. We went in -- and I supported going after the Al Qaida into Afghanistan -- but, lo and behold, the neocons took over. They forgot about Osama bin Laden. And what they did, they went into nation- building, not only in Afghanistan, they went unjustifiably over into Iraq. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re in this mess today. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Giuliani, both Governor Huckabee... \n(APPLAUSE) ... both Governor Huckabee and Congressman Paul said they would not continue President Bush\u2019s policy. Would you? \nGIULIANI: George, I think the way you\u2019re defining it is incorrect. Democracy is not necessarily immediately going to elections. Democracy is... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, that was the way President Bush defined it... \nGIULIANI: Well, OK... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: ... not me, but go ahead. \nGIULIANI: The way I look at it, democracy also requires the rule of law. It requires stability. It requires people not being afraid they\u2019re going to be killed every day when they go out on the street. Democracy\u2019s only a theory if you\u2019re living in an unstable situation. So sometimes, democracy is the long-term goal, but in order to get there, you have to first build a rule of law, you have to first build respect for human rights, you have to first build... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So did we push for elections too quickly in Gaza? \nGIULIANI: In some cases, maybe going to elections so quickly is a mistake. Maybe the thing to do is to first make sure that you\u2019ve developed the bedrock -- bedrock for democracy. You know, if you\u2019re living -- I learned this in New York City when I became the mayor. Of course the situation was nowhere near as serious, but people were afraid to go out at night because crime was so rampant. I mean, we had all kinds of civil rights, but nobody could exercise them, because they were too darn afraid to go out, too darn afraid to go to the movies or go buy groceries at the grocery store. First, you have to have a certain quality of life that allows you to be comfortable (inaudible) going to exist, your children are going to go to school, you\u2019re going to be able to have a job, and your rights are going to be respected. Then elections start to mean something in the full picture of what a democracy is. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But, Senator McCain, would you follow what Mayor Giuliani is saying -- maybe go a little bit slower on elections, not put the spread of elections quite at the core of your foreign policy? \nMCCAIN:: We fail to appreciate that elections do not mean democracy, that it is rule of law. And rule of law, by the way, is beginning to take hold in Iraq, just as peaceful and more secure -- more secure, not totally secure -- neighborhoods in Baghdad and in Anbar and in other parts, in the Kurdish areas, is beginning to take place, which will then allow true democracy to take place. It\u2019s naive to say that we will never use nuclear weapons. It\u2019s naive to say we\u2019re going to attack Pakistan without thinking it through. What if Musharraf were removed from power? What if a radical Islamic government were to take place because we triggered it with an attack? But the fundamental -- by the way, you quoted President Bush. President Kennedy also said at his inauguration that would go anywhere and bear any burden. I believe the reason why we won the Cold War and the reason why we are still a shining city on a hill is because of our advocacy and our dedication to the principles that all of us are created equal and endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. \nMCCAIN:: That\u2019s all of us, no matter where we live in the world, no matter what our faith or our beliefs are. And I will continue to advocate for freedom and democracy and rights for all human beings. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney, will the Bush policy be your policy? \nROMNEY: Just as these other two gentlemen have said, democracy is not defined by a vote. There have to be the underpinnings of democracy: education, health care, people recognizing they live in a place that has the rule of law. And that\u2019s why our effort to spread democracy should continue, not to just spread votes, but instead to encourage other people in the world to have the benefits that we enjoy and to welcome democracy. As Tony Blair said, ours should be a campaign of values, encouraging other nations to see what we have and want those things for themselves. And there\u2019s no question in this country, we need to reach out, not just with our military might -- although that we have, and should keep it strong -- but also reach out with our other great capabilities. There... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But did President Bush fail to appreciate the nuance you\u2019re talking about now? That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking. \nROMNEY: I don\u2019t know what President -- all the things President Bush has done, but I can tell you, I\u2019m not a carbon copy of President Bush. And there are things I would do that would be done differently. I think when there\u2019s a country like Lebanon, for instance, that becomes a democracy, that instead of standing by and seeing how they do, we should have been working with the government there to assure that they have the rule of law, that they have agricultural and economic policies that work for them, that they have schools that are not Wahhabi schools, that we try and make sure they have good health care. We bring together not just America, but all the nations of the civilized world. We help draw these folks toward modernity, as opposed to having them turn toward the violence and the extreme, which Hezbollah and Hamas brought forward. And that kind of a campaign of values, combined with our strong arms, speaking softly but carrying a strong stick, as Teddy Roosevelt said, that will help move the world to a safer place. \nROMNEY: We\u2019d love it if we could all just come home and not worry about the rest of the world, as Ron Paul says. But the problem is, they attacked us on 9/11. We were here; they attacked us. We want to help move the world of Islam toward modernity so they can reject the extreme... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Tancredo, your answer on this this week was... \n(APPLAUSE) You said that, in order to deter an attack by Islamic terrorists using nuclear weapons, you would threaten to bomb Mecca and Medina. The State Department called that \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cabsolutely crazy.\u201d \nTANCREDO: Yes, the State Department -- boy, when they start complaining about things I say, I feel a lot better about the things I say, I\u2019ll tell you right now. \n(LAUGHTER) \n(APPLAUSE) My task as president of the United States is primarily to do one thing -- by the way, not to make sure everybody has health care or everybody\u2019s child is educated -- my task is to do one thing: to protect and defend this country. And that means to deter -- and I want to underline \u201cdeter\u201d -- any kind of aggression, especially the type we are threatened with by Al Qaida, which is nuclear attack. I read the national intelligence estimate. I see what they are planning. And I\u2019m telling you right now that anybody that would suggest that we should take anything like this off the table in order to deter that kind of event in the United States isn\u2019t fit to be president of the United States. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Thompson, you get the last word on this round. PAUL (?): No, I need -- I haven\u2019t spoken on... \nTHOMPSON: I would like to... \n(CROSSTALK) PAUL (?): ... to speak on this. \nTHOMPSON: Thank you very much, George. I sincerely believe that bombing religious artifacts and religious holy sites would do nothing but unify 1 billion Muslims against us. It makes no sense. \n(APPLAUSE) TANCREDO (?): After we take a hit? \nTHOMPSON: I would like to say you have to strengthen your military. What we (inaudible) as Americans, we have to be so politically correct in this country. When we have democracies in South America that are supporting us, we sort of ignore them, until somebody elects a guy like Chavez who hates us. Then we wake up and say something about it. \nTHOMPSON: I think we\u2019ve got to strengthen our military and we\u2019ve got to recognize in this world right now we are fighting a holy war. It\u2019s a jihad. And until we recognize that and stand up to be Americans and for America, we\u2019re going to continue to lose... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Brownback, then we\u2019re out of this. \n(APPLAUSE) \nBROWNBACK: Thank you. George, I think you\u2019re seeing clearly from the discussion here and this week that words of a president matter. When Ronald Reagan says, \u201cMr. Gorbachev, bring down this wall,\u201d that mattered. When he called the Soviet Union an evil empire, that mattered. Words of our leader matter, and you have to matter within the context of where we are. We are in a generational conflict with militant Islamists. That\u2019s where we are. We are at war. We\u2019re a nation at war. I think we have to be very realistic about this war. We have a number of allies in the Islamic world. We have a number of allies around the world. It is something important what we say and the direction we go. I think we push democracy, but I think we have to be realistic in the places that we push and at the time we push it. You push democracy in Pakistan or Egypt right now, you\u2019re going to get a radicalized government in Pakistan, a radicalized government in Egypt and you\u2019re going to have a nuclear-weaponed, radical government in Pakistan. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK, that wraps up discussion. \nBROWNBACK: That\u2019s why we have to be realistic... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you very much, but I do want to move on to another issue that was in... \n(APPLAUSE) ... that was in the news this week. Of course, the collapse of that bridge up in Minneapolis on 35 West, brought a lot of attention to our nation\u2019s infrastructure. And with that, let me turn back to David Yepsen. \nYEPSEN: Governor Huckabee, is it time we raise the federal gas tax to start fixing up our nation\u2019s bridges and roads? \nHUCKABEE: Well, I think the obvious answer is, it\u2019s not necessarily that we raise a tax to fix what we ought to fix of this country. We\u2019re spending billions of dollars all over our country and around the world, but it may be time that we start spending some of those billions of dollars to deal with our own infrastructure. And the bridge isn\u2019t the only problem. Anybody who\u2019s flown lately -- as I do pretty regularly in the commercial system -- know that we have a complete gridlock. \nHUCKABEE: And part of that problem is we\u2019ve got a system of air traffic control that was designed in 1950, five years before I was born. We\u2019ve got better navigation systems in our rental cars than we have running the airline industry today. And so, yes, we need to address it. It\u2019s not being talked about. And it\u2019s our bridges, our interstates, our sewer and water treatment systems. They\u2019re crumbling. They\u2019re old. We saw an 85-year-old steam pipe explode in the middle of Manhattan recently. And we have to start addressing building this country, not everybody else\u2019s. \n(APPLAUSE) \nYEPSEN: Mayor Giuliani, how do you answer -- in Minnesota, Governor Pawlenty, who vetoed an increase in his state gas tax said now he may consider one. Is this Republican dogma against taxes now precluding the ability of you and your party to come up with the revenues that the country needs to fix its bridges? \nGIULIANI: David, there\u2019s an assumption in your question that is not necessarily correct, sort of the Democratic, liberal assumption: \u201cI need money; I raise taxes.\u201d \nYEPSEN: Then what are you going to cut, sir? \nGIULIANI: But wait, wait, wait. Let me explain it. \nYEPSEN: What do you cut? \nGIULIANI: The way to do it sometimes is to reduce taxes and raise more money. For example... \n(APPLAUSE) ... I ran the city -- I ran a city with 759 bridges; probably the most used bridges in the nation, some of the most used in the world. I was able to acquire more money to fund capital programs. I reduced the number of poor bridges from 5 percent to 1.7 percent. I was able to raise more money to fix those bridges by lowering taxes. I lowered income taxes by 25 percent. I was collecting 40 percent more from the lower income tax than from the higher income tax. Or, I\u2019ll give you another example. Senator Edwards last week recommended increasing the capital gains tax from 15 percent to 28 percent because he wants more money. \nGIULIANI: Now, Senator Edwards hasn\u2019t had much executive experience because the reality is the last time -- the last time we raised the capital gains tax, and you can go back and check it, from 20 to 28 percent, we lost $45 billion. There is a liberal Democratic assumption that if you raise taxes, you raise money. We should put more money into infrastructure. We should have a good program for doing it. But the kneejerk liberal Democratic reaction -- raise taxes to get money -- very often is a very big mistake. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney, do you want to cut taxes to fix more bridges? \nROMNEY: There\u2019s no question but that the biggest source of revenue for this country -- if you really want to make some money in this country, really get some money so we can repair our infrastructure and build for the future, the biggest source of that is a growing American economy. If the economy is growing slowly, when tax revenues hardly move at all, and, boy, you better raise taxes to get more money for all the things you want to do. But if the economy is growing quickly, then we generate all sorts of new revenue. And the best way to keep the economy rolling is to keep our taxes down. That is why I proposed that middle-income Americans ought to pay no taxes on their savings. Invest in the future of the economy. Growth helps us provide the revenue that we need. Our bridges -- let me tell you what we did in our state. We found that we had 500 bridges, roughly, that were deemed structurally deficient. And so we changed how we focused our money. Instead of spending it to build new projects -- the bridge to nowhere, new trophies for congressmen -- we instead said, \u201cFix it first.\u201d We have to reorient how we spend our money. \nYEPSEN: Senator McCain, you have about 30 seconds. \nMCCAIN:: We passed a $50 billion transportation bill that had $2 billion in pork barrel earmarked projects: $233 million for a bridge to nowhere in Alaska, to an island with 50 people on it. Not one dime in those pork barrel projects was for inspection or repair of bridges. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator McCain, you got 10 seconds. \nMCCAIN:: They were for pork barrel projects. I\u2019ll veto every single bill that comes across my desk and make the authors of those pork barrel projects... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And that is the last word. We\u2019re going to go to commercial. We\u2019ll be back in just a couple of minutes. \n(APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And we are back now for the final half hour of the Republican debate here in Iowa. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And we want to start out this half hour with a question that came in over the Internet. His name is Sean Kennedy (ph). He\u2019s from Leesburg, Virginia. And he had a question about Vice President Cheney. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN KENNEDY (ph): During the Bush administration, there\u2019s been a growing controversy over the role of the office of the vice president. As a candidate for president, what authority would you delegate to the office of vice president? And should those authorities be more clearly defined through a constitutional amendment? (END VIDEO CLIP) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator McCain? \nMCCAIN:: Having been considered for that post several times, I\u2019ve thought a lot about that. \n(LAUGHTER) The vice president really only has two duties. One is to cast a tie-breaking vote in the case of a tied vote in the Senate. And the other is to inquire daily as to the health of the president. \n(LAUGHTER) \n(APPLAUSE) I really would do what some presidents have done in the past. A vice president brings a certain area of expertise and talent. I would probably assign some of those areas, like telecommunications or some other important issues. But... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So not as wide-ranging as Vice President Cheney had? \nMCCAIN:: Look, I would be very careful that everybody understood that there\u2019s only one president. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Thompson, you served in the Cabinet with Vice President Cheney. Do you -- and I heard in the implication in Senator McCain\u2019s answer there -- do you think that Vice President Cheney has too much power? \nTHOMPSON: I believe that Vice President Cheney is criticized for a lot of things that he doesn\u2019t do. \n(APPLAUSE) And I believe that Dick Cheney is an honorable individual. And I think the president of the United States depends a great deal upon him. But I would like to also quickly point out, since I\u2019m not going to get a chance, is that I don\u2019t want to leave this audience -- you know, when you said that nobody supports Senator Grassley\u2019s SCHIP program, to have the press -- because I know how the press acts -- that the press will come back, \u201cAll Republicans are against poor children and health care for them.\u201d That is not what we said. \n(LAUGHTER) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That\u2019s not what I said either, but go ahead. \n(LAUGHTER) \nTHOMPSON: We said that what we want to do is we want to change SCHIP on a competitive model, against the Democrats... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But you\u2019re not with Senator Grassley. And I want to move on and stay on this subject. \nTHOMPSON: No, but I really want to make that... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK. I just want to stay on this subject. Mayor Giuliani? \nGIULIANI: I think the vice president of the United States -- that office has to be worked out with the president. And the thing that\u2019s clearest about it, now that we\u2019re at war and we have this Islamic terrorist war against us and we have this aggressive enemy that\u2019s already attacked us here in the United States twice, is that a vice president has to be just as capable, just as ready to take over that office, literally on a moment\u2019s notice. And that should be the major qualification. And then it should be in the discretion of the president and the vice president to decide on what kind of responsibilities they should have. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But would you like to have... \nGIULIANI: I worked in the Reagan administration... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: ... a vice president like Vice President Cheney, with that wide range of responsibility (ph)? \nGIULIANI: I thought -- I mean, worked in the Reagan administration. I thought the division of responsibilities between President Reagan and Vice President was a good one. I thought it was a really comfortable one. I mean, I\u2019m real clear on the fact that George W. Bush is the president of the United States. \nGIULIANI: He\u2019s the only one... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney? \nGIULIANI: ... who makes the decisions. He can use Vice President Cheney the way he sees fit. And I\u2019m comfortable that you select somebody who can step in on a moment\u2019s notice with experience, background, knowing what\u2019s going on. We can\u2019t have a kind of situation like we had in, you know, the 1940s with Harry Truman, where Harry Truman, thank God, turned out to be the kind of president he was, but apparently he didn\u2019t even know about the Manhattan Project. You can\u2019t have that any longer. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney? \nROMNEY: You let the president decide what the responsibilities of the vice president would be in his administration... \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: What would you decide? \nROMNEY: Depends on the person, depends on the needs, depends on their capabilities. But I like a person that gives wide viewpoints on a wide array of issues. But let me tell you, it\u2019s been very popular lately for people across the country to be critical of the president and the vice president. And I know they make mistakes. But they have kept us safe these last six years. Let\u2019s not forget that. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Brownback? \nBROWNBACK: George, I wouldn\u2019t delegate things to the vice president. But I would involve the vice president in a lot of things. But I think there\u2019s a key point here to look at. One is that Dick Cheney came in with a lot of experience. He came in with a lot of experience on defense, foreign policy issues. And I think the president over-relied on that. I think Dick Cheney has done an admirable job. I think the president\u2019s over-relied upon that. I think you need somebody coming into the presidency that\u2019s had foreign policy experience, that\u2019s worked on these national and global issues, so that they don\u2019t have to depend on the vice president as much. I think you should have a highly competent person as vice president that can step in at any time and can provide you high- quality information, reflection, wisdom that\u2019s needed in that job, but not somebody that takes over the job. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Paul? \nPAUL: I certainly wouldn\u2019t support an amendment to change the role of the vice president. But there\u2019s no way to know exactly what goes on, but if you take perceptions from Washington, most people there behind the scenes think the vice president is more powerful than the president. Philosophically, I think this is the case. It\u2019s obvious that he represents a neoconservative viewpoint. And my objection is that that has been the rejection of the Republican Party platform and traditional conservatism. And I think this is where we have gone astray. We have drifted from our fundamental premises and the conservative values that this party used to get. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Hunter, you get the last word on this. \nHUNTER: George, it depends on the credentials of the president. I served in Vietnam -- didn\u2019t do anything special, but I wore the uniform. I\u2019ve been the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for the last four years. And my son has now done two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I can look the American people in the eye and say, \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d So I would not share the role of commander in chief with a vice president. If you\u2019ve got other folks that have less background in national security, they\u2019re going to need to have a vice president that they rely on much more. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I need to move on now, and the issue is taxes, always important in these caucuses and primaries. And the Iowa Republican Party has said the most important economic reform Congress can enact to win the fight against poverty is the fair tax. For our viewers, I want to explain what the fair tax is. It would eliminate the income tax, estate tax, payroll tax and capital gains tax. It would eliminate all those and replace it with a 23 percent sales tax. That\u2019s the fair tax. \n(APPLAUSE) Mr. Yepsen has a question. \nYEPSEN: Governor Huckabee, this issue of tax policy, I see it as a real fault line inside your party -- fair tax, national sales tax, a flat tax, or make adjustments to the existing tax system. \nYEPSEN: Where do you come down on this question? \nHUCKABEE: I absolutely support the fair tax. And part of the reason is, the current system is one that penalizes productivity. A recent poll showed that more Americans fear an audit of the IRS than they do getting mugged. And the reason is, getting mugged isn\u2019t as painless as an audit from the IRS. \n(LAUGHTER) And the reality is, if we could have the fair tax, you take $10 trillion parked offshore, bring it home, you rebuild the \u201cmade in America\u201d brand, you free up people to earn money, to work, you don\u2019t penalize them for taking a second job, you don\u2019t penalize them for investing, you don\u2019t penalize them for savings. Today, our tax system doesn\u2019t need a tap of the hammer, a twist of the screwdriver, it needs a complete overhaul. And what the fair tax does, it ends the underground economy. No more illegals... \nYEPSEN: Governor Romney? \nHUCKABEE: Let me, if I may. No more illegals, no more gamblers, prostitutes, pimps and dope dealers will be able to escape the tax code. \nYEPSEN: Governor Romney? \nHUCKABEE: It\u2019s the single great thing that will help this country (inaudible) revitalized economy. \n(APPLAUSE) \nYEPSEN: Governor Romney, how do you come down on this question? \nROMNEY: It\u2019s good, but it\u2019s not that good. \nHUCKABEE: No, it\u2019s actually better than that, Mitt, it\u2019s even better than that. \n(APPLAUSE) \nROMNEY: There are a lot of features that are very attractive about a fair tax. Getting rid of the IRS is something we\u2019d all love. But the truth is, we\u2019re going to have to pay taxes. We are the largest economy in the world. We\u2019ve added -- during the time Europe added 3 million jobs, we\u2019ve added about 50 million jobs in this country. And so completely throwing out our tax system and coming up with an entirely new one is something we have to do very, very carefully. The president\u2019s commission on taxation -- tax reform -- looked at this and said: Not a good idea. Some of the reasons... \nHUCKABEE: They didn\u2019t look at that... \n(CROSSTALK) \nROMNEY: Let me -- hold on, let me complete. Some of the reasons are the fair tax, for instance, charges a 23 percent tax, plus state sales tax, on a new home, when you purchase a new home. But if you buy an old home, there\u2019s no tax. Think what that might do to the construction industry. We need to thoroughly take it apart before we make a change of that nature. That\u2019s why my view is, get rid of the tax on savings and let middle-income people save their money tax-free. \nYEPSEN: Mayor Giuliani, which one of the three options would you... \n(APPLAUSE) A national sales tax... \nGIULIANI: Eliminate the death tax. \nROMNEY (?): Of course. Of course. \nGIULIANI: And that should be eliminated immediately. It makes no sense at all. In 2010, the death tax is going to go to zero percent. And then it\u2019s going to go to 55 percent in 2011. You do not want to be on a respirator in 2010. \n(LAUGHTER) \n(CROSSTALK) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Huckabee and then... \nGIULIANI: And then I would say the most -- the most sensible thing to do is to simplify the tax code, reduce taxes, keep taxes low. I don\u2019t think -- I think the flat tax and the fair tax are both very intriguing. And if we were starting off at the very beginning with taxation, the first argument I would make is let\u2019s not have any taxes. The second argument I would make is the fair tax or the flat tax would probably be a better way to go. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But you\u2019re not for the fair tax now, correct? \nGIULIANI: It would be too complex to get there. And somebody would have to show me how we\u2019re going to make that transition. And, also, the thought that there wouldn\u2019t be an IRS with the fair tax -- well, who is going to administer the sales tax? And who\u2019s going to administer the people that are exempt from the sales tax? And who is going to administer what items might be exempt from the sales -- maybe food would be exempt from the sales tax. \n(APPLAUSE) \nYEPSEN: Senator McCain, how do you come down on this question? \nMCCAIN:: I believe that we\u2019ve got to simplify the tax code. But one of the first areas we\u2019ve got to go after is the alternate minimum tax, which is going to eat in to 20 million American families if we don\u2019t eliminate it, and very quickly. Look, when we found out that Congress could not close a single military base when we had a huge number of them, we appointed -- we passed a law where we appointed a commission and they said we would close so many based and Congress votes up or no -- up or down. I would find Alan Greenspan. I\u2019d say, \u201cGive us your recommendations.\u201d We\u2019ll pass a law. And we will vote on Alan Greenspan and his commission\u2019s recommendations, yes or no, up or down. That\u2019s the way you\u2019re going to simplify the tax code, which now requires $140 billion of American families\u2019 income to prepare their tax returns. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Tancredo? \nTANCREDO: The reason why we absolutely need to go to something like a fair tax -- and I am a co-sponsor. And by the way, if you don\u2019t understand how it would work, I would suggest to you that you read Neil Boortz\u2019s book and John Linder\u2019s. It\u2019s a perfect explanation of how it works. \nGIULIANI (?): (inaudible) read it -- underlined it. \nTANCREDO: Here\u2019s -- well, then you should know how it works. \nGIULIANI (?): We just disagree about it. \n(LAUGHTER) \nTANCREDO: The fact is that -- but the most important reason, the most important reason to move from an income tax to something like a fair tax -- to specifically a fair tax, is because an income tax is designed to manipulate behavior. BROWNBACK (?): George? \nTANCREDO: It gives the government the power to manipulate your behavior. \u201cI reward you for the things I want you to do by giving you a tax cut. I penalize you for the things I don\u2019t want you to do by raising your taxes.\u201d That is too much power for the federal government. It is always going to be an overreach of power. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I\u2019ve got to move on. Senator Brownback, you get 30 seconds on this, and then we move on. \nBROWNBACK: I think we need to move toward an optional flat tax. I think we need to go to flat taxes. \n(APPLAUSE) And let me just say why here. We\u2019ve got a problem with the current tax code and we\u2019ve tried to take it out. And every time you try to take it out, everybody comes to defend it that has something in it. You can put an optional flat tax in the tax code and let people choose. And it will create economic growth. That\u2019s why 16 countries have already gone to a flat tax: It creates growth. Growth is the key for us in this economy for us to get things moving forward. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK, but you\u2019re against the fair tax. I want to -- I\u2019ve got to move on now. Sorry, Governor, I\u2019ve got to move on right now. We\u2019ve got an e-mail question coming in. I\u2019m going to ask every one of you to come in on this for 30 seconds. It comes from Adam Waldren (ph) from Pocatello, Idaho, and it starts like this: \u201cI have made several mistakes that have been defining moments in my life because of what I learned or was forced to realize. What is the defining mistake of your life and why?\u201d \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Hunter? \nHUNTER: Because of what I learned and was forced to realize. Think of a major mistake. Contemplating running as a Democrat in my very first... \n(LAUGHTER) \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Paul? \nPAUL: The only mistake I made and continue to make is I don\u2019t speak forcefully enough for the cause of liberty and the cause of the Constitution. I\u2019m working on it all the time. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Huckabee? \nHUCKABEE: I think probably the greatest mistake I made was not taking good care of my own personal health for the first half of my life. And that\u2019s been one of the most transformational things I\u2019ve done, and I just wish I\u2019d started much earlier. \nROMNEY: Probably from a political standpoint and a personal standpoint, the greatest mistake was when I first ran for office, being deeply opposed to abortion but saying, \u201cI support the current law,\u201d which was pro-choice and effectively a pro-choice position. That was just wrong. And when I became a governor and faced a life-and-death decision as a governor, I came down on the side of life. That was a mistake before that. \nGIULIANI: To have a description of my mistakes in 30 seconds? \n(LAUGHTER) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Defining mistake, Mayor. Just one defining mistake. \nGIULIANI: Your father is a priest. I\u2019m going to explain it to your father, not to you, OK? \n(LAUGHTER) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK. I guess that\u2019s a pass. Senator McCain? \nMCCAIN:: You want my list? It\u2019s right here. \n(LAUGHTER) I would imagine that in 1967, in the USS Forrestal, where we\u2019d just had a horrendous fire and the ship was headed back to the United States, and a guy came onboard and said, \u201cWe need people to go over to another aircraft carrier and stay in combat,\u201d that was a very defining moment. \nMCCAIN:: I thought about that a lot in the intervening five and a half years in prison. The other mistake was when I went to a meeting among some regulators concerning a guy who was a supporter of mine. It was a mistake and one I never should have made. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Brownback? \nBROWNBACK: Probably not telling my wife and kids and parents I love them enough and just being more focused, too many times, on me instead of on them and on others is probably the biggest mistake I\u2019ve made. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Thompson? \nTHOMPSON: My mother-in-law died of breast cancer, my mother. My wife has breast cancer. My young daughter has breast cancer. I don\u2019t think I was supportive enough, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m vowing right now to end breast cancer by the year 2015 for all the women in America. \n(APPLAUSE) \nTANCREDO: I have no doubt of what the greatest mistake in my life has been. And that is that it took me probably 30 years before I realized that Jesus Christ is my personal savior. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Tancredo, thank you all very much. We have one more... \n(APPLAUSE) We have one more round. I also want to bring all of you in on this for about 30 seconds each. And I\u2019m going to introduce it by showing everyone something that President Bush said at the Iowa straw poll eight years ago. It was his fundamental promise as president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BUSH: I know this: Should I be fortunate enough to become the president of the United States, that when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, I will swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God. (END VIDEO CLIP) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Tancredo, that was the core promise of President Bush\u2019s campaign, to restore honor and dignity to the Oval Office. What will you restore to the Oval Office? \nTANCREDO: Hope -- hope in America itself, remembering that we have made a number of mistakes that have turned our friends against us, have encouraged our enemies. I believe that -- with all my heart, that it is going to take a leader committed to the ideas of Western civilization, to the rhetorical -- to speaking out about the values of Western civilization. We can no longer afford political correctness. We have to tell people that there is something good -- not just good, but great -- about who we are. That will restore America\u2019s faith in itself and the world\u2019s faith in America. \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Thompson? \nTHOMPSON: I would open up the East Wing. I would open it up to bring in the best minds -- Democrats, Republicans, independents across America -- that want to get something done with this great country. Instead of tearing it down, start building, pro-America, and make sure that we\u2019re not so politically correct that we are sacrificing our values in America in this jihadist war. And by bringing in the best minds, the best people, we can change the direction and really start building America a stronger and healthier and better tomorrow than ever before. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Brownback, what would you restore to the Oval Office? \nBROWNBACK: Rebuilding the family. You know, in Washington, D.C., right now, 63 percent of the children are born out of wedlock. Nationwide, the number is 36 percent. You can raise a good child in that setting, but it gets more difficult. The best place is between a mom and a dad bonded together for life. I would stand for life. And I would appoint the next justice I hope would be the voting decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator McCain? \nMCCAIN:: I love my country. I\u2019ve had the great honor for more than 50 years of serving it in the military, in Congress, the United States Senate. And I am fully prepared -- fully prepared, more than anyone else running on either side -- to fight the transcendent challenge of this nation, which will be for all of the 21st century. And that is the struggle against radical Islamic extremism. \nMCCAIN:: We must win. We will win. And we will never surrender; they will. \n(APPLAUSE) \nGIULIANI: I would do the same thing that I did as mayor of New York City, and that is, I would restore hope, but for the people of the entire country: hope that this country can do great things, grand things, that we can build our future on optimism, not this kind of defeatism that I hear from the Democratic candidates. And in deference to the senator, I think the senator is a great man and very well-qualified. But the fact is, I look at the three leading Democratic candidates. They haven\u2019t held an executive office in their lives. They haven\u2019t run a city, a state, a business. I think maybe they\u2019ve run a club somewhere. But the reality is, you\u2019ve got to have some kind of experience for this job. You have to be able to show that you can accomplish things and you can get things done. And I\u2019ve done that, and I would do that for this country. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney? \nROMNEY: I\u2019ve thought a lot about this question. And I take my inspiration from my dad, from Ronald Reagan, Teddy Roosevelt, the Declaration of Independence. My view is that America is going to be strengthened by virtue of the presidency, if I\u2019m able to have that opportunity. I would strengthen America\u2019s military, make sure that we could be safe here at home. We know that we can be safe around the world. I want to have more troops in our military. I want to have them have the equipment they need on the battlefield and the care they deserve when they come home. I want to strengthen our economy, keep our taxes down, become free of oil from foreign places, strengthen our economy so we have great jobs and a great future for our people. And finally, I want to strengthen the American family. In my view, families, a strong economy and a strong military -- that combination of features is what makes this party so strong and accounts for our great success in the elections over the prior several decades and also is so critical to our future as a nation -- a strong economy, a strong military, and strong families. And I\u2019ll fight for those things. \n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Huckabee? \nHUCKABEE: I would put the very same frame on my wall in the White House I did as governor for 10 and a half years. It\u2019s a frame that has a photo, and underneath the photo it says, \u201cOur boss.\u201d My picture was never in that frame in 10 and a half years. Every week or so, we\u2019d put the picture of some ordinary Arkansas citizen. And I told our staff, let\u2019s never forget who the real boss is. I hope every day I\u2019d never forget I work for those people; they don\u2019t work for me. I\u2019d like to be the kind of president that\u2019s more concerned about the people on Main Street, not just the folks on Wall Street. And we need that kind of Republican running, that kind of Republican winning.\n I\u2019d never forget who the boss really, really is.\n(APPLAUSE) \nSTEPHANOPOLOUS: Congressman Paul? \nPAUL: I would restore openness to government. I do not think in this country we should have secrecy of government. The purpose of government is to provide privacy for the people. I would never use executive privilege to deny information to the Congress, with the full realization that you protect security information, but in the very general sense, we should be very, very open. We want a transparent government. And currently I believe we could improve on that matter. \n(APPLAUSE)\n STEPHANAPOULOS: Congressman Hunter, last word.\nHUNTER: I think restoring what I call economic patriotism. You know, in World War I, World War II and the Cold War, we rode to victory on the arsenal of democracy. That\u2019s our great industrial base, our ability to make things in this country, this magnificent manufacturing capability, which right now we\u2019re pushing offshore, pushing to China, pushing to India, pushing to Japan.\n I would stop China from cheating on trade. I would level the playing field. I would bring back that arsenal of democracy that we need, not only for high-paying jobs in this country but also to defend the country.\n And lastly, when my kid came back from Iraq, he wrote a great letter. And the last part of that letter said, \u201cFamilies lift this country up. They provide us with fidelity, morality, faith in God, and raising the next generation of Americans.\u201d \n Our work: to make sure that we elevate the American family and make a life of opportunity for that next generation of Americans.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you.\n Thank you all. It was a great debate. \n Thanks everyone who was watching back at home.",
