But for the jewelers in the Jackson Heights gold district, spring began several weeks ago.\nIt is wedding season in this Queens neighborhood, and the brides are back.\nOn weekend afternoons, the streets are filled with brides by the dozen: young women amid a flock of relatives, all methodically perusing the windows of the jewelry shops in preparation for what many say is the most important purchase of their lives.\nThere is much to choose from: huge filigreed necklaces wide enough to cover a woman's chest and shoulders, not to mention tiaras, anklets, armlets and bangles, along with rings for fingers, toes, noses, and ears -- all wrought in gleaming yellow 22-karat gold.\nGold jewelry plays a crucial role in a traditional South Asian wedding ceremony, and for South Asian families throughout North America, Jackson Heights is the place to come for gold.\nFor more than 15 years, the intersection of 74th Street and 37th Road has been the heart of South Asian Queens, so much so that local residents call it the Indian mall. And among stores that offer the latest Bollywood spectaculars on DVD and sweet shops selling stacks of syrupy, spiral-shaped jalebis, the most eye-catching places are the gold jewelry shops.\nA decade ago, there were only a handful, but today dozens of gold jewelry shops are clustered within a two-block radius of this intersection. It is as if the 47th Street diamond district had been transported to Jackson Heights and reborn with a South Asian accent.\nBecause late winter is the high season for South Asian weddings -- the weather in the subcontinent is good during that period -- Jackson Heights has been flooded with shoppers on a quest for the specialized jewelry ensemble required in traditional Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani wedding ceremonies.\nCustomers include not only South Asian immigrants from New York but wedding parties from around the country, who typically make a special stop before flying to ancestral homes in the subcontinent for the actual ceremony.\nSince Jackson Heights jewelers work with suppliers all over Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Britain, customers often find a greater selection of styles in Queens than they do even in large South Asian cities.\nAnd because selecting wedding jewelry is usually a family affair, on weekends during February and March, Jackson Heights is full of extended family groups.\nBy tradition, the jewelry must be 22 karats, a purer form of gold than is commonly sold in American stores.\n''This is because the bride's jewelry is a part of the dowry,'' said Arvind Bhai Maganlal, who along with his wife, Asmita Ben, has owned Mita Jewelers on 74th Street since 1990. ''The groom's family, they have to know what they are getting. The bride's family will say to them, my daughter will bring into your home this much jewelry, this much cash. And because the wedding jewelry is 22 karat, they know exactly what they are getting.''\nIn fact, it is common for the groom's family to have a prospective bride's jewelry weighed and assessed, to make sure the gold is the proper quality.\n''Our women can always tell if the gold is pure,'' said Ehsan Chowdhury, a Bangladeshi immigrant from Jackson Heights who was helping his wife choose jewelry for a sister's wedding. ''I don't know how they know it, but they always know. For our women, it must be 22 karat.''\nIn Bangladeshi culture, the dowry system is intended to protect both parties in a marriage. The groom's family receives a sum of money up front, and the bride keeps possession of her wedding jewelry, which she can sell if the marriage fails or if her husband cannot support her.\n''Jewelry is a kind of insurance for a woman,'' Mr. Chowdhury said. ''Say the man says to his wife: 'O.K., I don't want you anymore. We will get a divorce.' The woman has her insurance, her jewelry, and so she is protected. She can sell it, and maybe she can open a business for herself. You have your insurance companies in America, and this is our system.''\nThe basic items are the rani haar, also known as queen jewelry, which is a set of earrings sold with a large matching necklace. The rani haar set typically costs $3,000 to $5,000.\n''This is the basic thing,'' said Fatima Begum, a saleswoman at Silk-n-Gold, which sells up to two dozen sets on a busy week. ''The bride will get this set, and then, if there is more money, she will choose more jewelry.''\nA more elaborate ensemble might include anklets and bracelets; a panja, which covers the back of the hand and held in place by an attached bracelet and rings; a nathni, or nose ring, and a tiara. Brides also commonly wear a tikka, a piece of gold jewelry that hangs over the forehead and is hooked into the parting of the hair. Aditi, the lushly adorned bride in the film ''Monsoon Wedding,'' wore a gold tikka with a ruby hanging between her eyes.\nBut as South Asian communities in New York and elsewhere in America have become more established, tastes in weddings and, by extension, wedding jewelry, have been changing. Many young couples choose to celebrate their weddings here, rather than return to their parents' homelands. And a wedding in the United States means that gold jewelry plays a less crucial role in the marriage transaction.\n''In the olden times, women wore necklaces of 300, 400 grams, very heavy,'' said Mr. Maganlal of Mita Jewelers. ''But these modern girls go for something smaller.'' He shook his head slightly in disapproval. A trend toward lighter, finer earrings and necklaces is hardly good news for a man in the gold business.\n''Sometimes you even see the bride's family come to choose the jewelry together with the mother-in-law,'' Mr. Maganlal said. ''This is not the old tradition.''\nAs if to prove his point, Mahin Hossain, who moved to the west Bronx from Bangladesh 18 months ago, showed up at his shop one day with her niece, Rifat Ahamed, and a half-dozen other relatives to buy jewelry for a forthcoming family wedding. They were the family of the groom, Mahin Hossain's nephew; the bride would arrive from Michigan the day before the wedding.\nHAVING been married the previous summer, Ms. Ahamed, 17, was an old hand at choosing wedding jewelry. ''It takes the whole entire day,'' she said. ''First you have to look at every shop, and then they bargain.''\nAfter leaving Mita Jewelers, the little parade of relatives led by the bride's prospective mother-in-law window-shopped their way along 74th Street. At Alankar Jewelers, they spent 10 minutes examining a large rani haar set before moving on to Silk-n-Gold, two doors down.\n''The mother-in-law decided she doesn't like it,'' Mrs. Hossain said. ''She wants something more gorgeous for her new daughter-in-law.''\nFor her own wedding, Ms. Ahamed and her mother had settled on something a little more modern than the traditional rani haar.\n''I wore a choker,'' she said. ''All the gold jewelry is so heavy and hard to wear, plus you're wearing a sari. It gets hard to move, with everything.'' Ms. Ahamed performed a little mime that suggested a shy bride, moving stiffly, head bent, as if weighed down by unfamiliar clothes and heavy jewelry. ''And on top of that, you just keep thinking, I'm getting married!''"}, {"text": "Sports of The Times; West Ham United: One Team That Courts Its Neighbors\n2003-02-04T05:00:00.000Z\nJust outside the Upton Park tube station, the Islamabad Halal Butchers are next door to Duncan's Pie, Mash & Eels -- the present and the past, side by side.\nBobby Moore grew up in the East End of London and went on to play for West Ham United, the local team, and also the fabled 1966 World Cup champions. Most of the children in the area now have roots in Pakistan or Bangladesh.\nEvery time the Hammers play at home, white men of a certain age return to the old neighborhood, perhaps stopping off in one of the remaining pubs, almost all wearing the claret and blue colors of West Ham.\nThere are few dark faces in West Ham's Upton Park stadium, and there are no South Asian soccer players whatsoever in the English Premier League. But West Ham, to its credit, is trying to take the mystery and perhaps even the menace out of English soccer.\nThe club is called the Academy of Football -- it says so right over the front door -- because its youth programs produced Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters of the 1966 World Cup champions. In its own way, West Ham is the academy once again.\nMany professional teams around the world pay lip service to including the young, the disadvantaged, the minorities, the people who cannot pay the grotesque ticket prices. But West Ham's program seems a bit more than that.\n''Our role is not to bring Asian people to the turnstiles,'' Mick King, who runs the project, said. ''They already sell out every game. Our job is to teach people to play football.''\nThe children of immigrants are invited to the only public field in the working-class neighborhood, encouraged to break the stereotype that ''Asians can't play football.''\nWest Ham was on the front page recently. Struggling to avoid being relegated to the First Division, the club signed Lee Bowyer, an aggressive midfielder who grew up in the neighborhood.\nBut Bowyer came with a dossier of hostility to people of Pakistani and Bengali ancestry, who are known as Asians in England. In 1996 he was found guilty of directing a racial epithet toward an Asian fast-food vendor. Three years ago, while playing for Leeds United, Bowyer was charged with beating a man of Asian background. Bowyer was acquitted, but a teammate was convicted, and Bowyer still faces a civil case.\nSome people protested the signing, but the issue has quieted down.\n''Lee Bowyer will come and go,'' King said. ''Our program is light-years away from the Porsche-driving players.''\nKing, 45, is a licensed community and youth worker who works with the newer Britons.\n''They came here rather than drown in flooded fields,'' King said, adding that South Asians' ''aspirations are much higher'' than some of the old residents'.\n''Football mirrors life,'' King said. ''Once people have something, they try to protect it. They don't mean to be racist. White working-class people love their football.''\nWest Ham is the last of the major clubs in England to be run by the founders, in this case, shipbuilding families. (The stadium club is called the Thames Iron Works Bar, and the club symbol is a pair of crossed shipbuilders' hammers.)\nAt the very least, the West Ham management encourages its new neighbors to have a look around. One recent morning, a sixth-grade class from Monega Primary School visited the West Ham locker room. King chose Ishmael and Mumima as captains of two groups, and a few Muslim girls removed their scarves and put on sneakers and track suits.\n''We have a girls' team at school, and some of them are quite good,'' said Caroline Peck, a teacher, who said there were no religious objections ''as long as it is within the confines of education.''\nThen the two squads worked out for an hour on the sidelines of the West Ham field, which was neatly manicured even in a dank English winter.\nKing displayed ball-control drills, making the point that soccer, like life, works best when you find your own space. His colleague Christian Lattanzio, 31, who once played in Italian youth programs, demonstrated exercises. (One class heard that Lattanzio likes poetry, and spent an afternoon reading poems to him rather than kicking the ball.)\nAfter the workout, the club visited the West Ham museum, which includes a diorama of a broadcaster describing that immortal day in 1966 when the score will forever be England 4, West Germany 2.\nLater, there was a session about nutrition and exercise, with the children working in small coed groups. At lunch there was a film about West Ham's history, followed by another video, called ''Show Racism the Red Card,'' featuring famous English soccer players.\nRio Ferdinand said he went to school with Stephen Lawrence, who was killed in a racial attack a decade ago and whose killers have never been convicted. Ian Wright talked about the evolution of Malcolm X. Kevin Keegan talked about the need for equal opportunity.\n''Their parents face racism every day,'' Chander Pajput, another teacher, said. ''As far as they're concerned, they're second-class citizens.''\nPajput, of Indian heritage, said he had gone to a game in London more than 20 years ago ''with some white friends of mine, and I was horrified at the things people said.''\n''To tell you the truth, I never went back,'' he said.\nThe children were asked to give examples of stereotypes. A girl said, ''Only men can fix cars.'' A boy said, ''Only women can cook.''\nA few weeks earlier, King said, ''one kid, around 11 years old, said he was affected by West Ham's bringing in Lee Bowyer, and I said he was entitled to his opinion.''\nThe West Ham project is not designed to find the next Bobby Moore or even the next Lee Bowyer. It will settle for producing some players and some fans -- and maybe more teachers like Iftekhar Ahmed, who works on King's staff.\nAhmed moved to England from Bangladesh as an infant, and played in youth leagues with Bowyer.\n''He wasn't really that good,'' Ahmed said. ''One day we saw him playing on television and we were surprised.\n''As a player, he has qualities. I do not object to West Ham acquiring him because I am a West Ham fan. But as a human being, I don't appreciate him. He's had racial incidents. There's a lot of concern in the community.''\nAhmed said he was held back as a youth because ''we lacked parental approval.''\n''It's not religious or cultural on our part,'' he added. ''People just didn't accept Asians.''\nHe said Asians were turned off a few years back when the right-wing National Front was ''recruiting people outside the stadiums.''\n''People are still narrow-minded,'' Ahmed said. ''You hear, 'Asians only play cricket.' That's just nonsense. During the World Cup, Bengali people go crazy about football. Our job is to work it through. In five years, you'll see Asian people playing.''\nWest Ham fans learned to love Clyde Best of Bermuda, their first black star, back in the 60's. The fans are not angels; a Bowyer Innocent T-shirt finds buyers outside the stadium. But if and when West Ham finds its first South Asian player, the old fans will still trek in from the distant suburbs to wear the claret and blue."}, {"text": "Baked Alaska on The Menu?\n2003-09-13T05:00:00.000Z\nSkeptics of global warming should come to this Eskimo village on the Arctic Ocean, roughly 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle. It's hard to be complacent about climate change when you're in an area that normally is home to animals like polar bears and wolverines, but is now attracting robins.\nA robin even built its nest in town this year (there is no word in the local Inupiat Eskimo language for robins). And last year a (presumably shivering) porcupine arrived.\nThe Okpilak River valley was historically too cold and dry for willows, and in the Inupiat language ''Okpilak'' means ''river with no willows.'' Yet a warmer, wetter climate means that now it's crowded with willows.\nThe warming ocean is also bringing salmon, three kinds now, to waters here. The Eskimos say there were almost no salmon a generation ago.\n''The weather is different, really different,'' said 92-year-old Nora Agiak, speaking in the Inupiat language and wearing moose-skin moccasins and a jacket with wolverine fur. ''We're not getting as many icebergs as we used to. Maybe the world moved because it's getting warmer.''\nIn the past, I've been skeptical about costly steps (like those in the Kyoto accord) to confront climate change. But I'm changing my mind. The evidence, while still somewhat incomplete, is steadily mounting that our carbon emissions are causing an accelerating global warming that amounts to a major threat to the world in which we live.\nAlaska has warmed by eight degrees, on average, in the winter, over the last three decades, according to meteorological records. The U.S. Arctic Research Commission says that today's Arctic temperatures are the highest in the last 400 years, and perhaps much longer.\nThe U.S. Navy reports that in areas traversed by its submarines, Arctic ice volume decreased 42 percent over the last 35 years, and the average thickness of ice below water declined 4.3 feet. The Office of Naval Research warns that ''one plausible outcome'' is that the summer Arctic ice cap will disappear completely by 2050.\n''We've got climate change,'' Robert Thompson, a native guide, says flatly. He notes that pack ice, which always used to hover offshore, providing a home for polar bears, now sometimes retreats hundreds of miles north of Kaktovik. That has caused some bears to drown and leaves others stranded on land.\n(After a polar bear was spotted outside Kaktovik's post office one snowy morning, the locals explained what to do if you bump into a famished polar bear: Yell and throw stones, and above all, don't run!)\nFor hundreds of years, the Eskimos here used ice cellars in the permafrost. But now the permafrost is melting, and these ice cellars are filling with water and becoming useless.\nKaktovik's airstrip, 50 years old, has begun to flood because of higher seas, so it may be moved upland. Another native village, Shishmaref, has voted to abandon its location entirely because of rising seas.\nIn the hamlet of Deadhorse, I ran into an Arctic native named Jackson Snyder, who said that winters were getting ''a lot warmer -- doesn't get much below 50 below anymore.''\nThat may not seem so bad. But while there will be benefits to a warmer Alaska (a longer growing season, ice-free ports), climate change can also lead to crop failures, spread tropical diseases and turn Bangladesh into tidal pools. The pace of warming may be far too fast for animals, humans or ecosystems to adjust. My advice is that if you're planning a dream home in New Orleans or on the Chesapeake, put it on stilts.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, reflecting a consensus of scientists, concluded that human activity had probably caused most global warming in recent decades. It predicted that in this century, the seas will rise 4 to 35 inches.\nSome 14,000 years ago, a warming trend apparently raised the sea level by 70 feet in just a few hundred years. Today's computer models don't foresee a repeat of that, but they also can't explain why it happened then.\nThat's why I'm changing my mind about the need for major steps to address carbon emissions. Global warming is still an uncertain threat, but it may well become one of the major challenges of this century. Certainly our government should do more about it than censor discussions of climate change in E.P.A. reports.\nUnless we act soon, we may find waves lapping the beaches of Ohio."}, {"text": "Suddenly, a Seller's Market for Arabic Studies\n2003-03-19T05:00:00.000Z\nProf. Muhammad S. Eissa has never been busier.\nEach weekday he teaches Arabic to students at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and because the demand for experienced Arabic instructors has overwhelmed the supply nationwide, his lectures are videotaped for replay in classrooms at a college and a university in Utah.\nIn his free time, Dr. Eissa, an Egyptian-born Muslim, has also been lecturing church groups and Rotary Clubs that are suddenly eager for information about Islam.\nAs the pursuit of Al Qaeda and America's confrontation with Iraq intensifies, Arabic-speaking educators and Islamic organizations, as well as universities and schools across the nation, are straining to respond to requests by students and the public for information and instruction about the language and culture of Islam.\n''It's just snowballed,'' said Karin Ryding, who heads Georgetown University's Arabic languages department, which offered five beginning Arabic classes last semester, instead of the usual two. Other universities reported similar increases or new courses because of the demand.\nHistorically, most Americans have been only dimly aware of Islam and its liturgical language, Arabic, but this is not the first time that national interest has built to a fever. The 1979 hostage crisis in Iran led to a burst of study of the Muslim world, and the federal government made more money available to train teachers of Mideastern languages and for study abroad. By the mid-1980's, however, government and public interest had waned, only to increase again, for a while, at the time of the Persian Gulf war.\nBut now some of Dr. Eissa's students are digging in for the long term, betting that an intellectual investment in Arabic will pay off in their careers.\n''If we go into Iraq, we're going to need to be over there for a long time to build it back,'' said Lars Longnecker, a third-year law student who decided in December to study Arabic. ''So I see our involvement in the Mideast increasing, and I figured Arabic would give me a leg up in that area.''\nStudents across the country appear to agree. Kirk Belnap, a professor of Arabic and the director of a federally financed consortium, the National Middle East Language Resource Center at Brigham Young University, said many universities were reporting ''double or triple enrollments'' in Arabic classes.\n''There's been an explosion in interest,'' said John C. Eisele, executive director of the American Association of Teachers of Arabic. The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., where Dr. Eisele teaches, offered two beginning Arabic classes last fall, but had to turn away 20 students. Because the demand is similar nationwide, many colleges and universities, as well as half a dozen federal agencies, are seeking to hire people fluent in Arabic. ''There's a ton of jobs out there,'' Dr. Eisele said.\nIt is not only college campuses that have experienced the surge in interest. In Alabama, so many middle school and high school students asked about Islam that nearly 200 Alabama teachers signed up last summer for a course, Understanding Islam, taught by Dr. Angelia Mance, associate director of the National Council on Geographic Education.\n''It was the most popular course I've given,'' said Dr. Mance, who taught it in classrooms packed with teachers in the Alabama towns of Florence, Jasper and Hamilton. One of her students was Gail Spann, a public school librarian whose son, Johnny Michael Spann, an officer in the Central Intelligence Agency, was killed in Afghanistan in November 2001, Dr. Mance said.\n''War is God's way of teaching world geography to Americans,'' Dr. Mance said, quoting Ambrose Bierce, the 19th-century satirist.\nThe Islamic Networks Group, formed in the mid-1990's by California Muslims who believed their religion was being misrepresented in the public schools, has in recent months expanded its network of speakers bureaus to 25 cities from 18, said Maha ElGenaidi, the group's co-founder, who grew up in Ohio and Pennsylvania.\nThe speakers originally lectured about Islam mostly in public schools, she said, but in recent months, the group has been flooded with invitations to explain the religion to police departments, groups for the elderly, community centers and Rotary Clubs.\nBut if some Americans are suddenly eager to learn about Islam, there is much ignorance to overcome.\nEven many university students ''lack a rudimentary knowledge of the nature of the Islamic faith,'' according to a study published in the September issue of the Journal of Instructional Psychology. After hearing statements betraying ignorance of Islam, its authors, Thomas Mastrilli and Deborah Sardo-Brown, professors at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, circulated a questionnaire among 218 students about to become teachers in public schools.\nAbout half the students could not identify the Koran as the Islamic holy book or Mecca as the holiest Islamic city (one in seven guessed Jerusalem), their report said. Not one of the students surveyed could name the world's three most populous Muslim countries: Pakistan, Indonesia and Bangladesh. The two professors called for more education about Islam to foster religious tolerance.\nIn contrast, a study released this month warned against too much tolerance of Islam. It was written by Gilbert Sewell, a former education editor at Newsweek who heads the American Textbook Council, a New York group opposed to multicultural teaching. Mr. Sewell examined seven widely used middle school and high school world history textbooks and concluded that publishers made ''an effort to circumvent unsavory facts that might cast Islam in anything but a positive light.'' For instance, textbooks have ''defanged'' the term jihad, Mr. Sewell contended, defining it as Muslims' struggle for spiritual improvement rather than more narrowly as holy war.\nBut several textbook publishers criticized Mr. Sewell's objectivity.\n''A lot of his language is just slanted against the religion of Islam,'' said Collin Earnst, a spokesman for Houghton Mifflin.\nBernard Lewis, a Princeton Mideast scholar cited extensively by Mr. Sewell, declined through his assistant to comment on the report. Rashid Khalidi, a professor of history and Near Eastern languages at the University of Chicago, called Mr. Sewell's study ''a terribly biased document full of bigoted statements.''\nMr. Sewell and his critics agree on the importance of increasing Americans' familiarity with Islamic civilization -- the challenge to which Dr. Eissa has devoted his professional life since he began teaching Arabic at American universities in 1978.\n''American interest in Islamic affairs comes in waves and then it ebbs,'' Dr. Eissa said, just before video cameras focused on him as he began conjugating Arabic verbs at the start of another class here. ''But this current tide of fascination seems more intense and wider in perspective.''"}, {"text": "URBAN TACTICS; In Chelsea, A Little Dal Spells Home\n2003-02-16T05:00:00.000Z\nBY day, the 29th Street Deli is as generic as they come, a tiny convenience store tucked between a parking lot and a shop selling imported silk saris on a barren stretch of 29th Street known as Norman Vincent Peale Way. There's a stand of shiny produce near the front door and a selection of frozen desserts near the cash register, but nothing that would merit a second glance.\nBy night, the deli is utterly transformed. The modest store becomes a pulsing, chattering, free-flowing all-night party, a makeshift restaurant and social club for a group of New York workers long underserved by both restaurants and social clubs: Bangladeshi taxi drivers.\n''They say that 40 percent of the cabbies in New York are from Bangladesh,'' said Ahmed Gulam, a garrulous regular who has been driving a taxi in New York since 1996. ''And now we have a place to go where there is always community, always a party.''\nNew York cabbies working the night shift have always needed a place to eat. But as the population of drivers has become heavily immigrant, and heavily South Asian, the task of feeding them has taken a new turn. A spokesman for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission estimates that 70 percent of the city's 100,000 cabbies are from the Indian subcontinent.\nEven small New York restaurants are generally too expensive for many drivers, and so the city has become home to many makeshift, almost underground establishments where cabbies from a particular country or even a particular region can congregate, chat with friends in their own language and eat their own regional cuisine.\nThe transformation of the 29th Street Deli, just west of Fifth Avenue, started in 1999, when a Bangladeshi woman named Muksuda Kahatun emigrated to New York to join her cab-driving husband, Daud Kahatun. He was proud of his wife's cooking, and he understood how hard it was for taxi drivers on the night shift to find good, affordable food to tide them over till morning.\n''He knew she was such a good cook,'' Mr. Gulam said of Mr. Kahatun, with the air of someone retelling a favorite legend. ''And so one day he asked her, 'Why don't you try to sell your food to the cabbies?'''\nLast year, through a special arrangement with the owner of the 29th Street Deli, Mrs. Kahatun began doing just that. Each day, at her home in Corona, Queens, she prepares a variety of Bangladeshi foods and packs them carefully into foil containers. In the evening, she brings the food to the deli and lays it out on a few feet of counter space near the cash register.\nThe selection changes nightly. On a recent Saturday, it included rice with dark lentil dal, bright yellow curry with vegetables, a spicy chicken stew, vegetable rolls (small cylinders of pastry filled with corn, beans and spiced eggplant) and a variety of snacks and sweets.\nSeveral customers sat at a folding table in front of the counter, intently scooping up morsels of curry and rice from their plates with their fingers. A dozen others were arranged about the deli in small groups, their folding chairs pushed up against racks of laundry detergent and shrink-wrapped breakfast pastries, chatting avidly in Bengali.\nWord of Mrs. Kahatun's home cooking spread quickly.\n''She has been here only one year,'' Mr. Gulam said, ''and so at first maybe only two or three people come to eat each night. But then we all start calling our friends, and telling them to come here, take a break, have some good-tasting food.''\nMrs. Kahatun serves 150 to 200 cabbies each night, and has become a sort of den mother to the Bangladeshi cabbies working the night shift, many of whom are young and unmarried. She moves among them briskly, a slight figure in a silver-gray salwar kameez with a matching shawl over her long hair.\n''I'm a single man, so when I stay home, I feel boring,'' said Mr. Gulam, explaining why he came almost every night. ''Here, there are always friends. You know everyone, you eat, you laugh, and you tell stories. When you are a cabby, often there is no time to eat until very late. You come here late, you will see all the hard-working people.''\nThe place is busiest around 2 a.m., when cabbies change shifts, and continues most nights until 3 a.m. On weekends, Mrs. Kahatun often serves until nearly dawn.\nOn this evening, it was 3 a.m. when Mr. Gulam arrived. A few minutes later, he hailed a group of new arrivals. ''That man with the glasses, he's the joker,'' Mr. Gulam said. ''And this man is my brother, Shohel Ahmed. Today he comes late.''\nWhen the group settled down to its meal, the conversation turned, as it often does, to the state of business, which is not good. When the economy gets tight, small luxuries like late-night taxis are often the first to go. Even the cold weather has not helped much.\n''It used to be you could work only two hours, and earn $80 or $90,'' said one cabby, who identified himself as Jewel. ''Now it takes five hours or more to earn the same amount, and many days you must work 14, 15 hours just to break even.''\nAnother problem, Jewel said, is what he sees as hostility directed at Muslim taxi drivers. Most Bangladeshis are Muslim, and some customers make insults from the moment they notice a Muslim name on the card on the partition.\n''They call us Taliban,'' Jewel said. ''They say terrible things, things that are so provocative. It is because of the names. If we could take our names down, no problem.''\nThere was a brief silence. Then Jewel launched into one of his favorite David-and-Goliath stories, a tale of his own recent triumph over a particularly hostile customer that had taken place just outside his taxi.\n''I had to stop the car because he lit a cigarette,'' Jewel said. ''It is not allowed to have smoking in the cab, but he became very angry. When he grabbed me by the neck, his fingers were like big bananas, and he was so tall, like Shaquille O'Neal, that he lifted me right up off my feet.''\nThe other cabbies whistled appreciatively. ''He told me to go back to my country,'' Jewel continued, ''and I say, 'Oh, where is that?' He say, 'Taliban,' and so I kick him very hard and run away.''\nThere was another moment of uncomfortable silence, which Mr. Gulam finally broke by ordering a round of sweets: condensed-milk pudding with vermicelli, and rice-flour cakes filled with palm sugar and coconut.\nSEVERAL blocks away, the Punjabi Food Junction at 10th Avenue and 28th Street does a brisk overnight business serving the community of Punjabi taxi drivers. There's a $5.95 all-you-can-eat buffet which, the owner, Phuman Singh, likes to say is ''open 26 hours a day.''\n''We get mostly the taxi drivers but sometimes the American people as well,'' he said. On a recent night, offerings included yellow-lentil dal, tandoori chicken, rice pilaf and an Indian-American invention that Mr. Singh calls bread pakoras, white bread folded around peas and potatoes, dipped in spicy batter and fried.\nBalwant Singh and Amer Deep Singh, cousins from the state of Punjab, in India, meet here nearly every night around 2 a.m. The owner is a friend, and they like knowing they will run into other Punjabi Sikhs. ''And the food tastes just like at home,'' Balwant Singh added.\nHe teased his cousin about a recent decision to switch from taxi driving to limo driving, and together they flipped through the matrimonial advertisements in a recent issue of Desi Matchmaker, a publication that helps South Asians find appropriate mates, although Amer Deep Singh is not actually seeking a bride.\n''I am already engaged to a girl,'' he explained. ''She lives in Canada, and maybe we get married next year. I just like to look.''"}, {"text": "Few Habitats, Many Species And a Debate on Preservation\n2003-07-01T05:00:00.000Z\nConservationists call them hot spots -- habitats that cover just 1.4 percent of the earth's land surface but are so rich in biological diversity that preserving them could keep an astonishing number of plant and animal species off the endangered list.\nSince 1988, when Dr. Norman Myers and his colleagues began describing these hot spots in a series of scientific papers and arguing for their protection, they have become a focus of worldwide conservation efforts. Private organizations and government agencies, including the World Bank, have made preserving 25 such ecological arks -- from the Atlantic rain forest of Brazil to the semiarid Karoo region of South Africa -- a top priority for financing and protective legislation.\nBut a growing chorus of scientists is warning that directing conservation funds to hot spots may be a recipe for major losses in the future. Just as an investor should maintain a balanced portfolio, the scientists argue, conservationists should avoid putting all of their eggs in one basket.\nHot spots are top performers in one dimension, these scientists say: the number of unique species that live in them. Of species that live on land, nearly half of all plants and more than a third of all animals are found only in the hot spots. But they do not include many rare species and major animal groups that live in less biologically rich regions (''cold spots'').\nAnd the hot-spot concept does not factor in the importance of some ecosystems to human beings, the scientists argue. Wetlands, for example, contain just a few species of plants, but they perform valuable service by filtering water, regulating floods and serving as nurseries for fish.\nThis debate has been simmering quietly among biologists for years. But it is coming to a boil now with the publication of an article in the current issue of American Scientist arguing that ''calls to direct conservation funding to the world's biodiversity hot spots may be bad investment advice.''\n''The hot-spot concept has grown so popular in recent years within the larger conservation community that it now risks eclipsing all other approaches,'' write the authors of the paper, Dr. Michelle Marvier, a professor of biology at Santa Clara University, and Dr. Peter Kareiva, an associate at the university and a scientist with the Nature Conservancy, a group that has increasingly focused on hot spots.\n''The officers and directors of all too many foundations, nongovernmental organizations and international agencies have been seduced by the simplicity of the hot spot idea,'' they go on. ''We worry that the initially appealing idea of getting the most species per unit area is, in fact, a thoroughly misleading strategy.''\nOther prominent ecologists have grown critical of hot spots. ''Focusing all of our attention on hot spots is just nuts,'' said Dr. Paul Ehrlich, president of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford University.\n''The hot-spot approach was a good one when it was proposed by Myers way back when,'' Dr. Ehrlich said. ''It attracted important attention to the distribution of species diversity. Now it's clear that saving a few percent of the earth's surface to preserve species will not accomplish what needs to be accomplished.''\nEven if people succeeded in preserving a single viable population of every species on earth, he said, the human race would die out unless it managed to protect the ecosystems that support broader populations of plants, animals and people too.\n''One has to balance the necessary attempts to preserve species diversity with what may be much more important,'' he said of ''the preserving of population diversity and in the process the preserving of ecosystem services.''\nBut hot spots have their ardent defenders, notably Dr. Myers, a fellow at Oxford University, and Dr. Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International, a nonprofit organization that has made hot spots the centerpiece of its global strategy.\nDr. Mittermeier says hot spots have been successful at attracting attention and financing for conservation in tropical countries. ''And that has been good,'' he said. ''No one is suggesting that one invest solely in hot spots, but if you want to avoid extinctions, you have to invest in them.''\nBy definition, hot spots contain many species that exist nowhere else on earth and that are under threat because more than 70 percent of their habitat has been destroyed. Conservation International is still working on expanding the hot spots list, Dr. Mittermeier said, with 10 new ones to be announced later this year.\nAnd the organization puts a high priority on protecting five vast wilderness areas that have many unique species and are still relatively intact. They include the world's largest tropical rain forests, the Amazon, the Congo forests of central Africa and the island of New Guinea, as well as the Miombo-Mopane grasslands and woodlands of southern Africa, and the deserts of northern Mexico and the American Southwest. These areas still have more than 75 percent of their natural habitat and fewer than 13 people per square mile, said Dr. Mittermeier, but they will become hot spots if they are not protected,\nDr. Myers said that since he wrote his first paper on hot spots, $750 million had been committed to protecting them, including a $261 million donation to Conservation International from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the largest single gift ever to an environmental organization. Still, he said, the hot spots need more attention and more money -- ''a lot more,'' he said.\nDr. Agnes Kiss, an environment specialist with the World Bank, acknowledges that when it comes to spending money on conservation, hot spots loom large. ''Put it this way,'' she said. ''When we're trying to justify a project, if it's a hot spot, basically it's a shoo-in.''\nThe World Bank and its Global Environment Facility, which makes grants in addition to the bank's traditional loans, is halfway through a five-year $125 million Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund to invest in protecting hot spots, along with the MacArthur Foundation, the Japanese government and Conservation International.\nStill, Dr. Kiss said, the bank also takes other factors into account, including the commitment of governments and local communities to preserve biodiversity and their track records with previous projects.\nIn a world where funds are limited, that is just the kind of approach that is needed, Dr. Marvier and Dr. Kareiva assert in their American Scientist article. In a coming paper in Ecology Letters, written with their student at Santa Clara University, Casey O'Connor, they propose a ''return on investment'' model to determine which countries provide the best opportunities for preserving biodiversity. Their analysis compares the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of conservation efforts in different countries, alongside biological diversity and the threat of habitat destruction.\nWhen factors like the costs of doing business, the reliability of governments and pressure from population growth are taken into account, they write, some countries on Conservation International's list of the 17 most ''megadiverse'' countries -- Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, and Venezuela, for example -- drop off the priority list. And some other countries not found on the list emerge as priorities, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Mozambique and Vietnam.\nStill others appear on every list, no matter which priority-setting model is used: China, India, Madagascar, Papua New Guinea and South Africa.\nDr. Marvier and Dr. Kareiva say the largest conservation organizations -- the Nature Conservancy, the World Wildlife Fund and Conservation International -- have many offices concentrated in countries with hot spots, but are understaffed in countries with vast biological resources, like Argentina and Russia.\nSince no one strategy is enough, they argue, conservationists need a way to make explicit trade-offs. Preserving 1,000 species in a ''cold spot'' like Montana, they argue, would be more important than preserving 1,000 species in a hot spot like Ecuador because in Montana 1,000 species represents a third of the total, while in Ecuador it represents just 5 percent.\n''Conservationists widely accept the need for some sort of triage,'' they argue, ''whereby limited funds go to places where the greatest good can be done.''\nDr. Kareiva acknowledged that there would never be one magic equation everyone would accept. ''But we can all get more sophisticated by focusing on different variables,'' he said. Biological diversity, he said, ''should be one variable in the equation; it shouldn't be the end-all or be-all.''\nDr. Kiss, the World Bank environmental specialist, agreed. ''The basic principle that biology isn't everything is quite sound,'' she said. But Dr. Mittermeier of Conservation International worries that focusing on ''return on investment'' could lead to bad decisions in the long run. Colombia, for example, demands conservationists' attention despite the uncertainties raised by its guerrilla war, he said, adding, ''If a country is rich in diversity it's very dangerous to write it off because of temporary difficulties.''\nDr. Thomas Lovejoy, president of the H. John Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment in Washington, called the debate ''useful, but somewhat academic.''\n''The real issue here is not the sort of fine-tuning of what is the best way to set priorities from organization to organization. It's about changing the scale of the funding,'' he said. ''In the real world, there is a real need for a diversity of approaches in the field of conservation.''\nHot-spots research ''highlighted that there are certain places where the fire engines ought to go right away,'' Dr. Lovejoy said, ''whereas other places under less pressure can wait a few years, if you have to do them in sequence.''\n''But you'd better not wait too long,'' he added."}, {"text": "Extradition Sought for Woman Accused in Deaths of 2 Children\n2003-04-01T05:00:00.000Z\n IRVINGTON, N.J., March 31 \u2014 Investigators today were working with Canadian law enforcement officials to extradite a woman accused of killing her two stepchildren here last week. \n The woman, Sultana Haque, 30, was arrested in Toronto Sunday night and is being held on murder charges, said Michael Chase, the acting chief of the Irvington Police Department. \n Ms. Haque is awaiting extradition to New Jersey, where she will be formally charged with murder and possession of a deadly weapon, said Charlotte Smith, spokeswoman for the Essex County prosecutor's office. \n The Irvington police said Ms. Haque slashed the throats of her stepchildren, Alstan, 8, and Aisha, 5, while her husband, the children's father, was at work. Irvington police officers were summoned to a seventh-floor apartment about 11:30 Saturday morning after the children's father, Jeff Haque, returned from work and discovered their bodies lying in pools of blood. \n Ms. Haque, a native of Bangladesh, had fled to Toronto by train and sought refuge at a mosque after the killings, the police said. She was referred to a woman's shelter, where she apparently told people that she was involved in a homicide, Chief Chase said. \n Her stepson and stepdaughter had been living with their natural mother in Teaneck, but were spending the weekend at their father's apartment in the Maple Gardens high-rise complex on Marshall Street. A memorial service for the children was held today at a mosque in Teaneck. \n Today, Ed Rogan, a spokesman for Department of Human Services, which oversees the state's Division of Youth and Family Services, said Mr. Haque had registered two complaints against the children's natural mother, Nazma Haque, last year. Both complaints were unsubstantiated, Mr. Rogan said. \n Several calls to Mr. Haque's family were not returned. "}, {"text": "'Loot'\n2003-05-04T05:00:00.000Z\n Once upon our time, there was an earthquake: but this one is the most powerful ever recorded since the invention of the Richter scale made it possible for us to measure apocalyptic warnings. \n It tipped a continental shelf. These tremblings often cause floods; this colossus did the reverse, drew back the ocean as a vast breath taken. The most secret level of our world lay revealed: the sea-bedded-wrecked ships, facades of houses, ballroom candelabra, toilet bowl, pirate chest, TV screen, mail-coach, aircraft fuselage, cannon, marble torso, Kalashnikov, metal carapace of a tourist bus-load, baptismal font, automatic dishwasher, computer, swords sheathed in barnacles, coins turned to stone. The astounded gaze raced among these things; the population who had fled from their toppling houses to the maritime hills ran down. Where terrestrial crash and bellow had terrified them, there was naked silence. The saliva of the sea glistened upon these objects; it is given that time does not, never did, exist down here where the materiality of the past and the present as they lie has no chronological order, all is one, all is nothing-or all is possessible at once. \n People rushed to take; take, take. This was-when, anytime, sometime-valuable, that might be useful, what was this, well someone will know, that must have belonged to the rich, it's mine now, if you don't grab what's over there someone else will, feet slipped and slithered on seaweed and sank in soggy sand, gasping sea-plants gaped at them, no-one remarked there were no fish, the living inhabitants of this unearth had been swept up and away with the water. The ordinary opportunity of looting shops which was routine to people during the political uprisings was no comparison. Orgiastic joy gave men, women and their children strength to heave out of the slime and sand what they did not know they wanted, quickened their staggering gait as they ranged, and this was more than profiting by happenstance, it was robbing the power of nature before which they had fled helpless. Take, take; while grabbing they were able to forget the wreck of their houses and the loss of time-bound possessions there. They had tattered the silence with their shouts to one another and under these cries like the cries of the absent seagulls they did not hear a distant approach of sound rising as a great wind does. And then the sea came back, engulfed them to add to its treasury. \n That is what is known; in television coverage that really had nothing to show but the pewter skin of the depths, in radio interviews with those few infirm, timid or prudent who had not come down from the hills, and in newspaper accounts of bodies that for some reason the sea rejected, washed up down the coast somewhere. \n But the writer knows something no-one else knows; the sea-change of the imagination. \n Now listen, there's a man who has wanted a certain object (what) all his life. He has a lot of-things-some of which his eye falls upon often, so he must be fond of, some of which he doesn't notice, deliberately, that he probably shouldn't have acquired but cannot cast off, there's an art nouveau lamp he reads by, and above his bed-head a Japanese print, a Hokusai, `The Great Wave', he doesn't really collect oriental stuff, although if it had been on the wall facing him it might have been more than part of the furnishings, it's been out of sight behind his head for years. All these-things-but not the one. \n He's a retired man, long divorced, chosen an old but well-appointed villa in the maritime hills as the site from which to turn his back on the assault of the city. A woman from the village cooks and cleans and doesn't bother him with any other communication. It is a life blessedly freed of excitement, he's had enough of that kind of disturbance, pleasurable or not, but the sight from his lookout of what could never have happened, never ever have been vouchsafed, is a kind of command. He is one of those who are racing out over the glistening sea-bed, the past-detritus=treasure, one and the same-stripped bare. \n Like all the other looters with whom he doesn't mix, has nothing in common, he races from object to object, turning over the shards of painted china, the sculptures created by destruction, abandonment and rust, the brine-vintaged wine casks, a plunged racing motorcycle, a dentist's chair, his stride landing on disintegrated human ribs and metatarsals he does not identify. But unlike the others, he takes nothing-until: there, ornate with tresses of orange-brown seaweed, stuck fast with nacreous shells and crenellations of red coral, is the object. (A mirror?) It's as if the impossible is true; he knew that was where it was, beneath the sea, that's why he didn't know what it was, could never find it before. It could be revealed only by something that had never happened, the greatest paroxysm of our earth ever measured on the Richter scale. \n He takes it up, the object, the mirror, the sand pours off it, the water that was the only bright glance left to it streams from it, he is taking it back with him, taking possession at last. \n And the great wave comes from behind his bed-head and takes him. \n His name well-known in the former regime circles in the capital is not among the survivors. Along with him among the skeletons of the latest victims, with the ancient pirates and fishermen, there are those dropped from planes during the dictatorship so that with the accomplice of the sea they would never be found. Who recognized them, that day, where they lie? \n No carnation or rose floats. \n Full fathom five. \n Chapter Two MISSION STATEMENT \n There was a great deal of entertaining up at the Manager's house, weekends. On Monday morning a member of the kitchen and ground staff whose job it was set off to walk fifty miles to town with the master's note for the liquor store. A case of Scotch whisky. The man walked back with twelve bottles in the case on his head, arriving on Friday. Every Friday. The feat was a famous dinner-party story, each weekend: that's my man-what heads they have, eh, thick as a log! \n Roberta Blayne ne\u0301e Cartwright works for an international aid agency, has been based both at headquarters in New York and Geneva, and posted abroad a number of times. Her first appointment to Africa came when she was nearly forty-six and felt she looked it; she had been married once, long ago it seemed to her. The journalist husband had fallen in love with a Chinese girl while on assignment in Beijing; the marriage was an intermittent one, so to speak, each of the pair generally somewhere else and it fell into desuetude amicably. He did not share her need to have some part in changing the world, which grew in inverse proportion to any other emotional need. There were no children as a reminder of the marriage; only the tragic-eyed swollen-bellied ones of the horde waiting, here, there, for succour through the bureaucratic processes she served. Not always, or often, the direct means of putting food in their gaped nestling-mouths, but projects of policy, infrastructure, communications, trade treaties, education, land distribution by which development aid was meant to satisfy all hungers. \n Could have been India. Even the European countries brought to Third World conditions by civil wars. But it was Africa; a tour of duty, a territory in the process of transformation as in most others on the African continent. She unpacked at the type of house in the capital her aid agency hired for whatever personnel in middle-level position merited. The suburb must have dated from colonial times; verandah round three sides darkening rooms with fireplaces whose chimneys were now blocked by electric heaters, a garden where loquat and bougainvillaea, gnarled as old oak, tangled above stony red earth. The bedroom she chose-there were three-was obviously the best one, this confirmed by the aura of recent occupation by her predecessor and his or her bedmate, the hangers on the rods bearing the ghosts of clothes. Her own took their place; her papers and books spread where others had been cleared away. She was accustomed to this kind of takeover. Whatever lingering presence of others was quickly erased by hers. This was a confidence acquired by the nature of international work, routine as computer competency: you have to be in constant touch with headquarters, home base in New York or Geneva, and you occupy, where others were before you and will come after, designated quarters-even though the black man who insists on waking you with tea every morning and polishes the floors, and the other who squats to tend weeds that have taken the place of flower-beds, enact old colonial rituals of a home. \n Her title was Assistant to the Administrator of the programmes for this country planned by experts in New York and Geneva according to their Mission Statement. Much of the application consisted of informing New York/Geneva tactfully as possible that the Agency's plan for the country to enter globalisation couldn't be achieved quite as visualised, and concealing how she and the Administrator were deviously, prudently finding out how to go about the process-not on their own well-trained theoretical model, but in the ways the Government itself best understood how the country might practise reforms and innovations according to the circumstances in which their constituents lived, often unimaginable in New York/Geneva, and the expectations, demands, prejudices, political rivalries within which Ministers thrashed about to keep their cabinet seats. This meant not only travel into the bush and up rivers to communities where the development plan saw the local school as being thrust into the new one world with information technology equipment-and where the Administrator and his Assistant found there was no electricity in the village-but also required attentive socialising with Ministers and their various Deputies, advisors, often unidentified figures attendant and clearly influential, who would pick up in mid-sentence some wandering statement by a Minister, clarifying it briskly. Who were these men-even a woman or two? How to approach them for inside facts, for warnings or encouragements about whom to seek out to breach a Minister's generalisations, that slam of doors on undesirable realities. \n She enjoyed field trips: she distrusted abstraction. -Then you're working for the wrong outfit.- Her Administrator, a Canadian, taunted her; but they got on well, he had his wife and teenage son with him, the boy enrolled at a local school as evidence of the Administrator's commitment to sharing the life of the local people wherever posted. As the bachelor woman (his wife dubbed her with mock envy), she was invited to drop in and share meals at their house where the same kind of resident tea-provider and floor-polisher had become a mate of the schoolboy, teaching him to play the guitar the traditional African way, and in turn being taught the latest pop music. In addition to the official gatherings and embassy parties, the Administrator's house was where Government Ministers and officials, members of parliament, the capital's dignitaries, judges, lawyers, businessmen, were entertained for what could be gleaned of use to the Agency's mandate. Few brought their wives along; the female Minister of Welfare and two MPs were usually the only black women present, and they were strident in their interruptions of male discourse, as they had to be to distinguish them from the wives left at home. Roberta Blayne, the Administrator and his wife, Flora, had no particular sense of being white, in this company; all three had lived with black, yellow, all races in the course of their work around the world and accepted their own physical characteristic like that between eyes with or without the epithelioid fold, noses high-bridged or flat. They were also aware that they were not always accepted by the same token among all the eminent blacks present-it's easier for the former masters to put aside the masks that hid their humanity than for the former slaves to recognise the faces underneath. Or to trust that this is not a new mask these are wearing. \n For the first few months neither Ministers nor their satellites addressed Roberta Blayne beyond the usual general greeting, which then began at least to include her name-not a difficult one to recall: somebody's assistant, home-grown or imported, a genus there to be ignored. But as her Administrator, Mr Alan D. Henderson, often spoke in the plural `we' and turned to her for her interpretation of points in an interview or observations on a field trip, the dignitaries began to recognize her as, if not one of the company of Minister of Welfare and MPs-her manner was not strident-part of a delegation, another honorary man. Her status was marked by observation that she drank whisky with the Ministers instead of the beer that was the expected choice of any entourage. A dinner-table companion might turn to her sometimes with the usual questions of obligatory interest-where did she come from?-English, of course?-what does she think of our country?-ever been in Africa-first time? -First time. India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan-but not here.- You see you are welcome, we Africans are friendly people, don't you find.- There was a lawyer who was witty and forthright, making her Administrator and her laugh at themselves, with his anecdotes and mimicry of encounters with officials from aid agencies. -One thing you development fundis don't know about is the new kind of joke you've inspired among us in the taverns.- The Administrator was equal to the banter. -It's a good sign when you hear you're the butt of humour, means you're accepted.- \n The lawyer, with lips everted expectantly in a grin, saw the Assistant was about to speak: -As what? Part of the community? Or part of the scene playing between donor and beneficiary?- \n -Ah, she's right on, man!- The lawyer flung himself back in his chair delightedly. -Is it a sitcom, miniseries starring the IMF and World Bank- \n The Administrator was enjoying himself. -Oh not your standard villains- \n This sort of pleasant exchange struck up only after the tap on a glass signalled that the host, Minister or Chairman, was about to make a welcoming speech, and discussion of the latest announcements or `pending' announcements (development topics had their own evasive lingua franca) on trade tariffs, bills coming before parliament for land reform, proceedings of Mercasur, SADEC, the EU, had been respectfully listened to or contested (the listeners asserting themselves to become the listened to) over the skill of eating and drinking without appearing to be aware of this lowly function. \n It was only then that whatever everyone had been drinking released the individual from the official; the volume rose convivially. \n Continues... \n Excerpted from Loot and other stories by NADINE GORDIMER Copyright \u00a9 2003 by Felix Licensing, B.

"}, {"text": "A Museum Tends the British Melting Pot\n2003-06-11T05:00:00.000Z\nAt each end of Brick Lane in the East End of London, little plastic flags offer visitors a warm welcome to Banglatown. With its textile shops, travel agencies, restaurants and halal butchers serving a thriving community of Bangladeshi immigrants, this bustling street could well have been transplanted from the Indian subcontinent.\nBut if Bangladeshis have made this Spitalfields neighborhood their own in recent years, a far older story is told at a building on a street leading off Brick Lane. Here, in what is billed as the first Museum of Immigration and Diversity in Britain, the message is that immigration to London is hardly a novelty, that for three centuries the area around Brick Lane has been a melting pot for immigrants and refugees.\nGiven the scale of immigration from Britain's former colonies since the 1960's, the museum at 19 Princelet Street is modest. Although it will be open daily during Refugee Week here, June 15 to 22, it is struggling to raise $4.8 million so that the building can be open year-round. Even in its dilapidated state, though, it is a powerful symbol of the ever-changing face of Spitalfields.\nHuguenots, or French Protestants, were the first foreigners to move into the neighborhood, in the late 17th century. Among the 50,000 or so Huguenots fleeing religious persecution by Louis XIV was Peter Abraham Ogier, a silk merchant whose family was the first to occupy 19 Princelet Street in 1719. The house has remained nearly unchanged since then: even the original kitchen sink is still in place.\nIn the mid-19th century, with Spitalfields then favored by Jewish immigrants from Poland, Lithuania and Russia, a synagogue was added in the building's garden by its new tenant, the Loyal United Friends Friendly Society. Today, though abandoned for worship, the synagogue remains a mute witness to a Jewish community replaced by a new wave of immigrants.\nThe 19th century also brought Irish refugees of the potato famine, but the next big change came with the arrival of Caribbean immigrants after World War II. They were followed in the 1970's by Bangladeshis and, most recently, by a growing number of Somalis. A rare touch of traditional Britain survives at the Christ Church Spitalfields Church of England Primary School on Brick Lane, but almost all its students are the children of immigrants.\nNearby, another building represents the evolution of a neighborhood more strikingly. Built in the 18th century by Huguenots as a church called L'\u00c9glise Neuve, it has successively housed the Society for Promoting Christianity Among Jews, a Methodist Chapel, the Great Synagogue Machzikei Hadass and, since 1976, the Jamme Masjid Mosque.\nIt is through this prism that the Museum of Immigration strives to recount the story of newcomers to Britain, a mission similar to that of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, which interprets the immigrant experience in Manhattan during the 19th and early 20th centuries. For the moment, though, the Spitalfields museum's priority is more mundane: to raise money to strengthen its buckling walls and floors, some now supported by metal pillars. Even so, there are no plans to restore or modernize the building because 19 Princelet Street is itself the museum's principal exhibit. ''We want to spend money where it cannot be seen,'' explained Susie Symes, a former British government economist who runs the museum's board of trustees.\nThe Ogier family's kitchen and living quarters give an idea of 18th-century domestic life, although the former synagogue is the most interesting architectural artifact: it retains its 19th-century chandeliers and an elegant balcony with paneling that carries the names of members of the local Jewish community and the money they contributed to the building's upkeep.\nAn aura of mystery was added to the building by ''Rodinsky's Room,'' a book by Rachel Lichtenstein and Iain Sinclair published in 2000 (Granta). It recounts the strange life of David Rodinsky, a Jewish hermit who for decades lived in an attic room at 19 Princelet Street and who vanished suddenly in 1969. When his room was opened 11 years later it was found to contain cabalistic drawings as well as notebooks in Sumerian, Arabic, Japanese, Hebrew, Yiddish, Greek and Russian.\nRodinsky's room is closed now, but once the upper floors of the building have been made safe his refuge will become part of the museum's effort to keep alive three centuries of memory. In the meantime, a semipermanent show called ''Suitcases and Sanctuary,'' organized two years ago, sets out to recall the poverty or repression that prompted immigrants to move to Spitalfields.\nThe charm of this exhibition is that it was put together by children from six local elementary schools who, for the most part, come from immigrant families. Thus Somali children wrote poems about the Irish potato famine and took part in a video in which they re-enacted Irish families traveling to Britain, while Muslim children from Bangladesh enacted a Yiddish folk tale. The story of Bengali immigration was in turn told by children from a local Roman Catholic school.\n''We have proved with the exhibition that people want to visit the house,'' Ms. Symes said. ''The idea is that you can take historic buildings and give them new meaning today through what they evoke. And we see that with visitors, who may be strangers but eagerly exchange ideas and experiences.''"}, {"text": "Helping Binyam, When His Mother Won't\n2003-05-20T05:00:00.000Z\nAlas, there are several good reasons not to help starving Africans.\nI wish the famine were as simple as the local governments portray it: as a drought that has left 40 million Africans at risk of starvation. But after jouncing over rumors of roads in Ethiopia and Eritrea, I've met too many children like Binyam Berhane.\nBinyam is a 14-month-old boy in this town in southern Eritrea who came within a whisker of starving to death. But before you reach for your checkbook, I should add that his mother, a 20-year-old woman named Senait Derhane, looks healthy and plump. She was wearing a nice dress and had purple nail polish on her toenails.\nShe acknowledges that the reason she doesn't have food for Binyam is that the Eritrean government drafted her husband to fight a (senseless) war still simmering with Ethiopia. In his absence, she has no income and no one to work the fields.\nSo sure, there is a severe drought. But it has only aggravated a chronic shortage that is the fault of governments and individual families.\nWhat breaks your heart is the sight of healthy parents cradling skeletal children. Petros Loka, for example, is a young man with the hint of a potbelly -- yet he was at an Ethiopian clinic with his 7-year-old son, David, who was admitted at 31 pounds and looked like a ghost. Trying to puzzle out how this could happen, I asked how the family ate.\n''The man eats first, and then the children and the wife eat together,'' Mr. Loka explained. Others confirm that across rural Ethiopia, the father eats first and the mother and children get leftovers -- with the smallest kids mostly squeezed out. To address that problem, we need not just more food but, above all, education, so that, as in Ethiopia's cities, families eat together and understand the need to look out for their youngest members.\nMoreover, even in a good year five million Ethiopians need food aid, and Georgia Shaver, head of the World Food Program in Ethiopia, says that ''normal'' may need to be redefined as 10 million in need. So the problem goes beyond the weather and includes insecure land tenure, the 29 million Africans with AIDS or H.I.V., and the lack of irrigation.\nI talked to members of one family who were hungry because their crops had failed from the drought, just 100 yards from a lake. Why hadn't they irrigated? The risk of being stomped by hippos was one factor, but another was that carrying water is women's work and tending the fields is men's work, and this cultural impasse left them stymied -- and starving.\nAnother problem is that food aid solves immediate problems but adds to the underlying one. U.S. gifts of grain save lives -- but also lower local food prices. This reduces incentives for farmers and leaves them poorer, and thus arguably more vulnerable in the next famine.\nSo there are plenty of reasons not to help the 40 million at risk of starvation in Africa. And yet. . . .\nI've never seen anything like the wizened children dying of starvation in Ethiopia. Even if we do our part, perhaps 100,000 Ethiopian children will die of malnutrition-related ailments in 2003, as they do in a typical year. But if the drought persists and we don't do more, the toll will rise to several hundred thousand or more.\nWhen children are dying in front of you -- or at risk of permanent brain damage if they survive -- practical objections to food aid lose their force. And it's not true that giving such aid is always pouring food aid down a rathole. In the 1970's, Bangladesh perpetually seemed in famine and was famously dismissed by Henry Kissinger as an ''international basket case.'' Since then, Bangladesh has grown economically faster than the U.S.\nSo just because famine is chronic doesn't mean that we shouldn't help. This fact simply underscores the importance of focusing not just on relief, but also on longer-term development. While preventing today's famine with food, we can prevent tomorrow's with irrigation ditches, schools and AIDS education campaigns.\nIt's astonishing how easy it is to save lives here. Give a starving kid a bit of milk and high-nutrition grain, and within a few days the eyes shine again and a smile reappears. At a Catholic-run clinic near Awassa, Ethiopia, the Italian medical director, Dr. Isabel Arbide, suddenly dashed over and embraced a small boy.\n''Oh, look at this child!'' she gushed delightedly as the boy beamed back. ''I thought he was going to die. I wouldn't have given five centimes for his life. Now look at him!''\nWe also hold these lives in our hands. And while there may be several good reasons to turn our backs, kids like Binyam provide 40 million even better reasons to help."}, {"text": "Tribute to a Room With a View; Windows on the World Employees Plan a Restaurant\n2003-07-09T05:00:00.000Z\nTogether they represent more than 300 years of experience at New York restaurants, including the doomed Windows on the World on top of the trade center. But they had never been forced to confront a problem like this:\nAre spicy French fries upscale enough to include on the menu of a white-tablecloth restaurant?\nSeveral of the former Windows workers who had gathered in a noisy downtown conference room shook their heads, as though someone had suggested serving sliced white bread and margarine. Others pursed their lips disapprovingly, but were willing to listen to the consultant who had proposed serving fries at the fancy new co-op restaurant that surviving workers plan to open early next year.\n''Spicy fries,'' said the consultant, Steven Hill, a chef and cooking instructor, ''are not too d\u00e9class\u00e9 anymore.''\nEvery Monday afternoon, waiters, cooks, busboys and headwaiters who worked at Windows and a few other restaurants near ground zero wrangle over issues like the character of French fries without always coming to a decision. But there is no disagreement about the group's broader goal: overcoming the tragedy and creating a new future for themselves that will stand as a kind of legacy to the memory of 73 of their colleagues who died on Sept. 11, 2001.\nWith the help of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, a number of former workers at Windows -- a few without legal immigration documents and most without steady jobs -- formed the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York to help themselves rebuild their lives.\nThis evening, about 40 of those workers will release details of their plans for the restaurant, tentatively titled Windows on TriBeCa, that they hope to open within sight of ground zero.\nThey already have the support of celebrity New York chefs like Waldy Malouf, of Beacon, and Don Pintabona, founding chef of Robert De Niro's Tribeca Grill, who are helping them organize a cook-off in the fall to raise some of the $3 million they estimate it will cost to get their restaurant going.\nThey have lined up support from New York bankers, real estate agents and designers. They are negotiating with an Italian restaurant workers' cooperative that has employee-owned restaurants in Europe and Asia and wants to provide the Windows workers with financial and technical help.\nThey hired a consultant to prepare a $30,000 report sizing up the best location, size and theme of a new restaurant. They have established a catering business that in less than a year brought in enough money to pay for the report.\nAll profits from the catering business go toward the co-op, and only the director receives a salary. Everyone else works on a voluntary basis and will continue that way until the restaurant opens. Each co-op member will become part owner of the enterprise, but the workers have not yet figured out how they will draw salaries or take profits from it.\nLike the ingredients of a complicated recipe, the elements of the venture have been selected. All that's left is the execution.\n''I am not nervous about it at all,'' said Mohammad Quddus, 37, a waiter from Bangladesh who worked at Windows on the World for five years. He has never owned his own business nor run his own restaurant, but he is convinced that among the 40 members of the group, there is experience enough to handle every issue that may arise.\n''We are restaurant professionals,'' said Mr. Quddus, a quiet man who abandons his reserve when he talks about the co-op. ''We know how to prepare food and how to serve food. And though we are 40 people, we will all be acting like one owner.''\nWhile others share Mr. Quddus's enthusiasm, they are more concerned about how well 40 individuals can work together to make tough decisions. Ataur Rahman, 48, also from Bangladesh, noted the frequent disagreements that have arisen over small decisions, and he worries that they may be a sign of divisions to come.\n''But we're going to do it anyway and see,'' Mr. Rahman said. ''At least we'll try.''\nWorking at the top of the world brought the 40 together from the farthest reaches of the globe. Ghana, Morocco, Bangladesh, Mexico, Ivory Coast, Guatemala, Indonesia, Egypt, Nepal and half a dozen other foreign lands are reflected in their faces and in their dreams.\nTheir diverse backgrounds are considered one of their strengths, and something they hope will be reflected in the menu.\n''Everybody will bring his mother here for recipes,'' said Fekkak Mamdouh, who was a waiter and union shop steward at Windows. The others at the meeting laughed. ''No, I'm serious,'' he said.\nIf some workers did not quite understand how risky a venture a restaurant can be, the consultant's report done for them by the I.C.A. Group of Brookline, Mass., made it clear.\nGiven current economic difficulties in New York, the report concluded, an independent restaurant sponsored only by the co-op would be ''a difficult and probably unfeasible undertaking.''\nSaru Jayaraman, the executive director of Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, said that receiving the consultant's report last January was disconcerting. ''We were very cautious about moving forward,'' she said.\nThe report strongly advised the group to find partners and to seek the counsel of experienced chefs and restaurateurs, and they did.\nOne of the first people they reached was Mr. Pintabona, who worked at the popular Tribeca Grill until January. ''The idea sounded kind of cute, but I was not at all sure if it was going to fly,'' Mr. Pintabona said. ''But when I met with them I was impressed by their spirit.''\nBut not by all their ideas. He was most troubled by the workers' initial intention of making the new restaurant into a memorial to Windows on the World and the people who died there. They intended to bring Windows memorabilia like plates, uniforms and T-shirts to decorate the new venture.\n''I told them that people might go there to see what this is all about because it's a unique concept,'' Mr. Pintabona said, but he doubted it would be enough to bring diners back a second or third time. Reminding diners of the events of Sept. 11 might drive them away, he said.\nSo Mr. Pintabona and other consultants have suggested that the group focus instead on the cooperative nature of their ownership. ''They should connect with co-op farmers and food producers throughout the country, because there's a perceived value there,'' Mr. Pintabona said.\nThe consultant's report suggested TriBeCa as the best location for a new restaurant, and the members are negotiating for space in a historic building near ground zero. Despite the ethnic backgrounds of the members, the report recommended that the basic menu fare be traditional American comfort food, like steak and fries.\nThe report also recommended limiting the co-op restaurant to 100 tables. But when other advisers suggested making the restaurant larger and more luxurious, the workers agreed. Now they are planning a 200-seat full-service restaurant for which they must raise $1 million in cash and arrange financing for an additional $2 million.\nThe money is far more than any of the members have ever handled. They feel, however, that their greatest strength lies in the stake they all have in a business where they will be both employees and owners.\n''Nobody is going to waste food, nobody is going to steal, nobody is going to break glasses,'' said Utjok A. Zaidan, 54, who was a headwaiter in the Windows banquet room. Mr. Zaidan came to New York from Indonesia in 1974 and, like most of the other people involved in this project, always dreamed of opening his own restaurant.\n''This is not just a way to make money,'' he said. ''It could be a model for how to run restaurants in New York.''"}, {"text": "Hunger Worsens in Many Lands, U.N. Says\n2003-11-26T05:00:00.000Z\nThe number of hungry people worldwide has swelled in recent years, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, because of war, drought, AIDS and trade barriers, according to a report released Tuesday by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.\nThe report, ''The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2003,'' found that after falling steadily during the first half of the 1990's, hunger grew in the latter half of the decade.\nBetween 1999 and 2001, the report found, more than 840 million people, or one in seven, went hungry. Most alarming of all, between 1995 and 2001, the number of malnourished people across the developing world grew by an average of 4.5 million a year.\nThe agency said the findings would make it impossible to meet its goal of reducing world hunger by half by 2015. That goal, set first in 1996, was cited as a top priority by the United Nations Millennium Summit meeting in September 2000.\nThe rise in hunger came even though the world produced ample food, and in 22 countries, including Bangladesh, Haiti and Mozambique, the number of undernourished declined in the second half of the decade. ''Bluntly stated, the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will,'' the report declared.\nThe agency called on rich countries to invest in improving agricultural productivity, conserving natural resources and expanding access to global markets for farmers in the developing world. Citizens of countries that spend significant portions of their limited export earnings to import food are most likely to go hungry, the report concluded. By contrast, countries that succeeded in reducing hunger were those where agricultural production rose, population growth slowed and H.I.V. rates were relatively low.\nAntipoverty advocates said the report underscored the need to tackle the underlying causes of hunger.\n''We tend to think of the solution as, 'Well, they need seeds and tools,' '' Adrienne Smith, a spokeswoman for Oxfam America, which is based in Boston, said in a telephone interview. ''Unfortunately there are structural issues that conspire to keep people from thriving.''\nThroughout the 1990's, the report found, only 19 countries, including China, reduced hunger among their peoples. In another 17 countries, where hunger had begun falling in the early 1990's, the number of malnourished people climbed in the latter half of the decade; this group included densely populated nations like India and Nigeria.\n''Unless significant gains are made in large countries where progress has stalled, it will be difficult to reverse this negative trend,'' the report said.\nNot surprisingly, the figures from countries at war, like Liberia and Congo, were the most startling. Agricultural production has come to a standstill in those countries, a great many of them in West and Central Africa. The vast and fertile Congo topped the chart, with 75 percent of its population estimated to be undernourished in the 1999-2001 period. In Afghanistan and Burundi, 70 percent of the people were undernourished.\nIn southern Africa, the report went on, the AIDS pandemic has cut a devastating swath through what otherwise would be its most productive citizens. The disease has robbed families of their breadwinners and forced some families to abandon their fields.\nHunger in turn has exacerbated the AIDS crisis, driving rural people to the cities, where infection rates are high, and forcing women and children to trade sex for money and food, the report found.\nPointing to the success of some countries, the report singled out efforts by Brazil to tackle the roots of hunger: poverty, unemployment and land distribution."}, {"text": "SOAPBOX; A Lesson Learned, and Passed On\n2003-12-07T05:00:00.000Z\nMY 5-year-old son is in kindergarten. He told me the other day that his class was collecting food for the hungry.\n''Mommy,'' he said, ''did you know there are some people who don't even have any food, and are always very hungry?\n''Do you know where those hungry people live?''\nWhen I was growing up in the 1960's, the answer to that question -- where ''those hungry people live'' -- would have been in Biafra or in Bangladesh.\nWhen their children left food on their plates, my friends' parents would snap, ''Don't you know there are children starving'' in those places. And they would demand, ''Don't you know how lucky you are to have food at all?''\nBut my own mother never pointed to third world countries or to anonymous starving children.\nInstead, she would look me directly in the eye and tell me how she had ached with hunger, growing up in Eastern Europe during World War II, with three sisters and two brothers. They were poor long before the bombs fell on their village in Poland, in 1939, and destroyed their house.\nFor them, a slice of bread cut into eight pieces was a treat for breakfast. My mother, aunts and uncles fought for the crumbs. The bread was sustenance, even those tiny flecks of stale crust, that now chickens would reject as feed.\nThings got worse. When the war broke out, my mother and her family fled to Russia and were later sent to Siberia. There they pulled plasterboard from the walls and ate it for lunch.\nTheir experiences in Siberia, now 61 years ago, were not theirs alone, but were shared by others in similar dire, wartime circumstances: People, like her family, who daily foraged in the 50-degree-below-zero temperatures, searching the frozen ground for any sign of food, often finding nothing.\nBut time did not lessen the lesson my mother learned, that she passed along to me. Whenever I, as a child, complained or left food on my plate, she would remind me that from her perspective, a child who could eat, was a very fortunate child. Even today, my mother, who is 74, will cry when she recalls that time of deprivation.\nAnd as a result of her experience, my mother always looks for where ''those hungry people'' live, and she has taught me to do the same: donating canned goods to food pantries, and giving directly to the hungry and to the homeless.\nIf I still lived in Manhattan, my son would not have to ask me where ''those hungry people lived.'' He would see them every day -- sprawled on the street. He would hear them, too, often shouting to no one in particular, yet to everyone, ''It only takes a dollar to feed a homeless person!''\nSo now my son asks me, ''Do you know where those hungry people live?''\nThe hungry are here in Westchester, and in large numbers. This is true despite a report in Forbes that cited Purchase as having the 12th most expensive ZIP code in the United States, and boasting median home prices of $1,348,000, followed in the top 100 by Rye, Harrison, Bedford, Armonk, Larchmont, Scarsdale and Chappaqua.\nThere are certainly no homeless people sprawled on the streets of those communities.\nBut affluence should not overshadow poverty.\nAs reported by the Westchester Coalition for the Hungry and Homeless, ''240,000 of Westchester's 948,000 citizens, or 25.4 percent rely on the 38 soup kitchens, 72 food pantries and 33 shelters located in 24 communities from Mount Kisco to Mount Vernon, for help.''\nThe number of families living at the national poverty line -- $17,000 for a family of four -- has been on the rise in Westchester, with the greatest number of those families living in Mount Vernon, Yonkers and New Rochelle.\nI know where the hungry people live.\nIn this holiday season, I will tell my son and his twin brother of the many ways we can help: by donating nonperishable food; by giving of our time and money, and by remembering where the hungry people are. And, most of all, that they are."}, {"text": "Food Markets\n2003-03-10T05:00:00.000Z\n Agata & Valentina 1505 First Ave. (at 79th St.) (212) 452-0690.

The school was poor, but students received meals through an international school feeding program.\n''The food was not good,'' he said. ''Just beans and maize, with a lot of maize and very few beans, cooked in a big pot. But when I look back on it, it used to be delicious.''\nBasic education is one of the most far-reaching single investments that can improve the economies and foster the emergence of literate, self-reliant societies in the developing world. And when meals are offered in schools, enrollment and attendance rates increase significantly, as a student's ability to concentrate and learn is generally sharply improved.\nIn poor societies, the ramifications of this simple formula are more clear-cut and wide-ranging than in the developed world. In the last several years they have fostered a minor renaissance in the culture of humanitarian aid.\nAid organizations have become increasingly mindful of the fact that by feeding a child in school, they address not only short-term hunger but some of the societal ills that allow it to endure. In 2001, with a $124 million contribution from the United States Government, the World Food Program of the United Nations tried to reach more schoolchildren.\nIn 2000, the agency provided daily meals to 12.3 million pupils in 54 countries; this year, the agency says more than 15.6 million children in 70 countries will receive the meals.\n''If you feed children, they come to school and they stay in school and they learn better,'' said Arlene Mitchell, who heads the agency's School Feeding Program.\nSome charities have supported schoolfeeding programs for decades. But the school meal programs fell out of fashion in the 1990's, Ms. Mitchell said. Interest was revived with the McGovern-Dole global food initiative, a two-year pilot program approved by President Bill Clinton in 2000 with $300 million in financing.\nThe program, which provides American farm surpluses for school feeding programs in developing countries, was made permanent by the Bush administration in 2002. But Congress may cut funds to about a quarter of 2001 levels in the budget process.\nThe United States Government is by far the greatest contributor to the World Food Program. The agency, based in Rome, has an annual budget of $1.9 billion and is financed by donations, almost all from governments, although it is trying to get more help from private sources and institutions. The agency says it costs $34 a year to feed a child in school, or 19 cents a day.\nSchool feeding programs tend to operate in desolate areas where enrollments are low and a nutritious meal has the biggest impact. The greatest beneficiary by far in 2002 was North Korea, followed by Kenya, India, Bangladesh and Cuba.\nThe programs hope to overcome the kind of hunger that is generally associated with poor diet and poverty rather than with famine. When possible, fortified foods are used to counter deficiencies and help school performance. Iodine is usually added to salt, and oils are fortified with vitamin A.\nSchool meals usually consist of a fortified cereal-based drink and simple gruel or fortified biscuits, prepared by parents or paid cooks in canteens. When possible, the foods are familiar to the region -- couscous in Niger, for instance, or pumpkin porridge in North Korea.\nEvery attempt is made to serve a meal early in the school day, when children's energy levels are lowest. ''Internationally, many kids have to walk kilometers and kilometers just to get to school, so they start out with no energy and reduce it even more,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''Your chances of having their attention and good behavior are really limited. They literally fall asleep from lack of energy.''\nA Unicef study completed this year found that of the world's 300 million chronically hungry children, 134 million do not attend school. School meals add nutrition and savings to the family food budget. Research by the World Food Program has shown that when schools provide a meal, enrollments can double in a year.\nIn many poor countries, parents depend on children to work in the fields, care for siblings and search for food. Some programs try to compensate by providing take-home rations or cooking oil for the child's family. In some instances, families are allowed to sell these additional rations.\nThis strategy has been successful where poverty and tribal or cultural traditions keep girls out of school. Two out of three children who do not attend primary school are girls, and many meal programs are designed to narrow this gap.\n''To encourage attendance by girls or other hard-to-reach groups, we use take-home rations for good attendance,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''In Pakistan, for example, if a girl attends school 20 days a month she gets food to take home to her family.''\nGirls who attend school tend to marry later and have fewer children, the food experts say. Educated mothers are more likely to contribute to family income, are better able to manage the food supply and are more likely to educate their daughters.\nSchool feeding is not without pitfalls. Some students do not improve because parents cut back on meals served at home. Storage and transportation are complex, and mealtimes vary greatly from country to country. Teachers may be forced to take time out to prepare and serve meals.\nMost important, a transition strategy must be put in place to help the community take over school feeding when the local World Food Program has run its course, usually about five years in the least-developed countries. More than 12 countries, including Brazil, Namibia and Swaziland, have taken over school feeding from the World Food Program in recent years.\n''You go in, you show the benefit to the community, you get them involved in the process, and eventually you're trying to see how they can take over the program,'' said Trudy Bower, the director for the World Food Program in Ghana. ''That's our strategy. Aid does not become endless.''\nCombining Hunger Programs and Education\nHere are a few of the aid organizations that operate school feeding program overseas:\nCARE\n650 First Ave.\nNew York 10016\ncareusa.org\n(212) 686-3110\nCatholic Relief Services\n209 West Fayette Street\nBaltimore, Md. 21201\ncatholicrelief.org\n(800) 736-3467\nMercy Corps\nDept.

The police said the boy was 10, although an aunt said he was 11.\nThe couple, William Cirone, 66, and his wife, Barbara, 63, were taken to New York Presbyterian Hospital after the accident, which took place just before 8 p.m. Mrs. Cirone was listed in critical condition yesterday, and her husband in stable condition, the police said.\nThe couple were visiting from their home in Solvang, Calif., and had been heading north across 87th Street, at the corner of Second Avenue, when they were struck.\nThe police did not release the boy's name, and no charges have been filed against him.\nThe owner of the restaurant, Mumtaz, at 1493 Third Avenue near 84th Street, said he looked like a teenager and had told him he was ''16 plus.''\n''I got a 14-year-old kid,'' the owner, Julfikar A.

Through the roof beams, one could see the pale blue sky.\nThe fire yesterday morning was the second suspicious incident in two months at the building, and this time, two people lost their lives. Neighbors said that flames as high as 10 feet forced people to leap from windows.\nBrenda Casanova, 41, and Maria Cruz, 20, both tenants in the building, died in the fire, the police said. The police said that they were mother and daughter.\nA 17-year-old boy and a 2-year-old boy were in critical condition last night, suffering from smoke inhalation, the authorities said. Their names were not released. Another four people suffered injuries, although none were life-threatening, the police said.\nNila Reyes, 51, a receptionist, was one of the few people in the neighborhood who seemed to know the victims of the fire. She described them as members of a family that lived on the third floor, led by Ms. Casanova, adding that Ms. Casanova and her three children -- Ms. Cruz; Itsel, 19; and Carlos, 16 -- had been sleeping in the house when the fire began. Five other friends and relatives, including Itsel's 2-year-old son, Anthony, were also sleeping in the house, she said.\nLisa Martinez, 32, who lives across the street, said: ''I was woken by the splattering of glass. I saw flames coming from the bedroom window.''\nFire officials were uncertain yesterday what caused the fire in the Unionport section of the Bronx, but they called it suspicious. It occurred nearly one month to the day after another incident, in which someone poured gasoline inside a stairwell of the house.\nAll morning yesterday, a host of fire marshals and detectives stood outside the charred remains of the brick three-story building. They were interviewing neighbors and picking through debris.\nNot all of the injuries related to the fire occurred at the scene, officials said. As one fire company, Squad 41, responded to the blaze, a minivan struck its rig on Westchester Avenue at White Plains Road, a spokesman for the Fire Department said. The minivan then caromed into four pedestrians, who were hospitalized with minor injuries. Six firefighters from Squad 41 were also injured in the collision and were taken to St. Barnabas Hospital with minor wounds.\nMs. Reyes, who lives around the corner on Lyon Avenue, said she was awakened by screaming shortly after 6 a.m. She said she looked from her house 50 feet away across an alley and saw a shirtless young man in bluejeans dangling from the house's awning. Smoke was pouring from a third-floor window, she recalled. It was so thick, she said, that even at a distance it made her choke.\nShe said that suddenly the windows of the house had exploded, and debris was thrown for several feet.\n''It was a scary moment,'' she recalled.\nThe landlord lived on the ground floor, neighbors said. She was identified as Criseyda Dortalina by a man named Luis Suero, who said he was her friend.\nMs. Dortalina turned up at the house three or four hours after the flames had been extinguished. She asked reporters if there had been fatalities. She said that she had been awakened by her second-floor tenants and had run.\n''I ran outside,'' she said, still wearing the white sweat pants and bright pink slippers she had fled in. ''I saw my house was burning. I ran back in and got my son.''\nJeff Thomas, 30, who lives two doors down from the house, said the family on the second floor was from India or Bangladesh. He said that the father of the family was an engineer who drove a livery cab to earn a living. The father had three sons, Mr. Thomas said, who he believed were 13, 6 and 2.\nThe father of that family had climbed over a fence during the fire between the two houses, Mr. Thomas said, and handed his two young sons to Mr. Thomas and his wife. Then the family went into Mr. Thomas's house for shelter, he explained. There, Mr. Thomas said, the father later recalled that he had heard a loud explosion in the morning. After that, he said, the family fled.\nLeticia Maldonado, 65, lives next door to the gutted house. She said that she had recently spoken with the Casanova family on the street.\nShe said that family members had told her that someone with a grudge against them had set the fire.\n''They said it was someone who doesn't like us,'' Ms. Maldonado said."}, {"text": "East Asia Markets Rise Sharply as SARS Fears Recede\n2003-04-29T05:00:00.000Z\n HONG KONG, April 29 \u2014 Stock markets rose sharply across most of east Asia today as investors gained hope that an outbreak of a deadly respiratory disease could be brought under control. \n Airline shares, heavily battered in recent weeks, led broad advances after an official with the World Health Organization said that the risk to travelers from SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, was widely overestimated. The W.H.O. announced on Monday that the disease appeared to have peaked and gone into decline in Canada, Singapore, and here, and had disappeared in Vietnam, although it is still spreading in mainland China and Taiwan. \n The Hang Seng Index here leaped 3.67 percent today on the heaviest trading volume in eight months. The Singapore market was up 3.51 percent, South Korea's broad market soared 4.98 percent, Australia's ASX 200 index increased 1.23 percent and the Jakarta market climbed 3.08 percent. \n Even the stock market in Taiwan climbed 1.47 percent, after three days of heavy losses and despite the quarantine today of a second hospital there after 17 workers were suspected to have contracted SARS. \n The New Taiwan dollar, the Japanese yen and many other Asian currencies strengthened against the United States dollar today; Japanese financial markets were closed for a holiday, however. \n The conspicuous exception today was the Shanghai stock market, which dropped 1.85 percent. But this was just half of its gains on Monday. The China Securities Regulatory Commission announced this evening the closure of stock markets and futures markets in mainland China until May 12. \n While the commission did not explain its action, exchange officials in Shanghai had been predicting such a move would be made as a way to control the spread of SARS at once-crowded brokerages and trading halls. \n At the end of the morning session today at the Hong Kong Exchange, traders took off their bright red jackets with gold identifying numerals on the back and headed for lunch with their first big gains since the local government announced an outbreak of a mysterious respiratory disease nearly seven weeks ago. \n Donna Tsang, a trader wearing a soft-pink facemask that matched her blouse and skirt, said that the SARS problem appeared to be ebbing somewhat. \"SARS is not over, it has just calmed down,\" she said, adding that recent gains on Wall Street had played little role in today's market advance. \n The exchange urges floor traders to wear facemasks and hands them out for free, but half the traders were not wearing them today; an exchange official said that almost all of them were wearing masks until very recently. Masks are also becoming less common on the streets in Hong Kong, which remains the city hardest hit by the disease, with 12 more deaths today, raising the total to 150. \n There were 15 new cases of SARS here today, while 49 people were discharged from hospitals after recovering from the disease. Dr. Margaret Chan, Hong Kong's health director, warned that people should not let down their guard yet. \n \"We need to maintain our vigilance,\" she said at a news conference this afternoon. \n William C. Belchere, an economist with JP Morgan Chase, said that many participants in financial markets remained concerned about the continued spread of the disease in mainland China, which reported 9 more deaths today, raising its total to 148, along with 202 new cases. \n But given that SARS has been present in China since November, there should be hundreds of thousands of cases by now if the disease spread easily, instead of the 3,303 cases reported over the past five months, Mr. Belchere said. \n \"It looks like the worst of SARS is by us, and that gets people back to fundamentals and the balance sheets of companies,\" he said. \"There's a recalibration of the seriousness.\" \n Even with today's rally, Asian markets have considerably underperformed markets elsewhere, especially Wall Street. Fears of SARS have badly depressed demand in many regional economies, even though the limited number of actual illnesses has meant little disruption in the supply of goods and services. \n Many economists are still downgrading their estimates for China's economic output this year, as domestic and foreign tourism has collapsed, retail sales have weakened and the sales of many service businesses, from restaurants to hotels, have slowed. While China's output for the full year is still estimated to grow as much as 6 or 7 percent this year, that is partly because of 9.9 percent growth in the first quarter, before SARS became widely recognized as a problem in China. \n Beijing is now enduring the same kind of panic buying of food, deserted streets and mass exodus that Hong Kong saw a month ago. The W.H.O. has warned of a serious health problem if SARS spreads in poor, rural areas of China or comes to infect people in impoverished countries like India and Bangladesh. \n But stock markets had been weak across much of East Asia through March and much of April on early fears that SARS would be even worse. There had been worries that the disease would infect millions of people within months, as was the case with some of the flu pandemics of the twentieth century, and that this would cause even greater economic disruption than is now seen. \n Some floor traders here said that for all the ebullience today, a considerable risk remained to financial markets and people alike as long as the disease remains out of control in China. \n \"I'm surprised that the market went up,\" said Shum Yan-yee, who wore a standard-issue green surgical mask as he left the trading floor today. \"SARS may not be over very soon.\" "}, {"text": "And Bear In Mind\n2003-09-14T05:00:00.000Z\n(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)\nFOUR SPIRITS, by Sena Jeter Naslund.

Scribner. $25.\nAs her first novel arrives here, Monica Ali is already a best-selling author in Britain, praised by The Observer in London as ''one of the best novelists of her generation.'' Her ''Brick Lane'' is one of 23 books on the not exactly short list for this year's Man Booker Prize. Ms. Ali is being celebrated for her limpid portrait of Bangladeshi characters living in London, defining the immigrant experience through the obstacles and conflicts they encounter. Yet her work is much more impressive in the abstract than it is on the page.\nAlthough ''Brick Lane'' has invited comparisons with fiction by Zadie Smith and Jhumpa Lahiri, it rarely gives off the same sparks. Instead ''Brick Lane'' unfolds more quietly and prettily, punctuated by inevitable bitter twists. Ms. Ali writes in decorous, painterly fashion about images that tend to be profoundly unsurprising: ''Dark spots moved through the far fields. Men, doing whatever they could in this world.'' When she makes sharper observations, they are expressed in the narrative equivalent of bold-face type. ''A loss of pride,'' says the book's most sympathetic character, ''is a terrible thing.''\nThis man's name is Chanu, and he first appears as a figure of fun: the tirelessly self-promoting 40-year-old who enters an arranged marriage with an 18-year-old Bangladeshi named Nazneen. When she arrives in London, Nazneen is na\u00efve about many things -- like the glass fans that turn out to be revolving doors to skyscrapers -- but not about the delusions of her instant husband. She sees the absurdity of his ambition, which has led him to frame any document related to his precious education (''It's just directions to the school, but that's all they gave out'') and to stop at nothing in the name of self-improvement.\n''We were most interested in your story, 'A Prince Among Peasants,' but unfortunately it is not suitable for our publication,'' reads Chanu's rejection letter from The Bexleyheath Advertiser. Apparently this is not a publication that specializes in thinly transparent, face-saving fiction.\nBut Chanu's efforts persist, as does his mounting resentment of English complacency and condescension. ''These people here are by and large ignorant and know nothing of the Bront\u00ebs or Thackeray,'' he inveighs. ''These people here didn't know the difference between me, who stepped off an aeroplane with a degree certificate, and the peasants who jumped off the boat possessing only the lice on their heads.''\nAs Chanu become more and more aware of the brick wall that he faces in London, Nazneen evolves, too. Despite her extreme passivity, there is a storm raging inside her, as signaled by storm-raging-inside-her imagery. On snow globes: ''When you shook them they were whipped with a white explosion but then, only then, you could imagine the life within.'' Eventually this longing erupts into an affair with a man who is younger, freer and more politically active than the ever more discouraged Chanu. She is of course drawn to this lover ''like a moth to a flame.''\nFeminism is as central to ''Brick Lane'' as the tensions within its immigrant community, which increase after the destruction of the World Trade Center fuels smoldering fires. The first time Nazneen wanders through London and says, ''Sorry'' in English is a red-letter day for her self-determination. ''If God had wanted us to ask questions, he would have made us men,'' her mother once told her, but now Nazneen has her doubts.\nAs she is toughened by motherhood and loss, she is also immersed in the moral irony of being a sheltered Muslim woman who sews linings for miniskirts. (The family has taken in piecework.) And when her daughters become teenage enough to say, ''Bor-ing'' in the assimilated English manner, she is left to weigh the price of freedom. Letters from her beautiful sister Hasina tell another story of sexism and hardship, especially after Hasina is rumored to be too close to her landlord. ''You getting cheap rent or what?'' Hasina is asked.\nAnd someone else tells her: ''Sometime when people see a beautiful thing they want to destroy it. The thing make them feel ugly so they act ugly.'' With one of the broad strokes that abound in ''Brick Lane,'' Hasina adds: ''He meaning me for the beautiful thing.''\nAs the wider world intrudes on the studied na\u00efvet\u00e9 of ''Brick Lane'' (someone tells Hasina of ''singer in USA country she call Britainy Spear''), the book moves toward an angry social upheaval that lends it a final sense of consequence. ''The history lessons: they were not, after all, about the past,'' Chanu thinks, as his dreams of a life in England collapse. And when riots erupt on the melting-pot London street of the title, Ms. Ali powerfully observes: ''All the mixed-blood vitality of the street had been drained. Something coursed down the artery, like a bubble in the bloodstream.''\nThe groundwork for these closing events is evident throughout ''Brick Lane,'' expressed with varying degrees of subtlety and sting. But it takes a long, lulling buildup before Nazneen truly experiences the forces that will be ''tearing apart her passive soul.'' Meanwhile Nazneen is electrified by new concepts like ice skating, which at various times represents exhilarating freedom, frozen false emotion and finally a new world of possibilities. As she does with many of this book's ideas, Ms. Ali takes that metaphor around the rink for one spin too many."}, {"text": "LETTER FROM AFRICA; Liberia Seen as Icon of World's Neglect of Africa\n2003-05-21T05:00:00.000Z\nAt a popular restaurant here on the water's edge, the dinner menu offers a rare item: a vegetarian version of the traditional West African groundnut stew. Vegetarianism is anathema in this part of the world. But adjustments have had to be made in Sierra Leone because the world is here.\nTens of thousands of foreigners have come to help restore peace in this tiny West African country. Pakistani peacekeepers patrol the streets. Norwegians are putting up houses for amputees (the most compelling casualties of Sierra Leone's decade-long war). The Bangladeshis have built a ''friendship school.''\nWar criminals are to be tried in a new courthouse, under construction now, courtesy of foreign donors. Already, 17,000 United Nations peacekeepers, the largest such force in the world, have disarmed the warlords and drug-addled child soldiers who carried on this country's decade-long war. Some people call this the United Nations of Sierra Leone.\nToday, Sierra Leone makes a strong case for international intervention. What makes it all the more remarkable -- and fragile -- is what stands next door: a portrait of neglect, an American invention called Liberia.\nThe contrast is striking. The World Food Program can no longer deliver food aid to much of Liberia because its workers keep coming under attack by armed thugs. Liberian refugees have rushed by the hundreds of thousands into neighboring countries. Liberian mercenaries have ranged across West Africa, in search of new conflicts and attendant looting opportunities.\nLiberian enemy factions -- the government of President Charles Taylor in one corner and rebels in another -- have made deadly alliances with rebel leaders and heads of state in next-door Guinea and Ivory Coast.\nThese are foul wars of revenge and greed. The misery they produce cannot be healed without ending the carnage in Liberia, analysts of the region agree.\nBut Liberia gets scant international attention. That negligence is a product of Liberia's peculiar history. The British took the lead in corralling international intervention for Sierra Leone, its former colony on this patch. The French have had 4,000 soldiers planted in Ivory Coast, its former colony. Liberia does not have a conventional colonial history. It was founded by freed American slaves in 1847; ''the love of liberty brought us here,'' the Liberian coat of arms reads.\nFor nearly 150 years, Liberia remained a virtual American colony, and during the cold war it ranked among Washington's most useful allies. The memory of that strategic alliance sits on the outskirts of the capital. It is called the V.O.A. refugee camp, named after the Voice of America radio transmitter that once stood there.\nThe United States has never recognized itself as an imperial power, let alone a colonial one. Even the title of ''occupying power'' is worn uncomfortably today in Iraq, where the now frayed term ''liberator'' has been the label of choice.\nSo America's former virtual colony seems to be nowhere near the top of Washington's priority list; in fact, not even on the Africa list.\n''The end of the cold war produced a strategic disengagement, and Liberia is Exhibit A in terms of the consequences,'' said Chester A. Crocker, the Reagan administration's point man on African affairs. ''There isn't a sense of strategic interest or a sense of historic responsibility that makes us take a more forceful stand.''\nThe International Crisis Group, a research and advocacy organization, calls Liberia ''the eye of the regional storm.'' The United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Ruud Lubbers, on a swing through the region last week, called it the ''epicenter'' of the human crisis in West Africa. Mr. Lubbers described Liberia's predicament as an emblem of the world's inattention to the continent. ''It is an icon of the problem,'' Mr. Lubbers said of Liberia, ''the violence, the gross negligence of the international community.''\nThe United States has been reluctant to endorse peacekeeping missions in Africa. But it has quietly supported the Sierra Leone war crimes court, which is investigating the role of the Liberian president in the conflict and suggests that it may indict him.\nThe United States also gives military aid to Guinea, an ally of the rebel group now gunning for control of the Liberian capital. Rebels are said to control some 60 percent of Liberian territory. Fighting continues unabated.\nThe Liberian war's backdrop is international neglect. The relationship between Africa and the outside world has almost always been an unhappy one. A little more than 100 years ago, in the scramble for Africa, as it was called, the European powers sat down together to bargain and parcel out the continent's riches.\nToday, a mixture of self-interest and historic ties compels the British and French to re-engage in their former colonies. Perhaps they and the other traditional power in West Africa, the United States, should follow the lead of the 19th-century imperialists and sit down to bargain again. Only this time the object should not be to divide the spoils but to bring a measure of peace to this ravaged place.\nThe Security Council was scheduled to send a mission to the region last week, but other matters, namely the debate over sanctions on Iraq, detained them. The mission has been postponed for next month, or the month after."}, {"text": "Pakistani and Saudi Men Find Long Lines for Registration\n2003-03-22T05:00:00.000Z\nIt was the final day for Pakistani and Saudi men in the United States to register with immigration authorities, and hundreds went to 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan yesterday displaying a grim resignation.\nThere, at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building, they stood in long lines, crowded into nondescript waiting rooms, produced documents, filled out questionnaires, answered questions and had their pictures and fingerprints taken.\n''We don't think there is anything wrong with this,'' said Sheraz Malik, 28, who came to register along with his three younger brothers; all have lived in the United States since they were children.\n''We understand that this is necessary for security,'' Mr. Malik said. ''I'm just afraid of being detained and sent back to Pakistan.''\nIt was a scene that has been playing out for months across the country under a federal policy that requires male noncitizens 16 and older who come from certain Arab and Muslim countries to register with immigration authorities.\nThe countries have been divided into four groups; Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were in the third.\nMen from the last group of countries -- Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan and Kuwait -- must register by April 25.\nThe men, many arriving yesterday with wives, friends or lawyers to help them through the long process, are required to provide the names and addresses of parents and American contacts, information about when and where they entered the country and their status, and various forms of identification.\nAccording to Mark Thorn, the New York spokesman for the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles immigrant benefits, 101,589 people have complied with the requirements nationwide. Of those, 1,854 are being temporarily detained and 87 are in custody, though most of those are eligible to be released on bond.\nThe bureau could not provide local statistics, but the stories of overnight detentions and deportation proceedings are so frightening that many men are not registering, immigrants' advocates and lawyers said. Some have been leaving the country while others are simply remaining here.\nMohsin Mushtaq, a 19-year-old high school student, said he arrived to register about 6 a.m. on Tuesday and did not have his initial screening until that evening.\nMr. Mushtaq, who said his visitor's visa had expired, was then taken to an investigations unit on the 10th floor and held in a locked room with about 35 other men until the next evening.\nThey were given little to eat, and their first offering contained meat that the men could not eat because they are Muslim, Mr. Mushtaq said; they could not call their families and they were often treated rudely, he said. Some of the men broke down in tears.\n''I just want to be able to stay and study,'' he said. ''It was like a jail. Why they have to do that to us, because we're Muslim or we're Pakistani? It was just like we were animals.''\nImmigration lawyers also say that many of the men being questioned are heads of households and that it is unclear what will happen to their families if they are deported.\n''I'm scared,'' said Mr. Malik's wife, Denise, an American citizen who is 22 years old and five months pregnant. She was trying to put on a brave face for her husband, who had abandoned his effort to obtain a green card because of a conflict with his father, now in Pakistan.\nStill, Mrs. Malik said, ''He goes to Pakistan and my world's going to crumble.''"}, {"text": "Does Democracy Avert Famine?\n2003-03-01T05:00:00.000Z\nFew scholars have left more of a mark on the field of development economics than Amartya Sen.\nThe winner of the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, Mr. Sen has changed the way economists think about such issues as collective decision-making, welfare economics and measuring poverty. He has pioneered the use of economic tools to highlight gender inequality, and he helped the United Nations devise its Human Development Index -- today the most widely used measure of how well nations meet basic social needs.\nMore than anything, though, Mr. Sen is known for his work on famine. Just as Adam Smith is associated with the phrase ''invisible hand'' and Joseph Schumpeter with ''creative destruction,'' Mr. Sen is famous for his assertion that famines do not occur in democracies. ''No famine has ever taken place in the history of the world in a functioning democracy,'' he wrote in ''Democracy as Freedom'' (Anchor, 1999). This, he explained, is because democratic governments ''have to win elections and face public criticism, and have strong incentive to undertake measures to avert famines and other catastrophes.'' This proposition, advanced in a host of books and articles, has shaped the thinking of a generation of policy makers, scholars and relief workers who deal with famine.\nNow, however, in India, the main focus of Mr. Sen's research, there are growing reports of starvation. In drought-ravaged states like Rajasthan in the west and Orissa in the east, many families have been reduced to eating bark and grass to stay alive. Already thousands may have died. This is occurring against a backdrop of endemic hunger and malnutrition. About 350 million of India's one billion people go to bed hungry every night, and half of all Indian children are malnourished. Meanwhile, the country is awash in grain, with the government sitting on a surplus of more than 50 million tons. Such want amid such plenty has generated public protests, critical editorials and an appeal to India's Supreme Court to force the government to use its surpluses to feed the hungry.\nAll of which has raised new questions about Mr. Sen's famous thesis. In an article critical of him in The Observer of London last summer, Vandana Shiva, an ecological activist in India, wrote that while it is true that famine disappeared in India in 1947, with independence and elections, it is ''making a comeback.'' The problem, she added in an interview, ''has not yet reached the scale seen in the Horn of Africa,'' but if nothing is done, ''in three or four years India could be in the same straits.''\nTo Mr. Sen, though, it is not the thesis that needs revision but the popular understanding of it. Yes, famines do not occur in democracies, he said in a phone interview, but ''it would be a misapprehension to believe that democracy solves the problem of hunger.'' Mr. Sen, who is the master of Trinity College at Cambridge University, said his writings on famine frequently noted the problems India has had in feeding its people, and he was baffled by the amount of attention his comments about famine and democracy had received. The Nobel committee, in awarding its prize, did not even mention this aspect of his work, he said, adding, however, that many newspapers had seized on it and misrepresented it.\nMr. Sen's views about famine and hunger have recently been put to the test by Dan Banik, an Indian-born political scientist at the University of Oslo. Mr. Banik has spent much of the last several years in India, studying the parched, desperate Kalahandi region of Orissa. In that area alone, Mr. Banik said by phone from India, he found 300 starvation deaths in six months. And they are hardly unique. ''I have collected newspaper reports on starvation for six years in Indian newspapers,'' he said, ''and there's not a state where it hasn't happened. Starvation is widespread in India.''\nHe quickly added, however, that the toll was nowhere near the hundreds of thousands that constitute a famine. In fact, Mr. Sen's theory about famines not occurring in democracies ''applies rather well to India,'' he said. ''There has not been a large-scale loss of life since 1947.'' At the same time, he said, ''there have been many incidents of large-scale food crises that, while not resulting in actual famines, have led to many, many deaths.''\nWhile the Indian bureaucracy responds well to highly visible crises like famine threats, Mr. Banik observed, starvation ''occurs in isolated areas and so isn't very visible.'' India has done an even poorer job of addressing the problem of chronic malnutrition, he said. ''It's so shocking,'' Mr. Banik added. ''There's so much food in the country, yet people are starving.''\nIndia's huge food stocks reflect the power of the farm lobby. It has pressed the government to buy grain at ever higher prices, making bread and other staples more and more expensive. To help the hungry, the government has a national network of ration shops, but they have been undermined by widespread corruption and distribution bottlenecks. What's more, the government, under pressure from the World Bank and other institutions, has reduced its once-generous food subsidies.\nOn a visit to New Delhi in early January, Mr. Sen participated in a forum to publicize the recent starvation deaths and to promote a new ''right to food'' movement. While such events show how democracies can provide opportunities for ''public agitation'' to redress injustices, Mr. Sen said, they also highlight how poorly India has done in meeting basic social needs. ''We must distinguish between the role of democracy in preventing famine and the comparative ineffectiveness of democracy in preventing regular undernourishment,'' he observed.\nThat Mr. Sen would end up as the foremost thinker on this subject is somewhat surprising, for he initially paid little attention to the link between hunger and democracy. When the International Labor Organization asked him to look into the causes of famines in the mid-1970's, Mr. Sen decided to focus on the Great Bengal Famine of 1943, in which as many as three million people died. As a 9-year-old boy in a privileged Bengal family, he had seen the suffering first hand. At the time of his research, it was widely assumed that famines were caused by sudden food shortages. Examining records, however, Mr. Sen found that food production in Bengal had not declined. Rather, food prices had soared while farm wages had sagged, making it hard for rural workers to buy food.\nExamining more recent famines in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, Mr. Sen found that they, too, were caused not by food shortages but by lagging rural incomes. In his landmark ''Poverty and Famines'' (1981), he argued that most famines could be readily prevented by mounting public works projects for those most in peril.\nThat book did not consider the role of democracy. Soon after it appeared, however, Mr. Sen began hearing reports about the Chinese famine of 1958 to 1961. The full dimensions of that calamity had remained hidden from the outside world, but after Mao's death it became clear that tens of millions had died. To Mr. Sen the reason seemed clear: the absence of a free press and opposition parties meant there was no one to sound the alarm. By contrast, India had been free of famine since independence. In a 1982 article for The New York Review of Books, Mr. Sen argued that even a fraction of the Chinese death toll ''would have immediately caused a storm in the newspapers and a turmoil in the Indian parliament, and the ruling government would almost certainly have had to resign.''\nThe question of food and starvation, he wrote, could not be divorced from ''the issue of liberties, of newspapers and ultimately of democracy.'' Since then, though, Mr. Sen has frequently referred to India's failures in combating everyday hunger. In his book ''Hunger and Public Action'' (1989), Mr. Sen (along with the co-author, Jean Dr\u00e8ze) noted that nearly four million people die prematurely in India every year from malnutrition and related problems. That's more than the number who perished during the entire Bengal famine.\nIt is Mr. Sen's writings on democracy, not famine, that have troubled some scholars. Throughout his prolific career, the 69-year-old economist has been very bullish on democracy. In ''Development as Freedom,'' for instance, he wrote that ''developing and strengthening a democratic system is an essential component of the process of development.'' The book had little to say about the high rates of malnutrition, illiteracy and infant mortality that persist in India and many other democracies, and how they can be overcome.\nThis has led some to conclude that Mr. Sen is na\u00efve about how democracies work in the real world. ''Democracies are often run by ethnically based groups prepared to do terrible things to other ethnic groups,'' said Frances Stewart, a professor of development economics at Oxford University. ''Or they can be very corrupt, dominated by elites.'' She added: ''Capitalist, democratic states put the emphasis on the private sector, which doesn't always deliver on social goods. The free press is good on major disasters like classic famines, but it tolerates chronic hunger as much as anyone else.'' To be fully represented, she said, the poor need institutions like trade unions and political parties that speak for them.\nStephen Devereux, an economist at the Institute of Development Studies at Sussex University who specializes in food security in Africa, faulted Mr. Sen for not dealing with the ''big political questions.'' ''For him,'' he said, ''public action consists of public works programs -- limited transfers to the poor to help them through a crisis. It's important to look more at fundamental reforms, like land reform.'' Currently, Mr. Devereux said, more than a half-dozen countries in Africa face a famine threat, including such democracies as Ethiopia.\nThere, he said, conditions are ''as bad as in 1984,'' when famine deaths were estimated at one million. Ethiopia was then ruled by a Marxist dictator. Today it is democratically governed, but as many as six million people remain dependent on food aid from abroad. ''Having a free press and a democratic process is important for all kinds of reasons,'' Mr. Devereux noted, ''but that doesn't address poverty and the conditions that lead to famine.'' With the spread of laissez-faire economic policies, he added, governments have less ability to ''step in and provide food security.''\nOther scholars, however, say that government itself is the problem. T. N. Srinivasan, a professor of economics at Yale University, says that political freedoms, to work, need to be complemented by economic freedoms. Mr. Sen, he said, ''doesn't emphasize enough the importance of free markets, trade and access to world markets and capital.'' The reason authoritarian China has grown more rapidly than democratic India, he said, is its embrace of economic liberalization. Mr. Sen, he added, ''seems to have a much dimmer view of globalization than people like me, who see open markets as the best opportunity of the last century'' for countries to grow and develop.\nWhat unites Mr. Sen's liberal and conservative critics is their belief that democracy, while desirable, is no cure-all for problems like hunger and illiteracy. In fact, in his more recent writings, Mr. Sen has paid more attention to the shortcomings of democracy and how they can be addressed. The key, he said, is not to jettison democracy but to find ways of making it work better for society's underdogs."}, {"text": "A Biennale That Puts Indonesia On the Map\n2003-09-17T05:00:00.000Z\nDjie Tjianan, a prominent collector of contemporary Indonesian art, and Jim Supangkat, a curator, wondered: If Indonesian art was so alluring to collectors in Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo, why not show the best at home?\nSo they created a biennale here, and after an overflow opening night this month and guests from around the region, they knew they were on to something.\nMr. Tjianan, who splits his time between Indonesia and the United States, runs a gallery, C P Artspace, in Washington that challenges the notion of the Western domination of international art. Why not, he asked himself, continue that theme in Jakarta?\nThe biennale, running through Oct. 3, emphasizes Indonesian artists, but displays works by artists from all over Asia (several top Chinese artists are represented) and to a lesser extent from elsewhere, including the United States and the Netherlands, the former colonial power here.\nThe C P Open Biennale is at the usually rundown National Gallery, which Mr. Tjianan spruced up with repainted white walls and cleaned floors. The show is strongest in painting, sculpture and drawing, although there are some video pieces and a smattering of digital art. Mr. Tjianan and Mr. Supangkat make no apologies.\n''Even the new biennale in Shanghai and Bangladesh tend to show developments in Europe and the United States,'' said Mr. Supangkat, who chose the show's 128 featured artists from 700 entries. ''We wanted to do something different.''\nMr. Tjianan, 42, happily surveyed a Saturday crowd that had chosen the freshly opened biennale over the usual outing to one of this city's many shopping malls. ''The international art world will probably see this as obsolete, outdated,'' he said of the emphasis on painting and sculpture. ''We're proposing a new, old model.''\nBut the works look far from old.\nCenter stage goes to one of Indonesia's best known artists, Heri Dono, who was selected for the Venice Biennale this year. Mr. Supangkat chose Mr. Dono's giant cardboard cutout of a horse and strung it from the ceiling, where it greets visitors entering the main gallery. Called ''Trojan Horse,'' this floor-to-ceiling work, with its comic shape, sets an upbeat tone for the show.\nIn the next few rooms Mr. Supangkat juxtaposes works that represent some of the biennale's internal ideas. One theme singled out by Mr. Supangkat is what he calls ''localness reconsidered'': works that use craft techniques or hark back to traditional forms. Somewhat surprising, he has placed a cluster of F. Widayanto's decorative ceramic sculptures representative of traditional Indonesian female figures next to a contemporary mixed-media work by Mella Jaarsma. Ms. Jaarsma, who recently has begun exploring the military and its dominance in life here, devised a piece that places a human model wearing a canvas military-style uniform beside a canvas tent kitted out with toothpaste, soap and other needs of a refugee.\nMany proposals submitted for the biennale were unexecuted ideas. ''In many cases we just encouraged the artist to go ahead,'' Mr. Supangkat said. Some works turned out to be less successful than expected, he said, but for the most part his confidence in the wide array of Indonesian artists -- most of whose work he knows well -- has paid off. He was particularly pleased with some of the younger artists.\nYuli Prayitno, 29, promised in his proposal to blend found objects with wood. His finished work has become a conversation piece: it is a startlingly simple sculpture of a suspended enamelware teapot that pours beautifully finished blond wood into an enamelware mug.\nAnother work drawing attention comes from Yani M. Sastranegara, best known for her sculptures based on nature. This time she used hundreds of gray fiber stones hung individually from the ceiling by narrow thread, hovering over the water in a way that gives a sense of order to nature's disorder.\nMr. Tjianan said he was gratified that he could lure three Chinese artists, as well as Gu Wenda, a Chinese-born artist living in Brooklyn, to the show. Mr. Gu, who has made site-specific installations around the motif of the United Nations in New York, San Francisco and in Europe, was easy to persuade. ''We went to New York and he felt the same way we do, that Asian things should be more highly regarded in the international art world,'' Mr. Tjianan said.\nFor the Jakarta show Mr. Gu came to install a piece made from more than 1,000 yards of human hair coiled on a gallery floor. Labels of the many countries where the Chinese diaspora live were scattered through the hair.\nFrom Beijing, Fang Lijun, a member of the school of Cynical Realism that formed after 1989, sent two paintings showing the anomie of daily life. One canvas is centered on a nearly photo-perfect child's chubby hand, presumably from China's spoiled middle class, stretching into a blue infinity of sky, cloud and rose petals. The other shows a male, stretched out in a pool, apparently about to drown as pale blue water washes over him, leaving only his face above the surface.\nAs a weekend throng continued to swell, Mr. Tjianan seemed a little surprised. A real estate developer who was sent by his Indonesian family to expand the business into the United States, Mr. Tjianan said he found his true calling in the art world. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a management degree but exercised his passion for art by opening his Washington gallery three years ago.\n''I firmly believe that Indonesian art is good,'' he said. ''What is lacking is the way we present the art to the world. I believe by packaging the art, the art will get more respect.''\nSo he considered it a coup that the biennale's opening was attended by Akira Tatehata, a professor and curator at Tama Art University in Tokyo; Kuroda Raiji, the chief curator at the Fukuoka Asian Art Museum in Japan; and Kwok Kian Chow, the curator at the Singapore Art Museum.\nAlso pleasing was the turnout of featured artists at the opening night, a fairly rare event at most biennales. The artists' friends came, too, some of whom had spent days helping install works.\n''This is almost like a relief,'' Mr. Tjianan said. ''It means: 'Hey, we can do this. Hey, we're pretty good.' ''"}, {"text": "Even With Glut, Shrimp Farmers Want Still More and Others Balk\n2003-05-07T05:00:00.000Z\nHolding a plate of freshly cooked shrimp, Wichan Maungchanburi, a 41-year-old shrimp farmer, asked what price they would fetch in the United States.\n''I cannot sell these here,'' he said gruffly, sitting in front of his simple stone house in southern Thailand. ''We have too many shrimp in Thailand. And now they say these are too small. These are the ones they rejected.''\nIt is not just Thailand; there are simply too many shrimp worldwide.\nAfter decades of growth brought about by the creation of giant, man-made shrimp ponds throughout Asia, and with other countries stepping up production, prices have collapsed. On top of that, the industry faces criticism from environmentalists for clearing forests and destroying wetlands, and American fishermen accuse Asian producers of illegally dumping shrimp below cost.\nOne industry response to the glut is a prediction that with modern production methods and costs falling, shrimp consumption will soar. But that optimism is tempered by diseases that have invaded ponds in some areas.\nNo company feels these pressures more than the Charoen Pokphand Group, the world's largest exporter of frozen shrimp.\nIn good times, the Bangkok-based CP Group, as it is known, racked up fat profits and fed America's growing appetite for shrimp. Now it is under attack on many fronts. For one thing, environmentalists blame it for destroying wetlands.\nWith its profits slumping, the value of the company's shrimp exports plummeted 25 percent last year. Wholesale shrimp prices are down nearly 50 percent over the past few years, to about $5 a pound.\n''This is a very challenging time for them,'' said Komsun Suksumrun, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in Bangkok.\nIn response, the CP Group is trying to move up the value chain, analysts say, by marketing ready-to-eat shrimp dishes and strengthening its more profitable shrimp feed business.\nYet problems remain. CP Group executives say that demand began to slide after Sept. 11, 2001.\nThe company is being hurt by tighter European Union restrictions on antibiotic use. Earlier this year, the E.U. rejected some Thai shrimp after tests showed residue of banned antibiotics.\nIt also faces stiffer competition from China and Latin America, where shrimp production is booming. Last year, China became the world's largest shrimp producer, a title Thailand had held since 1993. And while demand continues to grow in the West, the pace has slowed.\n''There's just too much shrimp out there,'' says Charles Woodhouse, a columnist at Fish Farming International. World shrimp farm production jumped to about 1.5 million metric tons in 2002, up from about 600,000 in 1990, according to Shrimp News International.\nAngered by the drop in prices, American shrimp fishermen along the Gulf Coast are considering an antidumping lawsuit.\n''It seems the shrimp are coming in here at a faster pace than they can be consumed,'' says Eddie Gordon, president of the Southern Shrimp Alliance, a trade group in Louisiana.\nMeanwhile, the CP Group, to compete with lower-cost producers in China and Vietnam, is moving some shrimp farming production to India, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia. Among other things, experts say the moves could help the company avoid the effects of viral diseases that have ravaged parts of Thailand in recent years.\nHere in the Mae Klong region south of Bangkok, once a thriving shrimp-growing area, abandoned farms line the small roads off the highway. Weeds cover old footpaths, and former shrimp ponds are now hollow pits of dried, cracked earth.\nResidents say many farmers have returned to the salt-drying industry that dominated the region before people learned how to dig giant holes and fill them with thousands of gallons of South China Sea water to create shrimp ponds.\nSurviving farmers say they work harder each year only to harvest fewer shrimp. ''These are real tough times,'' said Sopun Kalljain, a shrimp farmer in the southern town of Lampo.\nEven though Thai shrimp production reached record levels last year, experts say many regions are being slowed by disease. Some fear the industry could be destroyed by the kinds of viruses that wiped out the shrimp industry in Taiwan in the late 1980's.\nAs a solution, many Thai farmers are abandoning the traditional black tiger shrimp and experimenting with white shrimp, a variety that costs less to produce and has been bred to be immune to certain diseases.\nTo bolster production and lock out carriers of disease, the CP Group is also experimenting with new farming techniques. In Yisarn, a village 19 miles south of Mahachai, it has developed indoor shrimp ponds with temperature and water-quality controls.\n''This is our future,'' said Sujit Kaewchum, general manager of the Yisarn research center. ''Here we can harvest five times a year rather than two times. And indoors we can get more consistency, more production.''\nIndoor ponds could also help eliminate some of the environmental problems that have long plagued the industry, experts say. Since the 1960's, environmentalists have criticized shrimp producers for clearing mangrove forests and destroying wetlands to build shrimp ponds.\n''This is basically a cut-and-kill system,'' said Isabel de la Torre, an environmentalist working for the Industrial Shrimp Action Network, an advocacy group. ''They dig up the land, create dikes, use chemicals and kill everything off. Then, when they're done, they leave and move up and down the coast, looking for a new spot.''\nEven today, World Heritage sites in Bangladesh and the Philippines, meant to be preserves, are being cleared of mangrove trees to create ponds, environmentalists say.\nSome industry officials concede that the creation of giant ponds -- often 100,000 square feet and five feet deep -- have resulted in environmental ruin. But they insist recent shrimp farm development has been more environmentally friendly.\n''We're doing a lot better job managing the growth,'' said George Chamberlain, president of the Global Aquaculture Alliance, an industry group. Industry officials believe, however, that consumption growth will soon recover and that new techniques will be needed to produce even more shrimp. Poor farmers in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam are now clearing forests and digging deep, wide holes for new ponds.\nSome experts say that because of cheap labor and new techniques, the cost of producing shrimp is plummeting. ''They're making it at an amazingly low price and will eventually put all commercial fishermen out of business,'' said Bob Rosenberry, editor of Shrimp News International.\nChingchai Lohawatanakul, chief executive of Charoen Pokphand Foods, the flagship unit of the CP Group, says that as prices fall, consumption will grow even more. Shrimp, he said, will no longer be seen as a luxury item, but will take its place as a staple, like beef, chicken and pork.\n''Our competitor is not India or Vietnam,'' Mr. Lohawatanakul said. ''Our competitor is pork.''\nHow will the world produce what some industry officials expect to be 10 times more shrimp to meet the growing demand over the next 20 years? On what land?\nNo one knows. But CP is counting on it."}, {"text": "What Did You Do During the African Holocaust?\n2003-05-27T05:00:00.000Z\nThis charming nation was hailed in the 1990's as one of Africa's brightest hopes, a symbol of an African renaissance. Its economy boomed, and Hillary Clinton dropped by.\nIt was an apt symbol of that evanescent renaissance, for Eritrea is now turning into a thuggish little dictatorship. It is imprisoning evangelical Christians, it jails more journalists than any other country on the continent, and the regime that once empowered women now rapes them.\nThe private sector has been regulated mostly out of existence, and aid groups are given a cold shoulder. The leader who liberated his people a decade ago is now starving them.\nAnd in the same way, much of Africa has been caught in a tailspin. While our attention is diverted by Iraq, famine is looming over 40 million people on the continent, West Africa seems caught in an expanding series of civil wars, and much of Central Africa has been a catastrophe for up to a decade.\nIn Congo, in which I've had a special interest ever since Tutsi rebels chased me through the jungle there for several days in 1997, 3.3 million people have died because of warfare there in the last five years, according to a study by the International Rescue Committee. That's half a Holocaust in a single country.\nOur children and grandchildren may fairly ask, ''So, what did you do during the African holocaust?''\nSome African nations, like Uganda, Mauritius, Ghana and Mozambique, are booming; they show that African countries can thrive. But the failures outnumber the successes: child mortality rose in the 1990's in Kenya, Malawi and Zambia; primary school enrollments dropped in Cameroon, Lesotho, Mozambique and Tanzania; the number of malnourished children is growing across the continent.\n''We are losing the battle against hunger,'' warns James Morris, the head of the World Food Program.\nSo it's time to rethink this continent. Africa itself has largely failed, and Western policies toward it have mostly failed as well.\nEritrea is a window into what went wrong. To be sure, even now it is an alluring country with a gentle people. President Isaias Afwerki avoids a personality cult; instead of a statue of him, the central square has a gargantuan pair of sandals, which symbolize the liberation struggle.\nBut Mr. Afwerki fought a senseless border war with Ethiopia beginning in 1998, and now an estimated half the budget goes to the military. The port is quiet because there is no trade with Ethiopia; most of the working-age population has been drafted into National Service, so families have no one to till the ground or earn a salary. A million Eritreans are at risk of famine.\nThere are no simple solutions to Africa's problems, but there are some good ideas around:\n*Western powers could guarantee the security of African governments that commit themselves to democracy. This idea, which would attract more investment for democracies, is detailed in a fine new book, ''Africa's Stalled Development.''\n*Liberals and conservatives feud over plenty, but they generally agree on the need for widespread debt forgiveness. Africa is asphyxiated by its $217 billion foreign debt.\n*Think trade, more than aid. Incentives to build cheap factories in Senegal or Ethiopia could perhaps replicate Bangladesh's success with clothing exports.\n*We should phase out socialist agricultural policies in Europe and America. Western farm subsidies cost poor countries some $50 billion in lost agricultural exports. The best way for the U.S. to help a struggling democratic country like Mali would be to stop lavishing $2 billion a year in tax dollars on U.S. cotton farmers (whose average net worth is $800,000) so Malian peasants can produce for the world's markets.\nWould any of this work? I don't know. But Africa is broken, and it needs high-level attention to help it fix itself. President Bush's $15 billion AIDS initiative was an important step, and it proved surprisingly popular around the United States.\nSo perhaps there is even a political payoff in compassion for Africa, and this is also an area where we can work with Europe and rebuild trust, beginning at next week's G-8 summit. Mr. Bush's planned trip to Africa this year would be the perfect start for a major U.S.-led effort to help Africa find its footing -- and nothing we could do in coming years would save so many millions of lives."}, {"text": "If You're Thinking of Living In/Jamaica Hills; Tranquil Haven for Many Ethnic Groups\n2003-06-08T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE centerpiece of Jamaica Hills is the 9.16-acre Captain Tilly Park on Gothic Drive, a quiet oasis of woodlands and walkways surrounding a large pond known as Goose Pond. Waterfowl make their home here, and a tiny island wildlife refuge gives the pond a bucolic air.\nA similar tranquillity pervades this leafy Queens neighborhood of mostly one- and two-family detached houses that encompasses about 65 blocks stretching from Parsons Boulevard to Home Lawn Street and from Grand Central Parkway to Hillside Avenue. The community has several apartment buildings, including co-ops, but most are found along major thoroughfares rather than on side streets.\nAlthough the local civic organization asserts that the neighborhood's name is singular, as does Jeff Gottlieb, president of the Central Queens Historical Society, it is more commonly known as Jamaica Hills.\n''It's a very quiet neighborhood with a lot of different ethnic groups, who get along,'' said Devi Sookram, who on a recent day was planting petunias in front of the five-bedroom, two-family house on Normal Road that she shares with her husband, Rudy, their two sons and other family members.\nMrs. Sookram moved here five years ago. She comes from Guyana, South America, but many of the neighborhood's families are from Pakistan, Bangladesh and other South Asian countries. They come here to find a quiet way of life close to public transportation and good schools.\nMany also come to be close to the Jamaica Muslim Center at 85-37 168th Street near Gothic Drive. ''When I came here in 1990, there were very few Bangladeshi families here,'' said Dilafroz Ahmed, a travel agent, who lives with her husband, Mustaque, a pharmacist, and their two daughters in a three-bedroom colonial on Highland Avenue. ''I wanted a convenient neighborhood with good schools. Now many people are moving here because of the mosque.''\nThe Muslim Center was founded in 1981 and now has 1,500 to 2,000 members, said Mohammad Billah, its president. It occupies a recently completed 20,000-square-foot two-story building with a mosque on the first floor that can accommodate up to 2,000 worshipers. On the second floor, a 150-student elementary school for kindergarten through Grade 5 is to open in the fall.\nHousing demand from Muslim families and other newcomers has brought an upward pressure on prices. ''Jamaica Hills is definitely a move-up area,'' usually not for first-time buyers, said Gregory Scotidas, an associate broker with the Century 21 Milestone real estate agency in Jamaica. House prices generally start at $380,000 to $400,000 for a three-bedroom single-family house with a basement and a garage on a 30-foot-by-100-foot lot, he said. Larger houses on larger lots sell for about $500,000, he added.\nChris Kennedy, a sales representative with First Choice Real Estate in Fresh Meadows, said the median price of a house is now $450,000 compared with $380,000 a year ago. He pointed to a gracious 100-year two-family colonial on 169th Street that he sold in March 2002 for $395,000. The same house today would probably sell for $550,000, Mr. Kennedy said.\nLongtime residents say they have no problems with the ethnic changes that began in the 1970's. ''When we bought our house here in 1965, the real estate broker told us the neighborhood would stay stable for about 10 years,'' said Mildred Sporn, whose husband, Irving, is taking over as the president of the 29-year-old Jamaica Hill Community Association this month. ''The community definitely has not deteriorated since then. It is very vital and vibrant and people keep up their homes.''\nHowever, resentment has been building among many residents over physical changes in the neighborhood. Rising prices have brought an influx of developers who are taking advantage of local zoning to create new multifamily dwellings to replace single-family houses. About 70 percent of the neighborhood has zoning that allows three-story attached buildings, and any house on large property is in danger of being demolished. In its stead can go two or more three-family houses that each sell for $700,000 and up. In some cases, the existing house remains and a side yard is developed.\n''Currently, I can count 14 single-family houses that have been demolished,'' said Deborah Ayala, the vice president of the community association, who lives on a block with two construction sites. Additionally, larger homes are being converted to illegal rooming houses, she said. ''Everyone is in an uproar,'' she said. ''The main issue is overcrowding and trying to preserve the character of our neighborhood.''\nTHE civic group is working with city planners and elected officials on a rezoning plan that would make new development more compatible with the existing area. Neighborhood volunteers have begun conducting a survey that will detail the characteristics of each house on each block.Public hearings on the rezoning will be part of the lengthy application process.\n''The neighborhood has a certain character and a certain history, and the zoning is very different from that,'' said City Councilman James F. Gennaro. But all voices have to be heard, he stressed. ''You have new people moving in who have their hearts set on living in a single-family neighborhood, and others who are looking for more affordable housing, so for them one unit in a multiple family house is fine.''\nFor transportation to Manhattan, there is subway service on Hillside Avenue and a Long Island Rail Road station at Sutphin Boulevard and Archer Avenue. Bus service along 164th Street and other major cross streets provides easy access to both. Drivers can take the Grand Central Parkway, the community's northerly boundary.\nA strong attraction in the neighborhood is the highly regarded P.S. 131 on 172 Street and 84th Avenue. The school, which offers kindergarten through Grade 5, is a mosaic of the community. Its approximately 800 children represent 100 nationalities and speak 40 languages, said the principal, Randolph A. Ford. ''These families consider education truly, truly important as it relates to their children's future, so they are very supportive of our school,'' he said.\nThe school consistently scores well on state and city reading and math tests, with 77.3 percent of the fourth graders reading at or above grade level in 2002 and 71.4 percent performing that well in math.\nFrom P.S. 131, children go on to Middle School 216 in Fresh Meadows, part of District 26, one of the best school districts in the city. On Grade 8 reading tests, 62.8 percent of children were at or above grade, and 56.4 percent achieved those levels in math.\nMost continue on to Francis Lewis High School in Fresh Meadows rather than to the local Jamaica High School on Gothic Drive or to the Thomas A. Edison Vocational and Technical School on 84th Avenue.\nFrancis Lewis is ranked among the Top 10 city high schools. On state Regents exams 62.2 percent of the students scored at least 65 in English and 72.3 percent met that standard in math. Sixty-eight percent of the graduates go on to four-year colleges and 10.6 percent go on to two-year schools.\nChildren in the western section of the community initially attend P.S. 182 at 90-36 150 Street in Jamaica, an early childhood center offering kindergarten through Grade 2. From there they proceed to P.S. 86 at 87-41 Parsons Boulevard for Grades 3 to 6. In 2002, 49.1 percent of Grade 4 children scored at or above grade level in English and 55 percent reached that level in math.\nFrom P.S. 86 most children continue on to Junior High School 217 at 85-05 144 Street in Briarwood for Grades 6 to 8. In Grade 8, 26.3 percent of children were at grade level in reading and 31.9 percent in math.\nMost of J.H.S. 217 graduates go on to Hillcrest High School at 160-05 Highland Avenue. The school was recognized three years ago as a New York State Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. Last year, 47 percent of its students achieved grades of 65 or higher in English on Regents exams, and 40.6 percent in math. Of its graduates last year , 41.9 percent went on to four years and 21.1 percent to two-year programs.\nJamaica Hills at one time attracted the very wealthy because its high hills had good views and benefited from refreshing breezes, said Mr. Gottlieb of the local historical society. Highland Avenue, for example, had a number of imposing mansions. Jamaica Hills ''started out as an elite area,'' he said. ''It then became middle class and it is still middle class, with well-kept housing.''\nNone of the early mansions have survived. With easier access to Manhattan by public transportation -- the railroad station on Sutphin Boulevard opened in 1913 -- large estates began giving way to housing developments in the 1920's and 1930's. Jamaica High School, itself an imposing building, was completed in 1927 on the site of one of the estates, called the Clark House.\nLOCAL houses of worship often had an influence on who settled in the area. Jewish families arrived in the 1930's with the construction of nearby synagogues. A large influx of Greek families came in the 1960's because of the St. Demetrious Greek Orthodox Church on 152nd Street just west of Parsons Boulevard, which opened in 1963.\nIn the last decade, followers of Sri Chinmoy, an Indian spiritual leader who lives in neighboring Briarwood, have moved in. Residents say sect members are good neighbors because they are quiet and law-abiding. In general, residents say, crime is not a concern here though some homeowners say that students attending Jamaica High School and the Thomas A. Edison school litter and create noise.\nAlthough there are few shopping opportunities within the community, thriving commercial areas featuring ethnic grocery stores and restaurants can be found along Parsons Boulevard and Hillside Avenue. A Met Food Market on Parsons and a C-Town on Hillside provide grocery shopping.\nIn addition to the Captain Tilly Park, named for George H. Tilly, the son of a prominent local family who was killed fighting in the Philippines in 1899, the community has the four-acre Joseph Austin Playground at 164th Place and 84th Avenue with a baseball field, basketball and handball courts, and a children's playground.\nA notable baseball player who never made it to the major leagues used to hang out there. Mario M. Cuomo played for the late Joseph Austin, a volunteer coach for local youth, for whom the playground is named. Mr. Cuomo went on to play baseball at St. John's University, just north of the neighborhood, and later in the Pittsburgh Pirates minor-league system before quitting the game for a political career that led him to become governor of New York."}, {"text": "Postwar rebuilding: Pick the UN's best for a wider Iraq role\n2003-11-13T05:00:00.000Z\nDepending on whom you talk to, the United Nations is either an obstacle to more effective security and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, or an opportunity to advance precisely these goals.\nAdherents of the view that the United Nations is an obstacle cite its propensity for dilatory political wrangling, semantic hairsplitting, and diplomatic horse-trading \u2014 all much in evidence in the two months required for the United States to obtain Security Council approval on Oct. 16 of an artfully-worded resolution endorsing an accelerated process of security, reconstruction, and movement toward a sovereign Iraqi state.\nLike other UN endeavors, this one involved U.S. negotiations not only with the four other veto-wielding permanent Security Council members, but also with the 10 rotating members who, in turn, engaged in discussions with others among the remaining 176 members of the General Assembly.\nAdherents of the view that the United Nations provides a significant and valuable opportunity present a very different perspective. They argue that the Security Council process is essential as both inducement and political cover if several countries are to be politically enabled to provide military and paramilitary forces and other assistance in Iraq. Some of these countries \u2014 including India, South Korea, Bangladesh and perhaps Russia and Indonesia \u2014 disagreed with the coalition's original decision to invade Iraq in March, and thus would need the endorsement of a Security Council resolution to change course now. So, the argument goes, the Security Council process is an opportunity to obtain the participation and assistance that the coalition seeks.\nIn the U.S. policy community, protagonists of the obstacle view are concentrated in the Pentagon, while adherents to the opportunity view populate the State Department.\nIn any event, there may be a way to resolve this dilemma \u2014 a way that can add muscle to the Security Council resolution. This alternative lies in directly expanding the role of a select few specialized UN agencies to pursue in Iraq the humanitarian and reconstruction activities in which they are competent and experienced. This approach not only complements the UN resolution of Oct. 16 but also constitutes a more effective means of inducing other countries to provide military and paramilitary forces to strengthen security in Iraq.\nThe UN family consists of nearly two dozen specialized agencies, some of which have highly creditable track records for providing effective as well as efficient services, despite the fact that others among the UN agencies are\ncumbersome, cost-ineffective bureaucracies. The high-performance agencies include the World Health Organization, the Food and Agricultural Organization, UN International Children's Emergency Fund, UN Development Program, UN Industrial Development Organization and the International Telecommunications Union.\nNow, suppose the Coalition Provisional Authority and Iraq's Governing Council, together with such other financially able governments as those of Japan, Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland, perhaps South Korea, China, and others, proposed to the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, to augment significantly the core budgets of these agencies \u2014 say, by 20 percent \u2014 to support resumption and expansion of their reconstruction efforts in Iraq. This would bolster children's vaccination and nutrition programs, technical assistance in agriculture and water supply, rehabilitation and repair of electricity and telecommunication systems, and training of telecom technicians.\nThe annual budgets of these six UN agencies amount to about $2.6 billion. So, shared among the financially able donors, the annual costs of the proposed 20 percent increased UN effort would be about $500 million \u2014 whose U.S. share would fit within, rather than add to, the $18.3 billion for Iraq's reconstruction which the Bush administration has obtained from the Congress.\nIn light of the unanimous and permissive Resolution 1511, it is likely that the secretary general would be inclined to accept this proposal, both because it would advance reconstruction in Iraq, and also would ease the UN's budgetary woes \u2014 which Annan frequently bemoans, both inside and outside UN corridors. In the wake of the Aug. 19 bombing of the UN compound in Baghdad, Annan's acceptance would no doubt be conditional on assurance of enhanced security for UN personnel\nAnticipation of such a substantial expansion of the UN presence in Iraq would constitute a more powerful de facto UN mandate than does Resolution 1511 alone, thereby facilitating provision by certain key countries of forces to enhance security on the ground.\nAcceptance of the proposal would, of course, also carry with it retention by the United Nations of its authority and responsibility to assure that the expanded role of the selected UN agencies was exercised in full conformity with established UN humanitarian and nation-building missions.\nThus, the expanded UN activities would palpably reinforce the case for additional forces to enhance security for the conduct of these activities.\nThe result would be a compelling synergy: Expansion of the UN role in Iraq's reconstruction would encourage contributions of forces to enhance security in Iraq, and the improved security would contribute to a more effective UN role in Iraq's reconstruction.\n*\nThe writer is a senior economic adviser and corporate fellow in international economics at RAND, and a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, {"text": "The World; Peacekeeping Is Back, With New Faces and Rules\n2003-07-20T05:00:00.000Z\nPEACEKEEPING is no longer a dirty word in Republican Washington. The United States is appealing to other countries to share the military burden of the occupation of Iraq, and President Bush is also signaling his willingness to send American troops to West Africa to help pacify Liberia.\nBut as peacekeeping, like bell-bottoms, comes back into fashion, it is now cut from a different fabric than before. The missions are longer, and the troops are more likely to come from developing countries.\nIn its original missions, United Nations troops were likely to be the first force on the ground, after combatants had agreed to step back.\nBut in the last four years, urgent humanitarian crises in the eastern Congo, Sierra Leone and East Timor have required new tactics. Military action is needed more quickly than a United Nations blue-helmeted force can be authorized and deployed. In these knotted conflicts, ad hoc multinational forces have taken the lead, with the United Nations' blessing, and they have been led by developed countries -- the British in Sierra Leone and the French in the Ivory Coast, for example.\nTheir tenure tends to be measured in weeks or months, while the tenure of United Nations' forces, which follow the multinational forces, tends to be measured in years. The United Nations' forces also tend to come from countries with less substantial economies, though they usually have substantial militaries. On June 30, the top contributors to peacekeeping missions were Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Ghana. Together, they contributed 13,826 troops, military observers and policeman.\nThe five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- together contributed a total of 2,097, less than all the individual countries but Ghana.\nDoes it matter? After all, the countries with the most robust economies are paying most of the bills. The United States, in the current fiscal year, is paying 27 percent of the United Nations peacekeeping budget of $2.17 billion.\n''There are countries that support peacekeeping in a big way, with a lot of money, and countries that support it with flesh and blood,'' said Jean-Marie Gu\u00e9henno, the United Nations under secretary general for peacekeeping operations, in a recent interview.\nWhile the movement in this direction has been going on since at least the mid-1990's, ''I do hope we are in a trough, not a trend,'' he said. This divide ''could create some resentment.''\nIndeed, if the military intervention is to have any meaning, it must display international backing of all sorts, said David Rudd, the president of the Canadian Institute for Strategic Studies.\n''It's all well and good to support an operation financially,'' Mr. Rudd said, but ''if you subscribe to the notion of some form of global community, this demands and equitable sharing of the risks.''\nBut Paul F. Diehl, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said that the increasing dominance of developing countries is not a major issue if their forces have the military capability and are seen as legitimate, not interlopers with their own agenda. (Which makes Nigerian forces a problematic presence when it comes to West African peacekeeping.)\nFor the major troop contributors, there are rewards -- peacekeeping dividends, if you will. Pakistanis and Indians believe ''that peacekeeping adds to the military experience,'' Mr. Gu\u00e9henno said. ''To be able to hold fire in a difficult situation requires a lot of training.''\nAnd then there is a more tangible dividend: Mr. Gu\u00e9henno's office reimburses the countries that provide troops at the rate of $1,100 per soldier a month. Often, the cost to the country providing the troops is significantly less. ''Generally, it is a substantial and generous differential,'' said Tariq Chaudhry, a peacekeeping specialist at Pakistan's mission to the United Nations. ''But that's not why we go into it. We are actually quite proud of our record, proud that we've got peacekeeping right.''\nEconomic incentives may become more explicit. In Iraq, the Pentagon is considering a plan to train private Iraqi security force to guard pipelines, government buildings and other sites. And now, most of the 500-strong police force the United States has serving in Kosovo are employees of a private firm, DynCorp.\nIndeed, the notion of privatizing peacekeeping is getting more attention. In the June and July issue of Policy Review, published by the Hoover Institution, P. W. Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote that the growing industry of private military firms could be tapped to protect humanitarian aid workers or to intervene ''whenever recalcitrant local parties break peace agreements or threaten the operation.'' They could even take over the whole operation, as a coalition of private security companies offered to do in the Congo, for $100 million or more.\nPrivatization, unsurprisingly, has many critics. In his article, Mr. Singer warned that ''outsourcing also entails turning over control of the actual provision of service. For peacekeeping, this means the troops in the field are not part of national armies, but private citizens hired off the market, working for private firms. Security is now at the mercy of any change in market costs and incentives.''\nFor his part, Mr. Gu\u00e9henno said he was worried that privatization offered the wrong message. ''With private troops, the first signal you send is: This is important, but not important enough to risk our own people,'' he said."}, {"text": "Casualties of 9/11 Rebuilding; A New Transit Center Will Displace Businesses\n2003-03-01T05:00:00.000Z\nThe tailoring shop of Perry Akhtar and Luigi Barbarto survived 9/11.\nTheir place, at the corner of Broadway and Fulton Street, was closed for nearly two months after the terrorist attack. Even after it reopened, business just limped along for months. Only recently has work picked up to three-quarters of what it was when there was a World Trade Center a block away.\nBut it looks as if the tailoring shop of Perry Akhtar and Luigi Barbarto will not survive the rebuilding effort.\nNew York State and New York City are planning a new Fulton Street Transit Center, a $750 million project that will include a capacious, glass-enclosed entrance hall on the east side of Broadway between Fulton and John Streets, replacing the narrow, gloomy stairways on corners or tucked amid buildings. Downstairs, the maze of connecting corridors linking nine subway lines at the Fulton Street and Broadway-Nassau stations will be simplified and the platforms spruced up.\nBut some buildings will be razed to make way for the transit center. The tailoring shop is in one of them.\n''People across the street might feel good about what is to happen here,'' Mr. Akhtar, 48, said. ''But our concern is what will happen to our livelihood.''\n''We haven't heard anything from anybody, even our landlord,'' said Mr. Akhtar, a Pakistani immigrant, as he waited for a customer to put on an evening gown so he could measure it for hemming. ''We are confused and very concerned about the business. I don't know what we'll do or where we'll go or what the rent will be.'' The rent on his second-floor space is about $1,600 a month.\nDownstairs, in the building's below-ground arcade, Yuriy Davidov took a break from gluing new soles on shoes. His shoe repair shop, which largely serves people entering and leaving the subway station, will also have to go.\n''I came here to take care of my family better,'' said Mr. Davidov, 52, who immigrated eight years ago from Uzbekistan with his wife and three children. ''I'm worried. At my age, what other job can I do?''\nJust how many retailers, and the office tenants above them, will be displaced by the transit center is not certain. The new entrance hall is to extend about a half block east from Broadway toward Nassau Street, officials said, but the precise distance has not been determined. So the complete list of buildings that will have to be razed on Broadway and on Fulton and John Streets is also not certain.\n''All we've said on the public record is that it will be on the east side of Broadway between John and Fulton,'' said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\nEight buildings, from 2 to 12 stories, are on Broadway and around the corners on Fulton and John Streets to about midway to Nassau Street. The buildings house about 50 shops, including delis, clothing stores, gift and barber shops and a florist. Most are small mom-and-pop-type operations, although a Modell's Sporting Goods store is among them.\nFrom official descriptions of the plans, it seems that most of these eight buildings would have to go to make way for the new Fulton Street Transit Center. Those nearest the corner of Broadway and Fulton Street would definitely have to be razed.\nA spokesman for the Collegiate Church Corporation, the owner of the building that houses the shops of Mr. Akhtar and Mr. Davidov and is known as both 150 Fulton and 210 Broadway, said that it had no news for the tenants.\nThe spokesman, Gerald McKelvey, said the corporation and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had had ''conversations about what is supposed to happen or may happen in the Broadway-Fulton area, and the M.T.A. is doing its appraisals, but nothing definitive has been determined and no offer had been put on the table.''\nIn his subway-arcade shop, Mr. Davidov said his financial worries were heightened by college tuition bills for one child, and that another child would be entering college in September.\nThere is also the money he invested to upgrade his shop when he took it over five years ago. He declined to say how much he spent, but ''for me, it's big money.''\nGary Rosenberg, a real estate lawyer, said that public agencies taking property ''normally are obligated to pay for the fixtures of tenants'' at their depreciated value. ''Most tenants end up negotiating,'' he said.\nNext door to Mr. Davidov, Ji Kim, who sells takeout Korean and Japanese food, pointed out that his fixtures had hardly had time to depreciate. He opened his shop on Feb. 10.\n''I invested $50,000 for an architect, general contractor and plumber to install the water-supply equipment,'' said Mr. Kim, 30. He said that he had to stop sending money to his family in Korea so he could pay to set up his shop.\nMr. Kim said he had a 10-year lease. But Mr. Rosenberg said a tenant's lease terminated when a building was taken under condemnation, which could occur here.\nMr. McKelvey, the spokesman for the Collegiate Church Corporation, said that it had been informing would-be tenants that the building ''is the subject of redevelopment interest.''\nIn the adjacent building on Fulton Street, M. B. Islam, an immigrant from Bangladesh, sells costume jewelry and compact-disc players from a stand in a mini-mall, a jumble of small shops and counters offering goods and services, including cellphones, sunglasses and haircuts. He wanted to know when ''we'll have no business, no income.''\nWhen Gov. George E. Pataki recently outlined the overall plan to restore and upgrade transportation in Lower Manhattan -- the plan also includes a new PATH terminal at the trade center site, costing $1.7 billion to $2 billion -- he said construction of the Fulton Street Transit Center was envisioned to start next year.\nBut other officials noted that the project could be delayed by court battles or prolonged negotiations with owners of the site's existing buildings over the price for the properties. Disagreements with the federal government, which is to finance the new center, could also hold it up.\nIn his flower shop on Fulton Street just off Broadway, Jim Boudouvas, 38, saw the grand plan as just a ''new whammy.''\nHis business was closed for two and a half months after the terrorist attack, and he has been struggling to overcome a sales decline of 35 to 40 percent from before the terrorist attack. So Mr. Boudouvas, a father of two from Lynbrook on Long Island, is angry.\nNow, he said, he has to worry about being evicted, even as he faces debts, including $25,000 in loans he took out to ''tide me over'' till things improved.\nBut he was also fatalistic. ''You can struggle with lost business,'' he said, ''but you can't fight the government.''"}, {"text": "THE VIEW/From Cheshire; Something Funny Is Going On at the Museum\n2003-09-21T05:00:00.000Z\nROUTE 10 through Cheshire is lined with many unassuming buildings with facades of vinyl siding. At a glance, they look much the same, but read the signs and you will find worlds of difference: a piano bar, a bank, a synagogue -- and a cartoon museum.\nThe Barker Character, Comic and Cartoon Museum sits a bit off Highland Avenue (the local name of Route 10) behind an animation art gallery owned by the same family, Herbert and Gloria Barker. It is difficult to miss its colorful sign, however, and once you pull in the drive there is no mistaking that you have reached an enchanted place.\nThe museum proper is housed in one of those ubiquitous box-like buildings with vinyl siding, but its grounds are peopled with larger-than-life painted wooden silhouettes, including the Flintstones, Bugs Bunny, Popeye, Yosemite Sam, even the dancing California Raisins made famous through television commercials.\nThose dancing raisins are an indication that this is more than a cartoon museum. They are covered under the ''Character'' in the museum's name, and indeed, the Barkers are willing to enshrine any fictional character from childhood that enters popular consciousness through any medium, however lowly. Once inside (no admission is charged), this is immediately evident.\nPlacards, written in sober museum-speak, note when McDonald's restaurants brought back Teenie Beanies as the gift in its Happy Meals. There is a room devoted to Pez dispensers. Long-lost characters, like Tusk Tusk the Elephant, who had a brief career advertising Kellogg's Cocoa Krispies, all have a home here. The numbers are staggering: the museum has more than 80,000 items.\nThis is an island, not only of forgotten characters, but of forgotten media used to portray them, such as the View-Master (the binocular-like viewer used to watch 3-D images) and push-button puppets, those jointed figures that jerk and dance when the button beneath their base is pushed.\nTherein lies the oddity and the charm of the Barker Character, Comic and Cartoon Museum. Creations that anyone would grant a bona fide role in American popular culture -- Betty Boop and Popeye, for example -- sit alongside a big drink sipper branded with the San Diego Zoo's patented panda, a Ninja Turtle kiddy mug and a doll of Mork from Ork in his egg-shaped spaceship, and all are accorded the same dignity.\nThe curatorial vision seems to be this: If any kid anywhere might be excited to see an item, then it belongs here. That applies to any kid of any age as well.\n''I love it here,'' said Joel Granatelli of Cheshire, age 62. ''I could live in here.''\nFor now, he just visits often. On this day, he had brought his granddaughter and her friend all the way from Staten Island to see this big box of misfit toys and characters.\n''It's a nostalgic throwback to things you can't find anywhere,'' Mr. Granatelli said, just before he stopped dead at a cowboy exhibition. ''I used to have that rifle,'' he said, pointing to a Red Ryder toy gun, and then he broke into a jingle in which the cowboy character Tom Mix drummed up business for shredded wheat breakfast cereal.\nThe mixture of hucksterism and fantasy may seem distinctly American, but two of Mr. Granatelli's fellow visitors were a young couple from Melbourne, Australia.\n''We're sort of offbeat tourists,'' Linda Diflorio said of herself and her traveling companion, Michael Pulis.\nWhen their nation of origin was announced, the museum director, Nancy Spitzer, very much a loving, hovering den mother, said, ''Yesterday, Bangladesh. Today, Australia.''\nThanks to reviews in books and on the Internet, the museum has secured a place on the international map of eccentric collections. Its spot on that map is about to get bigger, with an expansion that should be completed by October. The museum's original 1,500 square feet of renovated barn will triple with the addition of 3,000 square feet of floor space. (There is also a smaller structure, a renovated stable, where vintage reel-to-reel cartoons are projected on a big screen, also free of charge.)\nThe increased shelf space will enable individual exhibitions for the Barkers's personal favorites, such as Popeye, and for those characters for whom the site serves as official museum, including Gumby, the California Raisins and the Celebriducks, the latest fad in customized celebrity memorabilia. The Barker collection of Celebriducks -- which includes the usual star athletes, plus likenesses of Shakespeare, Dracula and ''Snoop Doggy Duck'' -- is indeed impressive, if a bunch of rubber ducks with famous faces can ever be impressive.\nOnly a very bitter person could walk through this museum and not stop in wonder at something he had held dear as a child -- or could find a special place for right now. (Though nothing is for sale.)\nThe Barkers's collection began some 45 years ago with black-and-white drawings of Disney characters. These original drawings have become so rare and valuable that they now hang out of public view, in the office at Barker Specialty, which is just behind the museum.\n''Our main business is still making promotional items,'' Mr. Barker said of Barker Specialty, which makes everything from jackets for the F.B.I. to giveaway items for United States Army recruiters to a stuffed chef bear with a spoon and bowl for Campbell's Soup Company.\n''That is how we fund our fun, all the collecting and the museum,'' he said.\nIt also helps explain their fondness for promotional bric-a-brac.\nThe joy of children is evidently the Barkers's main goal with their museum, and the reason they refuse to charge admission. But the mania for collecting is the engine that makes this crazy train go.\n''Last night, we bid on a Kookla, Fran and Ollie board game,'' Mr. Barker said. ''We are always trying to fill in the missing characters.''\nThe Barker Character Comic and Cartoon Museum is at 1188 Highland Avenue in Cheshire.

It could be inserted several hours before sex, and remained effective for as long as 24 hours. It was more convenient than a condom, less invasive than an I.U.D., and the original manufacturer sold 250 million sponges between Today's market appearance in 1983 and disappearance in 1994, about 12 percent of the contraceptive market at the time.\nIn the years since it disappeared, the sponge achieved a kind of cult status, helped by a 1995 ''Seinfeld'' episode in which Elaine, discovering it would be discontinued, goes from pharmacy to pharmacy to stock up, then forces boyfriends to prove themselves ''spongeworthy.''\nA Spongeworthy Watch newsletter kept 8,000 subscribers up to date about Today's promised return to the market, and the president of Allendale Pharmaceuticals, the New Jersey company that is making the product again, communicated with an additional 5,000 women.\n''I was at my wits' end,'' said Stephanie Blaine, a Navy program manager in Alexandria, Va., who preordered last month after discovering Allendale's Web site in her Internet search for better birth control. ''I thought there's got to be some other way than these other alternatives.''\nWhen the sponge disappeared, women were so disappointed that many wrote the manufacturer and the Food and Drug Administration, pleading for its return. Some even wrote to Congress.\n''I didn't do the Elaine and buy a closet full, but I could really understand that episode, because I wish I had stocked up,'' said Dawn Schroer, who works at a publishing company in Minneapolis. ''There just aren't a lot of options, short of permanent sterilization, that are reliable and aren't a major inconvenience.''\nDoctors say that in fact, there are. In the years since the sponge disappeared, hormonal contraceptives have become safer. The F.D.A. has expressed new concerns about whether products containing nonoxynol-9, the spermicide used in Today, can increase H.I.V. transmission. The sponges are hardly the most reliable method to prevent pregnancy -- their effectiveness rate is a relatively low 85 percent to 90 percent. And while some researchers say the sponge blocks some sexually transmitted diseases, the drug agency says it does not.\nStill, doctors say they understand its appeal.\n''For years I've had patients saying, 'When's the sponge coming back, when's the sponge coming back?' '' said Deborah Oyer, a family practitioner in Seattle and a member of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health. ''The thing about contraception is, there is no ideal method for everyone, and when someone finds something that works, and then it disappears, it's like having your insurance change and having to find a new doctor.''\nIf women like a method, they are more likely to use it properly, making it more effective, said Paul Blumenthal, a gynecologist in Baltimore and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins. ''Women want something they can control, and this is one of those things,'' he said.\nWhitehall-Robins Healthcare, a unit of Wyeth, stopped making Today Sponges in 1994 after an F.D.A inspection of its plant found bacteria contaminating the water used to make the devices. The company decided it would be too expensive to upgrade the plant, but the sponge retained its F.D.A. drug approval.\nIn 1998, Gene Detroyer, a businessman who had started out developing disposable plates and cups for the maker of Hefty bags, heard that the rights to the sponge were for sale. He said he told his partner at Allendale, a scientist who exclaimed, ''That's a great product!''\nMr. Detroyer said he had since read enough letters from women echoing that same thought to believe that the new incarnation of Today would be a big seller. He sees a whole new generation of users among women in their 20's who were not sexually active when the sponge was available.\n''This is going to make millions of women very happy,'' Mr. Detroyer said. ''As happy as paper plates may make them, this is going to make them happier.''\nAllendale initially said it would have the sponges back in stores in fall 1999, but the drug agency said the company's plant did not meet manufacturing standards. The company is now conducting chemical studies at another plant in order to show the agency that the drug it is making is the same one approved back in 1983. It now says it expects Today Sponges back on shelves in this country within the year.\nIn the meantime, Mr. Detroyer arranged with two Canadian Web sites to sell the product by mail, and Today Sponges will appear on Canadian pharmacy shelves next month. He found a sympathetic voice in Barbara Bell, 62, who created the Web site birthcontrol.com to sell sponges out of her one-bedroom condominium outside Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1999.\n''You can get affordable, safe contraceptives better in Bangladesh than you can in New York City,'' Ms. Bell said, ''and that's wrong.''\nHer Web site has sold Protectaid sponges, which use a different combination of spermicides, for several years, in addition to holding orders for women who wanted Today Sponges as soon as they could have them.\nJolene Gladson was one of those women. She had never used the sponge, but heard about it from her friends, and at 39, says she worries about the risks of being on the pill.\n''Maybe it's laziness,'' she said, ''but I like the convenience of it, not having to go to the doctor to get a prescription or a shot. And I don't like the idea of polluting my body with all those hormones.''"}, {"text": "GHETTO MIASMA; Enough To Make You Sick?\n2003-10-12T05:00:00.000Z\nBeverly Blagmon lives in the School Street housing projects in southwest Yonkers, a once-vibrant manufacturing area just north of New York City long mired in unemployment and poverty. Beverly has asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis, gout and an enlarged heart, and her blood has a dangerous tendency to clot spontaneously. She is 48, and she had her first heart attack in her late 20's. One of her brothers died of heart failure at 50, and another died of kidney failure at 45, as did a sister who was 35. A young cousin recently died of cancer. In the past three years, at least 11 young people she knows have died, most of them not from gunshot wounds or drug overdoses, but from disease.\nMonica, who asked that her last name not be used, moved to the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn from School Street a year ago. She has diabetes, arthritis and asthma. She is overweight, and the pain from a back injury that occurred four years ago makes it hard for her to walk or even bend over a stove. Her elaborately braided hair is tinged with gray. In the past year, six of her friends have died, all of them younger than she is. When asked simple questions about her life -- when she was born, where she grew up, when her three children were born -- Monica answers in short phrases, wiping tears from her eyes. She is 36.\nEbony Fasion, 22, and her friend Dominique Faulk, 17, both former residents of School Street, have asthma. Dominique's cousin Jo-Scama Wontong, 19, still lives in the School Street projects. Jo-Scama has lost so many people she loved to disease and accident recently that whenever she thinks about it, she is stricken with panic. ''My heart beats so fast, and I can't breathe, and there's just death going through my mind the whole time.''\nSomething is killing America's urban poor, but this is no ordinary epidemic. When diseases like AIDS, measles and polio strike, everyone's symptoms look more or less the same, but not in this case. It is as if the aging process in people like Beverly and Monica were accelerated. Even teenagers are afflicted with numerous health problems, including asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure. Poor urban blacks have the worst health of any ethnic group in America, with the possible exception of Native Americans. Some poor urban Hispanics suffer disproportionately from many health problems, too, although the groups that arrived most recently, like Dominicans, seem to be healthier, on average, than Puerto Ricans who have lived in the United States for many years. It makes you wonder whether there is something deadly in the American experience of urban poverty itself.\nThe neighborhoods where Beverly, Monica, Ebony, Dominique and Jo-Scama live look like poor urban areas all across the country, with bricked-up abandoned buildings, vacant storefronts, broken sidewalks and empty lots with mangy grass overgrowing the ruins of old cars, machine parts and heaps of garbage. Young men in black nylon skullcaps lurk around the pay-phones on street corners. These neighborhoods are as segregated from the more affluent, white sections of metropolitan New York as any township in South Africa under apartheid. Living in such neighborhoods as southwest Yonkers, central and East Harlem, central Brooklyn and the South Bronx is assumed to predispose the poor to a number of social ills, including drug abuse, truancy and the persistent joblessness that draws young people into a long cycle of crime and incarceration. Now it turns out these neighborhoods could be destroying people's health as well.\nThere are many different types of disadvantaged neighborhoods in America, but poor urban minority neighborhoods seem to be especially unhealthy. Some of these neighborhoods have the highest mortality rates in the country, but this is not, as many believe, mainly because of drug overdoses and gunshot wounds. It is because of chronic diseases -- mainly diseases of adulthood that are probably not caused by viruses, bacteria or other infections and that include stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, high blood pressure and certain types of cancer.\nThe problems start at birth. The black infant death rate in Westchester County is almost three times as high as the rate for the county as a whole. Black youths in Harlem, central Detroit, the South Side of Chicago and Watts have about the same probability of dying by age 45 as whites nationwide do by age 65, and most of this premature death is due not to violence, but to illness. A third of poor black 16-year-old girls in urban areas will not reach their 65th birthdays. Four times as many people die of diabetes in the largely black area of central Brooklyn as on the predominantly white Upper East Side of Manhattan, and one in three adults in Harlem report having high blood pressure. In 1990, two New York doctors found that so many poor African-Americans in Harlem were dying young from heart disease, cancer and cirrhosis of the liver that men there were less likely to reach age 65 than men in Bangladesh.\nSince the time of slavery, physicians have noted that the health of impoverished blacks is, in general, worse than that of whites. Racist doctors proposed that the reasons were genetic, and that blacks were intrinsically inferior and physically weaker than whites. But there is very little evidence that poor blacks or Hispanics are genetically predisposed to the vast majority of the afflictions from which they disproportionately suffer. As the living conditions of blacks have improved over the past century, their health improved in step; when conditions deteriorated, health deteriorated, too. This has helped support the contention among researchers that much chronic disease among minority groups is caused not by genes, but by something else.\nThat something else may come down to geography. Ana Diez-Roux, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, has shown that people who live in disadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely to have heart attacks than people who live in middle-class neighborhoods, even taking income differences into account. Researchers from the Rand Corporation found that neighborhoods where many buildings are boarded up and abandoned have higher rates of early death from cancer and diabetes than neighborhoods with similar poverty rates and similar proportions of uninsured people, but intact housing. Abandoned buildings do not in themselves cause disease, of course, but they are an indicator of neighborhood deprivation and neglect -- and this does seem to be associated with poor health, though we don't know why.\nIn some ways, our public health institutions are in the same position they were in 150 years ago. In the mid-19th century, public health boards were established to fight the great killers of the day -- cholera and tuberculosis. The poor were more susceptible to these diseases then, just as they are more susceptible to chronic diseases now. And then, as now, the reasons were unknown. Some believed diseases were acts of God and the poor got what they deserved. If they would only drink less, go to church and stay out of brothels, they wouldn't get sick. Others maintained that the afflictions of poverty were environmental. A stinking mass of invisible vapor, referred to as ''miasma,'' hung in the air over the slums, they claimed, and sickened those who inhaled it.\nIt was not until the early 1880's, when the German scientist Robert Koch looked down his microscope at swirling cholera and tuberculosis bacteria, that everyone finally agreed about what was going on. The water the poor drank was full of sewage and contained deadly cholera germs; in overcrowded tenements, the poor breathed clouds of tuberculosis bacteria. Malnourished alcoholics tended to be more susceptible to these diseases, but immoral behavior was not their primary cause. Nor was miasma. The primary cause was germs.\nWe don't have a germ theory for chronic diseases like stroke, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. We know something about what can aggravate these diseases -- diet, smoking and so on -- but not enough about why they are so much more common among people who live in certain neighborhoods, or what makes, for example, a poor person who smokes the same number of cigarettes a day as a rich person more likely to get lung cancer. Or why several research studies show that smoking, eating, drinking and exercise habits do not fully account for why rich people are healthier than poor people. Even lack of health care cannot entirely explain the afflictions of the poor. Many poor people lack health insurance, and those who have it are often at the mercy of overworked doctors and nurses who provide indifferent care, but inadequate health care cannot explain why so many of them get so sick in the first place.\nMost poor minority neighborhoods ''are less healthy,'' says Adam M. Karpati, who works in the Brooklyn office of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. ''You walk down the street and you know it. But what is that thing that you know is going on? What's at play there? That thing you can't name? We don't know that.''\nClearly we need to examine this miasma with a different kind of microscope. The best we have at the moment are theories that fall into two main schools of thought. One school holds that the problem has mainly to do with stress; the other holds actual deprivation responsible. These two factors are often intertwined, but the emphasis is important. ''There are so many fists in the face of poor African-Americans,'' says Arline Geronimus, a professor of public health at the University of Michigan who leans toward the stress school, and she proceeded to list them for me. They have enormous family obligations, she explained, and while the middle class are able to purchase child care and care for elderly relatives, the poor cannot. The experience of racism and discrimination in everyday life is also still very real, and very stressful. She says that blacks are faced with a society that institutionalizes the idea ''that you are a menace -- and that demeans you,'' she says. Nancy Krieger, a Harvard researcher, found that working-class African-Americans who said they accepted unfair treatment as a fact of life had higher blood pressure than those who challenged it.\nGeronimus calls the grinding everyday stress of being poor and marginalized in America ''weathering,'' a condition not unlike the effect of exposure to wind and rain on houses. Listening to Geronimus describe ''weathering,'' I found it hard not to wonder whether anyone really knows what it is. Stress is subjective, a feeling, and it means different things to different people. Philip Alcabes, associate professor of urban public health at Hunter College, says that stress is like the miasma that was once thought to cause cholera in 19th-century slums. ''You can't see it, you can't really measure it, but it floats over certain people, especially the poor, and makes them sick.''\nIf ''weathering'' and stress have their modern day Robert Koch, he is probably Bruce McEwen, a neuroendocrinologist at Rockefeller University in New York. McEwen argues that stress hormones threaten the health of poor people, especially blacks and the Hispanic poor. Stress hormones are produced by the adrenal glands in response to signals from the brain. When people feel frustrated, frightened or angry, stress hormones travel through the bloodstream and instruct different parts of the body to prepare for an emergency. They speed up the heart rate and narrow the arteries so that blood gets to the tissues faster; blood sugar rises, so that energy rushes to the muscles and other organs; and some bodily functions, like digestion and the mechanisms that maintain the strength of the bones and other tissues, are inhibited. But not all stress is the same. Occasional periods of intense stress, like what you feel during a near miss in a car, do no harm. However, McEwen's research suggests that constant exposure to stress hormones impairs the immune system and damages the brain and other organs.\nChronic stress also signals the body to accumulate abdominal fat around the waistline, which is more dangerous than fat that lies under the skin, or subcutaneous fat. Abdominal fat worsens many chronic health problems, including diabetes and heart disease, whereas subcutaneous fat does not. It's as if stress hormones were like lye, powerful stuff that in small amounts is useful for cleaning the stove, but that in large amounts will eat right through the floor.\nNot everyone believes that stress is a major contributor to the health crisis among the poor. George Davey Smith, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Bristol in England, agrees that the poor live very stressful lives, and that racism is an everyday reality for many people. However, in his view -- the second school of thought on the matter -- the health crisis among the poor has more to do with living in a deprived environment.\nThe experience of poverty in America has changed a great deal since the 19th century; the poor now have safe drinking water and live in less crowded dwellings, and many have cars and TV's. However, it's also true that many poor people eat unhealthful food, smoke and abuse drugs. Americans hear a great deal about the importance of making healthy choices in their lives; warnings about cigarettes and high-fat foods issue frequently from the surgeon general's office and fill the pages of magazines and best-selling advice books. There are plenty of people who feel little sympathy for overweight diabetic people, poor or not, who eat regularly at McDonald's. But while there is considerable controversy about the ideal lifestyle regimen, you don't need to know much about impoverished neighborhoods to see the absurdity of choosing to go Atkins or macrobiotic for a person like Beverly Blagmon, who subsists on disability payments. Poor people are more likely to have unhealthy habits because fast food and cigarettes are abundant and cheap in their neighborhoods, and healthy alternatives tend to be limited.\nA recent survey conducted in four regions of the United States found that there were three times as many bars in poor neighborhoods as in rich ones, and four times as many supermarkets in white neighborhoods as in black ones. There are fewer parks in poor neighborhoods as well, so it is more difficult to find open spaces in which to exercise, and many of them are dangerous. Forty-one percent of New York's public elementary schools have no consistent physical education program. As Mary T. Bassett, a New York City deputy health commissioner, said to me, public health campaigns that tell people to ''just say no'' to smoking, or to change their diets and start exercising, can be cruel if they are indifferent to neighborhood circumstances.\nDavey Smith also points out that many of the poor black people who are sick today grew up in the 40's, 50's and 60's, when many black people lived in overcrowded dwellings, and were more prone than affluent whites to childhood infections. Some of these infections may have long-term effects on health. Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that has been associated with both ulcers and stomach cancer in adulthood, is most often acquired in childhood, and this may explain why poor blacks in particular have relatively high rates of both diseases. Adults who were poor as children, even if they are not poor now, are also more prone to stroke, kidney disease and hypertensive heart disease.\nI wondered about these alternatives. Presumably both stress and material disadvantage are important causes of ill health among the poor. But which is more important? And what would be the best way to address these problems? If stress is a major cause of ill health, interventions to alleviate it -- counseling, antidepressants, even yoga -- might be beneficial. A recent article in The British Medical Journal suggested that building self-esteem actually helped a group of Native Americans manage their obesity and diabetes better than did conventional counseling about diet and exercise. On the other hand, if material disadvantage is a major cause of ill health among the poor, then extensive changes in the environment in which the poor live -- for example, cleaner buildings and more parks -- are needed.\nPerhaps Beverly Blagmon, who lives in the midst of such problems, could help resolve this matter. I asked her what she thought the health crisis in southwest Yonkers was caused by, and she answered without missing a beat. ''Racism.'' We went on to talk about the lack of jobs in the area and the dilapidated state of the housing. I also learned that if stress is a killer, there is plenty of it on School Street, but yoga classes and motivational seminars are not likely to be of much help.\nBeverly raised 10 children, eight orphaned nieces and nephews in addition to her own son and daughter. The kids were desperate for attention from the overextended Beverly. ''It was hard,'' she said. ''You had to deal with 10 different personalities.'' All the kids are grown now, and all but two have left home. Now she worries because some of them can't find jobs. When she was young, Yonkers was full of factories that hired many young people. But not anymore.\nThen last year, disaster struck. Beverly's 21-year-old daughter was killed in a car accident; shortly thereafter, her nephew was shot and killed right outside her building. ''I was totally out of it,'' she said. ''People don't know how much a death can take from you. I went into the hospital right after my daughter's funeral. They didn't know if I'd had a mild stroke or not.''\n''Life is taken stupidly'' all the time around School Street, Beverly said, but this doesn't make it easier to handle. Beverly struggles with these losses, and said her family, friends and even officials from the local Housing Authority have been supportive. But when Beverly talked about life on School Street, what she said is underscored with tension -- the constant strain of ''us versus them.'' She sees the police in particular as a constant source of grief. ''Some of them are very prejudiced, even now,'' she told me. She claimed that a few officers harassed children and teenagers, and have even been known to swear at kids and shove them. She recalled, as if it were yesterday, a 1997 fight at School Street. Someone called Beverly to come outside, which she did, along with a visiting friend. Police officers were on the street, some of them shouting, and in the chaos that ensued, she said, a policeman knocked down Beverly's friend, a older woman who is legally blind. ''I was freaked out,'' Beverly said. ''The main witnesses were drug dealers, and they couldn't say anything.'' (The Yonkers police confirmed that the woman later filed a complaint, but said an internal investigation found no wrongdoing.) Beverly said she was infuriated when, shortly after the incident, she saw the mayor of Yonkers praise the police in a televised speech.\nPeople who are not poor often casually ascribe their aches, pains and even more serious afflictions to ''stress,'' but stress, if it is a killer, is a far more serious problem for people like Beverly. When middle-class people feel the police or other authorities treat them unfairly, they often have the resources to hire a lawyer and even effect change. But all too often poor blacks feel ignored when they complain about discrimination and abuse.\nHow might painful experiences like Beverly's be imprinted on the body? Laboratory animals suffer when stressed with electric shocks or when kept in isolated cages away from their peers, and they sometimes do develop symptoms that resemble human chronic diseases. But how does mouse stress compare to Beverly's stress? Or mine? Or yours? George Davey Smith would argue that it is entirely possible that the afflictions of poor people like Beverly are not due to stress, at all, but to old-fashioned deprivation: crowding, poor nutrition, lack of exercise and exposure to dirty air, germs and vermin. For a while, Beverly's family of 11 crowded into a two-bedroom apartment, until they were eventually moved into a six-room place. Once, money was so short that she begged the welfare office for food stamps. There is nowhere around School Street for kids to run around, Beverly says, except a concrete playground with a set of monkey bars. ''Why can't they put up some swings or build a basketball court? You see kids using garbage cans as basketball nets around here.'' Until two years ago, an incinerator in the building spewed forth horrible fumes that may have contributed to the high rates of asthma on School Street. ''When you got ready to polish the furniture, it was black with dust,'' Beverly recalled. ''Every day. Now, how much of that was getting in our lungs? I've been in the hospital every year with acute asthma.'' The incinerator has been replaced by a compactor, but as a result, life is a constant battle against roaches and mice, whose droppings also worsen asthma. Beverly told me that she recently caught three mice in one day. ''I put them on the maintenance people's desk,'' she said. The elevators are always breaking down, which is hard on the elderly. Once she saw human feces in the hallway.\nAfter talking to Beverly, I could only conclude that her life was full of many sorts of trouble, any or all of which might be harmful to health. If only it were possible to devise an experiment that would examine the effects of stress and deprived living conditions on the health of the poor. For nearly 10 years, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has been conducting an experiment called Moving to Opportunity that seems to be doing just that. HUD researchers wanted to see what happens to poor urban families who move out of neighborhoods like Harlem in New York, Roxbury in Boston or the South Side of Chicago and settle in better neighborhoods. They wanted to know whether moving would help children do better in school, and escape being drawn into crime when they reached adolescence. They also wanted to know whether their parents would climb out of poverty.\nHUD did find that people's lives improved in some ways. For example, the children who moved to better neighborhoods in Baltimore did better on standardized tests, and adults there were more likely to get off welfare. But HUD's most remarkable early findings had to do with health. In Boston, poor children who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods were less likely to experience severe asthma attacks. Adults in New York who moved were less likely to suffer from symptoms of depression and anxiety than those who stayed behind, and adults in Boston were more likely to report that they felt ''calm and peaceful.'' The HUD researchers who devised the experiment had not set out to study health, but their findings were so striking that they decided to expand their study to determine whether moving out of poor neighborhoods affected other aspects of health that they did not measure in the first round, including blood pressure, obesity and other factors associated with such chronic afflictions as heart disease, cancer and stroke, like smoking. Those results aren't available yet, but when I heard about the earlier study, I decided to conduct a small experiment of my own.\nI wanted to talk to families, like those who had participated in the HUD program, who had recently moved out of the slums. Did the move affect their health? And if so, why? Did people experience less stress? Did they eat better food? Breathe better air? What might their experiences tell me about the mysterious miasma of contemporary poverty?\nMy investigation led me to Jerrold M. Levy, the general counsel of the Enhanced Section 8 Outreach Program, or ESOP, which helps low-income families move out of depressed, dangerous inner-city neighborhoods in Yonkers into middle-class areas. ESOP wasn't conducting any studies of these people, of course, but Levy was willing to put me in touch with 10 of the families he'd helped move. He had noticed that the people who moved out of dangerous neighborhoods seemed happier. ''A few weeks after they've moved,'' he says of his clients, who are mostly single mothers, ''they come into my office, and it's like one of those programs on late-night TV where they do the makeovers, you know? They have their hair done nicely, they're wearing high heels and makeup, it's like they're transformed. They have a new sense of self-worth and dignity. But will you see changes in their health? I don't think so.'' Depression and anxiety are major health problems that affect large numbers of poor people, so I thought I would be satisfied just to find people whose mental health improved. And I did find such people. But I also found that most people who moved gained far more than high spirits.\nOf the 10 families I met, 9 had at least one member who suffered from a serious health problem before the move that required either medication or hospitalization. Of the 16 people in these families who had health problems, 12 told me that they felt better in significant ways -- either their symptoms were less severe so that they no longer required hospitalization, or they were taking less medication. Their health problems included severe asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis and eczema. Emergency-room visits for the asthmatic kids virtually stopped, and some adults with high blood pressure or diabetes reduced the doses of their medications. This was hardly a rigorous scientific experiment. There was no control group, and I was not able to check medical records. Nevertheless, I was stunned by what people told me. These people felt better, and moving appeared to have made all the difference. If moving out of southwest Yonkers were a drug, I would bottle it, patent it and go on cable TV and sell it.\nJuanita Moody is now 52. In the summer of 2001, she and her husband, William, moved to a middle-class section of Yonkers from a low-income housing complex on Nepperhan Avenue, where they lived for nearly 30 years. Juanita was crippled by polio when she was a teenager, and during an operation to adjust her spine, she was given a blood transfusion that contained hepatitis C. The virus lay dormant for many years. But two and a half years ago, Juanita's doctor told her that her liver was showing signs of damage and advised her to take interferon, a prescription drug for viral infections. When Juanita found out about the possible side effects, however, she refused. Today Juanita's liver tests are almost normal, suggesting that her hepatitis is not progressing rapidly. ''The doctor said I was fantastic, in terms of enzymes,'' Juanita told me. I did not speak to Juanita's doctor myself, so I could not confirm her diagnosis, but Juanita seemed energetic, and other doctors confirmed that it is possible for hepatitis to slow its progression. In addition, Juanita says that since she moved, her blood pressure has fallen from 140/90, which is considered high, to 130/78, which is almost normal, and the dose of blood-pressure pills she takes has been reduced by half.\nJuanita, a born-again Christian, attributes her improved health to prayer and to the new regimen she has maintained since she moved. She has become a health-food nut. Before she moved, her daughter told me, ''everything was fried, fried, fried. Before she'd eat at McDonald's and stuff, but not now.'' Now she drinks fruit and vegetable juices, and her kitchen cabinets are full of natural remedies: vitamins C and E, zinc, magnesium, calcium, alpha lipoic acid and milk thistle, which she says is excellent for the liver.\nJuanita says she began focusing more on her health after she moved. When she lived on Nepperhan, there were too many other things to worry about, including frequent robberies and killings in and around the complex itself. The building managers put up a fence to keep drug dealers out, ''but the crackheads living inside the building gave the dealers the keys.'' The elevators were often broken, which meant that someone would have to carry Juanita and her wheelchair up and down three flights of stairs.\nJuanita's new apartment is not in a luxury building. It's on a busy road, near two gas stations and a shopping mall, and has few amenities. But it is safe and has nice, leafy views. On Nepperhan, ''it was stressful just to walk out of that place. You were always scared for the kids. . . . You wake up stressed, go to sleep stressed, you see all the garbage and the dealers. That is depressing. In a bad environment like that you say, 'What's the use of doing anything?' '' Living in her new apartment building gives her a very different feeling. ''It inspires you to do all you can -- spiritually, health-wise, any kind of way.''\nIt is well known that junk food can make anxious people feel better. Researchers from the University of California recently discovered one possible reason. In response to constant stress, the brain makes a hormone called corticotropin-releasing factor, which instructs the adrenal glands to manufacture stress hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones cause a range of physiological changes that over long periods can be harmful. When people with high levels of cortisol eat sugary, fatty foods, fat is deposited in the abdomen. The researchers theorize that these abdominal fat cells can temporarily inhibit the brain from making corticotropin-releasing factor, reducing feelings of stress and anxiety. If this theory is correct, it could explain how the stress of poverty creates a biological urge to overeat, thus putting poor people at greater risk of obesity and its consequences -- diabetes, heart disease, stroke and certain types of cancer. Perhaps this explained why Juanita found it easier to change her diet once she moved out of the stressful atmosphere of Nepperhan Avenue. She admitted that doctors had been telling her over the years that she should consume less fattening food. ''But they can tell you, and you don't do it,'' Juanita said.\nNoemi, 31, moved with her two teenage children and her 76-year-old aunt, Raimunda, from Burnham Street in Yonkers to a better neighborhood in northwest Yonkers only three months before I met her in August. Noemi, who asked that her last name not be used, has had diabetes since childhood. Shortly after she moved, her doctor reduced her dose of insulin by three units. Noemi thinks it's because she feels less stressed in the new neighborhood. ''Stress affects your blood sugar,'' she explained. ''It makes your sugar go up so you need more insulin.'' She drove me from her new neighborhood of neatly mowed lawns, bushy trees and two-car garages to the place she used to live. ''Look at the neighborhood here,'' she said, as we drove by industrial garages, boarded-up buildings and vacant lots. An enormous, dented, wheezing Lincoln car screeched by. ''I had to be worried all the time, you know. Are the children gonna get hit by a car? Is something gonna happen? We've lived in neighborhoods with a lot of drugs, a lot of people getting killed. You'd read about it in the paper the next day and think: Oh, God! That's only two blocks from here.''\nNoemi's aunt Raimunda speaks no English, although she has lived in the United States for more than 15 years. She has high blood pressure and heart disease. I asked Noemi to ask Raimunda how she was feeling these days. ''She says her thing with the head is gone,'' Noemi translated. ''Before she used to get dizzy, but not anymore. Not for the past couple of months.'' When I asked Raimunda why she thought the dizzy spells went away, she, unlike Noemi and Juanita, did not mention stress. Instead, she said she thought the improvement had something to do with diet. ''She thinks the chicken is better here -- easier to digest,'' Noemi said. ''But what she doesn't know is that since we moved, I still buy the chicken in the same place.''\nAfter meeting Noemi, Raimunda and Juanita, I began to see more clearly what Arline Geronimus, the University of Michigan researcher, was talking about. Perhaps the miasma that is killing the poor really is stress after all. Then I spoke to the mothers of six children who had severe asthma. Every one of them had significantly fewer and less severe attacks after the families moved out of southwest Yonkers. Reduced stress could be partly responsible -- stress can worsen asthma -- but it seemed clear to me a cleaner environment was also responsible. The children ranged in age from 3 to 16; they all moved out of southwest Yonkers and settled in different parts of Westchester. The mothers, who asked that their last names not be used, saw astonishing changes, and hearing their stories convinced me that the only way to deal with the staggering epidemic of asthma that afflicts 30 percent of children in some New York City neighborhoods is to clean up the rundown, roach-infested buildings where so many of these children live.\nCarmen and her 4-year-old son moved to a middle-class section of Westchester in the spring of 2002. In Yonkers, her son would have severe asthma attacks every month and would have to sit for hours every day breathing through a nebulizer. Since they moved, she says he has needed the nebulizer only twice. Two years ago, Monique, her 3-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter moved from Cedar Street in Yonkers to Peekskill. When they lived on Cedar Street, her son's severe asthma came complete with projectile vomiting. The attacks started just a few months after he was born, and they terrified Monique. She blames her former landlord. ''There was no hot water for two weeks once, there were leaks in the roof, so it was damp all the time. Sometimes there was water coming through the roof, and mice playing in the living room,'' she says. ''There were cockroaches everywhere, even in the refrigerator. The landlord did nothing until I called the health department. It was stressful having all those roaches around. You didn't know if they were crawling all over you at night.'' As soon as the family moved up to Peekskill, the boy's attacks became less severe. Although he is still on medication, the violent attacks and the vomiting have stopped.\nCockroaches and vermin do worsen asthma, and this might explain why Monique's son was so sick. But there could be another reason that so many children in poor neighborhoods have asthma, and why they get better when they move. In the past decade, rates of childhood asthma, as well as obesity and diabetes, have soared in the very neighborhoods that were worst affected by the crime waves of the 70's, 80's and 90's. One possible explanation, says Daniel Kass, a research scientist for the New York City health department, ''is that asthma follows the crime epidemic, because it goes wherever people spend a lot of time indoors.''\nPoor parents, terrified that their kids will be killed on the street, tend to keep them inside, with the windows shut and the TV on, where they are constantly exposed to contaminants in indoor air, which some researchers believe can be as damaging as industrial pollution. Not only are sedentary, overweight kids more at risk for asthma, but kids with severe asthma tend to exercise less and are thus prone to obesity. Mothers trying to protect their kids from crime may not realize they are putting their future health at risk. As Mindy Fullilove, professor of clinical psychiatry and public health at Columbia University explained, ''The best parents -- the people who are the most upright, the churchgoers, the most protective mothers -- keep their kids inside, and they are at the intersection of the asthma and obesity epidemics.''\nI thought of Trevor Jackson Jr., a 14-year-old boy with serious eczema who moved from southwest Yonkers up to Cortland Manor in northern Westchester two years ago. ''This is a much better atmosphere,'' his mother, Dawn, told me. Their new apartment is in a large house with a wide sloping lawn surrounded by trees. ''The kids can just go outside anytime. The little one wouldn't go to sleep when we first got here.'' He wanted to be outside all the time. In Cortland Manor, ''kids have a better chance to grow,'' Trevor's father, Trevor Sr., says. ''We see deer in the yard, woodchucks, otters, frogs. There's just life up here.''\nI was beginning to see that the problems of stress and material deprivation were inseparable parts of the contemporary miasma of poverty. But how did these neighborhoods become so unhealthy? New York City is one of the most segregated metropolitan areas in the country. Blacks, whites and other ethnic groups interact every day, but to a large extent they live separately. At the same time, the city has also become more segregated by wealth, so that many black and Hispanic neighborhoods are also the poorest.\nThe Harvard sociologist William Julius Wilson has described how, thanks to the civil rights movement of the 60's, many middle-class blacks have been able to find jobs and housing outside traditional black areas, leaving behind the most impoverished, poorly educated people. This concentration of disadvantage -- racial, social and economic -- combined with the loss of many unskilled manufacturing jobs, is what Wilson says contributed to the many social problems associated with poverty today, including drug abuse, crime and single motherhood. Mindy Fullilove says that these trends contributed to widening health inequalities as well. As racial and economic segregation increased, health problems became concentrated in the most deprived areas, as if the miasma were condensing over them. Indeed, I wondered if the miasma might not turn out to be segregation itself.\nIn order to understand the health crisis among America's urban poor, Fullilove explains, you can't just consider what's going on now. ''You have to look at the history of these neighborhoods'' and think about the people who live there and what has happened to them in the past. ''The history of each neighborhood will determine its pattern of disease. A city like New York suffers from an overlay of epidemics.''\nIn the 70's, 80's and 90's, poor minority neighborhoods throughout the country experienced a protean health crisis. Rates of some chronic and infectious diseases began increasing for the first time since World War II. Even older blacks who made it into their 60's, and who once had as good a chance of reaching their 75th birthdays as 60-year-old whites, began dying at higher rates.\nFullilove says that urban-renewal projects that helped create concentrated poverty, along with redlining -- discrimination by banks and insurance companies -- and public- service cuts in poor neighborhoods led to catastrophic changes in the way the poor lived, and destroyed the foundation that made poverty endurable. The migrancy of poor people, displaced by fires, evictions and other calamities, destroyed informal community mechanisms for caring for children and controlling the behavior of adolescents and young adults, and this made it harder than ever for the poor to cope. ''It was like a massive refugee situation,'' Fullilove says.\nAt the same time, as the middle class increasingly campaigned for restrictions on cigarette and alcohol advertising, those companies spent more of their marketing dollars in poor neighborhoods. As Rodrick and Deborah Wallace wrote in their book ''A Plague on Your Houses,'' politicians looked the other way when companies posted huge, colorful billboards -- depicting exuberant black people smoking cigarettes and drinking beer -- outside schools and churches in Harlem, Brooklyn and the South Bronx. Construction on central Harlem's first full-size supermarket did not begin until 2002, but in the 90's there were more than a hundred places where a child under 18 could buy cigarettes, including individual ''loosies,'' which are cheap but illegal.\nThe wave of crime and drugs of the 80's and 90's has subsided considerably, and some once-grim urban neighborhoods are even prospering. But poverty has risen in many suburban minority enclaves, and the health problems of the poor have not gone away.\nMuch has been written about how such social problems as joblessness and drug abuse worsen health problems, but it is also possible that the converse is true. Both Beverly and Monica have lost jobs as a result of illness, and many sick people fall into poverty. Anne Case, a Princeton University economist, has shown that unhealthy young people are far less likely to succeed in school and find good jobs later on. Thus, illness can trap poor families in cycles of disease, death and poverty for generations.\nAdam Karpati of the New York City health department says that even though we don't know what the miasma is, there is still a great deal we can do to improve the well-being of the poor. In the 19th century, it was not the discovery of germs that led to the greatest advances in public health, but a series of profound changes in the way the poor lived -- a virtual social revolution. Then, as now, health and poverty were inseparable from each other, and better housing, sewers, decent wages, better working conditions and improved nutrition saved millions of lives. Today much could be done to improve the environment and make life less stressful for the poor. The health department is working to reduce mold and roach infestation in public housing, as well as encouraging doctors and community organizations to address such problems as obesity, asthma and diabetes. These admirable programs, however, are modest in scale, and in the current fiscal climate, their financing is far from secure.\nMore ambitious changes are needed, but at present, our government is permitting matters to get even worse. Since 2000, millions of jobs have been lost, and nearly three million people have joined the ranks of the poor, who now account for more than 12 percent of the U.S. population and 24 percent of African-Americans. This means fewer families will be able to move out of poor neighborhoods on their own. For now, the federal Section 8 program -- which provides subsidies for people to pay for private housing -- is the only hope most people have of getting out of these neighborhoods, but even its future is in doubt. Possible budget cuts could mean thousands of Section 8 recipients will lose their vouchers next year, and in the longer term, Republicans in Congress hope to devolve the program to the states. This will almost certainly mean the program will shrink. Last month, moreover, HUD also suspended rental supplements that Jerrold Levy says have made programs like ESOP possible. ''This will reinforce the ghettoization of poor people,'' Levy says.\nRising unemployment and budget cuts will not only harm people's health. They will also cost Americans money. Take diabetes and asthma as examples. Around one million people succumb to Type 2 diabetes each year, with African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans most at risk. The bill for treating the nation's 11 million known diabetics comes to $92 billion for medications and doctors' visits plus $40 billion in lost productivity due to absences from work and premature death. The yearly bill for the nation's asthma epidemic is $14 billion. As Beverly pointed out to me, shortsighted cuts, amounting to a few hundred million dollars, from the HUD budget mean programs to refurbish public housing, organize recreation for children and build playgrounds have been halted. The exterminator teams that used to come every month now come once every two months, and the roaches are flourishing as never before.\nWhatever the miasma is that afflicts America's minority poor, it is at least partly a legacy of the segregation of America's cities. These neighborhoods, by concentrating the poor, also concentrate the mysterious, as yet poorly understood, factors that make them sick. You'd almost think this new miasma was caused by some sort of infection, because of the way it seems to strike certain neighborhoods and certain types of people. I recently came across a research article by Angus Deaton of Princeton University, reporting that white people who live in cities with large black populations have higher death rates than whites with the same income who live in cities with smaller black populations. It made me wonder whether the deprived, polluted, roach-infested, stressful conditions in which poor blacks live aren't affecting all of us, to some degree. And even if we never find out what the miasma is, this possibility should scare us into treating this as the health emergency it is -- if nothing else will."}, {"text": "The Meltingest Pot\n2003-10-05T05:00:00.000Z\nThe building at 59-21 Calloway Street in Corona, Queens, is grandly named the Calloway Ch\u00e2teau, but it is really the 21st-century version of Ludlow Street, the first stop off the long-haul plane from Bukhara or Bombay. You put your bags down here, a half-hour's drive on the Grand Central Parkway from J.F.K., and pause to gather breath for the journey into the hinterland.\nThe residents of the Calloway Ch\u00e2teau are brown, white, black and olive; Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, Russian Orthodox, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist. Joseph Salvo, director of the population division at the City Planning Office, calls what's happening in Queens ''probably the greatest social experiment in history.'' It is the most ethnically diverse county in the country. In 1990, there were 243 census tracts in Queens County that were predominantly white; by 2000, the number had dropped to 116. For the past 10 years, Salvo, along with two colleagues, Arun Peter Lobo and Ronald Flores, has been charting with great specificity where different ethnic groups settle in New York. They have found that there are an increasing number of areas, dubbed ''melting-pot tracts,'' in which no single group dominates. The bar for being classified a melting-pot tract is high: there must be three separate groups who account for at least 20 percent of the population. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of melting-pot tracts in the city rose from 64 to 84. More than half of them are in Queens.\nThe Calloway Ch\u00e2teau is in Tract 437, in Corona. The tract is Hispanic-dominated as a whole (it is 52 percent Hispanic), but it is also significantly white, Asian and black. The number of people in Tract 437 who identify their ancestry as ''United States or American'' (173) are outnumbered by those who list their ancestry as ''sub-Saharan African'' (199). ''Then you break it up by block,'' Salvo says, ''and you got the U.N. in there.''\nFive of the blocks within the tract have been classified as melting-pot blocks. One of those is Calloway Street. Of the 907 residents of the block, 29 percent are Hispanic, 23 percent are white, 23 percent are Asian and 19 percent are black. ''This is extraordinary,'' Salvo says, even for Queens. ''These percentages are not typical.''\nDespite this astounding diversity, groups tend to stay within enclaves in the borough; even in mixed blocks, one group or another predominates in each individual building. When I read out the list of nationalities residing in the Calloway Ch\u00e2teau -- Uzbeks, Afghans, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Koreans, Filipinos, Ukrainians, Russians, Argentines, Colombians, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Peruvians, African-Americans, Guyanese -- Salvo draws in his breath. ''If you look at this building relative to all the buildings in Queens, this is going to stand out. Here is a rather extraordinary example of the melting-pot concept.'' While the Census Bureau doesn't compile data at the level of the individual building, it is quite possible that, for its size, the Calloway Ch\u00e2teau is the most diverse building in New York City.\nThe building has 110 apartments. It was built in 1968 as middle-class rental housing, then went co-op in 1988. In the 70's, there were a lot of South Asians living there, probably because the owner was an Indian doctor. Then a number of Uzbek Jews started moving in, directed there by a Jewish real-estate agent; their population peaked in the mid-90's. The building acquired a reputation in certain villages in Uzbekistan as a ''lucky building,'' says one tenant, Avram, who works as a cook. ''It's a building from which people go on to buy houses.'' As they saved enough money to buy houses in the suburbs, they made way for Hispanic and African-American families. Today there are very few vacancies. The exodus from New York that many observers projected after 9/11 never took place. There are actually more people living in the city now than before the catastrophe.\nAbout a quarter of the apartments are owner-occupied; the rest are rented out by the owners or by the building's sponsor. The residents range from people receiving Section 8 housing assistance to successful investment bankers who want their kids to grow up with a sense of the culture of their homelands. Most fall into the striving middle class; they work for the subway or own small shops or work in hair and nail salons. The board checks the credit histories of the tenants, but not much else. ''We don't reject anybody,'' says Orlando Medina, the 29-year-old Puerto Rican super.\nThe exterior of the seven-story building is unimpressive, all brown brick and fire escapes, but the entryway lends itself to collegiality. What was originally meant to be a driveway has been blocked to traffic by iron posts and now serves as a communal front porch. On warm evenings, Russian grandmothers stake their claim with folding chairs and tables and settle down for their nightly card games. Little girls skip rope behind them; boys ride around on their bikes. People coming home from work stop for a chat before walking into a lobby painted a vivid shade of green and going up into their apartments.\nThe incidental marvels of the Calloway Ch\u00e2teau begin in its very foundations. Seven years ago, a group of Eastern European entrepreneurs converted a disused swimming pool in the basement into a recreation center with Russian, Swedish and Turkish steam rooms; a Jacuzzi, a cold-water pool and a swimming pool; a massage room and a restaurant. It is nothing like the gleaming health clubs of Manhattan. A sign hung next to the pool orders: ''No Spitting Blowing of Nose or Urinating in Pool.'' This clientele is the least athletic of any facility devoted to physical exercise that I've ever seen. They emerge from steaming in the sauna or thrashing in the pool and promptly rush into the wood-paneled restaurant to guzzle beer and eat shish kebabs. As a result, it is an amiable place. If you're fat, you can be sure that someone fatter than you will be along before long.\nBoris Polyakov, one of the owners, sometimes regrets not having a weight room, which would draw in a younger crowd. But then he is reminded again of the real mission of his (technically co-ed) spa, where groups of naked men sit companionably, flogging themselves with birch branches: ''It's a place for men to get away from their family. There's no competition for women here. We're like a pack of wolves, barking our manhood. But it's all straight,'' he hastens to add. ''No homosexuality.''\nAs you make your way through the hallways, you notice that many of the doors of the apartments are wide open, as in a dollhouse. Within each one you can see people sleeping, watching TV, eating. Most of all, you notice the aromas of competing cuisines -- the cumin and mustard of Indian cooking, the yeasty aroma of Russian bread, the sizzling pork chops of the Latinos.\nThe most basic kind of interaction in the building is the exchanging of food. On the Muslim holy day Eid al-Adha, the Pakistanis distribute choice cuts of goat meat -- the liver and the testicles -- to the Indians; on the holiday of Dewali, the Hindus give boiled milk sweets to the Muslims. An Uzbek lady who bakes and sells big rounds of salted bread to her own people for a dollar gives it free to the Abichandani family. They are Hindu refugees from Pakistan who came via Bombay and now own four units in the building; the grandmother sometimes fetches the Uzbek woman's daughter from the school bus.\nAt the center of this flow of food is Orlando, the super. The people of the building repeatedly bestow the foods of their homelands upon him, and he tolerates it. ''I hate that fish they keep giving me,'' he says. ''Whaddyacallit? Gefilte. I throw it away.'' Orlando's wife tells me that she recently helped an elderly Russian lady fix her stove and was rewarded with a bag of potatoes. ''Don't ever take them,'' Orlando warns. ''They leave them out on the window ledge. The pigeons sleep on them.'' It was a package of mashed potatoes, she reassures him. Along with a jar of applesauce.\nWhen he is stressed, Orlando goes up to 4G to relax with Tasleem Mohammed, a Pakistani housewife with five children, who makes him curries (with few chilies; he hates spice) and gives him tea. He likes looking at the cockatiels Tasleem keeps in her living room, and he likes talking to her daughters about what they're doing in school. He talks about his own sister, his brothers back in Puerto Rico. ''Our family makes him miss them less,'' Tasleem says.\nOrlando came to the building this past spring from the Bronx. ''My last building was very close to hell,'' he says. He recalls finding a large, heavy box in its garbage area that he assumed a tenant had stuffed with construction material. He kicked it out of frustration, then ripped open the plastic garbage bag covering it and found a nearly decapitated human head loosely attached to a skinny old man's body.\nSo he moved with his family to the Calloway Ch\u00e2teau. He is a cheerful super. Every day he walks his two children to school and back; one of the tenants has prevailed upon him to take her two children along as well. The building functions on a system of exchange of goods and services. Rajesh Abichandani works for the Postal Service. He regularly brings home packages for the building's residents to save them the trip to the post office. If you look closely, you'll notice that many of the men and boys in the building sport the same bad haircut. Rajesh's neighbor Boris is the building's official barber. He will come to your apartment and cut your children's hair. In return you might lend him a Bollywood movie, which nearly everyone in the building seems to have developed an appreciation for. (For a while, everybody -- Latinos, Russians, Indians -- was also hooked on a popular Spanish telenovela that had all the Bollywood themes, but was shot on a lower budget and without the elephants.) Jos\u00e9, in 5H, fixed the plumbing in Rajesh's kitchen; the electrician on the fourth floor has fixed his light and fan; Artur, the Ukrainian in 2C, fixes his computer and TV.\nThe residents bring to Artur's attention a multicultural hodgepodge of electronics of Israeli, Asian, European and Russian design; VCR's that play formats unknown in the Western Hemisphere. Artur gets on the Internet and downloads whatever manuals he can. ''I get the schematic to see how it works,'' he says. ''It's a lot different.''\nThe building also takes care of its sick. ''In this building, anybody's sick, everybody know what's going on,'' Tasleem says. Remedies are constantly being proposed, many of them involving the sustained use of homemade laxatives and antacids. Detailed conversations about the intestinal tract and its proper function are not considered impolite. Again, Orlando is the target of much of the free medical advice. When he had an upset stomach, an Argentinean woman told him to boil an herb named ruda and drink it. When he had a headache, Tasleem advised him to get plain white yogurt and spread it all over his head. For his sore throat, a Russian woman suggested that he gargle with salt and baking soda. When his daughter had an earache, an Indian woman told him to heat a clove of garlic in some oil, throw away the garlic and drip the warm oil in his daughter's ear. He tried it out on her, and it worked. ''Another lady from Russia said you take milk, olive oil and salt, and you warm it up and soak your feet in it,'' he tells me. ''That will make them smooth and nice.''\nThe building is not without its tensions. Kids sometimes run around throwing garbage through the open doors of apartments. The co-op board and the sponsor have had uneasy relations with many of the tenants, over parking fees, for example, which were recently lowered after much tenant agitation. I ask a group of Bukharan grandmothers out in front about their relations with the Latinos. One of them, with her legs propped on the card table and her nightgown riding up, says, ''We don't say anything to them; they don't say anything to us.'' She disapproves of the way the Spanish girls wear miniskirts and smooch with their boyfriends. ''The boys put their hands on their thighs,'' she exclaims.\nOne of the Latino apartments had 15 people in a one-bedroom, the Russian woman remembers disapprovingly. But at the same time, when a Latino family's apartment was burned down, they all gave money to help them -- Russians, Indians, everybody.\nIn a coffee shop at the BP gas station nearby, I talk to Imran Ahmed, who moved from New Jersey to the Calloway Ch\u00e2teau because he wanted his children to experience Pakistani culture. A sign near the cashier advertises: ''American Flags -- Show Your True Colors.'' Imran is a Pakistani with an M.B.A. from Berkeley. Last year, he was in line to be the C.F.O. of the semiprivate city agency he works for. He was passed over for a promotion because, he guesses, he is Pakistani. After 9/11, he says, he feels unsure of his future in the country. ''Thirteen hundred Pakistanis they forced to leave,'' he says bitterly. ''Then you see those WorldCom and Enron people stealing billions of dollars, and they walk away. How can I base my future on such a place?''\nImran says that when Pakistanis were rounded up by the F.B.I., the Jews in his office joked with him, ''Are you one of those?'' But he holds no grudge against Jews in general, he says, because he lives and interacts with them in the building.\nAlthough the older residents of the Calloway Ch\u00e2teau studiously avoid talking about politics and the violent disputes between many of their homelands, the children aren't always so reticent. ''My kids talk with the Jewish kids when they're playing PlayStation,'' says Tasleem. ''They say: 'Why are they fighting? We are Jewish and Muslim and not fighting.' '' Thus it is that Indians and Pakistanis, whose countries are at each other's throats, find that their differences here are overwhelmed by their commonalities; that the Arejas, a Hindu family that had to flee Kandahar during the days of the Taliban, are lent money to buy a fried-chicken franchise by the Afghan Pathan owners who are selling it to them; that Avram, an Uzbek Jewish cook, tells me that he bears no grudge against the Uzbek Muslims who forbade the teaching of Hebrew and denied him a university place in Bukhara.\n''In this building, we have fights and arguments, but it's never about race,'' Orlando notes. ''It's about 'He left something in front of my door.' Never about race.''\nThere is one minority that seems excluded, though maybe not consciously, from the commerce of the building. Willie Mayzck is not Polish but African-American, from South Carolina, one of the few black tenants in the building. He doesn't know any of his neighbors' names; his conversation with them is restricted to hello and goodbye as he goes back and forth to his two jobs. ''They don't speak my language,'' he says, but he is not displeased with the building. ''It's not a racial building,'' he says. But he keeps to himself. ''I wouldn't know about the immigrants. They don't touch me at all.''\nThe building also has an active internal love life. Neighbors remember the Uzbek Jewish teenager who was in love with a Pakistani boy. They were together all the time, and she would come up to Monisha Abichandani's apartment to get her hands painted with henna like the South Asian girls, learn how to wear Indian clothes and watch the latest Hindi movies. It all got to be too much for her parents, and eventually she broke up with her boyfriend and married an Uzbek man, with whom she had kids and lives in Forest Hills. As an Uzbek man explains to me, ''You can have love affairs with people from other cultures, but when it comes to marriage, you have to come home.''\nShort of marriage, though, the building enjoys a vibrant dating scene, and not just across cultures. Victor, 65, is a Filipino accountant for a shipping company and has been living in the building since 1974. He's had a successful run among ladies in the building much younger than he is. There was the 25-year-old Pakistani woman who at the time they dated was 20 years his junior. They saw each other discreetly for a year, and then her parents arranged a marriage with a man from her homeland. Then there was another woman from the building, a 30-ish ''American'' -- a white woman. His current girlfriend is a 40-year-old Colombian. He sometimes refers to her as his fianc\u00e9e, but then thinks better of it. With a sly smile, he says, ''I like to taste different kinds of food.''\nUsman, who lives in the basement, has not had quite the same experience. He lives next to the meter room, in a small space that contains four beds and little else. The beds are occupied by Usman and three other Muslims from Samarkand, in Uzbekistan. The room is lined with three gorgeous woolen rugs that his brothers have sent. In the spaces above the rugs are pictures of Uzbek models, torn out of magazines, and a large black-and-white photograph of a woman sleeping on a bed, her buttocks prominently presented. It competes for your attention with a poster of Samarkand, the turquoise domes of its mosques and mausoleums illuminating the dim basement.\nOn the dressing table is a row of bottles and aerosol cans, perfumes alternating with insecticides. I ask him if his room has rats. He raises his hand, runs his fingers along an invisible track and makes a scuttling sound. ''I kill one for you tomorrow,'' he says. He traps them between the door and the wall and then hits them with a stick. Tail to head, they are half the length of his arm.\nUsman brings out trays of mints, rock candy, walnuts and raisins from his homeland. He puts them out on the tablecloth, a Russian newspaper opened to the obituaries page. ''Pilaf?'' he offers, lifting the lid of a cast-iron pot, revealing a pile of rice and meat. He's been here for six years; he's working to send money back to his wife, who has to have a heart operation. He also sends money to his daughter to study law in Tashkent. He speaks to his family twice weekly, using a $5 phone card that gives him 25 minutes of connection with them.\nUsman's room has two views. The first is through a window up by the ceiling: a red-and-white sign that says, No Parking 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday. The other is on a television screen, on which a video shows a continuous procession of men feasting in the courtyard of a large white house. It is the inauguration of Usman's house, or rather, the house that Usman's money built. The house has two levels, and each bedroom has its own bathroom. The wooden furniture looks solid, the carpets look expensive. There is no dialogue on the video, but a tamboura is being played by a solemn-faced musician wearing a suit. Usman received the video from his family; he has a drawer that is stacked with them, movie-length postcards from home. They are filled with shots of Samarkand, of markets full of fresh produce and halvah, trucks full of bread, scenes of Usman's friends and relatives and imams praying at his new house, which he has never set foot in.\nI look around and think: it can't be much of a life, always working, always in want of a woman. Then I realize why he watches the videos so intently. In the cramped basement, this is his transcendence. He needs something to work for: his family's house, his wife's medical care, his daughter's education. The videos reaffirm his status as provider. And then he can sleep contentedly on his threadbare mattress, with the rodents scuttling overhead, the laundry machines whirring next door.\nAnd there is this: in the Calloway Ch\u00e2teau, even a migrant worker in the basement is part of a community. Usman does odd jobs for people in the building -- he fixes a faucet, hangs a picture, patches a wall. He has good friends on the third floor, a Jewish family also from Uzbekistan. Once, he felt sharp pains in his stomach, and they took him to St. John's Queens Hospital, where he was discovered to have intestinal bleeding; he needed a blood transfusion. When the Jewish family went to Samarkand to visit their parents' cemetery, they were fearful about their security in the Muslim country. Usman arranged for his family and friends to be their hosts and to take good care of them.\nAt the end of a hard day, Orlando likes to relax in front of his aquarium. It contains brightly colored tropical fish, an anemone with its creamy white tentacles unfurling and waving in the currents of the tank, starfish, squid, crayfish and shrimp hiding among the rocks. Although there's a little blue fish that sometimes nips the bigger fish, they generally leave each other alone, he tells me. ''It's like our building,'' he says, crumbling a green sheet of algae into the water as the fish race up to take little nibbles from his hand. ''They don't eat each other.''"}, {"text": "Midnight Minus One\n2003-03-23T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE POINT OF RETURN\nBy Siddhartha Deb.\n304 pp. New York:\nEcco/HarperCollins Publishers. $24.95.\nNAIPAUL has had it with the novel, or so he claimed a few years ago in ''Reading and Writing: A Personal Account.'' ''The late 20th century,'' he wrote, ''surfeited with news . . . threatening again to be as full of tribal or folk movement as during the centuries of the Roman Empire, needs another kind of interpretation. But the novel . . . can subtly distort the unaccommodating new reality.''\nIt can, but that doesn't have to be a disadvantage. And a number of young novelists with Indian backgrounds have recently discovered that the distorted perceptions Naipaul warned against can be the subject of fresh and moving realist fiction. Last year's overlooked gem, ''Stealing the Ambassador,'' by the American-born Sameer Parekh, cannily updated the coming-of-age novel for these harsh times. And now, in his first novel, ''The Point of Return,'' Siddhartha Deb, born in 1970 in northeastern India and currently living in the United States, has imagined a kind of Indian Don Quixote. His memorable protagonist, Dr. Dam, a veterinary surgeon and devoted public servant, clings to an outmoded vision of his country as a secular democracy where tolerance, rationality and initiative can prevail. In reality, thuggishness, terror, ethnic violence, family feuds and hopelessly entrenched political corruption beset him all his days.\nDr. Dam's name is his fate. It attracts curses that this mild-mannered man fails to recognize as such. It also evokes a by now discredited vision of progress through science and engineering and large public works. Short and stocky, with pale skin and gray eyes (as if the British Raj were in his very blood), Dr. Dam embodies a whole generation -- not midnight's children, but midnight minus one.\nBorn under British rule, 21 years old when India achieved independence, Dr. Dam is always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Partition drove his Hindu family out of Muslim East Bengal (East Pakistan, still later Bangladesh) across the border into the Indian state of Assam, where, as the oldest son of a large family, he managed to resettle his entire clan, postponing marriage and fatherhood until he was middle aged. In Assam, he was able to make a decent life for his wife and only child, a son named Babu -- until ethnic violence between Hindus and tribal groups erupted and he found himself once more on the wrong side of history.\nDr. Dam speaks in clipped monosyllables, like his British predecessors. Like Gandhi, he scorns the perks of public office, even if it leaves him in cheap, much-repaired Chinese shoes and his family housed in a rat-infested slum. He belongs to a vanishing class -- the sort of modest, small-town professionals enshrined in the Malgudi novels of R. K. Narayan. The settlement he calls home is itself a British creation, a mile-high hill station known as the ''Scotland of the East.'' But Dr. Dam never forgets that his parents and grandparents were desperately poor villagers, and when he shocks his middle-class neighbors by hoeing the soil in his backyard he evokes not only the thwarted dignity of his peasant forebears but the great Hindu literary tradition of writers like Premchand.\nWhat holds the novel together, what provides its many heart-stopping moments, is the pathos of a failed father-son relationship. Babu, sometimes merely disaffected, sometimes downright cruel to his milquetoast father, is the novel's narrator. Dr. Dam's life, as his son sees it while he is growing up, is a series of failures.\nEven in retirement, Dr. Dam is thwarted. He goes to collect a pension check promised by a minister of the local state at the very moment the government falls and the minister is ousted. He hauls cement 250 miles over treacherous mountain roads to build a retirement house, only to have the bags harden into useless hillocks under the monsoon rains. Corrupt tribal politicians torpedo his proud scheme to improve the local milk supply. He's punished twice for a visit by Danish agronomists -- once by the Danes, with their offensive personal questions, and then by the Indian intelligence service, which suspects him of harboring NATO spies.\nThe novel unspools these vignettes in reverse chronology, so that Dr. Dam's life moves from defeat to aspiration. He is doomed, the reader knows, from the very beginning. Sentence first, verdict afterward -- there's a kind of cruelly absurd Alice in Wonderland logic to Dr. Dam's career. The retrogression also suggests the grown son's desperate search, too late, for clues to his laconic father's inner life.\nThese emerge most clearly in one pitch-perfect chapter called ''A Tale About Tigers.'' Ethnic riots have forced Dr. Dam and his wife and child to take refuge in the two basement storerooms of a mansion in a safe part of town. Three straight days of monsoon rain loosen Dr. Dam's tongue, and he offers to tell his son a story. Babu wants an adventure, with heroic action and the triumph of good over evil. But his father has only his own life to offer as a text -- so he tells of the time he spent his entire scholarship stipend of four rupees on his first pair of shoes and was beaten for it by his father, who threw the shoes into the dung heap. (Shoes -- the purchase, conservation or loss thereof -- are the novel's telling leitmotif.) When the child rejects this story, his father comes up with another, about a tiger that stalked him one night in his isolated bungalow, drawn by a sick cow he was boarding for a villager. Again the ending disappoints the child: his father did not pick up a gun and shoot the tiger. For Dr. Dam, though, it suffices that ''everybody's fine at the end. Me, the cows. The tiger too.''\nJust how far from the Indian reality is Dr. Dam's benevolent vision of a world in which cows and tigers peacefully coexist? This becomes clear in the book's final chapters when Babu, now a grown man, a journalist, returns to his hometown after years away and fills in the gaps in his father's antiquated, willfully restricted worldview. Mob rule, massacres, riots, nights spent cowering in terror were in fact the principal elements of life in the place his family loved.\nTo allow Dr. Dam to evolve through most of the book in a self-generated fog of benevolence and to shatter it in the last pages is a brilliant stroke (surely Naipaul would approve), and yet these last chapters somehow disappoint. They read like a smart reporter's expos\u00e9 of hard times, presenting a handy microcosm of ethnic and religious violence. Editorials are a dime a dozen. Storytelling of the kind Deb lavishes, for most of his book, on Dr. Dam is rare and precious and uplifting."}, {"text": "African Girls' Route to School Is Still Littered With Obstacles\n2003-12-14T05:00:00.000Z\nFor as long as anyone could remember, the girls of this village had been forbidden to go to school. They were to be educated instead by the local voodoo priest, in a secret rite of passage not to be spoken about to anyone. When they finished, they were to be married. They and their children were to forever enjoy the protection of the voodoo priest.\nThat was until six years ago, when, with prodding from local government and United Nations officials, an extraordinary deal was struck. Every family in Koutagba could send one girl to school, the priest agreed, so long as it also sent another to him.\nThe mothers of the village fell on their knees, laid bottles of home-brew at his feet and prayed. Two years ago, two Koutagba girls finished primary school. Today, 8 of the 27 pupils in fifth grade are girls. So is nearly half of the first grade.\nThe story of this tiny, remote hamlet in the heart of West Africa offers a metaphor for the challenges facing girls' education on the continent.\nIn spite of the steady progress in increasing school enrollment in sub-Saharan Africa, only 59 percent of all children attended primary school from 1996 to 2002, the lowest percentage of any region in the world, according to a report released Thursday by the United Nations Children's Fund, or Unicef.\nFor girls, because of a mix of traditional mores, crippling poverty and a lack of international aid for education, the numbers are even lower. Only 57 percent of girls were enrolled during the same period -- again, by far the lowest rate worldwide, according to the Unicef report. (In South Asia, by comparison, girls' enrollment reached 71 percent during the same period, and in the Middle East and North Africa 75 percent.)\nPerhaps most alarming of all, the number of girls out of school in sub-Saharan Africa rose over the last decade, to 24 million in 2002 from 20 million in 1990, according to the Unicef report. The costs of leaving girls out of school have already proved to be high, researchers say. Uneducated girls are more prone to live in poverty as adults, die in childbirth, contract H.I.V. and raise children who, in turn, are likely to be poor and in ill health.\nA report released by Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, in November painted an equally bleak picture, shining a light on the gender gap in countries like this one. While girls' enrollment in Benin increased by 9 percent over five years, the gap between boys and girls remains among the highest anywhere.\nThe latest reports stand in the face of recent pledges made by world leaders. Reaching gender parity by 2005 was among the principal development goals at the United Nations Millennium Summit meeting three years ago, along with reducing infant mortality and hunger. Reaching the education target in sub-Saharan Africa now appears unlikely, if not impossible.\n''It would be criminal to fail on that goal,'' Carol Bellamy, executive director of Unicef, said in a telephone interview. ''We believe that girls' education may be the single most important investment you can make to propel not only education for all, but several of the millennium development goals.''\nMs. Bellamy singled out school fees, which were a fixture of World Bank-led economic reform packages for the last decade, as the largest obstacle to girls' education. In societies where girls are considered unworthy of the investment, many poor parents pay for their sons, not their daughters, to go to school. Girls are put to work, helping their mothers fetch water and firewood, caring for younger siblings, sweeping and cooking. Persuading mothers to send daughters to school is often a formidable practical challenge. In some places, nurseries have been set up to relieve young girls of baby-sitting chores; in others, wells have been installed close to schools to save the girls from long walks.\nEducation specialists also point a finger at donor countries. Overall development aid has shrunk, and financing for education has fallen. Even a much-lauded education program begun by the World Bank two years ago, the Fast Track Initiative, remains woefully underfinanced.\nThat, advocates argue, has hurt ostensibly well-meaning nations. Niger, for instance, locked in the Sahara and among the world's poorest countries, drafted an ambitious $96 million proposal to establish free primary education. But the country has received barely half the aid it needs, according to a recent study by the Global Campaign for Education, a coalition of development groups. Only 24 percent of girls and 36 percent of boys now attend school.\nMany other factors conspire against girls' education as well, most notably the practice of marrying off girls as soon as they reach adolescence. In West and Central Africa, war has shuttered many schools. Across the continent, AIDS has robbed communities of breadwinners, leaving untold numbers of children to care for their families.\nIn the latest Unicef report, countries in West and Central Africa scored lowest in the gender parity index, a ratio of girls to boys enrolled in school. In Benin and Niger, for instance, the ratio was just under 0.70, compared to nearly full parity, or 1.00 on the index, in Iran and Bangladesh. Beyond sub-Saharan Africa, only Pakistan hovered close to the bottom, with a gender parity index below 0.70.\nThe turnaround for Koutagba in Benin came in April 1997, with the arrival of a strange apparition. Riding up the narrow dirt road on a scooter came Regina Guedou, a woman with a college degree. She came to tell villagers about how they could profit from sending their daughters to school. At first, Ms. Guedou recalled, the women of the village did not even speak to her.\nMs. Guedou was a liaison between the local government, the villagers and Unicef. Slowly, she got the villagers' attention. The girls would learn to read a thermometer and be able to figure out if a baby had a fever, she told them. They could help their mothers compute the costs of buying and selling their peanuts at the market. She told them their girls could one day ride a scooter all the way to the nearest small town.\nShe finally won their trust by offering a Unicef-underwritten loan for $700, a huge amount in this country.\nThe women were to use the money to buy food from the nearest small town, and to bring it back to sell. In exchange, the mothers agreed to send a daughter to school.\nThe voodoo priest, Mamassa Babalakoun, was apparently convinced of the merits as well. His youngest daughter is now in the fifth grade.\nThe priest was not available to speak to a visiting journalist on a recent day. But his representatives spoke on his behalf, making it plain that while they believed that girls' education could one day profit their community, they were worried that tradition -- and in turn, their own influence over the affairs of the village -- would be overwhelmed.\n''The fetish existed before the school,'' said one, who called himself the priest's spokesman. ''Each one has to respect the other.''\nMs. Guedou was there, speaking to the representatives with shoes off, hands behind her back, bowing ever so slightly between sentences. Tact is of the essence in such communications.\nThe priest's representatives added that girls who were educated could become government ministers and doctors. They could help care for their parents.\nA group of village men sat on a log in the shade and listened intently. One's T-shirt bore the image of Tupac Shakur; another's Osama bin Laden; a third, an American slogan against drug abuse.\nBehind the priest's compound lived an illiterate woman named Egbin Setati, quietly smashing tradition. Neither of her two daughters, ages 9 and 7, were going to go to the priest. They were both in school."}, {"text": "With Little Loans, Mexican Women Overcome\n2003-03-19T05:00:00.000Z\nGuadalupe Castillo Ure\u00f1a was widowed at 31, left alone with five children when her husband died trying to get to the United States from their hut here in the foothills of Mexico's southern Sierras.\nShe was among the poorest of the poor -- scraping by, like half the people in Mexico, and half the world's six billion people, on $2 a day or less, barely surviving.\nThen an organization called Finca came to the village. It asked the women there -- and only the women -- whether they would be interested in borrowing a little money, at the stiff interest rate of 6 percent a month, to start their own businesses.\nChange came. With a loan of about $250, Ms. Ure\u00f1a, now 35, started making hundreds of clay pots this winter. With Finca's help, they were sold in bulk to a wholesaler, who sells them in the city. She pocketed $15 to $20 a week in profit. That sum, the first real money she had ever earned, was enough to help feed her children and pay their school expenses.\n''It's exhausting,'' she said, ''kneading the mud, stoking the kiln. But it's something. An opportunity.''\nThese small loans, known as microcredit or microfinance, are not a charity. They are a growing business that is producing wealth in some of the world's poorest countries.\nExperience has taught the lenders to make nearly all their loans -- 95 percent or more -- to women, and preferably those like Ms. Ure\u00f1a who are single mothers.\n''Why only women?'' said Alejandra Ayala, 36, a participant from this village 100 miles southeast of Mexico City. ''Everyone knows women have the capacity to do this. Running a family, running a business, what's the difference?''\nCarlos Labarte, director general of Compartamos, a larger group loaning to the poor in Mexico, had his own answer: ''The men are not here. They've gone to the United States. Or maybe they're just gone. Or they've died. This is not philosophy. This is reality.''\nIn Mexico alone, companies making these loans are reaching hundreds of thousands of women and children. Those women borrowed and repaid tens of millions of dollars in the last two years. Their default rate on these loans averages 2 percent, considered unusually low in the developed world.\nThe sums loaned are tiny by most standards, a few hundred dollars in most cases. But they represent a chance for the poor to acquire a little bit of wealth. The money the loans help generate can ensure that a child can attend school or that her mother can buy medicine.\nThat counts for something in a world where rich and poor nations are undergoing financial shocks, wealthy donors are suffering from compassion fatigue and governments everywhere have thrown up their hands at the failure of antipoverty programs and development schemes.\nIn Mexico, the best-run little village lenders have grown into something closely resembling banks. That is something new in Mexico. Commerical banks in this country are for rich people. They almost never serve the middle class or the poor, rarely if ever providing them with savings accounts, much less loans or credit.\n''People who have nothing to eat and no table to eat on have no trust in institutions,'' said Serapio Reyes, who oversees 10,300 Finca clients from Cuatla, a two-hour drive southeast of Mexico City.\n''They need an institution like us to have a semblance of an economic or financial life,'' said Mr. Reyes. ''They certainly do not have access to a commercial bank. But they have us. And we are an institution based on trust.''\nMost of the 32 small loan institutions now operating in Mexico started in the 1990's. For many, seed money came from private American foundations or, in at least one case, the United States Agency for International Development. Many are modeled on the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, run by an American-educated economist named Muhammad Yunis, which now lends roughly $1.2 billion to 2.4 million poor people, overwhelmingly women.\nThousands of village banks based on Mr. Yunis's model have started around the world. But the most successful of these are now outgrowing their modest beginnings.\nCompartamos, which is based in Mexico City and whose name means Let's Share, started making loans in 1990. With 140,000 clients today -- 98 percent of them women -- it has a loan portfolio of $45 million and a default rate of just over 2 percent. Compartamos may not be Citibank, but it has the potential to offer more poor people more financial services than any commercial bank in Mexico ever has.\n''People don't just need credit,'' said Mr. Labarte, Compartamos's director general. ''They need financial services. They need savings accounts. They need insurance, life insurance, education insurance. These are things that no middle-class person, no poor person, has ever had in Mexico.''\nLike big banks, institutions that make these small loans can be damaged or destroyed by financial crises or by fraud. Finca's Mexico operation had to restart seven years ago, its managers say, after the peso collapsed and one local manager quit unexpectedly.\nThe established small loan groups like Finca, whose name means farm, and Compartamos have learned some fundamental lessons about what works and what does not work when it comes to fighting poverty.\nWhat works, first of all, is loaning money to women.\n''When you walk into a village, you do not consult the mayor and you do not consult the priest,'' said John Hatch, Finca's executive director. ''You ask, 'Who is the woman in this community that everyone most respects?' Then you ask that woman, 'Would you be willing to convene a meeting at your house?' And at the meeting we start the bank.''\nThe women in San Marcos Acteopan said they reacted with a rainbow of emotions after Finca came to town last year, from fear to fascination. The idea that someone was going to lend them money to start businesses was riveting.\nWhat is also working -- and this is very new -- goes beyond lending money to providing poor people with the ability to save and invest. This has become possible under a new federal law in Mexico providing a legal architecture and regulations for village banks and small loans.\nThose measures help combat the fiscal amateurism that had financially threatened some lending organizations, said Mary O'Keefe, who helped start Finca's operations in Mexico 10 years ago and now works as a consultant to the World Bank.\nThe breakthrough under Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, she said, ''is the realization that poor people are deserving of financial services.''\n''The trick'', she said, ''is to create savings. The fact is that poor people can save money.''\nThis fact qualifies as something of a revelation to economists: that given the chance, poor people would put their money into a certificate of deposit, rather than spending it, stashing it under a mattress, or fattening a pig for market.\nWhat does not work in this kind of war on poverty, experience shows, is letting the government run things. When Mr. Fox announced that he was starting a government small-loan program back in December 2000, a week after he took office, Mr. Yunis, the godfather of microcredit, talked him out of it. ''Politicians are interested in the votes of the poor,'' said Mr. Yunis, whose Grameen bank now has three branches in Mexico. ''Politicians are not interested in getting the money back.''\nMr. Reyes of Finca Mexico said demand for the loans was so great that he anticipated serving 58,000 clients by 2007, up from 10,300 today.\nAmong those clients is Escol\u00e1stica Medina, 43, of San Marcos Acteopan, who borrowed the equivalent of $500 from Finca late last year.\nWith the money she bought mud and firewood to make about 1,600 clay pots. She sold them over 15 weeks for about $800, with $110 in interest going back to Finca, an effective annual rate about five times higher than any United States credit card company could legally charge.\nShe kept about $190 -- ''a little money for when my children need something -- enough for food, for school, for their health.'' Now, she said, ''I feel equal to anyone.''"}, {"text": "Bush Delivers Remarks to the U.N. General Assembly\n2003-09-23T05:00:00.000Z\n The following is the text of President George W. Bush's remarks to the General Assembly as recorded by FDCH e-Media, Inc. \n Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 24 months ago--and yesterday in the memory of America--the center of New York City became a battlefield and a graveyard and the symbol of an unfinished war. Since that day, terrorists have struck in Bali, in Mombasa, in Casablanca, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in Jerusalem--measuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and innocent suffering they leave behind. \n Last month, terrorists brought their war to the United Nations itself. \n The U.N. headquarters in Baghdad stood for order and compassion, and for that reason the terrorists decided it must be destroyed. \n Among the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio Vieira de Mello. Over the decades, this good and brave man from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in Bangladesh, Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon, Cambodia, Central Africa, Kosovo and East Timor, and was aiding the people of Iraq in their time of need. America joins you, his colleagues, in honoring the memory of Senor Vieira Mello and the memory of all who died with him in the service to the United Nations. \n By the victims they choose and by the means they use, the terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in. Those who target relief workers for death have set themselves against all humanity. Those who incite murder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for life itself. They have no place in any religious faith, they have no claim on the world's sympathy, and they should have no friend in this chamber. \n Events during the past two years have set before us the clearest of divides: between those who seek order and those who spread chaos; between those who work for peaceful change and those who adopt the methods of gangsters; between those who honor the rights of man and those who deliberately take the lives of men and women and children without mercy or shame. \n Between these alternatives there is no neutral ground. All governments that support terror are complicit in a war against civilization. No government should ignore the threat of terror, because to look the other way gives terrorists the chance to regroup and recruit and prepare. And all nations that fight terror as if the lives of their own people depend on it will earn the favorable judgment of history. \n The former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew these alternatives and made their choices. \n The Taliban was a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When confronted, that regime chose defiance, and that regime is no more. \n Afghanistan's president, who is here today, now represents a free people who are building a decent and just society. They're building a nation fully joined in the war against terror. \n The regime of Saddam Hussein cultivated ties to terror while it built weapons of mass destruction. It used those weapons in acts of mass murder and refused to account for them when confronted by the world. \n The Security Council was right to be alarmed. The Security Council was right to demand that Iraq destroy its illegal weapons and prove that it had done so. \n The Security Council was right to vow serious consequences if Iraq refused to comply. And because there were consequences, because a coalition of nations acted to defend the peace and the credibility of the United Nations, Iraq is free. And today we are joined by representatives of a liberated country. \n Saddam Hussein's monuments have been removed and not only his statues. The true monuments of his rule and his character--the torture chambers and the rape rooms and the prison cells for innocent children--are closed. And as we discover the killing fields and mass graves of Iraq, the true scale of Saddam's cruelty is being revealed. \n The Iraqi people are meeting hardships and challenges, like every nation that has set out on the path of democracy, yet their future promises lives of dignity and freedom. And that is a world away from the squalid, vicious tyranny they have known. \n Across Iraq, life is being improved by liberty. Across the Middle East, people are safer because an unstable aggressor has been removed from power. Across the world, nations are more secure because an ally of terror has fallen. \n Our actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were supported by many governments and America is grateful to each one. \n I also recognize that some of the sovereign nations of this assembly disagreed with our actions. Yet there was and there remains unity among us on the fundamental principles and objectives of the United Nations. \n We are dedicated to the defense of our collective security and to the advance of human rights. These permanent commitments call us to great work in the world; work we must do together. \n So let us move forward. \n First, we must stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable countries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight this progress above all, because free people embrace hope over resentment and choose peace over violence. \n The United Nations has been a friend of the Afghan people, distributing food and medicine, helping refugees return home, advising on a new constitution, and helping to prepare the way for nationwide elections. \n NATO has taken over the U.N.-mandated security force in Kabul. American and coalition forces continue to track and defeat Al Qaida terrorists and remnants of the Taliban. \n Our efforts to rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposed to spend an additional $1.2 billion dollars for the Afghan reconstruction effort, and I urge other nations to continue contributing to this important cause. \n In the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is carrying out vital and effective work every day. \n By the end of 2004, more than 90 percent of Iraqi children under age 5 will have been immunized against preventable diseases, such as polio, tuberculosis, and measles, thanks to the hard work and high ideals of UNICEF. Iraq's food distribution system is operational, delivering nearly a half million tons of food per month, thanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food Programme. \n Our international coalition in Iraq is meeting its responsibilities. We are conducting precision raids against terrorists and holdouts of the former regime. These killers are at war with the Iraqi people, they have made Iraq the central front in the war on terror, and they will be defeated. \n Our coalition has made sure that Iraq's former dictator will never again use weapons of mass destruction. \n We are interviewing Iraqi citizens and analyzing records of the old regime to reveal the full extent of its weapons programs and its long campaign of deception. We are training Iraqi police and border guards and a new army, so the Iraqi people can assume full responsibility for their own security. \n And at the same time, our coalition is helping to improve the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The old regime built palaces while letting schools decay, so we are rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The old regime starved hospitals of resources, so we have helped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The old regime built up armies and weapons while allowing the nation's infrastructure to crumble, so we are rehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation facilities, bridges and airports. \n And I have proposed to Congress that the United States provide additional funding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial commitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan. Having helped to liberate Iraq, we will honor our pledges to Iraq. And by helping the Iraqi people build a stable and peaceful country, we will make our own countries more secure. \n The primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-government for the people of Iraq, reached by orderly and democratic process. \n This process must unfold according to the needs of Iraqis, neither hurried nor delayed by the wishes of other parties. \n And the United Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of Iraq self-government. America is working with friends and allies on a new Security Council resolution which will expand the U.N.'s role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of other conflicts, the United Nations should assist in developing a constitution, in training civil servants, and conducting free and fair elections. \n Iraq now has a governing council; the first truly representative institution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are showing the openness and tolerance that democracy requires and also showing courage. \n Yet every young democracy needs the help of friends. Now the nation of Iraq needs and deserves our aid, and all nations of goodwill should step forward and provide that support. \n Success of a free Iraq will be watched and noted throughout the region. Millions will see that freedom, equality and material progress are possible at the heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will face the clearest evidence that free institutions and open societies are the only path to long-term national success and dignity. \n And a transformed Middle East would benefit the entire world by undermining the ideologies that export violence to other lands. \n Iraq, as a dictatorship, had great power to destabilize the Middle East. Iraq, as a democracy, will have great power to inspire the Middle East. \n The advance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an example that others, including the Palestinian people, would be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause is betrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old hatreds and destroying the good work of others. The Palestinian people deserve their own state and they will gain that state by embracing new leaders committed to reform, to fighting terror and to building peace. \n All parties in the Middle East must meet their responsibilities and carry out the commitments they made at Aqaba. Israel must work to create the conditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian state to emerge and Arab nations must cut off funding and other support for terrorist organizations. \n America will work with every nation in the region that acts boldly for the sake of peace. \n A second challenge we must confront together is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Outlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the means to deliver them would be able to use blackmail and create chaos in entire regions. These weapons could be used by terrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a scale we can scarcely imagine. \n The deadly combination of outlaw regimes and terror networks and weapons of mass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished away. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize, all words, all protests will come too late. \n Nations of the world must have the wisdom and the will to stop grave threats before they arrive. \n One crucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at their source. For more than a decade, the United States has worked with Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union to dismantle, destroy or secure weapons and dangerous materials left over from another era. Last year in Canada, the G-8 nations agreed to provide up to $20 billion--half of it from the United States--to fight this proliferation risk over the next 10 years. \n Since then, six additional countries have joined the effort. More are needed, and I urge other nations to help us meet this danger. \n We are also improving our capability to interdict lethal materials in transit. Through our Proliferation Security Initiative, 11 nations are preparing to search planes and ships, trains and trucks carrying suspect cargo, and to seize weapons or missile shipments that raise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed on a set of interdiction principles, consistent with current legal authorities. And we are working to expand the Proliferation Security Initiative to other countries. We are determined to keep the world's most destructive weapons away from all our shores and out of the hands of our common enemies. \n Because proliferators will use any route or channel that is open to them, we need the broadest possible cooperation to stop them. Today, I ask the U.N. Security Council to adopt a new anti-proliferation resolution. \n This resolution should call on all members of the U.N. to criminalize the proliferation of weapons--weapons of mass destruction, to enact strict export controls consistent with international standards, and to secure any and all sensitive materials within their own borders. The United States stands ready to help any nation draft these new laws and to assist in their enforcement. \n A third challenge we share is a challenge to our conscience. We must act decisively to meet the humanitarian crises of our time. The United States has begun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scale and treating millions who have the disease already. We have pledged $15 billion over five years to fight AIDS around the world. \n My country is acting to save lives from famine as well, providing more than $1.4 billion in global emergency food aid. And I've asked our United States Congress for $200 million for a new famine fund, so we can act quickly when the first signs of famine appear. Every nation on every continent should generously add their resources to the fight against disease and desperate hunger. \n There's another humanitarian crisis spreading, yet hidden from view. Each year an estimated 800,000 to 900,000 human beings are bought, sold or forced across the world's borders. Among them are hundreds of thousands of teenage girls, and others as young as 5, who fall victim to the sex trade. This commerce in human life generates billions of dollars each year, much of which is used to finance organized crime. \n There's a special evil in the abuse and exploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. \n The victims of sex trade see little of life before they see the very worst of life: an underground of brutality and lonely fear. \n Those who create these victims and profit from their suffering must be severely punished. Those who patronize this industry debase themselves and deepen the misery of others. And governments that tolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery. \n This problem has appeared in my own country and we are working to stop it. The PROTECT Act, which I signed into law this year, makes it a crime for any person to enter the United States or for any citizen to travel abroad for the purpose of sex tourism involving children. The Department of Justice is actively investigating sex tour operators and patrons, who can face up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the United States is using sanctions against governments to discourage human trafficking. \n The victims of this industry also need help from members of the United Nations, and this begins with clear standards and the certainty of punishment under the laws of every country. \n Today, some nations make it a crime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct should be a crime in all nations. Governments should inform travelers of the harm this industry does and the severe punishments that will fall on its patrons. \n The American government is committing $50 million to support the good work of organizations that are rescuing women and children from exploitation, and giving them shelter and medical treatment and the hope of a new life. I urge other governments to do their part. \n We must show new energy in fighting back an old evil. \n Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and more than a century after slavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the trade in human beings for any purpose must not be allowed to thrive in our time. \n All the challenges I have spoken of this morning require urgent attention and moral clarity. Helping Afghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in a transformed region, cutting off the avenues of proliferation, abolishing modern forms of slavery, these are the kinds of great tasks for which the United Nations was founded. In each case, careful discussion is needed and also decisive action. Our good intentions will be credited only if we achieve good outcomes. \n As an original signer of the U.N. Charter, the United States of America is committed to the United Nations. And we show that commitment by working to fulfill the U.N.'s stated purposes and giving meaning to its ideals. \n The founding documents of the United Nations and the founding documents of America stand in the same tradition. \n Both assert that human beings should never be reduced to objects of power or commerce, because their dignity is inherent. Both recognize a moral law that stands above men and nations which must be defended and enforced by men and nations. And both point the way to peace; the peace that comes when all are free. \n We secure that peace with our courage and we must show that courage together. \n May God bless you all. "}, {"text": "THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ; In Bush's Words: 'Advance of Democratic Institutions in Iraq Is Setting an Example'\n2003-09-24T05:00:00.000Z\nFollowing is a transcript of the address by President Bush today to the United Nations General Assembly, as recorded by The New York Times:\nMr. Secretary General, Mr. President, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen.\nTwenty-four months ago -- and yesterday, in the memory of America -- the center of New York City became a battlefield and a graveyard and the symbol of an unfinished war.\nSince that day, terrorists have struck in Bali, Mombasa, in Casablanca, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in Jerusalem, measuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and innocent suffering they leave behind.\nLast month, terrorists brought their war to the United Nations itself. The U.N. headquarters in Baghdad stood for order and compassion. And for that reason, the terrorists decided it must be destroyed.\nAmong the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio Vieira de Mello. Over the decades, this good and brave man from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in Bangladesh, Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon, Cambodia, Central Africa, Kosovo and East Timor, and was aiding the people of Iraq in their time of need. America joins you, his colleagues, in honoring the memory of Senhor Vieira de Mello and the memory of all who died with him in the service to the United Nations.\nBy the victims they choose and by the means they use, the terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in. Those who target relief workers for death have set themselves against all humanity. Those who incite murder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for life itself. They have no place in any religious faith. They have no claim on the world's sympathy, and they should have no friend in this chamber.\nEvents during the past two years have set before us the clearest of divides, between those who seek order and those who spread chaos; between those who work for peaceful change and those who adopt the methods of gangsters; between those who honor the rights of man and those who deliberately take the lives of men and women and children, without mercy or shame.\nBetween these alternatives, there is no neutral ground.\nAll governments that support terror are complicit in a war against civilization. No government should ignore the threat of terror, because to look the other way gives terrorists the chance to regroup and recruit and prepare.\nAnd all nations that fight terror as if the lives of their own people depend on it will earn the favorable judgment of history.\nThe former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew these alternatives and made their choices. The Taliban was a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When confronted, that regime chose defiance, and that regime is no more.\nAfghanistan's president, who is here today, now represents a free people who are building a decent and just society. They are building a nation fully joined in the war against terror.\nThe regime of Saddam Hussein cultivated ties to terror while it built weapons of mass destruction. It used those weapons in acts of mass murder and refused to account for them when confronted by the world.\nThe Security Council was right to be alarmed. The Security Council was right to demand that Iraq destroy its illegal weapons and prove that it had done so. The Security Council was right to vow serious consequences if Iraq refused to comply.\nAnd because there were consequences, because a coalition of nations acted to defend the peace and the credibility of the United Nations, Iraq is free. And today we are joined by representatives of a liberated country.\nSaddam Hussein's monuments have been removed. And not only his statues. The true monuments of his rule and his character -- the torture chambers and the rape rooms and the prison cells for innocent children -- are closed. And as we discover the killing fields and mass graves of Iraq, the true scale of Saddam's cruelty is being revealed.\nThe Iraqi people are meeting hardships and challenges like every nation that has set out on the path of democracy. Yet their future promises lives of dignity and freedom. And that is a world away from the squalid, vicious tyranny they have known.\nAcross Iraq, life is being improved by liberty.\nAcross the Middle East, people are safer because an unstable aggressor has been removed from power.\nAcross the world, nations are more secure because an ally of terror has fallen.\nOur actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were supported by many governments. And America is grateful to each one.\nI also recognize that some of the sovereign nations of this assembly disagreed with our actions.\nYet there was, and there remains, unity among us on the fundamental principles and objectives of the United Nations. We are dedicated to the defense of our collective security and to the advance of human rights.\nThese permanent commitments call us to great work in the world, work we must do together. So let us move forward.\nFirst, we must stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable countries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight this progress above all, because free people embrace hope over resentment and choose peace over violence.\nThe United Nations has been a friend of the Afghan people, distributing food and medicine, helping refugees return home, advising on a new constitution and helping to prepare the way for nationwide elections.\nNATO has taken over the U.N.-mandated security force in Kabul. American and coalition forces continue to track and defeat Al Qaeda terrorists and remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts to rebuild that country go on.\nI have recently proposed to spend an additional $1.2 billion for the Afghan reconstruction effort, and I urge other nations to continue contributing to this important cause.\nIn the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is carrying out vital and effective work every day. By the end of 2004, more than 90 percent of Iraqi children under age 5 will have been immunized against preventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and measles, thanks to the hard work and high ideals of Unicef.\nIraq's food distribution system is operational, delivering nearly a half-million tons of food per month, thanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food Program.\nOur international coalition in Iraq is meeting its responsibilities. We are conducting precision raids against terrorists and holdouts of the former regime. These killers are at war with the Iraqi people. They have made Iraq the central front in the war on terror. And they will be defeated.\nOur coalition has made sure that Iraq's former dictator will never again use weapons of mass destruction.\nWe are interviewing Iraqi citizens and analyzing records of the old regime to reveal the full extent of its weapons programs and its long campaign of deception.\nWe are training Iraqi police and border guards and a new army, so the Iraqi people can assume full responsibility for their own security.\nAnd at the same time, our coalition is helping to improve the daily lives of the Iraqi people.\nThe old regime built palaces while letting schools decay. So we are rebuilding more than 1,000 schools.\nThe old regime starved hospitals of resources. So we have helped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq.\nThe old regime built up armies and weapons while allowing the nation's infrastructure to crumble. So we are rehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation facilities, bridges and airports.\nI proposed to Congress that the United States provide additional funding for our work in Iraq -- the greatest financial commitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan.\nHaving helped to liberate Iraq, we will honor our pledges to Iraq. And by helping the Iraqi people build a stable and peaceful country, we will make our own countries more secure.\nThe primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-government for the people of Iraq, reached by orderly and democratic process.\nThis process must unfold according to the needs of Iraqis -- neither hurried nor delayed by the wishes of other parties.\nAnd the United Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of Iraq self-government.\nAmerica is working with friends and allies on a new Security Council resolution, which will expand the U.N.'s role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of other conflicts, the United Nations should assist in developing a constitution and training civil servants and conducting free and fair elections.\nIraq now has a governing council, the first truly representative institution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are showing the openness and tolerance that democracy requires. And they're also showing courage.\nYet every young democracy needs the help of friends. Now the nation of Iraq needs and deserves our aid. And all nations of good will should step forward and provide that support.\nSuccess of a free Iraq will be watched and noted throughout the region. Millions will see that freedom, equality and material progress are possible at the heart of the Middle East.\nLeaders in the region will face the clearest evidence that free institutions and open societies are the only path to long-term national success and dignity. And a transformed Middle East would benefit the entire world by undermining the ideologies that export violence to other lands.\nIraq as a dictatorship had great power to destabilize the Middle East. Iraq as a democracy will have great power to inspire the Middle East.\nThe advance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an example that others, including the Palestinian people, would be wise to follow.\nThe Palestinian cause is betrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old hatreds and destroying the good work of others.\nThe Palestinian people deserve their own state. And they will gain that state by embracing new leaders committed to reform, to fighting terror and to building peace.\nAll parties in the Middle East must meet their responsibilities and carry out the commitments they made at Aqaba.\nIsrael must work to create the conditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian state to emerge, and Arab nations must cut off funding and other support for terrorist organizations.\nAmerica will work with every nation in the region that acts boldly for the sake of peace.\nThe second challenge we must confront together is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nOutlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the means to deliver them would be able to use blackmail and create chaos in entire regions. These weapons could be used by terrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a scale we can scarcely imagine.\nThe deadly combination of outlaw regimes and terror networks and weapons of mass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished away. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize, all words, all protests will come too late.\nNations of the world must have the wisdom and the will to stop great threats before they arrive.\nOne crucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at their source.\nFor more than a decade, the United States has worked with Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union to dismantle, destroy or secure weapons and dangerous materials left over from another era.\nLast year in Canada, the G-8 nations agreed to provide up to $20 billion, half of it from the United States, to fight this proliferation risk over the next 10 years. Since then, six additional countries have joined the effort. More are needed. And I urge other nations to help us meet this danger.\nWe're also improving our capability to interdict lethal materials in transit. Through our proliferation security initiative, 11 nations are preparing to search planes and ships, planes and trucks carrying suspect cargo, and to seize weapons or missile shipments that raise proliferation concerns.\nThese nations have agreed on a set of interdiction principles consistent with current legal authorities, and we're working to expand the proliferation security initiative to other countries. We are determined to keep the world's most destructive weapons away from all our shores and out of the hands of our common enemies.\nBecause proliferators will use any route or channel that is open to them, we need the broadest possible cooperation to stop them.\nToday, I ask the U.N. Security Council to adopt a new antiproliferation resolution. This resolution should call on all members of the U.N. to criminalize the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to enact strict export controls consistent with international standards and to secure any and all sensitive materials within their own borders.\nThe United States stands ready to help any nation draft these new laws and to assist in their enforcement.\nA third challenge we share is a challenge to our conscience.

'' 'Why do you want to lend money to poor people?' ''\nMr. de Lesseps, 54, an international businessman whose great-great-grandfather developed the idea for the Suez Canal, has a ready answer. ''The only way to solve the problems of poverty and terrorism in the world today,'' he said, ''is through investment.''\nHe is no ordinary investor. As a co-owner of BlueOrchard Finance in Geneva, he is one of the leading figures in the world of microfinance, an idea that is taking on renewed popularity in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nMicrofinanciers and allied institutions typically make loans in amounts of $1,000 or less to poor people in poor countries who are ignored by commercial banks. The concept can be traced to Prof. Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1976 and became known as a ''banker to the poor.''\nInvestors in microfinancing ventures make profits in the form of interest payments on the order of two to five percentage points above the London Interbank Offered Rate, the international benchmark known as Libor. As a rule, microcredit loans are not backed by collateral, leaving no means of financial recovery for the lender if they are not repaid. But Grameen and other leading microcredit institutions claim loan loss rates of less than 5 percent, compared with 5 to 10 percent in the subprime consumer finance industry, for borrowers with income problems or flawed credit histories.\nJust less than $500 million is committed to microcredit loans worldwide, according to BlueOrchard's estimates. But Mr. de Lesseps said he believed that the total market for such loans may be near $3 billion.\nHe acknowledges that the aims of his microfinancing ventures are not purely philanthropic, at least not in the traditional sense. ''The reason we lend money to poor people is not only so that they can make money,'' he said, ''but also so that our investors can make money.''\nUntil recently, microfinancing initiatives, because of their profit-making orientation, have failed to win support from international organizations like the World Bank and the United Nations. But last month, Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations announced a new commission aimed at overcoming the institutional, legal and cultural barriers to private-sector participation in fighting world poverty. The co-chairmen of the commission are Ernesto Zedillo, the former president of Mexico who now directs Yale University's Center on Globalization, and Paul Martin, a Canadian Parliament member and former finance minister.\n''Whatever else we do to help the poor, local entrepreneurs have the power to create the greatest change for their countries,'' Mr. Martin said at the United Nations when the new commission was announced on July 25. ''The entrepreneurial spirit does not have to be imported. Visit the smallest town in the poorest country on market day and you will see the private sector at work.''\nMicrofinancing is just one of several international business interests in Mr. de Lesseps's private-sector portfolio. He is completing a five-star hotel in Havana that will be operated by the South African hotel magnate Sol Kerzner. Mr. de Lesseps also has investments in Myanmar, including an upscale housing development with a golf course designed by Gary Player and a 258-bed hospital in Rangoon. But he says he is proudest of a recently completed orphanage and maternity ward in the Shan state of Myanmar, both not-for-profit projects.\nMr. de Lesseps traces his entrepreneurial bent and interest in social causes to his great-great-grandfather, Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French diplomat who supervised the construction of the Suez Canal in 1879 and then made an unsuccessful attempt to build the Panama Canal. As head of the Franco-American Union, Ferdinand de Lesseps presented the Statue of Liberty to the United States.\nA British-born ancestor on the maternal side of Mr. de Lesseps's family, Noel Sampson, was a pioneering investor in India who played polo with the maharajahs. ''It's in my blood to discover new trends,'' Mr. de Lesseps said.\nAlexandre de Lesseps was raised in Khartoum, Sudan, the son of a former French ambassador, and was educated at Northwestern University. There, his capitalistic instincts were tempered by a flirtation with the antiwar movement and the radical left-wing Students for a Democratic Society.\nHe began his business career as a film producer in Hollywood, then bought and sold a modeling agency in Paris. In the late 1980's, he decided that Asia was ''the place to go,'' he said, and made a fortune investing in companies based in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region. ''I sold all my holdings in 1993, and in 1994, the Asian market collapsed,'' he recalled. ''I was very lucky.''\nHis involvement in microfinancing began a little over two years ago, when a Swiss banker and friend, Melchior de Muralt, approached him about investing in BlueOrchard. Founded by the former United Nations microfinance specialists C\u00e9dric Lombard and Jean-Philippe de Schrevel, BlueOrchard manages a mutual fund that currently makes about $50 million in short-term loans to microcredit lending institutions in more than 20 poor countries around the world, from Peru and Nicaragua to India and Indonesia.\nThe BlueOrchard Fund is open to retail investors willing to commit a minimum of $10,000. The fund returned 6.8 percent, net of fees, in 2001, and 4.1 percent last year, according to Mr. de Lesseps.\nBesides being an investor in BlueOrchard, Mr. de Lesseps is a fund-raiser for the firm in New York (he has a home in the Hamptons), Hong Kong and Europe, and a kind of roving international cheerleader for the microfinancing concept.\n''You're not going to get rich investing in microfinance,'' he conceded. ''But at the same time, it's safer than the stock market and offers a much better return than a typical money market account. If you're a blue-chip investor sitting on a lot of cash, it makes sense to put up to 4 percent of your net worth into this type of fund. You also get the satisfaction of knowing that your money is doing good for the poor people of the world.''\nMr. de Lesseps has seen BlueOrchard's money at work firsthand on trips with his colleagues. When they arrive in a country they regard as a potential investment area, they visit the central bank or leading aid institutions to learn who is doing micro-financing. Later, on-site research often takes them to interior villages where families may live on less than $10 a month.\n''I visited a village in Cambodia where the people used microcredit loans to buy irrigation equipment and seed, which they use to grow vegetables,'' Mr. de Lesseps said. ''They are now selling the vegetables to exporters and to a local hotel. The whole village has been transformed from dust to being productive. You don't ask for collateral on the loans because they don't have it. But they will die to pay you back because you are giving them a first-time chance. It's a matter of pride.'\nBlueOrchard typically charges two to seven percentage points more than Libor for loans to local microcredit institutions, which then charge rates to their borrowers based on assessments of risk factors. In countries like Nicaragua, local lending rates can be up to 22 percent above Libor.\n''I know that sounds pretty high,'' Mr. de Lesseps said. ''But you have to remember that other forms of locally available credit are five times higher, and that loan sharks sometimes charge 10 percent a week or even 10 percent a day. If you want to rid the world of poverty, you have to kill loan sharking.''\nBUT microfinancing is still far from a sure thing. Although Mr. de Lesseps says BlueOrchard's due diligence has so far kept its loan losses near zero, a microcredit subsidiary of South Africa's leading retail bank lost $87 million last year because of bad loans. And Grameen Bank, the granddaddy of microfinance, has come under attack from critics who contend that the actual repayment rate on its loans is much lower than the 95 percent it claims, and that the bank routinely reschedules many overdue loans to keep them from being classified as delinquent.\nMore generally, skeptics of microfinancing say administrative costs of making small loans can be 25 cents on the dollar or higher, which makes it difficult for lenders to eke out a profit without charging exorbitant interest rates.\nNonetheless, Mr. de Lesseps said he believed that 80 percent of the potential for microfinancing worldwide remained untapped and that the industry would easily be able to absorb more than $10 billion in the next decade. He said he hoped that in light of the recent United Nations initiative, central banks in both poor and developed countries may soon see fit to guarantee microcredit bonds.\n''For me the only way to make a difference,'' he said, ''is to make sure that the money going to poor countries is properly managed and not just thrown away.''"}, {"text": "If You're Thinking of Living In/Ditmas Park and Ditmas Park West; Spirited Enclaves With Grand Homes\n2003-11-02T05:00:00.000Z\nLIKE a lot of residents of a little corner of Flatbush, Brooklyn, known as Ditmas Park and Ditmas Park West, Katleen Felix Ranger and her husband, Pascal, a cosmetics executive, started their housing search in fashionable Park Slope. But after they had looked at a few small, expensive and somewhat noisy brownstone condominium units near Seventh Avenue, a newspaper ad brought them to these unusual enclaves of 100-year-old Victorians.\n''There were children running around; people talked to us on the street and suggested play dates,'' said Mrs. Ranger, who is originally from Montreal and has two little boys. ''I was also impressed to see so many people renovating their houses and how people cared.''\nDuring the family's first week in the house, a three-story, six-bedroom Victorian with all its original details, the neighborhood association came by with a welcome basket of freshly prepared foods and salads. Mrs. Ranger immediately signed up to be a volunteer. ''I like community action,'' she said. ''I like to get involved.''\nSince the Rangers arrived in 2002, welcome baskets have been replaced by twice-yearly cocktail parties so that newcomers can sample first hand the kind of neighborhood spirit that is pervasive around Ditmas Park and Ditmas Park West, two of 12 such small enclaves. Running from Prospect Park as far south as Avenue H, the patchwork known as Victorian Flatbush also includes the sprawling colonnaded mansions of Prospect Park South, Caton Park, Albemarle-Kenmore Terrace, Beverley Square West, Beverley Square East, Newkirk, West Midwood, Midwood Park, South Midwood and Fiske Terrace. The whole area is said to be one of the largest collections of Victorian properties in the nation.\nDIVIDED by the tracks of the Q train, the 27 square blocks of Ditmas Park and Ditmas Park West are bordered by Cortelyou Road to the north, Newkirk Avenue to the south, East 19th Street to the east and Coney Island Avenue to the west. The differences between the two are subtle. Ditmas Park has been designated as a landmark district, its streets are wider and parcels of property are slightly larger than in Ditmas Park West, where the average property measures about 50 feet by 100 feet.\nThere are a few condominium and rental units, but most of the housing is grand one-family homes, often three or four stories, 80 to 100 years old. Some boast eight bedrooms in addition to double living rooms, formal dining rooms and wide porches. Some residents have wooded double lots owing to long-ago tear-downs. Home offices abound and it is not unusual, as one resident said, to devote an entire room to the Christmas tree.\nAn encyclopedic range of architectural styles includes Victorian, Queen Anne, shingle style, colonial revival, neo-Tudor, Spanish Mission and Georgian. One noteworthy house is a modified Tudor with a slate roof at Ditmas Avenue and Rugby Road that was built for Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in the days when the Vitagraph Studios flourished in Flatbush, according to a guide published by the Flatbush Development Corporation.\nIn the spring, gardens in the area are an explosion of cherry, apple, peach and pear blossoms, and each house has abundant off-street parking. ''Where else in the city can you have a two-car garage?'' asks John Sprung, a lawyer and musician who has lived in Ditmas Park West since the 1970's.\nThe neighborhood is enjoying a surge of popularity, some of it among people priced out of Park Slope or Brooklyn Heights or tired of brownstone living.\nSally Gilliland and her husband, Dan Lawler, both architects, considered Park Slope but in September moved into Ditmas Park after 14 years in a spacious 1920's-era apartment on Eastern Parkway. They paid just over $800,000 for a 3,000-square-foot, six-bedroom Victorian with stained glass windows, fireplaces, a grand staircase and a wide front porch. ''We absolutely wanted to stay in Brooklyn,'' Ms. Gilliland said. ''And we really wanted to live in a stand-alone house because of the space and the light coming in on four sides.''\nThe median price for a Ditmas house is roughly $700,000, but demand and lack of inventory are causing prices to skyrocket, said Mary Kay Gallagher, a busy broker. While she might have had 10 houses to show just a few years back, today she often has no more than two active listings at a time.\n''We're not in the $1 million bracket yet, but we're getting there,'' said Mrs. Gallagher, who raised six children in her seven-bedroom house on Marlborough Road. ''I think $920,000 for a house on Rugby Road has been the highest price so far.''\nJulie Kestyn, an independent broker, said prices have doubled since 1996 but appear to be leveling off. ''They were going up by $50,000 a year, but that seems to have stopped,'' she noted.\nLow turnover among residents aggravates the problem, said Roslyn Huebener, principal broker with Aguayo & Huebener. ''No one here ever moves for more space,'' she noted. ''Even the empty nesters want to hang on to that wonderful house because they love the house, the neighbors and the parking. There is no reason to leave, ever.''\nWhile house prices have gone up in steep increments, co-op prices are another matter. Prices in good buildings here have increased sharply, yet remain so low as to seem almost quaint compared with corresponding sales in Park Slope or Manhattan, according to Mark Garstein, owner of the Warren Lewis agency. ''Park Slope is two to three times more expensive, and this is only 10 minutes farther on the subway,'' he said. ''A Park Slope buyer who cannot afford a one-bedroom for $350,000 can get the same thing here for $80,000.''\nLarry Bernstein of Jonas Equities, managing agent of a 42-year-old, 111-unit building at 415 Argyle Road, said a 1,500-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath duplex that sold for $54,000 in 1999 is closing this month at $220,000. A 900-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath unit that sold for $49,000 in 1997 would sell today for $150,000, he estimated.\nIf co-op prices have increased, it is sometimes because the building itself has been upgraded. At 415 Argyle Road, for example, ''they have redone the interiors, repainted all the halls and made a number of aesthetic improvements,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''And there's now a very active board of dedicated people.''\nLow rates of owner occupancy in some co-op buildings add vigor to a relatively quiet rental market. Rents at 415 Argyle Road, where 40 percent of units are owner-occupied, are $875 to $1,100 for a one-bedroom, while two-bedrooms are $1,100 to $1,350, according to Mr. Bernstein.\nThe focus of neighborhood activists has switched in recent years from preservation to invigorating the local retail scene. An extremely popular new greenmarket is held every Saturday in the schoolyard at Public School 139. It is on Cortelyou Road, the major shopping street, which also has a large number of low priced residential units. A grant of $1.4 million has been allocated for improvements like new trees, lamps and sidewalks. New retailers and restaurants are beginning to move in. An Irish pub opens this month, while Rug-B, a restaurant serving Caribbean specialties, is as popular with local families for its food as it is for its music on the weekends.\nAnother commercial strip, Newkirk Plaza, an open-air mall of 30 retailers straddling the subway tracks between Newkirk Avenue and Foster Avenue, recently got a grant of $1 million. It too is getting trees, streetlamps and decorative wrought-iron fencing, and a facelift is planned for the subway station.\nThe closest supermarket is an Associated branch on Cortelyou Road, where the products reflect great ethnic diversity. The population mix includes Caribbean, African-American, Hispanic, Asian, Haitian, Orthodox Jewish, Indian and Bangladeshi backgrounds, and some residents cite this cultural richness as one the area's biggest draws.\n''We moved here because we appreciated the diversity, and we think it's wonderful,'' said Robert Strauss, a retired lawyer who has lived in Ditmas Park West since 1979. ''Our neighbors come from every ethnic group imaginable.''\nSome parents send children to private schools in Brooklyn Heights or Manhattan, but highly rated local public schools embrace neighborhood diversity. P.S. 217 on Newkirk Avenue, has 1,280 students in prekindergarten through fifth grade, and the foreign languages spoken include Russian, Spanish, Urdu and Chinese, according to Mary Buckley Teatum, who has been the principal for 15 years.\nIt is one of the 200 schools in the city exempt from the new uniform curriculum, and 61 percent of its fourth graders read at or above grade level, up 12 points over the previous year. In math, 70 percent perform at or above grade level, up 15 points.\nAt P.S. 139 on Rugby Road, the 1,134 students in prekindergarten through Grade 5 get to know the cultures of one another through potluck suppers and fashion shows where children can wear their native dress. Some 56 different languages are spoken at the school. Among fourth graders, 82 percent scored at or above grade level in math while 53 percent scored at or above grade level in reading.\nTHE Hudde School, J.H.S. 240, on Nostrand Avenue has 1,900 students and is ranked first of six junior high schools in its district in eighth grade reading and math. Last year, some 67 percent of eighth graders read at or above grade level, an increase of 16 points over the previous year, while in math, 58.6 percent of students performed at or above grade level, up 8 points.\nMost students of high school age attend Midwood High School on Bedford Avenue, where almost all graduating seniors go on to college, according to the principal, Steve Zwisohn. The school offers advanced placement courses in 14 subjects, as well as accelerated programs in science and humanities, which have rigorous criteria for admission. For the SAT reasoning tests last year, the average score on the verbal test was 521, compared with a a statewide average of 496, and 548 in math, compared with 510 statewide.\nCommunity meetings often take place at a local landmark, the imposing Flatbush-Tompkins Congregational Church on East 19th Street. Energetic community groups like Friends of Cortelyou and the Flatbush Development Corporation organize numerous activities for residents, including an annual house tour in the spring, a street fair and a road race in September called the Flatbush Frolic, a Christmas tree lighting and book parties. The Flatbush Family Network helps local mothers with information and resources.\n''Commercial strips usually follow when residential property values increase and that is happening in a big way now,'' said John Broderick, executive director of the Flatbush Development Corporation."}, {"text": "Necessity Is the Mother Of Invention\n2003-11-30T05:00:00.000Z\nStriding down a hallway at M.I.T., Amy Smith has a bucket in one hand and a length of string in the other. The brain behind such creations as the phase-change incubator, she is on her way to the Charles River to retrieve some dirty water for her next class. As she lopes along, Smith describes the ordeals of testing water in remote villages. Her words spurt out. She's a woman on fast-forward, and she does not so much talk as download information.\nWe reach the massive front doors of M.I.T.'s main building, and she pushes out into the crisp air and roar of traffic. Without interrupting her disquisition on water-testing, she perches sidesaddle on a banister. Elegantly poised, she slides down the handrail, still talking.\nShe lands on the sidewalk with a practiced leap. ''You slide faster in the winter,'' she says, ''when you've got a wool coat on.''\nIf you're an inventor and you ride the banister below the pillared entrance of a university, there's a good chance of coming off as way too cute, like Robin Williams playing an inventor in a Disney movie. But Smith can get away with this kind of flourish. She is, after all, one of the brightest minds in a movement that sets out to prove that the best technology can be cheap and simple. The banister is a perfect example: it requires less energy than the stairs, and it's free.\nIn a culture that hails mobile phones and plasma-screen televisions as the great innovations of our time, Smith is gloriously out of step. She designs medical devices and labor-saving machines for people who live at the far end of dirt roads in Africa. Her inventions cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few pennies. ''You can't understand how important a grain mill is,'' she says, ''until you've spent three hours pounding grain and gotten a cup and a half of flour.'' It is this kind of understanding -- of tedium, of tired muscles, of hunger pangs -- that Smith brings to her work.\nAn hour later, in Smith's ''D-lab'' class, students gather around a huge, black-topped slab of a table. It's the first semester of design lab, and these undergrads are learning about the politics of delivering technology to poor nations, how to speak a little Creole and the nitty-gritty of mechanical engineering; during the midsemester break, they will travel to Haiti, Brazil or India. There, they will act as consultants in remote villages, helping locals solve technical problems. Oh, yes, and the students will also test village drinking water for dangerous bacteria.\nToday, Smith is training them to do that. Using a small pump, the students draw the Charles River water through a filter. Smith points to a piece of the testing rig -- what looks like a silver barbell. ''This test stand costs $600,'' she says. ''Personally, I find that offensive.'' When the students work in the field, she says, they will be using a far cheaper setup -- one that she patched together herself for about $20, using a Playtex baby bottle. ''You can do a lot more testing for the same amount of money.''\nNow the students have made cultures of Charles River water in petri dishes. The next step is to incubate the petri dishes for an entire day at a steady temperature. But how do you pull that off in a lean-to in Haiti, with no electricity for miles around? Again, Smith has a solution. She passes around a mesh bag of what appears to be white marbles. The ''marbles'' contain a chemical that, when heated and kept in an insulated environment, will stay at a steady 37 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. The balls are the crucial ingredient in one of Smith's inventions -- a phase-change incubator that requires no electricity. The design won her a 1999 Collegiate Inventors award. She says she hopes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will soon endorse her incubator. ''From there it's not a big step to go to the Red Cross,'' she says. One day it could be a key piece of equipment at rural health clinics, where doctors depend on intermittent electricity or none at all. Smith has founded a company to handle the exigencies of getting her incubators up and running and out into the field. ''I have 6,000 of these balls on their way here from China as we speak,'' she says.\nNow, Smith wants to demo a bacteria test in the dark. She asks a student to cut the lights. He flips a switch. For a moment, nothing happens, and then the room vibrates with a mechanical hum and panels close over a bank of skylights in the ceiling. All crane their necks to watch. The panels move in menacing slo-mo, like something out of a James Bond movie. A few people giggle, as if they have suddenly become aware of the contradictions thrumming in this room -- they've come to one of the best-financed technical institutes in the world to learn how to work with Playtex baby bottles.\nA few weeks from now, Smith will give them one of their toughest lessons in the gaps between first world and third. The students will spend a week surviving on $2 a day in Cambridge -- the equivalent of what the average Haitian earns. Last year, Jamy Drouillard, who was a teacher's assistant for Smith's class, performed the assignment along with his students. Drouillard grew up in Haiti, but that didn't give him any special edge. He laughs, remembering his chief mistake. ''I bought a bunch of Ramen noodles, a packet of hotdogs, a bunch of spaghetti and some ketchup,'' he says. ''It got sickening after Day 3. Actually, before Day 3. I should have mixed and matched instead of buying five boxes of spaghetti. In Haiti, people come up with creative ways of varying their food intake.'' He said the assignment drove home Smith's point quickly: living at subsistence level requires enormous creativity. The African farmwoman who finds a way to make a scrap of land yield enough cassava root for her family is as much an inventor as any M.I.T.-trained engineer.\nLast year, at an academic dinner with a plentiful buffet, Smith pulled out crackers from her pocket and nibbled while colleagues feasted around her; she was sticking to the $2-a-day assignment in fellowship with her students.\nIn the late 1980's, as a Peace Corps volunteer, Smith was stationed in Ghanzi, then a backwater of Botswana, down a dirt road that could take as long as three days to travel. ''Nobody wanted to live there,'' she says. ''You got sent there for punishment if you did badly in a job.''\nSmith grew up in a comfortable, academic family. Her father taught electrical engineering at M.I.T.; her mother taught junior-high math. At the dinner table, the family would chitchat about ways to prove the Pythagorean theorem. In her first couple of years in the Peace Corps, she missed the kind of people she had known growing up in the orbit of M.I.T. -- people willing to engage, for instance, in passionate discussion about the innards of a motor. ''I'd run into development workers who had no clue about engineering. They wouldn't understand that there was a way you could solve a problem.''\nIn 1987, Smith returned home to Lexington, Mass., for her mother's funeral. Wandering through a supermarket after the service, she marveled at the lunacy of her own country: an entire aisle just for soup? It seemed impossible to bridge the gap between America and Botswana.\nAbout a year later, Smith was gazing out the window of her room, studying the expanse of the Kalahari Desert pocked by thorn bushes. Suddenly, she says, she understood the arc of her life: she would learn how to be an engineer and bring her skills to a place like this. So she applied to graduate programs and ended up back at M.I.T. in 1990.\nSometime after she got there, a professor suggested that she try to solve a problem that bedevils people who live in rural Africa. It involves the hammer mill, a no-frills, motorized grain mill that women use to grind sorghum or millet into flour. The hammer mill can do a job in just a few minutes that might otherwise take hours, which makes it a hotly coveted item in developing nations. But there's a built-in flaw: the mill uses a wire-mesh screen. When that screen breaks, it cannot easily be replaced, because parts like that are scarce in Africa and not easy to fabricate. So for lack of a wire screen, grain mills often end up in the corner of a room, gathering dust.\nWhat was needed was something that could not only match the efficiency of the hammer mill but also use materials available to a blacksmith in Senegal. A group of M.I.T. students had come up with some ideas, but Smith, who had ground sorghum by hand in Botswana, knew they weren't fast enough. So she devised a system based on an elegantly simple element: air. She redesigned the machine to use the air passing through the mill to separate particles. The smaller ones -- aka flour -- get carried out while the larger ones stay behind. The resulting machine would cost a quarter of what its predecessors had and use far less energy.\nFor her work as an inventor, including the screenless hammer mill, Smith became the first woman ever to win a Lemelson-M.I.T. Student Prize. Past recipients of the high-profile award for inventing include David Levy, who patented not only the smallest keypad in the world but also a surgical technique that speeds the splicing of severed blood vessels.\nSmith's entire life is like one of her inventions, portable and off the grid. At 41, she has no kids, no car, no retirement plan and no desire for a Ph.D. Her official title: instructor. ''I'm doing exactly what I want to be doing. Why would I spend six years to get a Ph.D. to be in the position I'm in now, but with a title after my name? M.I.T. loves that I'm doing this work. The support is there. So I don't worry.'' It was a good thing that she won the Collegiate Inventors award in 1999, she says, because back then she was stretching a three-month graduate-student stipend to last for a year and didn't know how she'd pay her rent. The $7,500 prize came just in time.\nLikewise, the inventors who most inspire her will never strike it rich. ''There are geniuses in Africa, but they're not getting the press,'' she says. She gushes about Mohammed Bah Abba, a Nigerian teacher who came up with the pot-within-a-pot system. With nothing more than a big terra-cotta bowl, a little pot, some sand and water, Abba created a refrigerator -- the rig uses evaporation rather than electricity to keep vegetables cool. Innovations that target the poorest of the poor don't have to be complicated to make a big difference. The best solution is sometimes the most obvious.\nSmith, of course, aims to design such hidden-in-plain-sight tools and deliver them to the needy. But she also wants to change people's understanding of what it means to be an inventor. To this end, she is a co-founder of the Ideas (Innovation Development Enterprise Action) competition at M.I.T.; students work with a community partner to solve a problem for the disenfranchised. Last year's winners, for instance, included a team that developed a kit for removing land mines so that farmers in places like Zimbabwe no longer have to improvise with hoes and rakes.\nSuccess in the Ideas competition, as well as in the kind of design that Smith pursues, requires humility, because your masterpiece may end up looking like a bunch of rocks or a pile of sand. And since you'll be required to do extensive fieldwork to understand the problem you're solving, it also demands the skills of a crack Peace Corps volunteer, someone who remains cheerful even when the truck breaks down, the food runs out and you're the one who has to sleep next to the goat.\nWomen have the advantage here, unlike other branches of engineering. ''I know how to be self-deprecating,'' Smith says. ''The traditional male engineer is not taught that way.'' That engineer, were he trying to figure out an agricultural problem in Botswana, might consult with men, but that wouldn't get him very far. ''In Africa, the women are the farmers. Women invented domesticated crops. If you're talking to the right people, they should be a group of elderly women with their hair up in bandannas.''\nAs improbable as it may sound, Smith's brand of invention is moving into the mainstream. That is because her clients -- the disenfranchised in Africa, Haiti, Brazil, India -- are increasingly able to secure loans. The concept of microfinance, which first took off in the 1970's in Bangladesh, has gathered force throughout the developing world, giving impoverished people the capital they need to start small businesses and buy materials. According to Elizabeth Littlefield of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, a microfinance group within the World Bank, the integration of tiny loan-making operations into mainstream banking could bring billions of new consumers into the global marketplace over the next few decades. There have already been some surprising strides made. In India, for example, banks have set up solar-powered kiosks in out-of-the-way villages, giving clients access to financial services in places where there is not even electricity. But what will they invest in? The rural poor will need machines designed for their needs. And that will, in turn, create demand for new kinds of technologies.\nIn a barbecue pit near the M.I.T. student center, pale blue smoke streams out of a trash can and twists in the direction of the tennis courts. It smells of caramel. Shawn Frayne, a gangly guy with a shock of black hair, sticks a lighter down into the can. He's trying to get a fire going. He holds up one of his finished products -- a piece of charcoal that looks like a jet-black hamburger patty. It's made out of the parts of the sugarcane that aren't edible -- that is, trash. These humble wads could help to solve a number of problems in Haiti: poor people would be able to make their own charcoal rather than having to pay for the prefab variety, forests would no longer have to be cut down to make wood charcoal and local entrepreneurs could use the recipe to set up small businesses.\nFrayne graduated from M.I.T. last year. He didn't like school much, except for Smith's design class, to which he is so devoted that he volunteered to put finishing touches on several inventions the class started last year. ''I learned in an economics class that if someone has a good idea and they can implement it in a third-world country, they can dramatically change the economy of the country,'' Frayne says. ''I was surprised by how much technology can affect the well-being of a people.''\nSmith herself stands by, trying to keep the wind from whipping her blond hair into her face. ''We're working on a portfolio of designs like this charcoal that we can show to the Peace Corps or to N.G.O.'s, groups that are trying to help people start up small businesses,'' she says.\nFrayne ducks down, pointing to the base of the trash can. ''If we were in Haiti, we'd use dirt to seal up the bottom of the can,'' he says. ''But I couldn't find any dirt around here, so I used duct tape.''\nSmith nods approvingly. ''In Cambridge, duct tape is the equivalent of dirt,'' she says. She loves duct tape and all it stands for. She knows how to make a hammock and a kaleidoscope out of duct tape. It's a very useful material, no doubt, but if she were on her $2-a-day budget, she'd probably have to buy it on layaway."}, {"text": "Necessity Is the Mother Of Invention\n2003-11-30T05:00:00.000Z\nStriding down a hallway at M.I.T., Amy Smith has a bucket in one hand and a length of string in the other. The brain behind such creations as the phase-change incubator, she is on her way to the Charles River to retrieve some dirty water for her next class. As she lopes along, Smith describes the ordeals of testing water in remote villages. Her words spurt out. She's a woman on fast-forward, and she does not so much talk as download information.\nWe reach the massive front doors of M.I.T.'s main building, and she pushes out into the crisp air and roar of traffic. Without interrupting her disquisition on water-testing, she perches sidesaddle on a banister. Elegantly poised, she slides down the handrail, still talking.\nShe lands on the sidewalk with a practiced leap. ''You slide faster in the winter,'' she says, ''when you've got a wool coat on.''\nIf you're an inventor and you ride the banister below the pillared entrance of a university, there's a good chance of coming off as way too cute, like Robin Williams playing an inventor in a Disney movie. But Smith can get away with this kind of flourish. She is, after all, one of the brightest minds in a movement that sets out to prove that the best technology can be cheap and simple. The banister is a perfect example: it requires less energy than the stairs, and it's free.\nIn a culture that hails mobile phones and plasma-screen televisions as the great innovations of our time, Smith is gloriously out of step. She designs medical devices and labor-saving machines for people who live at the far end of dirt roads in Africa. Her inventions cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few pennies. ''You can't understand how important a grain mill is,'' she says, ''until you've spent three hours pounding grain and gotten a cup and a half of flour.'' It is this kind of understanding -- of tedium, of tired muscles, of hunger pangs -- that Smith brings to her work.\nAn hour later, in Smith's ''D-lab'' class, students gather around a huge, black-topped slab of a table. It's the first semester of design lab, and these undergrads are learning about the politics of delivering technology to poor nations, how to speak a little Creole and the nitty-gritty of mechanical engineering; during the midsemester break, they will travel to Haiti, Brazil or India. There, they will act as consultants in remote villages, helping locals solve technical problems. Oh, yes, and the students will also test village drinking water for dangerous bacteria.\nToday, Smith is training them to do that. Using a small pump, the students draw the Charles River water through a filter. Smith points to a piece of the testing rig -- what looks like a silver barbell. ''This test stand costs $600,'' she says. ''Personally, I find that offensive.'' When the students work in the field, she says, they will be using a far cheaper setup -- one that she patched together herself for about $20, using a Playtex baby bottle. ''You can do a lot more testing for the same amount of money.''\nNow the students have made cultures of Charles River water in petri dishes. The next step is to incubate the petri dishes for an entire day at a steady temperature. But how do you pull that off in a lean-to in Haiti, with no electricity for miles around? Again, Smith has a solution. She passes around a mesh bag of what appears to be white marbles. The ''marbles'' contain a chemical that, when heated and kept in an insulated environment, will stay at a steady 37 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. The balls are the crucial ingredient in one of Smith's inventions -- a phase-change incubator that requires no electricity. The design won her a 1999 Collegiate Inventors award. She says she hopes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will soon endorse her incubator. ''From there it's not a big step to go to the Red Cross,'' she says. One day it could be a key piece of equipment at rural health clinics, where doctors depend on intermittent electricity or none at all. Smith has founded a company to handle the exigencies of getting her incubators up and running and out into the field. ''I have 6,000 of these balls on their way here from China as we speak,'' she says.\nNow, Smith wants to demo a bacteria test in the dark. She asks a student to cut the lights. He flips a switch. For a moment, nothing happens, and then the room vibrates with a mechanical hum and panels close over a bank of skylights in the ceiling. All crane their necks to watch. The panels move in menacing slo-mo, like something out of a James Bond movie. A few people giggle, as if they have suddenly become aware of the contradictions thrumming in this room -- they've come to one of the best-financed technical institutes in the world to learn how to work with Playtex baby bottles.\nA few weeks from now, Smith will give them one of their toughest lessons in the gaps between first world and third. The students will spend a week surviving on $2 a day in Cambridge -- the equivalent of what the average Haitian earns. Last year, Jamy Drouillard, who was a teacher's assistant for Smith's class, performed the assignment along with his students. Drouillard grew up in Haiti, but that didn't give him any special edge. He laughs, remembering his chief mistake. ''I bought a bunch of Ramen noodles, a packet of hotdogs, a bunch of spaghetti and some ketchup,'' he says. ''It got sickening after Day 3. Actually, before Day 3. I should have mixed and matched instead of buying five boxes of spaghetti. In Haiti, people come up with creative ways of varying their food intake.'' He said the assignment drove home Smith's point quickly: living at subsistence level requires enormous creativity. The African farmwoman who finds a way to make a scrap of land yield enough cassava root for her family is as much an inventor as any M.I.T.-trained engineer.\nLast year, at an academic dinner with a plentiful buffet, Smith pulled out crackers from her pocket and nibbled while colleagues feasted around her; she was sticking to the $2-a-day assignment in fellowship with her students.\nIn the late 1980's, as a Peace Corps volunteer, Smith was stationed in Ghanzi, then a backwater of Botswana, down a dirt road that could take as long as three days to travel. ''Nobody wanted to live there,'' she says. ''You got sent there for punishment if you did badly in a job.''\nSmith grew up in a comfortable, academic family. Her father taught electrical engineering at M.I.T.; her mother taught junior-high math. At the dinner table, the family would chitchat about ways to prove the Pythagorean theorem. In her first couple of years in the Peace Corps, she missed the kind of people she had known growing up in the orbit of M.I.T. -- people willing to engage, for instance, in passionate discussion about the innards of a motor. ''I'd run into development workers who had no clue about engineering. They wouldn't understand that there was a way you could solve a problem.''\nIn 1987, Smith returned home to Lexington, Mass., for her mother's funeral. Wandering through a supermarket after the service, she marveled at the lunacy of her own country: an entire aisle just for soup? It seemed impossible to bridge the gap between America and Botswana.\nAbout a year later, Smith was gazing out the window of her room, studying the expanse of the Kalahari Desert pocked by thorn bushes. Suddenly, she says, she understood the arc of her life: she would learn how to be an engineer and bring her skills to a place like this. So she applied to graduate programs and ended up back at M.I.T. in 1990.\nSometime after she got there, a professor suggested that she try to solve a problem that bedevils people who live in rural Africa. It involves the hammer mill, a no-frills, motorized grain mill that women use to grind sorghum or millet into flour. The hammer mill can do a job in just a few minutes that might otherwise take hours, which makes it a hotly coveted item in developing nations. But there's a built-in flaw: the mill uses a wire-mesh screen. When that screen breaks, it cannot easily be replaced, because parts like that are scarce in Africa and not easy to fabricate.

The 70's was when the 8-by-10-inch print started to look small. Color was slowly muscling its way into museums, and several well-known artists responded by conspicuously bulking-up in black-and-white. In 1975 Richard Avedon created a sensation by exhibiting three photographic murals at the Marlborough Gallery in New York, one of them a 21-foot-long, life-size group portrait of Andy Warhol's Factory crew. Two years later, Irving Penn's blow-ups of trash from the city's streets graced the walls of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Even the grandfatherly Ansel Adams, meeting the demands of a hungry photography market in its infancy, reprinted images from his youth in ever increasing quantities and sizes.\nBut big in the 70's isn't big anymore. Not when the German artist Thomas Ruff makes color photographs of heads as large as entire bodies in Mr. Avedon's portraits. Mr. Penn's cigarette butts hardly register as oversize now. Like S.U.V.'s and television screens, photographs throughout the 90's swelled to almost irrational dimensions. As technology allowed huge color prints to be processed with ease and buyers paid top prices for them, big became the norm. Younger photographers and students, when asking themselves how large an image should be, often opted for the McDonald's answer: supersize it.\nThe German artist Thomas Struth, 48, whose exhibition of 70 works opens on Tuesday at the Metropolitan Museum, has produced enormous photographs since the late 80's. His color prints typically measure 7 or 8 feet long and 4 or 5 feet wide when framed. And his ''Video Portraits'' are truly monumental at 14 feet high by 24 feet across. Never before seen in the United States, they will be projected in the Great Hall, just inside the Met's entrance.\nIn other respects, though, Mr. Struth's work remains within the tradition of ''straight'' photography. The values of precise observation -- the familiar world of people, trees, streets and buildings examined through a lens at a specific place and time -- are at the heart of his work. Despite efforts by some essayists in the catalog (Yale University Press) to bend him into a more tortured postmodern stance, he has said that he regards photography, rather quaintly, as a ''communicative and analytical medium.''\nBut like his countryman Andreas Gursky, whose 2001 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York was a popular smash, Mr. Struth also faces a degree of critical skepticism. Can an artist whose photographs are so clearly seductive be trusted? Are the places and people rendered in such detail and icy perfection more interesting and alive after scrutiny? Or has he embalmed them? Does the power of his images derive from thoughtful choices about what he has included or excluded from the frame? Or from the persuasive rhetoric of their sheer size?\nThe question of scale is front and center in Mr. Struth's celebrated photographs of museum and church interiors. Pictures about people looking at pictures, they capture the weariness and confusion of the art spectator, hoping for a private experience in a crowded public arena like the Pantheon or the Louvre. As tourists and students move through the Art Institute of Chicago or the Church of the Frari in Venice, pausing to read labels or just staring, Mr. Struth has pulled back and given us a cool but not unsympathetic large-format view of art in the age of mass travel.\nHis photographs also destabilize the confident neutrality of anyone viewing them at an exhibition. Moments after studying the seriously dazed or slouching figures in Mr. Struth's pictures, visitors at the Met will no doubt be self-consciously checking their own attitudes and postures. These huge works will be shown in the Special Exhibitions gallery, while the Gilman gallery on the second floor will display his smaller prints.\nMany of these pictures embody the deference -- and the envy -- that photography has traditionally shown toward painting. The people observed by Mr. Struth have come to museums to commune with artworks -- centuries old and weighty with religious or political themes -- that command attention and respect by their generous allotment of wall space. In their scale, Mr. Struth's photographs aspire to be compared with 19-century history paintings and other revered canvases and murals. At the same time, in their minute human imperfections -- figures whose movements are blurred by long time exposures -- his images also gently mock such pretensions. They are proud of what they are.\nPhotography has long yearned for the opportunity to be big like its older brother. Carleton Watkins, Eadweard Muybridge and others who hauled their cameras across the 19th-century American west produced startlingly sharp contact prints with glass negatives as large as 18 by 22 inches. For maximum punch, it was standard practice in the 1860's and 70's to join photographs together in panoramas. A 21-panel view of a pagoda in India by the British photographer Linnaeus Tripe, dating from 1858 and now in the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal, measures 17 inches high by more than 19 feet long.\nA century later this was still the most popular method for those making photographs exceeding 20 by 24 inches -- the largest standard-size paper then commonly available. During the 1960's and 70's, many artists -- including Andy Warhol, Mel Bochner, Joyce Neimanas, Chuck Close, Sol LeWitt, Ray Metzker, Jan Groover, Lew Thomas and Brian Wood -- constructed large photographs out of smaller ones, the breaks between images integral to the meaning or rhythms of the whole. Mr. Avedon's murals were composites.\nSEVERAL exhibitions in the United States during the 80's took notice of this new proclivity for supersize scale: ''Big Pictures by Contemporary Photographers'' at the Museum of Modern Art in 1983; ''The Real Big Picture'' at the Queens Museum in 1986; and ''This Is Not a Photograph: 20 Years of Large-Scale Photography 1966-86'' at the John and Mable Ringling Museum in Sarasota, Fla., in 1987.\nMr. Struth was too young and obscure to be in these surveys. But his teachers, Bernd and Hilla Becher from the D\u00fcsseldorf Academy in Germany, have been recurring figures in them -- and ubiquitous throughout the last 20 years. Their systematic cataloging of water towers, factory chimneys and other relics of the industrial age, arranged neatly in black-and-white grids, have an almost sculptural presence on the wall. Mr. Struth's meticulous photographs of apartment complexes and deserted urban streets from the late 70's owe much to the Bechers.\nThe checker-board grid was not for him, however, and over the last 15 years his photographs have expanded to suit his different and even grander pictorial appetite. His camera now swallows as much reality in one gulp as the Bechers do in 16 bites. The smooth unity of these giant single images allows him to maintain the illusion -- one of the pleasures of photography -- that the artist has interfered as little as possible between the world and the spectator.\nIn a sense, Mr. Struth's photographs bridge a gulf that has persisted since the 70's between photographers and other artists. One of the motives for widening the dimensions of photographs was a desire to compete -- for economic and critical respect -- in galleries where painters and sculptors held sway. Thirty years ago, artists who wanted to burst the seams of the traditional black-and-white print were usually judged to be unsuitable -- too odd for exhibition in intimate print rooms. Likewise, photographers who played variations in a 35-millimeter format were dwarfed in SoHo lofts that had been used to hanging Abstract Expressionist or Pop Art.\nMr. Struth, who lives in D\u00fcsseldorf, exhibits his work in New York at the Marian Goodman Gallery, a space designed for large-scale painting and sculpture. He has all the financial and art-historical support from the art world that anyone could want. His ''Pantheon, Rome'' sold at auction in 2000 for $270,000. Even so, as a photographer he is something of a 19th-century throwback. He does not digitize his 8-by-10-inch negatives, as Mr. Gursky does, nor is he preoccupied with narrative. Critical attempts to marry his art to Cindy Sherman's theatrical tableaus seem far-fetched. Cinematic scenarios and performance-art high jinks are absent in his deadpan descriptions. August Sander would have approved.\nBut the success of the young Germans has provoked hordes of imitators who don't do big with the intelligent purpose of Mr. Struth or Mr. Gursky. The Armory Show in New York last fall was overstocked with gargantuan photographs of banal landscapes and domestic scenes, pictures with no evident reason for demanding that much space and attention. They existed to be big, as if that were enough.\nIn photographs the size of a billboard almost everything looks more impressive. Big is dramatic. Big is thrilling. Big sells. It can also clarify detail and reveal relationships -- between objects in a picture and between the picture and the viewer -- that aren't apparent in an 8-by-10-inch print.\nMost photographers will tell you that scale is vitally important to them, although many dealers offer prints by their artists in more than one size for customers who prefer small or can't afford large versions. The British photographer Julian Opie is cavalier enough about the matter to have made work for sale in S, M, L and X-L. But more prevalent among dealers selling gigantic photographs is the trend of offering editions of an image, but in only one size, thus reinforcing a kinship with painting. Mr. Struth's pictures are marketed in this way.\nThat photographers are no longer boxed in by the old standard sizes of manufacturer's papers in imagining work, or by the confines of print galleries in exhibiting it, can only be called a step forward. Technology offers new choices every year. A digital printer has come on the market that accepts 70-inch paper. Photographs on the scale of a Pollock will be an increasingly common sight. Extraordinary size made for extraordinary photographs in recent New York shows of works by Paul Shambroom at Julie Saul (of American town meetings) and Edward Burtynsky at Charles Cowles (of ships being broken up for scrap in Bangladesh). He currently has a show of oil fields in California and Canada at Cowles.\nStill, it was refreshing this fall to see that Chuck Close, a pioneer of the supersize photograph and an artist for whom scale has been a binding issue throughout his long career, has been making daguerreotypes. Maybe small is the new big.\nThomas Struth\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82th Street.\nTuesday through May 18."}, {"text": "Philosopher On the Trail Of Daniel Pearl's Killer\n2003-08-30T05:00:00.000Z\nBernard-Henri L\u00e9vy does nothing that goes unnoticed.

For 25 years he has been known here simply by his initials, B. H. L.\nNot that everyone takes him seriously. His carefully cultivated public persona, which includes black suits, unbuttoned white shirts and long, dark hair, is frequently mocked on a televised puppet show, and he is often hit with pies by a Belgian who claims to target the self-important. The satirical weekly Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 once asked of him, ''Rimbaud or Rambo?''\nYet France has always had a place for high-profile intellectuals, from Victor Hugo and \u00c9mile Zola to Jean-Paul Sartre and Andr\u00e9 Malraux. And from an early age, Mr. L\u00e9vy set off in their footsteps. He earned his spurs in the late 1970's as one of several ''new philosophers'' who enraged the left by attacking the Soviet Union. He then turned his guns on the right, warning that 1930's-style fascism was still rooted in French politics.\nSince then he has constantly been in the limelight. He has tried his hand at fiction, theater and movies (although his only feature film to date, ''Day and Night,'' starring his wife, was a flop). And he has continued to campaign for what he considers noble causes, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, from Afghanistan to Bosnia. In a book published in 2001, for instance, he wrote of forgotten wars in Sudan, Angola, Burundi, Sri Lanka and Colombia.\nWhat most annoys his critics, however, is that Mr. L\u00e9vy is often the star of his own stories. And the complaint has been heard anew about his latest book, in which he sets out to solve the murder of Daniel Pearl, a correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, who was killed after his kidnapping in Pakistan on Jan. 23, 2002. Yet, conversely, if the book has sold more than 200,000 copies here since April, it is also because Mr. L\u00e9vy's name and passion continue to draw French readers.\nNow, with the publication next week of the English translation of ''Who Killed Daniel Pearl?'' (Melville House Publishing), Mr. L\u00e9vy is entering unknown territory. Not only is his name less known in the United States than Mr. Pearl's, but the question also arises as to why a French intellectual should investigate the murder in a far-off land of a man who was an American, a journalist and a Jew.\n''If I had to pick, I'd say it was because he was Jewish,'' said Mr. L\u00e9vy, who is himself a nonpracticing Jew. ''Amid my shock at his death was the realization that we were entering a century in which a man could have his throat cut for saying, 'My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am a Jew.' As I read his work, I also understood he was not just a Jew. He was a Jew who believed in reaching out to moderate Islam. And I recognized myself in his way of being Jewish.''\nBut there was another reason, Mr. L\u00e9vy explained in an interview in his comfortable Left Bank apartment. ''I am hardly a fan of today's American government -- I opposed the Iraq war from the beginning -- but I am nonetheless strongly anti-anti-American,'' he said. ''I am alarmed by the way anti-Americanism is becoming globalized. Through Danny Pearl's experience, I had the feeling that the idea of America as a magnet for the worst was becoming a global phenomenon.''\nMr. L\u00e9vy nonetheless tells the story as a narrative of his own investigation, something that irritated some French critics. ''B. H. L. is an intellectual whose most accomplished work is the construction of his own biography,'' Pierre Assouline, editor of the literary monthly Lire, noted acidly. Others were more generous. In Le Monde, Alain Frachon said he found the book convincing. And, writing in Le Figaro, Jean de Belot praised it as ''a splendid journey to better understand the fragility of the world.''\nMr. L\u00e9vy was on a diplomatic mission to Afghanistan for President Jacques Chirac when he heard of Mr. Pearl's death. After completing his work in Kabul, he flew immediately to Karachi, returning to Pakistan for the first time since 1971. And in his airport taxi, he already sensed how the country had changed. ''What is your religion?'' the taxi driver asked him. He was taken aback. ''Atheist,'' he finally replied. ''My religion is atheism.''\nHe said he first imagined writing a long report for Le Monde, but was soon drawn into a more ambitious project, one that he felt equipped to carry out.\n''I don't think any American newspaper would have taken the risk of sending a journalist -- especially a Jew -- in the steps of Daniel Pearl,'' he said. ''I had the luck of being French, with the French position on the Iraq war well known. I still had a diplomatic passport. I played with ambiguities, telling people I was doing something I wasn't doing then: I was writing a novel, I was an official envoy. I was far less exposed than any American, although still at risk as a Jew.''\nHe has assumed a different risk by writing what he calls a ''romanqu\u00eate,'' part roman, or novel, part enqu\u00eate, or investigation. He mentions Truman Capote's ''In Cold Blood'' and Norman Mailer's ''Oswald's Tale'' as precedents, but he has raised eyebrows by imagining the thoughts of Mr. Pearl as he was about to have his throat cut and those of Ahmed Omar Sheikh, the British-born son of Pakistani immigrants who is the convicted mastermind of the murder.\nMost of the book, though, is reported on the ground. Mr. L\u00e9vy made five trips to Pakistan, two each to India, the United States and Britain, and one each to Bosnia and Dubai. And his conclusion is anything but fictional: that Pakistan's military secret service, the Inter-Services Intelligence, widely known as I.S.I., is deeply involved with both the Islamic fundamentalist groups responsible for Mr. Pearl's death and with Al Qaeda.\nSo why a romanqu\u00eate?\n''I am also a novelist, and I suppose that the book has a tone more of a writer than of a traditional researcher,'' said Mr. L\u00e9vy, whose earlier book, ''Sartre: The Philosopher of the 20th Century'' (Polity Press), has also just been published in English. ''But the real reason is that, by introducing elements of speculation, it was possible to move forward when the investigation seemed stuck. There are moments when I have the intuition of a novelist, moments that serve as sparks to illuminate and advance.''\nHe cited his decision to spend a night at the Akbar International Hotel in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, where on Jan. 11, 2002, Mr. Pearl met Mr. Sheikh. Mr. Pearl had been told that Mr. Sheikh could put him in touch with Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, a Muslim cleric reportedly linked to Richard C. Reid, a Briton accused of using a shoe bomb to try to sabotage an American airliner en route from Paris to Miami. In reality Mr. Sheikh was preparing the kidnapping 12 days later.\nMr. L\u00e9vy said he had been fully briefed on the meeting by Mr. Pearl's assistant, Asif Faruqi, but his ''novelist's instinct'' told him to stay in the hotel. And what he observed, he said, led him to discover that the I.S.I. used the Akbar to house Kashmiri fighters and other Islamic radicals. In other words, he writes, Mr. Sheikh set up the meeting with Mr. Pearl in a hotel ''controlled, almost managed, by the I.S.I.''\nThe bulk of Mr. L\u00e9vy's investigation involved reading police and intelligence files and interviews. To help draw his admiring portrait of Mr. Pearl, for instance, he met the reporter's parents and widow, Mariane, who (unlike The Wall Street Journal) cooperated with him. (He has dedicated the book to Adam Pearl, the child that Mrs. Pearl was carrying at the time of her husband's death.)\nIn London Mr. L\u00e9vy interviewed Mr. Sheikh's brother, former friends and some fellow students from his years at the London School of Economics. He also tracked Mr. Sheikh's steady radicalization: his identification with the plight of Bosnian Muslims, his move to Pakistan, his jailing in India on kidnapping charges, his release in exchange for a hijacked Indian plane and his ties to the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.\nIn Pakistan to verify details obtained from police records, Mr. L\u00e9vy visited the abandoned Karachi house where Mr. Pearl was killed. He met Pakistani officials who openly attacked the United States and, specifically, Jews. And with considerable trepidation, he paid an unannounced visit to the Sunni madrasa, or Islamic seminary, of Binori Town, where Mr. Sheikh is said to have slept some nights before the kidnapping.\nMore critically, as he advanced in his research, Mr. L\u00e9vy came to view the official Pakistani version that Mr. Sheikh acted alone as a cover-up for a far darker reality, one that placed Mr. Sheikh at the heart of a complex network of Islamic fundamentalist groups, many linked to the I.S.I. and Al Qaeda.\nLess clear, Mr. L\u00e9vy admits, is why Mr. Pearl was killed. He nonetheless speculates that Mr. Pearl was pursuing evidence that Al Qaeda and North Korea were receiving nuclear secrets from Pakistani scientists with ties to the I.S.I. and fundamentalist groups. ''In other words,'' Mr. L\u00e9vy writes, ''I bet on a Daniel Pearl busy gathering proof of Pakistan's collusion between the leading rogue states and terrorist networks of the world.''\nPaul Steiger, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, said the newspaper had no evidence that Mr. Pearl was investigating any such conspiracy. ''The Wall Street Journal was not involved in any way in the preparation of this book,'' he said in a statement responding to the book. ''However, we urge all the authorities involved in the investigation to review the book to see whether it provides any useful information which could help in the effort to bring Danny's killers to justice.''\nWhile Mr. L\u00e9vy does not hesitate to proclaim Pakistan itself a rogue state, he chooses to end his book on a conciliatory note, evoking moderate Muslims he has known in Bosnia, Algeria, Morocco and Afghanistan. ''There is this gentle Islam towards which, in spite of everything, until the last minute, Daniel Pearl wanted to believe, as I want to believe,'' he writes. And he adds, ''It was the true subject of this book -- homage to my posthumous friend and a call for the sharing of light.''"}, {"text": "'White Teeth' in the Flesh\n2003-05-11T05:00:00.000Z\nCONTRARY to the ideas of your average male M.F.A. student, fiction writing is not really about power. Properly executed it becomes the exact opposite of worldly power. It neither hurts nor heals in any material sense; no phalanx of soldiers will broach borders for it, no one will lose or gain employment as a result, and no babies shall be birthed. Its sublime bloody uselessness -- here lies its attraction for this particular novelist. For even if I am very bad at it, nothing too bad will come of it. I am a bit like my Archie Jones that way: the less practical effect I have in this world, the happier it makes me.\nI tell you this to give you some idea of what it was like to discover, one glacial November morning in West London, about 500 people freezing to death in various extremes of 1970's costumery (hot pants, halter necks, wind-sock caftans), as a direct result of my first novel, ''White Teeth.'' With a clutch of school friends, I had turned up to be an extra, to play one of those people who pass through the novel without comment or dialogue, and I was appropriately dumbstruck. Look at all this! Twenty lofty white vans lined the suburban street like a snow bank, people were filling in pay slips, searching for the pair of their platform shoe, enviously counting each other's lines. Somehow, all this was my fault. And pinned up on a wall were photographs of all my characters, but this time with unscripted, real faces that were nobody's but their own. I think this is what is called, amongst young Americans, ''a trip.''\nWe noticed immediately how good-looking all these actors were in comparison with their semi-autobiographical originals. The past had been upgraded, made taller and thinner and given the most glorious hair. ''That's telly for you,'' said my friend Hannah as we glumly studied one of the main actresses, the sort a cannibal would reject as a stingy hors d'oeuvre. Yes, that and much more is telly. Most noticeably, telly takes forever. Telly is waiting around in buses for hours listening to people talk about the telly they've done before. Telly is watching a creative idea make its excruciatingly slow progress from script-writer to producer to actor to third and second assistant directors to the director himself to the camera-man, to that poor maligned fellow who must hold the huge, furry grey Q-tip up in the air if anything is to be heard by anyone. Telly is group responsibility. But having not written the script, not participated in the production and not shared my vision with the director (I had no vision), I was free of responsibility and so repaired to the pub until officially required.\nIn the pub, my friends asked me the questions I should be answering in this article. Didn't I want to be involved? Wasn't I worried what they might do to the book? Were there bits of mine I'd instructed them not to touch and if they touched my bits, would I mind? The answers to which are, no, no, no and no. Why shouldn't my bits be touched, and often? I have needs too -- just like anybody. Besides, by this point I had come to realize that my ''White Teeth'' was about a hundred pages too long and suffered from a calamitous ending, dragging at the rear like all unnecessary tails. The truth is, it could do with some touching up. If it were a perfect piece of statuary, then no, one wouldn't want anybody's grubby fingers upon it. But it's not, it's more like a fat, messy kid who needs help. This is what I said to my friends, and they did not believe me. This is what I had said to Nick Brown, the producer, four months earlier, and he didn't believe me either.\nHe came to see me in Kilburn in the dazzling summer; I remember we sat outside of one of the Irish bakeries, and he was very charming, and dressed in the Englishman's July wardrobe of white shirt and khakis, as if accompanying Dr. Livingston. In fact, the first 10 minutes of our conversation were strongly reminiscent of an Englishman's encounter with a new tribe. He seemed uncertain whether I was going to offer him some rolling tobacco or shoot him with a poison dart. This gave me some idea of the writers who had come before me, and Nick was generous with his horror stories. It seems that in the adapting-a-novel-for-the-screen business, there might even be a saying: when going to see the writer, carry a 10-foot pole. For they come in many forms: the writer who must be obeyed, the writer who must have a speaking part, the writer who thinks she understands cinematography, the writer whose record collection is perfect for the soundtrack, and of course, the writer who likes to talk to good-looking actors. For hours. On set. When they're needed elsewhere. Of these crimes against film, I was most tempted by the idea that Britain needed to hear my early-90's collection of seven-inch trip-hop records, broadcast on national television with supplementary moving pictures. I remember Nick dutifully making a list of the titles I gave him and I remember none of them appearing in the final product, which is a mercy to all involved.\nBy the end of our tea, Nick had laid his 10-foot pole on the floor, and we were beginning to enjoy ourselves. I felt that I could, without fear of seeming unreasonable, make my one demand. It was not a big thing, but I realized I felt it with a ferocity that signified I must, after all, have written the book and that I did still care for it. Simply, I wanted Willesden Green in there. I wanted it in all its glory, lit with kindness and photographed with love. The clunky unlovable postwar architecture, the milelong strip of back-to-back kebab and fried chicken take-aways, the halal butchers and grocers. The two imperious, turreted Muslim schools in Queens Park (from which, at 3:30 every afternoon, a thousand Muslim children in traditional dress pour out into the street and pack into the sweet-shops, queuing for ice-pops and candy), the psychedelic, multicolored Hindu temple, the crumbling nunnery at the end of my street, all the schools that look like Victorian prisons (especially the one I went to), the grubby pool-houses on the Finchley Road, and beautiful St. Gabriel's church, a remnant of the country parish Willesden once was, and a church I visited devotedly throughout my childhood, though only to smoke fags around the back of it.\nNick, whom I discovered had once lived in the area, was 100 percent behind me on this. He told me he was 100 percent behind me, and I told him I was 100 percent behind him, but I'm certain that both of us had that feeling that infects all negotiations concerning television and cinema: that no matter who was behind who, the thing was never going to happen anyhow. Not in a month of Sundays. I certainly didn't believe it until I was on the set and in it, as it were.\nThe scene they put me in occurs at the beginning of the book, the moment when Clara Bowden meets Archie Jones. It is 1975 and they are at a huge party. He is old and white and unhappy, and she is young and black and unhappy. She is also excessively beautiful. She comes down the stairs, he sees her -- some time later they marry. This story was a highly bastardized account of the day my parents met, as given to me by my half-sister, Diana, who happened to mention it casually one day, ending 20 years of fervid speculation on my part. This was the initial creative spark of ''White Teeth.'' It took her about 30 seconds to tell the story, and it took me about two years to write it. And now, with four friends I had known since I was 11, I was in the party where my parents met, surrounded by fake hippies and fake dope and fake red wine, and a dancing Chinese girl with no top on and a conga line of four pretty black girls bouncing through the hall. I was caught in that 30-second sequence -- at the very moment my mother walked down the stairs to meet my father -- again and again and again, all the afternoon. The Chinese girl kept on dancing, the black girls went back to their starting positions, my fake red wine was infinitely replenished, the same song played and my mother came down the stairs to meet my father once more. To tell you the truth, it was sort of a spiritual experience. As a rule, I try to avoid those, but this one smacked so insistently of the eternal return (they made me and then I made the book and then I made them and then they made me), and of the generative power of the creative act, that goddamn it if I wasn't crying by the end of the 27th take.\nPossibly this is the reason they cut me out. In the final version, my mother claims you can see the top of my head for a second, but this is only visible to the attuned maternal eye -- normal sight is insufficient. You can, however, see many members of my family; all of whom I instructed not to go near the production, only to find them peering out at me from my telly nine months later. Highlights include my Uncle Andrew, who is the Rastafarian young man in the Jehovah's Witness prayer circle scenes (he had to tie his dreads back for obvious reasons). Also, my 18-year-old brother Luke plays one of the K.E.V.I.N. brothers. He would have me tell you that he is the especially handsome one. An ex-boyfriend, a girl I went to college with, a girl who went out with my friend's brother -- it took all sorts of Willesdeners to make ''White Teeth'' the novel, and all sorts turned out for the auditions as well. Many of them got the parts. And so when I watch the show, its personal nature is far more intense than the novel has ever seemed to me. Real people and places I have loved are everywhere. I don't mind being cut out because so much was left in -- particularly Willesden, as promised. Willesden never looked so good. Honestly, it looks so damn good you'd be forgiven for thinking it isn't Willesden, and in places it isn't -- South London was used often. But it was hard to get mad about this ultimate betrayal when somehow they found streets that seemed more Willesden than Willesden itself, if you see what I mean.\nAs for the film itself as artwork, it is readers who have occasionally complained to me about the lack of fidelity to this or that bit of the novel -- I have been told off by those who think I should have exercised a little more of the power I spoke of earlier. But to me the cuts were necessary to make the fat and messy kid presentable, and at least one of the changes is inspired. The attentive viewer will note a difference in the manner in which Samad sends one of his sons to live in Bangladesh. A cut has been made; a motivation inserted, and an artistic clarity is the result. The moment I saw it, I gasped -- this section of the novel would have been so improved had I thought of the same strategy. It is this kind of cutting and pasting in the film that I most enjoyed; it taught me a lesson. In a novel, one scrabbles in the dirt for motivation or stretches for decorative language to hide the lack of it. In film, no such disguise will be tolerated by the viewer. When we watch a man do something on screen, our guts much more than our brains will tell us the truth of the gesture, the action. It cannot be fudged. Fiction can learn from film here, or at least, mine can.\nI'm pretty much finished now, but I'd like to say a quick rapturous word concerning something else that my fiction cannot do and film can: faces. Nothing disappoints more in fiction than the description of people's heads and faces -- their shocks of red hair and tediously broad foreheads, their wide even teeth or small pointy ones, their large noses, furrowed brows, dimpled smiles and on and on. Good facial description is too rare. Although Dickens left you in no doubt concerning Mr. Gradgrind's visage, and Nabokov's Pnin and his Lolita possess two of the only faces in modern fiction that I remember, what of the other great characters? Anna Karenina, Elizabeth Bennet, Joseph K, Janie Crawford, Rabbit Angstrom -- what do they look like? Having absolutely no visual sense, my Archie and Samad were completely blank from the neck up in my mind. I knew everything they thought, but nothing of how they looked. Here the TV show gave me something remarkable, made me exquisitely powerless and grateful. I could write another 2,000 words on the faces of Om Puri (Samad) and Phil Davies (Archie). The terrific, deeply ridged apple-pathways and pock marks of Mr. Puri's ennobling beauty (he makes things around him become beautiful). And Mr. Davies's exemplary Englishness: an open, plain, unassuming face that releases devastating emotion on a drip feed. I'm glad I had neither of their faces in mind when I wrote; they are so there I would have lost all the power I have, which is to do a little scribbling about what is not there, and never will be, unless I make it flesh."}, {"text": "Ideas Unlimited, Built to Order\n2003-10-30T05:00:00.000Z\nEVER wonder why the audio capacity of a standard compact disk is 74 minutes? Thank Beethoven -- and Norio Ohga.\nIn the early 1980's, Sony was helping to develop a new digital music technology. Mr. Ohga, then the company's president, insisted that no matter what else, the new format had to be able to play Beethoven's Ninth Symphony without interruption. Mr. Ohga, you see, had been a classical vocalist before getting into electronics.\nThat the capacity of the world's most popular music format was defined by one man's musical taste should not be all that surprising. Necessity may have once been the mother of invention, but these days convenience is the likely surrogate, or at least the midwife.\nBut unlike electronics company executives, most people cannot command vast laboratories to weave their imagined conveniences into reality. They have other things to do than focus on how many megapixels, bits and megahertz are packed into the latest digital camera/cellphone/MP3 player. (For that matter, was anyone clamoring for a cellphone with a built-in camera in the first place?) Still, people will tell you what they really want -- if you ask them. So Circuits did.\nEleven prominent men and women, few of them technologists, suggested a technology or gadget they would like to see invented. One theme in their responses is a desire to break free from the incessant blinking and buzzing and flashing that the digital age has produced. It is a yearning to make technology more responsive to human needs rather than an inchoate web of digitalese existing for its own sake.\nOf course, the extravagances of one generation become the essentials of the next. Think about cellphones, or even color television. Convenience may be the new mother of invention, and perhaps that is good enough.\nJohn Perry Barlow\nCo-founder and vice chairman, Electronic Frontier Foundation; former lyricist for the Grateful Dead\nDump the Doodads, and Retrofit the Brain\nI want a gizmo to liberate me from gizmos. I keep thinking about the Aborigines, who decided very early on, like 50,000 years ago, that they had five tools and that was all they needed and they didn't develop any more. I've reached the point where I believe that gadgets are self-replicating to the point where my whole life is a sea of gimcrackery and doodads. I want to connect with people without feeling constantly oppressed by all of the beeping and buzzing and whining.\nI find myself toting two cellphones and a P.D.A. and a laptop and a Swiss Army knife. I feel completely overwhelmed by all of my tools, and even with all of these tools I find I am unable to make the kinds of connections I want at the times that I want. I look at 19th-century novels and it seems people were in better touch then than they are now. It seems as if every time someone in Dickens wants to reach someone, they are able to right away. Of course, they had 15-year-old boys they could dispatch to go find someone.\nI suppose I'm still waiting for the brain implant. Presumably that would be an ultimate interface between your nervous system and the larger accretive nervous system that you could switch on or off in different ways that would be constantly reconfigurable so that you wouldn't have to upgrade it by buying a new one every six months. But I don't think that's a very likely possibility. I've watched the efforts to develop a universal remote control, and they haven't been very promising so far.\nSCOTT ADAMS\n''Dilbert'' cartoonist\nPuss Can Run, but He Can't Hide\nI would like a cat locator device. About four times a week I become certain that one of my two cats has either run away or somehow become trapped in a wall or inside a major appliance. I end up crawling under beds, opening every closet door, calling the cat's name (as if!), and shaking the food bin. Nothing works, and with each passing minute I am imagining increasingly worse fates -- ''Maybe Smokey crawled up the chimney and got stuck!''\nBefore long, full panic sets in. I am sweating profusely, overturning the furniture, disassembling the television -- ''Sweet Jesus, has anyone used the oven lately??!!'' This goes on for about 20 minutes until the missing cat, thoroughly entertained, emerges from some secret hiding place.\nIdeally, the cat locator would present a top view of my house with a blinking light to indicate the cat's location. It would answer a long-nagging question once and for all: Are cats just good at hiding or have they developed the power of invisibility?\nMartina Navratilova\nTennis professional\nThe Ball Is In, or Out. Period.\nI can't say enough about technology. People tell me they can now play tennis on their hand-held phones and laptop computers. I saw a TV segment about a product that can tell me what secrets my dogs are trying to tell me when they bark. My car has no common sense, but its navigation system can take me right through a large body of water to get from point A to point B, and it has the audacity to brusquely correct me if I choose to go over a bridge instead of under it.\nThe only technology missing in my otherwise full life is a tennis linesperson who is always right.

O.K., the scoring could use an update, but it still works. But oh, those humans just can't seem to get it right.\nI want the new technological linesperson.

The Form's Filled Out\nAs a husband, father, citizen and professional, I am constantly having to recall personal data and financial information and information about my kids' dates of birth, Social Security numbers -- just a myriad of information. When the mortgage rates drop, I have to fill out 10 sheets of paper. When I get my car registered, I fill out other sheets of paper. When my kids sign up for soccer or gymnastics, there are more forms.\nI would love to have a small device like the Apple iPod in a small relational database to store virtually everything I would need for family and personal records, including health records. Let's say it would be coded so that when you went to the doctor for a checkup, it could beam your records to you, and when you went to the D.M.V., you could just get scanned and it would get your information. When you file your taxes, the I.R.S. would give you an interface to fill out your tax forms and your mortgage records. And you would have Wi-Fi so you can upload and download information.\nSo when my mortgage broker calls and says, ''Rates have dropped; fill out the forms,'' I could instantly upload my data into the housing mortgage forms. When my kids go to sign up for soccer, they would give me the form and the device would automatically fill out the form with this simple iPod-like interface. Same thing with the D.M.V. registration.\nUntil we start giving families something more useful than just the gadget that the 10-year-old kid has, I don't think we've started to turn technology into something for the masses, for everyone.

It's obvious that billions of people the world over enjoy recreational drugs from time to time, and that most of these drugs (the legal and illegal ones) are physically harmful and/or addictive. So why can't the chemical composition and/or means of delivery of certain drugs be altered so that they're no longer harmful or addictive?\nNot to drag out this old clich\u00e9, but do you mean to tell me that they can put a man on the moon but they can't subtly alter recreational drugs so that they're not addictive or bad for you? One doesn't have to make the case for the importance of recreational drug use, as almost every society since the extinction of the Neanderthals has to some extent incorporated recreational drug use as a valued or important personal or communal ritual.\nThese recreational drugs could be anything from alcohol to psilocybin mushrooms to opium to tobacco, and all of these are, to varying extents, toxic. So just as we've taken the sting out of space travel, why can't we eliminate or ameliorate the toxic qualities and effects of recreational drug use? We have the technology. We wouldn't become a nation of addicts, because addiction would be impossible.\nBecoming addicted to these new drugs would be akin to developing an addiction to corn. Recreational drug use has been, and continues to be, an integral part of our culture. Recreational drug use is practiced in bars and in churches, in Dumpsters and in penthouses, so with all of our technological resources, why can't we make it as safe as it is fun?\nPatricia F. Russo\nChairwoman and chief executive, Lucent Technologies\nOne Gizmo to Supplant 15\nThink of it as an electronic concierge. When I travel I have my laptop. I have a BlackBerry. I have two separate phones. In Europe I use one, and in the United States I use the other. We have all of these things, and I want to concentrate them into one device.\nFirst, I want it for access to my e-mail, and I want either to have the e-mail read to me with a text-to-speech capability or to be able to read it on the screen. Second, I want to be able to dictate to it and create a message that could then be sent as either e-mail or voice mail.\nIn terms of intelligence, it would be great to be able to track down whoever I want to get in touch with, and I want it to be voice-activated. So I can say, ''Find Frank for me,'' and it knows I mean Frank D'Amelio, my C.F.O. And the unit has information about Frank's cellphone and e-mail and so on. I want it to be able to control another device to tape a program I just learned was going to be on, or so it can arm my home alarm system or seek information about a hotel or restaurant based on where I am or am going.\nReally, it's a gateway device so I don't need 15 different gadgets to get things done.\nDonald J. Trump\nReal estate developer\nYour Wish Is My Command\nI would like a computer chip that I could attach to the brains of all my contractors so that they would know exactly what I wanted, when I wanted it, and at what price I wanted it. This would save me a lot of time and a lot of yelling.\nMargaret Cho\nActress and comedian\nLaptop, Butler and Virtual Mom\nI wish there was a laptop computer that would stay at body temperature, and not heat up to the point of your needing a phone book in between the computer and your lap. It should be extremely thin and easy to carry in one hand, yet with a large enough screen to make watching films very close to like being in a theater, with a surround-sound system loud enough to fill an entire room.\nThe computer should be powered by solar energy, which could be from any source, not only the sun, so that even the illumination of the screen could keep it going. There would never be any reason to turn it off, because it would always be on. It would also be online all the time, no matter where you are, with a speed-of-light connection, loading pages instantaneously but killing pop-ups before they have a chance to blur your vision. This nifty gadget would be able to find a signal in Antarctica and could double as a cellular phone, a two-way pager, a fax, a stereo and a television.\nThe memory would be astounding, and there would be room to store thousands of films and reruns of television shows as well as every piece of music ever made. The computer should also have a mood reader, like those rings from the 70's, where it would change color according to the state of mind of the wearer: the computer would immediately start to play a film that would snap you out of a bad mood or a piece of music to pull you out of any depression.\nThe machine would be more than just a laptop, but a very good and intuitive friend, dispensing good advice when needed, shutting itself down when it felt that you were overworking yourself, ordering food when you have worked so hard that you forgot to eat and are getting a headache. This laptop would be extremely affordable as well as indestructible, and every time a new model came out, the computer would automatically update itself so that you would have every new feature as soon as it was invented.\nIt would be a computer that not only served your needs but would anticipate your needs, as well as accomplish those things that we forget to do for ourselves that really are well deserved, like nice hot dinners and back rubs. It would also record television shows that it thought would be interesting for you to see, as well as pre-download music you might like and movies that you are not to live another moment without seeing. Yes. That is what I would want.\nWilliam Gibson\nNovelist\nLies Exposed in Telltale Colors\nI want to PayPal for some nameless download out of an offshore data haven, something that feeds every piece of Web news I read through some unknowable outland server, some swift and anonymous meshing of fuzzy logics cooked up by sleepless programmers in Bangladesh or Burma; some voodoo thing that unfailingly highlights outright lies, spin and misperception -- in different colors.\nI'd set my Mac to show me the outright lies in Pistachio, the spin in sky-blue Bondi, and the misperceptions in succulent Plum. Large swaths of news would probably be Plum, both that written by journalists and some large percentage of politicians' quotes. Perhaps relatively few Pistachio highlights would appear in the actual reportage, indicating direct mendacity on the part of a journalist, though it would be interesting to find out just how few, or how many.\nThe Plum of misperception would be heavily shot through with the Bondi of spin, I've no doubt, but the real nuggets, whole Pistachio statements by politicians, would stand out, I would imagine, quite regularly down the screen.\nSome people, I suppose, might complain that it took the fun out of guessing. Luddites!\nBill Joy\nCo-founder, Sun Microsystems\nMemo to My Borsalino: Quiet!\nI would like to have a cap of silence. This is a hat (wouldn't it be nice if hats came back?) that has directional microphones and noise-canceling speakers.\nIt would have software so that, for example, if you were sitting in a restaurant next to someone who was speaking annoyingly or obnoxiously, you could touch the hat (or even speak to it) and it would then cancel out their speech so that you wouldn't hear it.\n(This from the ''cone of silence'' on the old TV show ''Get Smart.'')\nGeneralizing this to the three monkeys -- see, hear and speak no evil -- you could have a pair of glasses that did what the hat did, doing both sight and sound. For extra credit it could detect when you are using language you shouldn't around the children, and bleep you."}, {"text": "'A Mighty Heart'\n2003-09-21T05:00:00.000Z\n Dawn will rise soon over Karachi. Curled in Danny's warm embrace, I feel safe. I like that this position is called \"spooning\" in English. We are like spoons in a drawer, pressed to each another, each fitted to the other's shape. I love these sweet moments of oblivion and the peace they bring me. No matter where we are - Croatia, Beirut, Bombay - this is my shelter. This is our way of meeting the challenge, of confronting the chaos of the world. \n As I awaken, I struggle for the right words to describe this place. It is the curse of all journalists, I suppose, to be writing a story even as you are living it. I am not sure I'll ever get to know Karachi. I have distrusted this city from the start, though we are partly here to find out if its bad reputation is deserved. Once relatively stable, even sleepy, Karachi became a nexus for drug and arms trafficking in the 1980s. Now the city is an intricate puzzle, decadent and beastly at the same time, metastasizing into a capital of blind hatred and violent militancy. \n The Pakistani people are equally fractured. Those born in their own land hate the Muslim immigrants who arrived from India after the two countries were partitioned in 1947. The Sunni Muslims loathe the Shiite Muslims. Since 1998 more than seventy doctors have been assassinated in Karachi; most were Shiites mowed down by Sunni zealots. And the pro-Taliban fundamentalists, who have been sinking deep roots here, detest the rest of the world. \n There are so many people in this city, but no one seems to know how to count them all. Are there ten million? Twelve? Fourteen? Most of Pakistan is landlocked, pressed between India and Afghanistan, with parts of its borders touching southwestern Iran and the farthermost reaches of China. But Karachi, on the brown coast of the Arabian Sea, is the country's major port and, as such, is a magnet for migrants who drift in from the Pakistani countryside and across the border from even poorer places - Afghan villages, Bangladesh, the rural outposts of India. By day you see the poor burn under the scorching sun, selling vegetables and newspapers at dusty crossroads. At night they disappear in the labyrinthine streets, lending the city an air of foreboding. To us, this third-world city may glow with a feeble light, but Karachi draws the desperately poor like a torch draws fireflies. \n Very rarely am I awake when Danny is still asleep, especially since I became pregnant. A ray of soft light enters our room, and falling back into sweet torpor, I gradually give up on the mysteries of Karachi and rejoin my husband in this privileged warm space of ours. Together, we can hold on to this night a little longer. \n SEVEN A.M. Danny is pushing back the bedroom door with his foot. He brings coffee and dry - if not stale - biscuits to stave off the fits of nausea I still fight in the morning. Sometimes I have to rush to the bathroom to retch as soon as I wake. The noise alone can turn Danny pale. He seems so unhappy to witness my suffering that I try to muffle the sound track. Danny pretends the pregnancy is making me moody. A few days ago I chanced on a less than discreet email he sent his childhood friend Danny Gill in California: \n Hey! ... Mariane's belly is getting very pronounced. It's quite a thing to see. Due date is May, ground zero is Paris. She's sick often, moody occasionally, hungry earlier than usual, impatient but only with Pakistanis, horny when other symptoms don't get in the way.... \n To my mind, Danny's moods have become unpredictable, too. I can't tell if it is because he is about to become a father, or because the world has gone amok in the four months since the World Trade Center was brought down, taking with it more than a few certainties. Danny is the South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal . Militant Islamic terrorism may hit anywhere on the globe, but the heart (if you can call it that) of its network is here, in this region, and the work at hand is daunting. \n Danny and I have always reported alongside each other. I accompany him on most of his interviews; he comes along for most of mine. Yet I do not kid myself. He is the more experienced journalist, and he works for one of the most powerful news organizations in the world, whereas I work primarily for French public radio and television, which has barely enough money to pay for my me\u0301tro tickets back home in Paris. But our differences in background and in culture make us well matched. We know naturally when to hold back and let the other speak. \n I make Danny laugh to help him forget his worries; I make sure there is silence when he concentrates. And we engage each other in endless philosophical debates - about truth and courage, about how to fight preconceived ideas, about how to learn from and respect other cultures. Still, to try to shed light on the nature of terrorist activities is to plunge into a kingdom of darkness. \n Already it is getting hot. To make me feel better, Danny reminds me that today is the last day of this assignment in Pakistan. Tomorrow we will check in to a five-star hotel in Dubai and stretch out on the beaches of the Arabian Gulf. It's a roundabout way back to our home in Bombay, but Pakistan and India are now at loggerheads, and there is no longer a direct connection between the neighboring countries. Battling over the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir, the two nations have escalated their historical animosity to the point that the world is braced for either side to unleash an attack against the other. Both Pakistan and India have used Kashmir as an excuse to justify recent military buildups; both possess arms of mass destruction; both strike poses as if they'll use the weapons. I think of the cops of Karachi, patrolling the streets in their pitiful uniforms, batons their only weapons. \n The tension is palpable. We hear it in the voices of our Pakistani friends. On December 24 , 2001 - the rare occasion that Christmas, Hanukkah, and Eid-ul-Fitr, the end of Ramadan, coincided - Danny received a note from an anxious friend in Peshawar, a relatively unstable city on the Pakistani-Afghan border: \n Happy Eid and happy Crismiss to you. Please also tell us about your wife. Are Indian armies ready to fight with us but they do not know that the Muslims will sacrifice their lives for Islam. In the case of war, India will be divided in lot of pieces and Muslim will take away his [clothes]. \n My prayer is that OH GOD Save my country from his enemies. Business conditions in Pakistan especially in Peshawar are not so good.... So at the end I say that God may live long for us and whole of yours family. With best wishes, Wasim \n Wasim is the director of a noodle factory. Danny met him two years ago in the Tehran airport. A very conservative Muslim, Wasim distrusts Westerners in general, but we went to visit him last December, and he treated us as his special guests, plying us with local delights, grilled meats and pastries, and inviting us to visit the marketplaces during Ramadan. Strolling through one store, he randomly picked up a pair of high-heeled shoes, shoes no proper Muslim wife would ever wear, and he insisted on buying them for me. On another night we had the honor of being invited to dinner at his house, a two-story mansion in an overcrowded area of the city. After we arrived, Danny disappeared in a cloud of several men, while seven women swooped in to take charge of me. Sitting cross-legged on carpets and removing their veils, they studied me with intense and unapologetic curiosity as they made me eat three plates of meatballs and rice. \n Danny wrote back to Wasim: \n Wishing you a happy Christmas, Hanukkah, and Eid. Mariane and I are taking my colleague and our local Kashmiri carpet dealers out for Christmas dinner. So we'll have three Muslims, two Jews and a Buddhist, which sounds like the beginning of an airplane joke, but may be a good way to wish peace on earth - or at least in Kashmir. Danny. \n We are staying with Danny's dear friend and colleague from The Wall Street Journal , Asra Q. Nomani, a most unconventional woman. An Indian-born Muslim, Asra was raised in West Virginia, and she is in Karachi to complete research on a book she's writing about Tantra. Tantra is generally associated with the sexual practices taught in The Kama Sutra; Asra insists she is focusing on its spiritual side. She is short and feminine but athletic, and striking-looking. Hers is an assertive beauty: Her shoulder-length black hair glistens with the oil that Indians use for daily head massages, and her face is dominated by sharp, broad cheekbones and eyes so dark and large that in repose, she can look like an ancient statue of Saraswati, the goddess who possesses all the learnings of the Vedas, from wisdom to devotion. But in this world she is also outrageously avant-garde. Unmarried women do not, as a rule, live alone in Karachi, but that hasn't stopped Asra, and she has rented a huge house in a district that is, oddly, named Defense Phase 5. Not only that, she has recently fallen in love with one of the sons of Pakistan's elite, nine years her junior. He is an attractive young man whom I immediately find somewhat empty. \n To welcome us, Asra has planted flowers at the entrance to the house, which is in a gated community, one of the most luxurious in Karachi. Here, the houses are guarded by a handful of skinny men, who take turns stationing themselves in a guardhouse, the main purpose of which is to protect them from the relentless heat. The neighbors hold good positions in the army and the government, or perhaps organized crime. The terrible gangster Dawood Ibrahim, by reputation a bloody barbarian, is supposed to have property around here. Danny has toyed with the idea of profiling him for the paper. \n Inside, Asra has prepared a true honeymooners' bedroom for us. There are flowers and pine-scented candles, a bottle of massage oil, another of bubble bath. To the left of our bed, a small window covered with wire looks out onto a room off the courtyard where a foldout cot occupies the place of honor next to a clothesline draped with children's clothes. This is the property of the house servants, Shabir and Nasrin, who could themselves be called the property of the house, because Asra hired them when she rented the place. I visited their room. They have nothing. They sleep on the floor, and their tiny daughter, Kashva, a doll-like girl with short hair, sleeps tucked between her parents. Nasrin is pregnant. I dare not say \"like me,\" so different will our two children's destinies be. \n Danny draws the curtain on the scene, his gesture a perfect metaphor for how one tends to deal with poverty everywhere. Our honeymoon room already looks like a whirlwind swept through it. This is Danny's way of moving in, his trademark. He opens his suitcases and scatters everything within them. Socks. The French comic books he uses to learn my native language (and which he thoroughly enjoys). Shaving equipment. His Flatiron mandolin, handmade in Bozeman, Montana, and more portable than his violin. Upstairs, his tools of the trade have already devoured Asra's office - a laptop, a Palm Pilot with the special keyboard Danny uses when he's traveling, a variety of wired devices, a digital camera, stacks of expense receipts, and Super Conque\u0301rant notebooks, which he buys in bulk in papeteries in Paris. \n Danny emerges from the bathroom in his shorts, cell phone in hand. He is one of those rare men whose eyes, those chestnut green eyes, always betray him; he cannot hide anything, especially when he's in a playful mood. I smile because I find him beautiful, and because my love for him is absolute. Without dropping the phone, he slips under the sheet. He crawls carefully over my body and reaches my rounded belly, where he starts a private conversation with our child in a tongue known only by the two of them. All I can gather is that he makes many promises for the moment the baby comes out. I weave my fingers through his thick brown hair. \n Danny goes to the most unexpected hairstylists. Funny phrase, that. The more picturesque the barbershop, the happier Danny is. Most of the time the barbers don't speak English, but this way one is always assured of a surprising result. This is Danny's way of facing the world: with trust. When we moved to Bombay in October 2000, the first thing he did was go to the barber on our small street. The fellow might have been cutting a white boy's hair for the first time in his entire life, but he had a great ancient barber chair with a dirty white leather seat and red armrests. I sat on the bench just behind Danny, following the action in the mirror. Everything was silent except for the drone of the flies and the snipping of the scissors. Suddenly I realized women were not supposed to be here. Well, blame it on the cultural gap, I thought; I'm staying. The barber began massaging Danny's head so vigorously that it whipped back and forth. Danny looked stricken with shyness, and he fought hard to avoid me in the mirror. I nervously laughed so hard that tears came to my eyes. But they turned into real tears when I was startled by the awareness that we were actually going to live right here, on this very street, which was filled with rats, and where women weren't welcome, and where everyone seemed stern and stiff and cold. Where I was going to be a foreigner. An outsider. \n Danny is still talking to \"Embryo,\" as we call him - I think he is telling Embryo that he will be a boy. We found out the day before coming to Karachi, at a sophisticated clinic in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, where they not only perform prenatal sonograms but claim to be able to influence the gender of the baby. \n \"BOY! IT'S A BOY! WHOO HOO!! Rock n Roll!! F-in A, man! We BAD, dude, We F-ing BAD!!!\" Danny emailed Danny Gill. \"Don't get me wrong, a girl would be great too. But IT'S A BOY! HOWOOOO! HOWOOOOO! BOYS RULE!!!\" \n I actually feel a little strange about carrying the male sex inside of me. When I tell Danny this, his eyes light up, as they always do when he's about to crack a joke. \"You know, honey,\" he says, \"that's how it all started ...\" \n This morning Danny is more solemn. \"It's incredible how much you can love somebody you haven't even met yet,\" he marvels. He says he wants to study the whole Encyclopaedia Britannica to be able to answers those questions kids never stop asking, like \"How can you keep the sky from falling?\" \n Danny gets up and finishes dressing. His glasses give him a serious look, and when he works, he always dresses with understated elegance. He might have a little weakness for beautiful ties, but he doesn't look anything like a baroudeur , one of those swashbuckling journalists in their ready-for-action safari jackets. \n I have a cold. \n Continues... \n Excerpted from A Mighty Heart by Mariane Pearl, Sarah Crichton Copyright &copy 2003 by Mariane Pearl \n Excerpted by permission.

Aesop Rock is the most intriguing of all the rappers affiliated with the Brooklyn-based label Definitive Jux. His new album, ''Bazooka Tooth,'' is full of off-kilter beats and bilious rhymes that overlap so densely that you may sometimes think you are hearing two records at once. His logorrhea can be exhausting, but his quick tongue and enigmatic narratives may win you over, even if you can decipher only a few lines at a time. One riff seems to go something like this: ''Buried his nozzle in fossil marker art/Pardon, cadaver had a legitimate pulse, and littered volts/Over the village where the skittish pigeons molt.'' Tomorrow night at 9, with El-P, S. A. Smash and others. Tickets are $15; sold out, but returns may be available (Kelefa Sanneh).\n* MARIA DEL MAR BONET, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Maria del Mar Bonet, from Majorca, is a singer who draws on traditions from Spain and across the Mediterranean to inform her ethereal songs. Tomorrow night at 8 and 10. Admission is $20 (Jon Pareles).\nVINICIUS CANTU\u00c1RIA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Vinicius Cantu\u00e1ria, a Brazilian songwriter who has lived in New York since the mid-1990's, is steeped in the bossa nova: its gently brushed guitar chords, its quietly elaborate melodies, its shades of sensuality and melancholy. He is working a triple bill tomorrow night: as a duo with the guitarist Smokey Hormel, who is part of the Brazilian-flavored group Smokey and Miho, at 8; with his band at 10; and with as yet unnamed guests at midnight. Admission is $12 with a one-drink minimum per set, or $20 for all three sets (Pareles).\n* CAPERCAILLIE, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. Capercaillie updates traditional Scottish music from the top down; the melodies sweetly sung by Karen Matheson or played by Michael McGoldrick on flute and pipes are traditional, but the beats reach into rock and dance music. Tomorrow night at 8. Tickets are $26, $21 for members, $15 for students (Pareles).\nDAVE DAVIES, Inter-Media Art Center, 370 New York Avenue, Huntington, N.Y., (631) 549-2787. This lead guitarist and longtime second banana in the Kinks has lately been touring on his own, telling tales of his long-running sibling rivalry with the Kinks's leader, Ray Davies. His music reminds listeners that he was the one who made early Kinks songs like ''You Really Got Me'' into power-chorded foretastes of heavy metal. Tomorrow night at 9. Tickets are $37.50 (Pareles).\nRAMBLIN' JACK ELLIOTT, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300. One of Woody Guthrie's many disciples, Ramblin' Jack Elliott was born in Brooklyn and put on his cowboy hat to see the world and bring back stories and songs. With Sarah Lee Guthrie and Kevn Kinney. Tonight at 7:30 and 10:30. Tickets are $20 (Pareles).\nORRIN EVANS QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, below Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Coming from Philadelphia, where so many promising young jazz players seem to be pouring in from these days, Mr. Evans is a ball of energy, determined to outdo the Miles Davis Quintet of the 1960's in terms of a concept of controlled freedom on the bandstand. His band members can seem as if they are just following their instincts, but at a subtle cue they snap into a piece of composed material. This weekend he plays with some of his hometown friends: Ralph Bowen and Victor North on saxophones, Mike Boone on bass and Byron Landham on drums. Tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30. Admission is $12 a set, $10 for members (Ben Ratliff).\n* GORKY'S ZYGOTIC MYNCI, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, from Wales, can be wistful or raucous, mixing affection for the 1960's with a streak of punk. The band rarely misses a chance to display a good melody. Sunday night at 9, with Mascott opening. Tickets are $10 (Pareles).\n* GRANDADDY, SUPER FURRY ANIMALS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. ''I'm O.K. with my decay,'' Jason Lytle sings on Grandaddy's new album, ''Sumday'' (V2). As he looks into a near future of decline and disillusionment, he wafts his high, wistful voice over tunes that unfold into near-orchestral pop, sharing the musical realm of bands like Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips. Super Furry Animals, part of the wave of Welsh bands that emerged in the mid-1990's, hopscotch through rock's past to play whatever they want, whether it is glam or garage-rock or psychedelia or techno with a Hawaiian guitar sample. There is plenty of melody, humor and unabashed affection behind the unhinged style-hopping. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, with Home opening. Tickets are $22.75 in advance, $25 on the day of the show (Pareles).\nEDDIE HENDERSON, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. Mr. Henderson is a trumpeter with a tough-as-nails sound, whose style was forged in the 1970's when Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard and Lee Morgan were still the ones to beat. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30. Cover charge is $20 (Ratliff).\nD. D. JACKSON TRIO, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, at Seventh Avenue, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. This Canadian jazz pianist is concerned with the evolution of jazz, and he is getting there through hybrid forms, having added dashes of a classical sensibility, Latin music, electric fusion, free improvisation and other things. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30. Cover charge is $18 with a $5 minimum (Ratliff).\n* GUILLERMO KLEIN, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-6056. Mr. Klein, from Argentina and now living in Spain, led a big band in New York for about three years was a jewel of the jazz underground. He has absorbed some of his style from the most ambitious jazz fusion of the 1970's, such as Hermeto Pascoal and Kenny Wheeler; there is some classical minimalism in it, too. Yet there is an original stateliness to his writing for brass and reeds. He has great taste, and the music he writes for this 12-piece group steers around bombast, mixing tightly structured arrangements with the cacophonic frisson of independently shouting horns. His group, Los Guachos, regularly includes the saxophonists Miguel Zenon, Bill McHenry and Chris Cheek; the trumpeters Richard Nant and Diego Urcola; the guitarist Ben Monder; the drummer Jeff Ballard; and the singer Luciana Souza -- a roll call of names that should be known to jazz enthusiasts today. Tonight and tomorrow night at 10. Cover charge is $15 (Ratliff).\n* UTE LEMPER, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300. Ms. Lemper built a career on classical art songs, especially the corrosive cabaret songs of Brecht and Weill, and she fearlessly revived songs attached to figures like Marlene Dietrich and \u00c9dith Piaf. Then she sought out their modern descendants: twisted love songs by Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. And lately she has written a few songs of her own. Tomorrow night at 8. Admission is $35 (Pareles).\nLOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO GEORGE HARRISON, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. The overshadowed Beatle who wrote ''Taxman,'' ''Something,'' ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps,'' ''Savoy Truffle'' and ''Bangladesh'' gets a tribute from the pop archivists at the Loser's Lounge. Tonight and tomorrow at 8. Tickets are $20 (Pareles).\n* ''THE MUSIC OF DEXTER GORDON'': GEORGE CABLES TRIO, WAYNE ESCOFFERY, JIMMY GREENE, JERRY WELDON, Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse, 10th floor, Rose Building, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Dexter Gordon (1923-1990) was, among other things, a bridge between the tenor saxophonists of the swing years and John Coltrane. His behind-the-beat phrasing, at its best, was poetry, and he is still a salubrious influence on developing musicians. Tonight three of them, the saxophonists Wayne Escoffery, Jimmy Greene and Jerry Weldon, play music associated with Gordon. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Admission is $55 (Ratliff).\n* PEACHES, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. This rapper's reputation precedes her: she is widely known (or, more accurately, narrowly known) for being white, female, Canadian and lewd -- not necessarily in that order. The title of her new album modifies a common four-syllable expletive by switching the gender; unfortunately, her rhymes often rely on a similarly programmatic approach. Still, she rarely disappoints at her concerts, at which she urges fans to shake the body parts she raps about. Sunday night at 11, with Electrocute and XBXRX. Tickets are $18 (Sanneh).\nREALISTICS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. The Realistics look back to the late 1970's and early 80's, riffling through styles from the Police, the Cars, the Raspberries and even Supertramp. Tonight at 9, with Mrnorth, Johnny Lives and the Flesh. Tickets are $13 (Pareles).\nR.E.M., SPARKLEHORSE, PETE YORN, Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000; Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741. R.E.M. showed a generation of collegiate rockers how to wind taut guitar lines around enigmatic words. In the 1990's its songs grew more pensive, adding keyboards and atmosphere, but with a retrospective album coming out, the band is likely to reach way back in its repertory. Pete Yorn, who opens the show at the Jones Beach Theater, has started revving up his smoky seductions with aggressive guitars. Sparklehorse, which opens the show at Madison Square Garden, occupies the far reaches of alternative country, where static and entropy threaten to blot out Mark Linkous's cantankerous, troubled songs. He has plaintive ballads and brawny guitar riffs to offer, but he is so ambivalent that he hides them in off-kilter arrangements and thickets of distortion. At Jones Beach Theater tonight at 7:30.

The Sunni cleric died along with his driver and three bodyguards, murdered near a tollbooth in a high-security area of Islamabad, the rich, spacious and usually sedate capital of a poor, crowded and deeply tumultuous country: Pakistan.\nAzam Tariq was considered an extreme man even in a nation abundant with extremists. Often accused of ordering the deaths of innocent Shiites, he made his home in Jhang, a robust city in the vast plains of central Punjab. It is a relatively prosperous area, with an occasional tractor to share beastly burdens with the water buffalo. But the greatest portion of the wealth remains with feudal landlords, most of whom are Shiites. Resentment of these landlords helped provoke years of spasmodic sectarian violence. This reciprocal bloodshed joined the other centrifugal forces that always seem to be flinging Pakistan toward bedlam: the religious fanaticism, the ethnic separatism, the political corruption, the four military takeovers, the three wars with India, the two wars in Afghanistan, the inconstant friendship of America.\nAs it happened, I interviewed Azam Tariq two days before he was gunned down. ''Anyone will know how to find me,'' he had promised in lieu of directions. And indeed, people in Jhang confidently pointed the way through the curvy and narrow lanes of an old neighborhood, where an automobile seemed a clumsy machine amid motor scooters and donkey carts. Maulana is a term of respect for a scholar, one dutifully applied by Azam Tariq's thousands of followers. That morning, the maulana was busy at his small compound, encircled in his office by dozens of supplicants needing help with their unpaid bills and unresolved quarrels. A bespectacled man with a henna tint to his stiff beard, Azam Tariq, 41, was wearing a turban, its long tail hanging over the front of his white linen shalwar kameez. He sat patiently on the floor behind a cloth-covered table, his ministrations repeatedly disrupted by phone calls. Outside were young sentries with machine guns. A closed-circuit TV monitored the mosque across the street.\nWhen Azam Tariq saw he had guests, he excused himself from the office and led my translator and me to a simply furnished guest room. An aide was sent to fetch bottles of 7Up and a plate of cookies. Then, unprompted by questions, the maulana began an enthusiastic self-defense, portraying himself as a reasonable man of virtuous restraint. Rather than killing Shiites, he said, they ''should merely be declared non-Muslims'' and jailed for 10 or 15 years. ''We have never called for violence against anyone.''\nThese were lies, which was to be expected. Pakistan is a great hub of duplicity, and the maulana was just one of the many chameleon characters who seemed able to operate at both its center and fringe, something like the nation itself, which is one of America's essential allies in the war against terrorism and also one of terrorism's essential incubators in its war against the West. Each time I visit the country, I hope for some blossom of understanding but return with the wilt of confusion. This is a nation of confounding murkiness, where every kind of deception, collusion and outright sham are recurring motifs in the political theater. Rumors and conspiracy theories are as commonly exchanged as rupee notes, the information -- some of it even true -- then twisted, inflated and endlessly rearranged. Much of the trickery is institutionalized. The I.S.I. -- the shorthand name for the military intelligence agencies -- is widely presumed to be an expert puppet master, the great Oz of a manipulated society.\nRumors were the reason I wanted a word with the maulana. I'd heard that he had cut a deal with the military a year ago to spring himself from jail.\nSince Pakistan's most recent military coup, in October 1999, the country has been run by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, an often brash former commando. From the first, he professed a devotion to democracy and a loathing for the nation's ample supply of knavish politicians. His deepest belief, however, seems to be in his own indispensability, and he has connived to hold on to power even after allowing national elections. His patriotic campaigns against corruption and extremism have most often given way to the more pressing priorities of mundane self-interest.\nThe case of Azam Tariq is but a single example. Two years ago, soon after 9/11, the general ordered the jailing of the maulana and several other incendiary mullahs. Months later, in one of his many rousing denunciations of radical Islam, Musharraf officially outlawed Azam Tariq's organization, Sipah-e-Sahaba (Warriors of the Prophet's Companions), saying Pakistanis were ''fed up'' with ''fratricidal killings.''\nBut these pronouncements, however sincere, meant little in practice. Much like other banned groups, Sipah-e-Sahaba merely had to change its name to go on operating. In fact, when elections were finally held, Azam Tariq was able to win a seat in Parliament from his prison cell. Three weeks later, a court released him. Curiously enough, he then allied himself with the pro-Musharraf coalition in the Assembly, becoming one of many unlikely bedfellows in the governing majority, among them several legislators newly liberated from the distractions of lingering criminal cases.\n''No, no, absolutely no deal was made,'' the maulana assured me, insisting that the timing of his release was purely a coincidence. Speaking in Punjabi, he swiftly changed the subject, preferring more familiar topics, like the many fruitless efforts by Shiite extremists to kill him. ''I've had 11 attempts on my life, with knives, guns, bombs, even rocket launchers,'' he boasted, as if these brushes with death verified his importance in life.\nAs goodbyes were said, he embraced me in the traditional way, pulling me toward him so that our right shoulders touched. Then he apologized for not having provided a full meal. In amends, he ordered his brother to escort us to a restaurant called Kim's. ''Best Chinese food in Jhang'' was the last thing I heard the maulana say.\nThe Smoldering Fire\nTo be honest, Pakistan frightens me. Not the being there, despite recent attacks on foreigners, despite what happened to Daniel Pearl. I have visited Pakistan a few dozen times since 1998, most recently for five weeks this fall. Almost always I've found the people warm and generous and protective. Rather, what greatly alarms me is Pakistan as a potential meltdown, a nuclear power with too many combustibles in the national mix.\nI am hardly alone in my fears -- and yet this nation rarely finds itself under the American magnifying glass. ''Pakistan is an incredibly important country, but I don't think there's an awareness of that in the United States,'' Richard Haass told me. He had recently left the Bush administration as director of policy planning in the State Department and assumed the presidency of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''If you'd ask most people what are the biggest issues in the world, they'd say the Middle East, Iraq, North Korea, perhaps Afghanistan, a long list. But not a lot of people would say Pakistan.'' He, too, has pondered the dangerous skein of possibilities. ''Sure to be a nightmare is a breakdown in order. They haven't institutionalized succession in any meaningful way. At worst, you could have a loss of control over their nuclear weapons.''\nPakistan has a population (150 million) larger than all but five nations and more nuclear warheads (perhaps 50) than all but six or seven. Since its establishment, it has been in want of a coherent national identity: some there sarcastically call it less a nation than a crowd. Born in 1947, it was awkwardly excised from the British Empire in two separate pieces, an east and a west that happened to be 800 miles apart, with the largely Hindu behemoth of India situated in between. This new nation was meant to be the Muslim homeland of the subcontinent, but the formal role of Islam was left ambiguous and has ever remained an issue. Religion alone proved insufficient glue. In 1971, Pakistan's eastern half went its own way after Bengali Muslims -- with India's assistance -- broke loose and created Bangladesh. Four contiguous provinces remain: Baluchistan, Punjab, the Northwest Frontier and Sindh. Significant numbers of the present citizenry feel their greater bond is to ethnicity -- be it Pashtun or Baluchi or Sindhi -- and would rather not be part of Pakistan at all. Also under Islamabad's control is Azad (''Free'') Kashmir, one-third of a lovely Himalayan territory claimed by both the Indians and Pakistanis. The dispute is the main reason these neighbors continue to kill one another.\nThough the British are long gone, the Pakistanis themselves remain colonized by privation. About two-thirds of the population survives on less than $2 a day. Nearly two of every five children are undernourished. Only 44 percent of all adults can read (only 29 percent of the women). The mosques, rather than the government, provide what frayed social safety net there is. Perhaps that is because Pakistan is habitually broke. Barely 1 percent of the population pays income tax. More than half of the central budget goes toward the military and repayment of the national debt.\nPolitically, Pakistan has been reliably unsteady, with democracy only a sporadic presence. The military has controlled the country for about half its 56 years. No elected government has ever completed a full term, and even when one is in place, it stays there only at the pleasure of the generals. The army -- some 500,000 strong -- is commonly thought to be Pakistan's elite institution. The military doesn't just dominate civilian affairs; its various ''welfare trusts'' are among the nation's largest industrial conglomerates. The Fauji Foundation, linked to the army, has substantial ventures in gas fields, sugar mills, a fertilizer plant, an oil terminal and an overseas employment service. Its corn flakes and other breakfast cereals control 80 percent of the market. Profits supply ex-servicemen and their families the quality schools and health care that most Pakistanis so badly lack.\nThe great murkiness of Pakistan is largely the fault of this formidable army and the skulking I.S.I., which have pursued furtive alliances with many of the nation's most violent Islamic extremists. For more than a decade, the military has trained and financed civilian jihadis who cross into the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir to create havoc. This guerrilla combat was once an entirely indigenous Kashmiri rebellion against New Delhi, but the Pakistanis quickly hijacked it. Radical groups supplied much of the manpower, often enlisting students eager to enter paradise through the golden door of a martyr's death. The relentless havoc has time and again nudged the two new nuclear powers close to war. The alliance between the army and I.S.I. on one hand and extremists on the other has also led to a contorted set of cross-dependencies. Loyalties are now confused, and many Pakistanis wonder whether fundamentalist elements in the army's officer corps are more sympathetic to the jihadis than to their own superiors.\nMusharraf's own dedication to the Kashmir cause is indisputable. In early 1999, just months into his tenure as army chief, he ordered the paramilitary forces of the Northern Light Infantry across the agreed cease-fire line. When the troops were finally discovered, the Pakistanis claimed they were mujahedeen acting on their own, a feeble story belied when the bodies of dead soldiers began to be returned to their families. The Indians responded to the encroachment with air power, giant howitzers and thousands of troops. This semi-war ended only after Nawaz Sharif, then Pakistan's prime minister, made a desperate July 4 trip to Washington seeking diplomatic intervention by President Clinton. In a retelling of the episode, Bruce Riedel, a special assistant at the White House, wrote that there had been ''disturbing evidence that the Pakistanis were preparing their nuclear arsenals for possible deployment.''\nMusharraf has since assured the world that Pakistan is a responsible custodian of its nuclear arsenal. Still, pressures for one-upmanship with India are immense. According to American officials, Pakistan began swapping vital nuclear secrets with North Korea in exchange for ballistic missiles in the late 1990's. The dealings apparently continued after Musharraf's coup, but by the time they were disclosed last year, Islamabad was already a front-line warrior against Al Qaeda. The Bush administration responded tepidly, imposing sanctions on a single Pakistani nuclear laboratory.\nIn the past 25 years, American policy toward Pakistan has largely been devised to fit the events happening next door, in Afghanistan. Immediately after Sept. 11, Washington reinvigorated a waning friendship with Islamabad, employing President Bush's with-us-or-against-us ultimatum. The Pakistanis were ordered to forsake their Taliban associates, avail air bases to American troops and join in the hunt for terrorists. In many ways, Musharraf was pleased to comply. He had been treated warily in the West. Intimacy with America would come with generous military aid, forgiven debt and a new role for him, that of a reputable statesman.\nThere was precedent for Musharraf's abrupt rehabilitation. An earlier Pakistani ruler, Gen. Zia ul-Haq, hanged his civilian predecessor, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and imposed a punitive version of Islam especially harsh on women. And yet however much Zia had fallen into bad odor, the air was freshened by his strategic usefulness after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Throughout the 80's, jihad was a word to be embraced, not abhorred, in Washington. The United States employed Pakistan as the conduit for billions of dollars in arms to the Afghan resistance. The I.S.I., tutored in artifice by the C.I.A. itself, thrived in the role of middleman benefactor to the many mujahedeen groups.\nSurely, the defeat of the Soviet Union was beneficial for the United States, but American policy lacked a fuller vision for the region. By 1989, when the Soviets finally fled their misadventure, Pakistan was awash with weapons, the inevitable leakage from the gushing pipeline. It was also an increasingly cordial locale for the heroes of radical Islam, the thousands of Pakistanis who fought in the jihad as well as the many ''Afghan Arabs'' from around the world who, like Osama bin Laden, had come to battle the infidels.\nWith the Soviets vanquished, they would begin to look for new enemies.\nMaking Democracy Safe for Musharraf\nOne evening in Islamabad, I decided to visit a session of the National Assembly, where the same scene had been repeating itself for months. Once the session was called to order, members of the opposition rose from their soft leather chairs and began pounding notebooks and tubes of paper on the curved tables before them. A ritual chant accompanied this arrhythmic drumbeat: ''Go, Musharraf, go! No, L.F.O., no!'' After about five minutes of this noise, the defiant legislators walked out, leaving pro-Musharraf lawmakers behind in a half-empty chamber.\nThe main grievance was the Legal Framework Order -- the L.F.O. -- Musharraf's unilateral redrawing of the Constitution. He has bestowed upon himself the power to appoint Supreme Court justices and military chiefs, dissolve the Parliament and fire the prime minister. In other words, officials -- whether elected or otherwise -- were free to perform their duties so long as the general did not disapprove of how they did it.\nAfter the 1999 coup, Musharraf promised his countrymen a ''true democracy,'' a way of governance he found hard to define though he openly supposed it would require his continuing guidance. Much the same had been pledged by the three previous military rulers, but the public was again keen for a fresh start, and the coup was widely cheered. Pakistanis had soured on Nawaz Sharif, an opulently wealthy industrialist whose greatest passions were food, cricket, fast cars and then more food.\nMusharraf, on the other hand, presented himself as a man who would countenance no corruption. People from some of Pakistan's leading families were arrested on fraud charges without regard to their political connections. The general demanded that bank loans be repaid, a bothersome innovation for many of the rich.\nI spent time with Musharraf during these early days. He is a forceful man who expresses himself with such common sense and seeming candor that it is hard to imagine a word being untrue. He favors declarations like ''It's high time we face facts!'' And yet for most Pakistanis, the general has been a disappointment. Anticorruption campaigns gave way, once again, to political vendettas. Farouk Adam Khan had been chief prosecutor during the initial period of crusading. One Sunday night, I found him in his law office, sitting under the dim light of a single desk lamp. ''Pervez Musharraf had a great opportunity,'' he said, ''but he lost it in the pursuit of power.''\nThe general learned the ins and outs of politics, best defined as how to keep the outs from getting in. In May 2000, the Supreme Court validated his coup. This occurred after the 13 justices were ordered to sign a loyalty oath to the new regime -- and the 6 who refused had been replaced. The court then recovered some of its dignity by setting an October 2002 deadline for parliamentary elections. At the time, Musharraf was referring to himself as Pakistan's ''chief executive,'' though the title of president later became his preference. He won a five-year term at the job in a national referendum with only his name on the ballot and a simple choice of ''yes'' or ''no.'' The reported tally showed 98 percent in the affirmative, a vote considered implausible by most observers -- even if no campaigning against Musharraf had been allowed. Within months, the new president, swept along by his landslide, issued the Legal Framework Order.\nThe parliamentary elections posed some difficulties for Musharraf, but not insurmountable ones. To have a malleable National Assembly, he would need support from a political party. Pakistan had plenty of those, but the two main ones relied on the cult of personality -- and their esteemed personages had long been on the lam. In an odd secret deal, Nawaz Sharif, head of the Pakistan Muslim League, traded prison in his homeland for exile in Saudi Arabia. Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of the hanged Zulfikar, had herself twice been prime minister, inheriting the Pakistan People's Party. Educated at both Harvard and Oxford -- and charged with corruption by both Pakistan and Switzerland -- she now lived in both London and Dubai.\nNeither Benazir Bhutto nor Sharif could have run again anyway. Musharraf had installed new rules for public office. Some were laudable, like reserving a quota of seats in Parliament for women. Others were quirky, moralistic or simply cunning. A college degree was required, disqualifying all but perhaps 4 percent of the population. Accused bank defaulters also could not run, nor could their relatives or business associates.\nYet however unusual these rules, it was their selective application that was most disturbing. In a detailed criticism of the election, observers from the European Union said the inconsistency was the ''result of a government strategy, in certain cases through the enforcement of person-specific provisions.'' Politicians allying themselves with Musharraf were often given ways around legal obstacles, the report noted. A few of the more ambitiously recruited were then rewarded with posts in the cabinet.\nAs might be expected, many Pakistanis believe the I.S.I. was shoulder-deep in election mischief. Intelligence agents may well have intimidated more than a few. Stories of such threats are common if difficult to confirm. ''They handcuffed me, put a black hood over my head, threw me in a car and put a blanket over me,'' Ahsan Iqbal told me. He was once responsible for economic planning under Nawaz Sharif and had refused to switch sides. ''They took me to one of their safe houses.'' There, he said, he was entombed in darkness for 16 to 18 hours until the abductors pushed him back into the car and abandoned him in a remote area. ''They were letting me know that if I misbehaved, something worse could happen.''\nWith Benazir Bhutto absent, I instead visited her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, who once bore the unfortunate nickname Mr. 10 Percent, a reference to the money he supposedly took off the top while his wife ran the country. For the past eight years he has been in prison, and the only way to see him was during one of the hearings in his continuing legal saga. ''Come here, right next to me,'' Zardari said affably. He was sitting in the side yard of a courthouse in Rawalpindi, relaxing under a tree. He pinched my arm and nodded to his left. ''The I.S.I. is posted there. Better put away your tape recorder.'' I had been expecting the dashing man I had seen in photos, a playboy polo player known as much for his dalliances as for his marriage. Instead he appeared pasty and bloated, a fidgety guy in a wheelchair with back problems and diabetes. His eyeglasses hung on a band around his neck; his cane rested against a tree stump. During his first years of captivity, he was tortured, he said. He stuck out his tongue to show me a groove excavated from the center.\nOur conversation rambled, and he was emphatic in denying any wrongdoing. He himself brought up the matter of a $180,000 diamond necklace his wife is said to have bought with dirty money. ''She doesn't need more jewelry,'' he said, as many a husband would. And her family was wealthy. ''Benazir has more jewelry than she can count.'' To him, their legal troubles were part of some conspiracy. ''The world is not Camelot,'' he said, as if summarizing some philosophy's central truth.\nAn old air-conditioner was rattling in the background. When it unexpectedly stopped, Zardari sent a man into the courthouse to restart this camouflage of noise, again nodding warily toward the I.S.I. agents. ''Musharraf is basically a wolf in sheep's clothing; he's playing footsy with the world,'' he said ruefully. But he seemed to envy the president more than dislike him. Musharraf had dumb luck on his side. ''If it wasn't for 9/11, we would have won the election hands down. He couldn't have kept Benazir from coming back. He couldn't have changed all those laws.''\nHe couldn't have kept Asif Zardari locked away.\nThe Mullahs Are Coming!\nEven without Benazir, her party got slightly more total votes than the one loyal to Musharraf, but his side won the most individual seats in Parliament.\nThe biggest surprise, however, was the success of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (M.M.A.), or United Action Forum, an odd coalition of six religious parties never before known for mutual harmony or strength at the polls. It won the third-largest block of seats. More stunningly, it did well enough in provincial races to control the assembly in the Northwest Frontier and become a major partner in a ruling coalition in Baluchistan. Government by ''the mullahs'' has long been a dreaded prospect by the vast majority of Pakistanis with less doctrinaire views, and the M.M.A.'s unexpected victories intensified fears that ''Talibanization'' was creeping its way across the land.\nSeven months later, extremists -- shouting the all-purpose invocation ''God is great!'' -- inflamed those anxieties by marauding through the city of Peshawar. As police placidly looked on, the crowd confiscated CD's and tapes from stores and burned music and movies in a bonfire. They blackened the faces of women on billboards. In the meantime, politicians in the new government spoke of plans to not only enforce their version of Shariah law but also compel its obedience with patrols of religious constables.\nConspiracy theorists and others reacted to the M.M.A.'s election success with a frenzy of suspicion. They began to call the coalition the Military-Mullah Alliance, speculating that the wily Musharraf had backed the religious parties to scare the gullible Americans into meting out more aid. (''The mullahs are coming! The mullahs are coming!'') To them, it seemed the M.M.A. had received an unfair leg up. Degrees from madrasas (religious schools) had been accepted to fulfill the educational requirement for candidates. On the ballots themselves, where each party was denoted by an emblem, the M.M.A. was granted the symbol of a book. In a mostly illiterate country, some people were then easily persuaded that their choice was to vote for or against the Holy Koran.\nBefore leaving Islamabad for Peshawar -- one center of religious extremism -- I discussed this hypothesis with a crafty political operator named Mushahid Hussain. He had been minister of information under Nawaz Sharif and endured 440 days of house arrest after the coup. But Hussain has a very agile mind, capable of elaborate spin moves. Once freed, he joined Musharraf's party and was now serving in Parliament's upper house. By his reckoning, the M.M.A.'s strong showing owed more to the other parties' disarray and the mullahs' savvy use of anti-Americanism. ''India-bashing has been replaced by America-bashing,'' he said. We chatted for about an hour, but what I recall most was a friendly warning as I left his house. ''Let me know if you want to talk anything over, but not on the phone,'' the former information minister told me. ''Remember, all the phones are bugged.''\nPeshawar, capital of the Northwest Frontier, is just east of the winding canyons of the Khyber Pass and Afghanistan. The province is largely Pashtun. By custom, women are kept hidden away. When outdoors, they are usually secreted beneath the billowy cloth of a burka. Among most Pashtuns, sympathy remains high for the Taliban, if not as models of Islamic behavior, then at least as ethnic brethren. Religious bullying was nothing unusual in the city, and it was easy to find new instances. Musicians were no longer able to find work. ''Now, even at weddings, some mullahs come up and say this is not allowed, this is against Islam,'' Sher Muhammad, an old man who plays the harmonium and drums, said with despair. ''If I play my music to feed my family, does that mean I am not a Muslim?''\nSuch complaints aside, what seemed most remarkable to me was how little of any religious agenda the M.M.A. had put in effect. Inexperienced at government, the coalition partners were a disparate bunch. A few powerful mullahs wanted to flip the calendar back 1,400 years to the days of the Holy Prophet, but others were content enough with the present. Mufti Ghulam-ur-Rehman, the white-bearded man in charge of the Council for the Enforcement of Shariah, entertained visitors while sitting cross-legged on the floor, but there was a fax machine on the cabinet behind him. ''It is a modern world,'' he said cheerily. ''TV has become a necessity of life.''\nMalik Zafar Azam, the M.M.A.'s minister of law, is a green-card holder who owns an Italian restaurant in Arlington, Va. ''I'm a good chef of spaghetti and pizza,'' he claimed. He still goes back and forth to America, though not so often since the bank foreclosed on his Virginia townhouse. He recalled appearing on a Pakistani TV show: ''They said to me, 'Oh, my God, you are the law minister; you're making all men wear beards and do all these things.' I said what the hell are you talking. I have no beard, and I wear short pants.''\nThere are Talibanizers at work, no doubt -- and more all the time. But the Taliban in Afghanistan was originally welcomed more as sheriffs than mullahs, their stern theocracy considered an antidote to plundering warlords and social chaos. Pakistan does not have the predicate of such pervasive lawlessness. Indeed, the M.M.A. may well have its hands full simply staying in power. As always, I heard rumor upon rumor, hard to fully believe, hard to fully discount. In one story, the I.S.I. was buying the nine votes needed to topple the religious coalition in the provincial assembly. This would provide a heavy hammer over the M.M.A., which has been stubbornly opposing Musharraf on the Legal Framework Order. The cost per politician was said to go as high as 10 million rupees, about $160,000.\nTalibanizers have other resistance to overcome. Fundamentalism provides a powerful pull, offering purpose to the otherwise ignored. But it is not the only magnetic force. Even in largely Pashtun Peshawar, the masses are being tugged in multiple directions, including toward modernity and the West. Internet cafes, which the Taliban would never have tolerated, are opening one after the other. Training in English is a chief selling point of private academies. Music and movies are sold openly. Pinups of Indian actresses are marketed side by side with those glorifying Osama bin Laden. More than 200 cable-TV operators are collecting a $4 monthly fee from tens of thousands of subscribers; even more people are stealing the service.\nOther cleavages divide Pakistan. Water itself sunders the provinces as each one vies for the precious flow of the Indus. Human rights activists struggle against death sentences in blasphemy cases and laws that sometimes make a woman the guilty party in her own rape. In the chaotic megalopolis of Karachi, thousands of terrorist murders have taken place during the past decade, the mayhem caused by two warring political factions. While this feud is presently at an ebb, sectarian killings keep the quotient of disquietude high with a particularly senseless touch, the targeting of doctors. An estimated 70 are dead. ''I was tipped off that I was No. 2 on a five-person list set for execution,'' Dr. Shafqat Hussain Abbassi told me. He is a Sunni, but the Hussain part of his name had caused him to be mistaken for a Shiite. For days, he desperately tried to get word to the proper terrorists. Finally, he reached a maulana with jurisdiction. ''He apologized that they were mistaken.''\nInternal nationalisms have troubled the country from its first days. Nawab Khair Bakhsh Marri is head of the Marris, one of the largest of the Baluchi tribes. His loyalty is to a greater Baluchi nation, not some British mapmaker's creation called Pakistan. Befitting his status as a nawab, or ruler, he lives in Quetta in a large compound with armed guards stationed at the gate. His hair is white, his beard neatly clipped. He gave his age as ''well over 70,'' and he spoke the fine English of a well-educated man. His feelings about Islam were hardly reverent. ''In our part of the world, a mullah is someone who washed the dead, not a job you'd much admire,'' he said with wry contempt. Neither has he much use for America, the ''leading shareholder'' in world imperialism, and wondered how a nation great enough to produce Noam Chomsky could also deliver George W. Bush.\nHis worst scorn, however, was reserved for Punjabis, the largest ethnic group in Pakistan and the dominant one in the army. He recalled fighting them over the years. In 1974, some 80,000 troops were deployed against a Baluchi insurgency. Even today, government forces are ambushed in the mountainous Marri lands east of Quetta. ''Why must Punjab be in my destiny?'' he asked. Destitute tribesmen would benefit from a road the government wants to build. But the purpose of development is merely to exploit his people's mineral resources, the nawab said disdainfully. ''So we fight on with the pen, the mouth and the gun.'' He paused to scoff at the sad irony of the storied Baluchis being part of an artificial nation. ''Religion is only one aspect of life. It's not enough for a country.''\n''You People Are Offensive''\nQuetta, the capital of Baluchistan, is just 50 miles from the Afghanistan border. This city may once have been Baluchi, but now it is also very much Pashtun. One poor neighborhood of high walls and narrow lanes is even called Pashtunabad. Most of its residents are Afghan refugees, including many easily identifiable as Taliban by their turbans. Some are merely students. But others are soldiers, going back and forth to their homeland to fight against American troops and the Karzai government. Their favored means of transportation is the motorcycle. One rumor is that the bikes are furnished by the I.S.I. If true, this raises one of the more popular sets of questions. Has Musharraf approved it? Or do rogues in the intelligence services have their own foreign policy?\nWhile wandering through Pashtunabad, I asked to enter a small, dark room where young Taliban men lived. They were suspicious of an American, but with customary Pashtun hospitality, a cushioned seat was offered and tea was poured into clear glasses half full with sugar. ''We study in the madrasa,'' said Abdul Baqi, a 27-year-old who seemed the leader. I wanted to know if he was learning any subjects beyond Islamic teachings, and when he said yes, I asked him if he could name any planet besides earth or multiply five times seven. He could not, but he had a question of his own: ''When will America be satisfied? When it kills every Muslim in the world?''\nThis question might just as well have come from a Pakistani. As I have fears about an unhinged Pakistan, Pakistanis have fears about a wanton America. The parallel apprehensions have much the same vocabulary: a nuclear power, prone to irrational behavior, too eager to go to war, a penchant toward duplicity.\nSometimes, there is even the part about religious extremism. ''George Bush is a mullah; he is a fundamentalist, too,'' Abdul Hakim Baloch, a writer in Quetta, told me. ''I don't know how history will treat the Americans, but you are committing one of the greatest crimes of all time. Bush thinks he must destroy Babylon as the verses of his Scripture tell him. But you cannot conquer the world based on superstitions.''\nAs an American in Pakistan, I was on a lecture tour where I was the one being lectured. Some decisive juncture had been passed, and people were erupting with accusations. Whomever I saw, extremist or not, educated or not, they told me they had finally lost patience with America, which in their eyes had grown hateful toward Islam and hypocritical about democracy.\nAitzaz Ahsan, a prom-inent politician and lawyer, opposes Musharraf. ''Here again is another dictator the Americans are willing to sit in their laps as if they have run into a long-lost loved one,'' he said in exasperation. ''We are back to Square 1, except this time, while attempting to demolish the demonic mullahs that we created ourselves, we are actually fueling their responses on a much wider theater.'' That theater is Iraq -- and perhaps beyond. A common suspicion is that an unquenchable America is after territory, after oil, after blood.\nThe sympathy that poured forth after 9/11 is spent. For many, the winning of two wars has turned American sorrow into vulgar triumphalism. ''You people are offensive,'' I was told sternly by Salima Hashmi, one of Pakistan's leading artists. ''I don't care who your enemy is. You don't kill two of his sons and then show them off on TV.''\nThese were feelings I could understand. They were reasoned criticisms. I might disagree with some of the thinking, but it all fell within the arena of legitimate debate.\nMuch of what I heard, however, seemed to come from an inverted world, the axis spinning backward, all the essential story lines turned inside out. There is no polling data to cite, but it seems that most Pakistanis, including a great many of the college-educated, continue to believe that the World Trade Center was attacked as part of a Jewish conspiracy -- and perhaps one that involved high-level cooperation from the United States government.\n''Who gained from these happenings?'' I was asked by a 35-year-old man named Haroon. ''Not Islam, not America, only the Jewish people.'' He demanded an investigation: Why had no Jews come to work at the World Trade Center that day? Why had Jewish businessmen withdrawn all their money from banks ?\nThere were multiple variations to this conspiracy theory, including a few that had Osama bin Laden acting as an Israeli hireling. When I responded with incredulity, I was pitied as a na\u00eff. Qazi Hussain Ahmad, the well-traveled, highly educated leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's largest religious party, even patted my hand. ''This required a very sophisticated infrastructure,'' he said of the trade center attacks. Hadn't I read the analyses on the Internet, he wanted to know: the Arabs involved lacked ''the capabilities to do all the planning'' for such a complicated operation. He suspected Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. He thought they might have been assisted by the United States military.\nGen. Hamid Gul, the retired head of the I.S.I., tendered a similar theory. ''The longest it would take for a U.S. Air Force aircraft to be on the tail of a hijacked plane is seven minutes,'' he told me, blaming collusion between the White House and ''Zionist intellectuals'' for the attack. He easily connected the dots. The same Zionists had recruited Monica Lewinsky, he said. ''She keeps the dress for two years and doesn't talk about it?'' He threw his head back in laughter. ''The American people are so gullible!''\nThe Feudals and\nThe Ghost Schools\nMost every village has a mosque. It is easy to happen upon the austere music of Muslim prayers. Harder to find are the chalkboard scratchings of an everyday school.\nPakistan's education system is a mess even by the sorry standards of South Asia. According to the World Bank, more than a third of the nation's 10-year-olds have never attended class. According to the United States Agency for International Development, Pakistani boys average less than two years of attendance, girls less than one. ''Ghost schools'' are a strange aspect of the problem. There are perhaps 10,000 of them: solid buildings, missing only the bodies and souls of teachers and students. Villagers often use the vacant classrooms to store grain and the courtyards to pen livestock.\nParents want their kids in school. If there were teachers, there would be students. But Pakistan's education budget as a percentage of gross domestic product is puny, according to a Unesco estimate, smaller than most of the Muslim world, smaller even than most of sub-Saharan Africa. And of those teachers who are paid, many simply fail to show up, relying on an inept bureaucracy to ignore their truancy. In a place called Masterano Kallai, I witnessed the reanimation of a ghost school. Some of the village's few literate men had volunteered to teach. Rooms were swept free of fodder and dung. A small blackboard was hung from a nail to the cement wall. More than 100 children arrived in the afternoon, some of them barefoot, many coming after a morning of hard lifting at a nearby brick kiln.\nFamilies with enough money send their children to private schools while many of the poor take advantage of the free education offered by the madrasas, some of which provide a reasonably full curriculum, and some of which provide only rote memorization of the Koran, and some of which provide the combatants for jihad. General Musharraf has repeatedly promised to reform the madrasas, requiring them to teach from an approved syllabus. But to do so would be an expensive, meddlesome task, and despite some boasts to the contrary, the government has yet to make even an approximate count of the madrasas, let alone change their lesson plans.\nThe want of schools reflects the want of democracy. However many ruptures there are in Pakistani society, the greatest gulf is that between the rich and poor, and the poor are easy to ignore in a nation controlled by generals and landlords.\nKaiser Bengali, a noted economist, told me that 4 percent of Pakistan's rural households own 50 percent of the land. ''It is something like 16th-century feudalism,'' he said. In many farming areas, the biggest landowners are actually called ''the feudals,'' and some are powerful enough to make their own laws and operate their own jails. In the cities, a feudal is more likely to be a thug who runs a land mafia, falsely staking claim to property and forcing people to pay rent. Karachi, one of the world's 10 biggest cities, has sprawling squatter settlements that far outstrip every electrical line, every sewer pipe, every water tap. I spent a morning in Ibrahim Hydri, a fishing village outside the city. Boats were returning from three days at sea, and the crew was shoveling out the storage bins of fast-aging shrimp and pomfret. A grim fisherman named Saleh Muhammed said sale of the catch would barely cover fuel costs and dock fees. His family lived in a hut of scrap wood and thatch. A ''feudal'' was threatening to burn him out unless he could come up with 3,000 rupees (about $50).\nThese were despairing days for small fishermen. Prices had plunged after the sea itself became tainted. On July 27, an oil tanker ran aground just outside Karachi's harbor and, after bewildered authorities allowed the cracked vessel to languish for 18 days, a massive rupture opened, disgorging 30,000 tons of crude. The fish kill was immense.\nThis oil spill was nearly as big as the Exxon Valdez incident in 1989 off the coast of Alaska. But with no terrorism angle, the event was mostly ignored by the foreign news media. As the oil washed onto Karachi's best-known beach, it sullied the marvelous vista of an affluent neighborhood's high-rise apartments. Three months later, when I stood on the shore, the hapless ship was still marooned, its bow at an odd angle like a broken bone. A top layer of oily sand had been scooped from the beach itself, but some of the spill had seeped a full 20 inches down. Waves were dumping more dirty water on the dirty beach.\nPatches of foamy brown stained the sand where the sea rolled in. ''Is that oil?'' I asked Brian Dicks, a British expert, who was standing beside a backhoe.\n''Oh, no,'' he answered, ''That's raw sewage. Comes in streams from the big apartment buildings. Some people take care of their waste, some don't.''\nIn this case, the sea's use as a latrine was actually an advantage, he explained. Nitrogen and phosphates from the sewage were helping break down the oil.\nAmerica's Great Ally\nPakistan is tough on prognosticators. Each time I am there, people tell me the place is about to spin apart. And yet for all the gyrations, it remains in one piece. Some would argue that despite its mischief, the military is the tie that binds. But the generals are also to blame for so much of what has set the country reeling in the first place.\nCynicism is a contagion in Pakistan. Musharraf is not only criticized for selling out to the Americans; he is also excoriated for selling out too cheaply. After all, this may be a limited window. Historically, the United States is all too forgiving when it needs Pakistan and then smugly reproachful when it does not.\nNevertheless, for now Pakistan is on the payroll. In June, George W. Bush proposed a $3 billion aid package to be dispensed over the next five years, half for military use, half for economic aid. He and Musharraf presented the news together in Camp David. The two presidents appeared pals that day, looking relaxed as they walked shoulder to shoulder. Bush said America has ''had no better partner in our fight on terror than President Musharraf.'' Still, it is hard to imagine that these men altogether trust each other. Bush surely remembers that the general had befriended the Taliban until the day he was drafted into the war on terrorism. And Musharraf undoubtedly recalls that Pakistan's last military ruler, General Zia, met an untimely end in a plane crash. A good many Pakistanis again see a conspiring hand, supposing that the C.I.A. did away with an ally after his usefulness had run its course.\nShaping American policy toward Pakistan requires a prolonged balancing act on a particularly high wire. Nuclear misbehavior must be discouraged, but economic sanctions would only push a volatile country toward bankruptcy and disintegration. Human rights should be stressed, but perhaps not if it keeps Al Qaeda suspects from being immediately handed over. Big infusions of economic aid are vital for development, but how can the money be kept from religious radicals and the hopelessly corrupt? A full return to democracy ought to be demanded, but past civilian governments have been kleptocracies. Sadly, no oasis is visible ahead. There is no obvious Mandela figure, no Walesa, no Havel waiting in the wings. There can be no Velvet Revolution to inspire the Pakistani masses. Between the Koran and the Kalashnikovs, too many people covet too many incompatible things.\nBut if elected governments have been disappointing, military ones have been disastrous. And the eventual bridge to cross is more than Musharraf. It is the army itself -- and its dominance, whether onstage or behind the scenes. Some way or another, Musharraf's time will pass. The great fear in the West has been that the next general will be much harder to deal with, someone with a long beard and no taste for whisky. But the greater likelihood is that after Musharraf simply comes another Musharraf, a slightly different model but still a man with the same loyalty to military pre-eminence.\nIdealists in the world believe there is no substitute for democracy. It may be hard work, but it must be tried, and if it fails, it must be tried again. The will of the people should not be forsaken for expedience, the body politic not sacrificed for Realpolitik.\nSuch sentiments have rarely been better expressed than in an eloquent address last month at the 20th anniversary of the National Endowment for Democracy. The main topic was democracy and Islam, and President Bush said, ''The daily work of democracy itself is the path to progress.'' For emphasis, he repeated the thought with new phrasing. ''It is the practice of democracy that makes a nation ready for democracy.''\nBush singled out two recalcitrant Muslim allies: Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\nPakistan went unmentioned."}, {"text": "The Taint of the Greased Palm\n2003-08-10T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen Vicente Fox was sworn in as president of Mexico on Dec. 1, 2000, he carried with him a huge burden: the public's expectation that he would liberate from corruption a country that had become symbolic of the scourge. Fox was the first Mexican president from an opposition party after 71 years of autocratic control by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I., which maintained its grip on Mexico principally through corruption.\nMexico's hopes for Fox were extraordinary, but new presidents nearly everywhere assume their nations' leadership with the expectation that they will clean up graft of some kind -- usually because they have promised it. Perhaps candidates in Finland, the world's least corrupt nation, don't tend to run on an anticorruption platform, but they do in most other nations, and not just poor or authoritarian ones. Inaugural speeches in capitals across the globe are filled with condemnations of past misbehavior and vows that tolerance for theft and bribery has ended; in his inaugural address, Fox said that combating corruption, ''until now a goal of secondary importance, will from today on be a national priority.''\nYet just as sure as a new leader's pledge to clean up the corruption of his predecessor is the certainty that his successor will, in a few years, be doing the same. Presidents who come to office promising to fight graft almost always fail -- occasionally leaving office several million dollars richer themselves. Arrests are made -- but often only of political rivals. Anticorruption campaigns come and go -- and still it requires a 30 percent payoff to build a highway, buildings fall down because inspectors are bribed and drivers prepare for an assault on their wallets when they see a cop.\nThere is, however, a curious assortment of places where, in recent years, things have changed. Australia, now one of the world's cleanest nations, was a longtime Wild West of lawlessness. Singapore is now a model of probity, but in the 1950's it was awash in corruption. Bolivia is one of the world's most corrupt nations, but for a time a reformist mayor gave residents of its biggest city, La Paz, a reprieve. Ferdinand Marcos, of all people, cleaned up the Philippines' tax bureau. Even in many nations where fraud is rampant, some agency or region stands out for integrity.\nUntil a few decades ago, corruption-fighting programs consisted mainly of lamenting the human character. Academic studies of corruption were hindered by the reluctance of scholars to seem patronizing to third-world countries. When scholars did look at corruption, their major focus, absurdly, was the question of whether it was harmful.\nToday, the costs of corruption are widely discussed, and they are stunning. Francisco Barrio, until April Mexico's anticorruption czar, estimates that graft costs his country 9.5 percent of its G.D.P. -- twice the education budget -- and Mexico ranks only in the middle of the corruption charts. Corruption also distorts spending. There is evidence that when levels of graft are high, governments spend less on education and health and more on public works -- projects chosen not for their value to the nation but for their kickback potential. Corruption greatly discourages foreign investment. And with globalization, its effects have become borderless: when the Bank of Credit and Commerce International went down in 1991, 40,000 depositors in Bangladesh lost their life savings.\nAs the world turns its attention from whether to fight corruption toward how, some surprising lessons are emerging:\n* The most corrupt nations are indeed poor ones, but grand corruption can be found everywhere: illicit deals between top officials and big business have brought down governments in Japan and Europe. Money distorts America's political system as well -- that it is largely legal does not make it less corrupt.\n* Big governments tend to be less corrupt. It might seem intuitive that a large role for government in the economy would provide a large opportunity for mischief, but in fact weak states often lack the mechanisms to fight graft.\n* Democracy helps -- a free press, strong opposition political parties, an independent judiciary and a healthy civil society all limit corruption. But getting there is perilous. The transition to democracy tends to be a very corrupt period, during which shaky institutions, rapid privatizations and unclear rules contribute to the problem. Countries recently emerging from dictatorship tend to be more corrupt than the dictatorships they displaced.\n* Regional variations are unpredictable. Northern European countries tend to be less corrupt than Southern European countries. But a clean colonizer doesn't mean a clean colony. Although Britain is now one of the least corrupt European countries, Bangladesh and Nigeria, former British colonies, score high on a global list of the most corrupt countries.\n* A key factor is how a country makes its money. Oil hurts. Countries that make their money from oil have usually neglected to develop a middle class and solid political institutions. High levels of non-oil international trade help, perhaps because trade has historically given powerful private citizens an interest in effective government and leaders incentive to raise standards to international levels. Singapore, Hong Kong, Chile and Botswana, all trading nations, are significantly less corrupt than their neighbors and cleaner than many wealthier countries.\nIn the last couple of decades, anticorruption campaigns have met with sporadic success in isolated countries. But now, for the first time, the struggle against corruption has gone global. A nongovernmental group founded in 1993, Transparency International, today has chapters in 90 countries. It is best known for its annual ranking of the perception of corruption -- that is, the general sense among people doing business in a given country that officials are demanding bribes. But Transparency, based in Berlin, also mobilizes people to fight corruption and disseminates information on how best to do so.\nInternational organizations are taking new steps against money laundering and bank secrecy. And since 1996, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have also been tackling the corruption issue. Before then, World Bank higher-ups ignored corruption, labeling it a political problem and claiming that it was thus outside the bank's economic mandate. But the real reason the bank didn't address corruption was that the bank represents the governments of the world, and governments are not happy when their dishonesty is exposed. So, awkwardly, it wasn't. (World Bank officials were literally not allowed to use the word ''corruption'' in their documents. They had to write ''C. . . . '')\nJames Wolfensohn, who took over as president of the World Bank in 1995, decided that corruption could no longer be overlooked. He commissioned a study showing that it was a significant drag on development -- and therefore an economic issue -- and declared that henceforth the bank could finance anticorruption projects and could withhold loans owing to lack of progress.\nUnder Fox, Mexico (where I have been living for more than a year) has become an ideal laboratory in which to observe and understand this new global focus on corruption. Mexico shows how easy it is to fight corruption once a government really wants to -- and how hard it is to reach that point, despite what presidents say in their inaugural addresses.\nIn July 1989, Francisco Gil D\u00edaz, an assistant secretary of the Mexican treasury, took control of the country's customs system. President Carlos Salinas was opening Mexico's economy. The country had just joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- the precursor to the World Trade Organization -- and the North American Free Trade Agreement was in the works. Mexico was preparing to handle a greatly increased flow of foreign trade. And its customs areas looked like garbage dumps.\nGil D\u00edaz didn't want the job. When he was offered the position of assistant secretary, he told his boss, Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe, that he would take the post on the condition that he would have nothing to do with customs. It was obvious that customs was unreformable. The conventional wisdom at the time -- among the general public even today -- was that cleaning up corruption would require prosecutions. This was not an option for Gil D\u00edaz, as the complex investigations necessary would eat up all his resources. Another thing Gil D\u00edaz could not do was fire customs inspectors, because they were protected by a union. Customs services have historically fed the pockets of high government officials, and President Salinas ran an administration of extraordinary sleaze and cynicism. The interests Gil D\u00edaz would need to take on were going to be powerful ones indeed.\nMost daunting, of all Mexico's corrupt institutions, perhaps none were as much of a medieval bedlam as customs. When Pompilio C\u00e1rdenas, who was hired to run customs at Mexico City's international airport, walked into the warehouse on his first day, his instinct was to go home. The airport was the entry point for the most costly merchandise coming into Mexico, and it set the country's image for international business. Yet the warehouse was filled with a jumble of abandoned merchandise -- even luxury cars -- that had been looted. Boxes of radioactive substances clearly marked ''refrigerate'' sat in the sun. There was no security; there were no lights. Even the fence around the airport runway had been toppled.\n''The disorder was deliberate,'' C\u00e1rdenas tells me as he shows me photos of the old warehouse. ''There was effectively no registry of what came in. If you don't know what comes in on 100 flights a day from all over the world, you can imagine the magnitude of the corruption.'' There was outright theft -- especially at night, when anyone could come in and cart away valuables. People could even go into the planes. A mafia ran the customs house, with the eager participation of airline personnel, government officials, customs agents, truck drivers and police officers.\nAnother problem was the thicket of requirements necessary for getting goods through customs. There were 16 steps, hence 16 opportunities for officials to solicit bribes. And, of course, there was collusion, which was why influential importers put up with the system. Companies could pay off workers to protect their merchandise and bring it out duty-free.\nGil D\u00edaz got Mexico's congress to convert customs to the system now in use in most of the world. Major shipments now had to be handled by licensed customs brokers, who would inventory the merchandise and calculate the correct duty. After the duty was paid, the merchandise would pass through a random customs ''stoplight.'' Ten percent of the merchandise got a red light and was inspected, and there were steep penalties for lying, including the possibility of prison. The 16 steps became 3. A process that had taken as long as a month was cut down to 10 minutes. From one month to the next, officially collected duties jumped by 30 percent.\nIn addition to raising revenue and greasing the movement of goods, that reform also curtailed corruption. The stoplight reduced the ability of inspectors to choose targets and took away a major source of bribes. ''Gil D\u00edaz wanted human discretion not to play a role,'' says Luis Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez Levy, who was the chief of customs.\nGil D\u00edaz made other changes. Anyone entering the warehouse had to wear identification. Managers had to leave their desks and walk around. He moved border customs posts to the actual border -- many had been miles away, making a trip through customs optional for importers. Most important, he appointed professionals, ending the parade of politicians' relatives and golf partners who had been given the lucrative gift of a customs post.\nEvery week, Gil D\u00edaz flew to a different post for a surprise inspection, not even telling the pilot where he was going until the plane was in the air. Once he even arrived at a customs post by garbage truck, when a taxi-less airport forced him to hitch a ride.\n''People say Mexicans need more education and a new culture, and I agree,'' C\u00e1rdenas says. ''But we don't need to wait three generations for change. You need a system that makes illegal acts difficult.'' Gil D\u00edaz changed the behavior of customs workers by removing opportunities for theft and bribery and increasing the probability of their being caught. In short, he made illegal acts difficult.\nIn his book ''Controlling Corruption,'' Robert Klitgaard, now dean of the RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica, Calif., shows how in some of the most unlikely places corruption has been fought using such simple administrative reforms. His most spectacular example is the cleanup of the Philippine Bureau of Internal Revenue under that renowned graft-buster Ferdinand Marcos. It is amusing to recall that Marcos declared martial law in 1972 in part to combat corruption. Three years later, he installed Efren Plana, a respected judge, as the commissioner of internal revenue. Plana fired about a hundred of the most corrupt officials. He set higher professional standards and banned the hiring of officials' relatives. Previously, tax assessors won promotion by bribing their superiors. Plana developed incentives that gave promotions and cash prizes to the most effective and fairest assessors. He brought in outside auditors and instituted frequent audits and spot checks. He recommended changes to simplify the tax laws, so that an individual agent's discretion was reduced. In short, he used strategies any first-year business student could have designed.\nGil D\u00edaz's reforms were similarly straightforward. ''It's not that I'm an administrative genius,'' he says. ''These changes were simply logical.'' If it was so easy to do it right, I ask him, why had customs been in such a state?\nLook at the interests behind it, he replies.\nAnd why had the government allowed things to get so bad? ''No one cared,'' he says.\nAll those inaugural speeches declaring all-out war on graft? Lies. It's actually easy to clean up corruption, absurdly easy, when you want to. What is difficult is really wanting to. Gil D\u00edaz was able to break the customs mafia because he had one crucial weapon: Nafta. The Mexican government and powerful businessmen needed to clean up customs in order to get a trade deal they were panting for. Absent Nafta, President Salinas wouldn't have given customs a second look.\nOnce corruption has become the norm, the system spits out those who try to fight it. Luis Moreno Ocampo, formerly the head of Transparency International in Argentina and now the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, offers an example from his country. Shortly after his election in 1999, President Fernando de la R\u00faa, keeping a campaign promise, reduced the slush fund used to pay off legislators. But when Congress would not pass his labor-law reforms, 11 senators were said to have received bribes from members of his cabinet. When de la R\u00faa went on to retain the two cabinet members accused of bribery in a cabinet reshuffle, the vice president, Carlos Alvarez, protested. The vice president ended up resigning. Those accused of bribery outlasted him. And the labor reforms passed.\n''You can announce a fight against corruption, but you have to govern, too,'' Moreno Ocampo says. ''And governing is easier if you don't question corruption.''\nWhy is it so hard to mobilize a nation against this scourge? The most important reason is history. Take Chile. It is far cleaner than its neighbors, yet it has few of the attributes of political life that normally guard against corruption. Its press and judiciary are perhaps the least politically independent in Latin America, its legislature one of the weakest. But Chile's rule-of-law culture prevails. This culture, paradoxically, is a result of Chile's poor prospects at the time of its conquest. Chile offered the Spanish no attractive minerals and no grand indigenous civilizations to conquer, so it developed as a relatively middle-class country whose citizens demanded an effective and uncorrupt government.\nElsewhere, history is a more malignant force. It condemns other parts of the world to continued corruption even as they acquire the institutions that are supposed to save them. One such place is Mexico City -- the classic example of a city where corruption moves everything. Mexico City is corrupt today because it was corrupt half a millennium ago. It has been a wealthy, autocratic, imperial capital since the Aztec empire of the early 1300's.\nTwo years ago, the Mexican chapter of Transparency International surveyed households in all 31 states and the Federal District of Mexico City, asking people how often they paid bribes for government services. Corruption was found to be spectacularly concentrated in Mexico City. People in the capital stopped by a transit cop reported paying a bribe 69 percent of the time.\nUntil elections were instituted in 1997, Mexico City's mayors were appointed by the P.R.I. All three mayors since then have come from the Democratic Revolutionary Party (P.R.D.), a leftist party that broke away from the P.R.I. The change at the top is significant -- while the last P.R.I. mayor, Oscar Espinoza, is awaiting trial on charges of stealing $42 million, one of the three P.R.D. mayors has only relatively minor blemishes, and the other two have impeccable personal reputations. The current mayor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, known throughout Mexico as AMLO, is considered a puritan and drives around town in a Nissan sedan.\nBut while larceny at the top trickles down, probity does not. In fact, it can hurt. Mexico City's leadership today seems to think it is doing enough just by not being the P.R.I. The P.R.D. has fallen victim to a common misconception: corruption is the other guys. Politicians everywhere seem to believe that things automatically change when they win, when in fact the corporate culture of corruption is usually so strong that it swallows any party's good intentions.\n''You want the parties to take on the administrative process,'' says Federico Reyes Heroles, the director of Transparency Mexico, ''not simply to say, 'When the saints come to power everything will be O.K.' I have no doubt that AMLO is honest, but the important thing is the system.''\nOf course, along with a corrupt political culture, Mexico City's leaders have inherited problems that make it difficult to change that culture. While the P.R.I. mafiosi at the very top have been swept out of city government in the last few years, the municipal workers' union protects lower-level workers from being fired. City officials could try to take on the union, which is historically tied to the P.R.I. But the P.R.D. wants control of the union's 100,000-plus members and its formidable election machine. It's just one example of the single biggest reason corruption persists worldwide: fighting it requires alienating the influential groups and people -- from labor unions to billionaire businessmen -- who keep politicians in office and help them get things done.\nAsk Mexico City officials how they are fighting corruption, and they point to the comptroller and the City Council's auditor. But these agencies are crippled by narrow mandates and tiny budgets. The comptroller is reduced to recruiting citizen volunteers to oversee bids for city contracts, and the office that monitors the price of public-works projects has only recently started using computers. Reports from the City Council's auditor regularly come out two years late.\nWhy don't the city's officials pay a price for slighting an issue of such overwhelming public concern? One reason is corruption's dirty little secret: like the inaugural promises, the people's cry that they are fed up with having to pay bribes is an exaggeration. For those being extorted, it's easy to end corruption -- absurdly easy. Just don't pay. But in fact the vast majority of citizens who complain about corruption are full participants in the process. I hate corruption enough to write an article about it, but during my first year in Mexico City, when my family lived in a house in the Condesa neighborhood, I bribed my garbage man every Friday, as did all my neighbors. With two kids in diapers, I didn't even want to contemplate the consequences of having our trash left on the stoop.\nDespite the complaints of citizens, the corruption accompanying an ordinary transaction in Mexico City usually begins with them. My garbage man, who demanded his weekly tip and let us know if we were a peso short, was an exception -- officials rarely solicit bribes. Instead, they work so slowly, sloppily and arbitrarily that people see no hope of getting the services they are entitled to without offering a tip ''pa' el refresco,'' literally, ''for a soda.''\nMy experience trying to convert the registration of the used car we bought to our family's name -- it took five trips to government offices over the course of months -- is more typical. So was our experience trying to get a birth certificate for our Mexican-born daughter. When my husband and I went to the civil registry in our district, dozens of people, most carrying infants, sat on precarious stacks of cardboard boxes in two tiny rooms filled with trash. There was no attempt to help people know where to start, no sign on the wall listing required documents, no take-a-number. One official told us we could not register the baby without the birth certificates of her grandparents. At the next desk, we were told we could. (In a neighboring registry, an official had offered to do it for a large bribe.) We paid a gestor, or coyote, to help us with the transaction, and at least got mostly done in one morning. An acquaintance who went alone needed four trips.\nI am not the only fed-up resident of Mexico City. Everyone complains, all the time. But when bribery is the only way to get services without taking a week off work, people bribe.\nWhat people really need, of course, is a system that doesn't require bribery to get things done. But this is so far from people's experience in places like Mexico City that they do not punish officials for failing to produce it. Nor do many people here believe in their own ability to influence a process of change. Mexico today suffers from double the usual Latin American fatalism, as it is also, in a way, a post-Soviet society. P.R.I. rule was not Marxist, but it was Leninist after a fashion, effectively eliminating civil society by swallowing up independent organizations. The hangover lingers, creating a vicious circle of corruption and inaction that makes fatalism entirely rational. Should I complain to my garbage man's boss? He probably enjoys a percentage of my tips. General fed-upness is a useless emotion unless there is some channel for turning it into action, and there is none.\nIn theory, of course, there is one such channel -- voting. Citizens can now throw out corrupt officials. But I don't think it has ever happened in Mexico City. Officials here ignore corruption because they can -- it doesn't cost them at election time. Most voters have more urgent needs than clean government, like jobs, security and food. And if voters don't really believe that corruption will ever disappear, then they figure they would be chumps not to get their own little piece.\nVotes here are not won through good service but through caudillo-style favors to constituent groups. The P.R.I. no longer runs Mexico City, but its political system still does. Mexico City is a supersize version of the Daley machine in Chicago or New York's Tammany Hall. Older people, for example, can get special income supplements -- but it helps to be close to your local P.R.D. official. AMLO, the mayor, may be personally puritanical (so was Mayor Daley), but he relies on P.R.I.-style electoral games to maintain political support.\nThe strategy works. In midterm elections last month, Mexicans rewarded the nation's two major political machines. Throughout the countryside, the P.R.I., which never stopped doling out goodies, made a comeback. And in Mexico City, the P.R.D. won an absolute majority in the City Council and control of 13 of its 16 districts. AMLO, with a popularity rating of more than 80 percent, is now the front-runner to replace President Fox.\nIn Mexico, then, democracy has not brought immediate gains. But slowly, I believe, it is helping the nation create a system of political pressure for the long run. Under dictators, reforms can happen, but they come at the pleasure of the leader, and disappear when he tires. In the Philippines, Efren Plana's reforms slowly eroded, and they crashed completely when President Marcos apparently decided to install cronies in the tax bureau in the mid-1980's to help his family avoid taxes and to produce money for his 1986 re-election campaign. Even in places where officials have the power, initiative and imagination to clean house, their work can dissolve into nothing when the desire flags.\nIn a democracy, citizens can become an ally of government reformers, exerting pressure to keep reform on track. This is happening -- although infuriatingly slowly -- in Mexico today.\nEven before Fox became president, Mexico's political opening-up was unleashing independent forces against corruption. Journalists used to have their salaries supplemented by a regular envelope of cash from whatever business or government ministry they covered. This was not a system that nurtured investigative reporting. Newspapers were tamed by their dependence on government advertising. Those arrangements died in the last years of the P.R.I. While most journalism is still embarrassingly awful in Mexico, newspapers are beginning to report on corruption.\nPerhaps the single most important victory over corruption in Mexico is the electoral process itself. Mexico's P.R.I. victories were the stuff of global infamy for decades. Today, Mexico's electoral institute advises other nations on how to organize clean balloting. On the basics, like registration, voting and counting ballots, Mexico probably does better than the United States.\nStill, I have yet to meet a Mexican who says that President Fox is doing much of anything to fight corruption, except those who work for him. The year after Fox took office, more people actually thought corruption was rising rather than going down. I believe that this public perception of Fox's failure is wrong, but it is understandable. His is a notoriously lethargic presidency. Rooting out corruption was a theme -- the theme -- of his party. No one could have lived up to the hopes invested in him.\nAnother reason for the public perception that Fox has failed is that his administration has chosen not to attempt widespread prosecutions for corruption -- and when it has gone after big fish, it has so far failed to land them. For most Mexicans, and indeed, people everywhere, jailing the big fish is synonymous with fighting corruption. But in general, Fox has been right to emphasize other strategies. Prosecutions of past thievery consume money and time better spent elsewhere. Especially in dysfunctional judicial systems like Mexico's, they often fail, and even when people do go to prison, the event is so rare that it has no deterrent effect on the behavior of current officials.\nBut Fox has actually made important investments in the future of clean government. He is bringing the anticorruption agency up to global standards. And at his urging, this year Congress created a federal civil service. It will professionalize government and cut down on patronage, nepotism and jobs allocated by the applicant's willingness to pay kickbacks to his superior.\nAlso, in June, Fox's new access-to-information law went into effect. The law recognizes that government information is the property of citizens and establishes a mechanism to allow them to request it.\nThe law effectively transfers some of the burden of monitoring corruption from the government to society. It will be a continuing source of specific public pressure against corruption. And specificity is important. As Mexico City shows, general disgust about corruption does not produce change. Only when powerful sectors demand specific new ways of doing business do reforms occur.\nTo call Mexico, where civil society is barely breathing after years on the P.R.I. payroll, a successful example of corruption-fighting is an overstatement at this point. But it might not be in a few years. ''In the past, presidents didn't have civic organizations to hold them accountable,'' says Stephen Morris, an expert on Mexico at the University of South Alabama. ''Now the pace of reform escapes the administration. Civil society is increasing its demands and pointing out blemishes in the government's program.''\nThree years ago, long after Gil D\u00edaz had left the Treasury and just before Vicente Fox took office, an elephant named Benny was smuggled from Texas into Mexico to perform in a circus, for a $4,500 bribe. Customs, it seems, is an institution inherently prone to corruption. But Francisco Gil D\u00edaz is back -- Fox appointed him treasury secretary -- and he is once again pouncing on corruption in customs. He fired the entire top management of the bureau. Salaries have been doubled or tripled. The customs inspectors are rotated every 15 days. So far, more than 1 in 10 customs brokers have been stripped of their licenses.\nUnder Fox's predecessor, Ernesto Zedillo, top officials in charge of customs changed almost yearly, and some were clearly unqualified. There were no new computers for six years. ''Customs had been abandoned,'' Gil D\u00edaz says. ''We reformed it under Salinas, and now we are doing it again.'' The reforms are depressingly familiar. The people he is firing probably include many he hired more than a decade ago. On a recent trip to the port of Manzanillo, he was trying to get customs officials to put up a fence around the truck route from the docks.\nSomeone dedicated, like Gil D\u00edaz, can keep putting fences back up. But they stay up only when there is pressure from businessmen worried that customs chaos will cost them trade deals and from a press that embarrasses the administration when a three-ton elephant is smuggled; or when there is public information about collected duties, a channel for the outrage of citizens who are shaken down and a court system that can actually put corrupt officials in jail. In short, the key to fighting corruption is to find sources of political pressure to balance the enormous we've-always-done-it-this-way weight of the corrupt.\nIn Mexico, as elsewhere, fences go up and fences fall. They remain standing only when a government knows that its fortunes are tied to the fences, that if the fences topple, the government topples along with them."}]
