[{"text": "BANGLADESH HUNGER LINKED TO FEUDAL SYSTEM; A World to Feed 16th article of a series appearing periodically\n1981-11-24T05:00:00.000Z\nThe very name of the country, Bangladesh, stirs images of misery and, in the minds of most Westerners, the perennial poverty here is the result of some inexorable Asian fate.\nCyclones, floods, war and, above all, overpopulation are blamed for the destitution and malnutrition in this fertile alluvial delta, one of the most crowded places in the world.\nSome 90 million people are jammed into a country roughly the size of Wisconsin and, in the last six years alone, women in Bangladesh have produced 14 million more mouths to feed - more than the entire population of Australia.\nDespite this Malthusian presence, however, Bangladesh is probably now producing enough food to provide an adequate diet for every man, woman and child in the country. And the agricultural potential of this lush green land is such that even the inevitable population growth of the next 20 years could be fed by the resources of Bangladesh alone.\nWhy, then, is malnutrition still endemic? And why is the agricultural potential still largely unfulfilled? American diplomats here tend to prefer the explanation that Bangladesh is the victim of a cataclysmic combination of overpopulation and recurring disasters. But most of the longtime aid officials in Dacca strongly believe that hunger would not exist in Bangladesh except for an inefficient, still largely feudal economic and social structure.\nThis system, it is generally agreed, is limiting the amount of food that can beju produced and keeping the food that is available from being consumed by those who need it the most.\nFood aid officials here privately concede that only a fraction of the millions of tons of food aid sent to Bangladesh has reached the poor and hungry in the villages. The food is given to the Government, which in turn sells it at subsidized prices to the military, the police and the middle-class inhabitants of the cities.\nMoreover, agronomists and relief workers here say that the skilled rice farmers of Bangladesh have neither the means nor the incentive to improve the country's own agricultural productivity.\nMuch of the land here is sharecropped by tenants who have to split whatever crops they produce 50-50 with the landowner. Yet the tenant has to pay the full cost of production. Under such arrangements, few tenants can afford the cost of the new seeds and fertilizers that are necessary for improved crop yields.\nEven within these constraints, Bangladesh may well be producing much more food than existing statistics indicate. Agricultural production figures in particular tend to be understated, reportedly because the numbers are used to justify the Government's annual requests for food aid. Deficit of a Million Tons\nAccording to official statistics, and using 15 1/2 ounces of rice as a minimum daily requirement for a person, the country has an annual food deficit of roughly one million tons of grain. But recent research by the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute found that actual production was significantly higher than the Government estimates.\n''The country is probably producing enough food to be selfsufficient already,'' said Hugh Brammer, a senior official of the Food and Agriculture Organization who is currently an adviser to the Ministry of Agriculture.\nBy implication, that would mean that hunger is far less severe here than has previously been reported. The last official nutrition survey was in 1975-76, when it was discovered that almost 60 percent of the population was malnourished, compared with 45 percent 20 years earlier.\nSince that time, however, the country has had two good crop years and grain reserves are at an all-time high of 1.4 million tons. Survey work has just been completed on a new nutrition study, and Dr. Kamaluddin Ahmed of the Institute for Nutrition and Food Science at the University of Dacca, the director of the survey, said in an interview that his field researchers had the impression that people throughout the country were eating better than they did in the 1970's. Nevertheless, Dr. Ahmed and other medical personnel interviewed here stress that malnutrition is still widespread.\nRecent trips in various parts of the country confirmed their statements. A two-hour visit to the village of Nolan, some 22 miles west of Dacca, with Rukia Rahman, a 23-year-old paramedical worker, disclosed a baby with night blindness, a result of vitamin A deficiency, a malnourished 10-month-old girl and a pregnant woman with the swollen ankles produced by eclampsia, a nutrition-related disease. Most Eat Two Meals a Day\nMost of the villagers said that they ate two meals a day, puffed rice and gur, a molasses-like syrup, in the morning, and rice and fish at night. On another morning, a group of foreign consultants traveling some 100 miles north of Dacca stopped for a midday snack of tea and cheese biscuits. Within minutes, a crowd of some 15 children had gathered to watch, prompting one woman to mutter, ''I should learn you can never have a picnic in this country.''\nAs she was putting the tin back in the van, it spilled, scattering the biscuits all over the ground. Within seconds, one of the children had scooped up all of the food and vanished.\nIn the view of virtually all of the international relief officials interviewed here, the root of this persistent malnourishment in the midst of relative plenty is the unequal distribution of land in Bangladesh. Few people are rich here by Western standards, but severe inequalities do exist, and they are reflected in highly skewed land ownership.\nThe wealthiest 16.7 percent of the rural population controls twothirds of the land, and almost 60 percent of the rural population holds less than one acre of property, up from 38 percent in 1975. This growing multitude of 45 million people - fully half the population of Bangladesh - is as vulnerable to famine as it was in the mid-1970's.\nThe warehouses ''may be full of rice, but that doesn't mean that most people can afford to buy enough to meet their needs,'' commented an official of the United States Agency for International Development. ''There still is no real food security in Bangladesh.'' Inheritance Law a Factor\nThe growth in landlessness can be attributed to several factors, particularly the Moslem law of inheritance, which dictates that the land must be divided and passed on to every child. As population has increased, the average size of plots has shrunk to such an extent that the least disaster can push a small farmer into the ranks of the landless.\nAn influx of money from Bangladeshi workers in the Middle East has also gone to buy up land, still the most desirable investment here. And the new agricultural technologies being introduced have tended to favor the larger farmers, putting them in a better position to buy out their less fortunate neighbors.\nWhatever the reasons for the trend, the increase in landlessness is a major reason for the persistence of malnutrition. According to the Rev. R.W. Timm, a Roman Catholic priest who has been in Bangladesh for more than 20 years, ''the real wages of rural laborers have declined over the past 15 years because of this huge pool of landless.'' He said that ''I met a man in Tangail the other day who was paying laborers five taka a day, about 25 cents, plus one meal.''\nThe average rural wage is about 50 cents a day, which is enough to buy 4.4 pounds of rice and nothing else. The most recent study by the Institute for Nutrition and Food Science showed that the food intake of landless workers was 10 percent to 14 percent below the recommended daily caloric intake, while those with three acres or more exceeded the requirements by a healthy margin.\nAnother study based on a health project in Noakhali, southeast of Dacca, found that the mortality rate of children aged 1 through 4 among the landless was twice as high as for children whose families held three acres or more of land. In Bangladesh, one of every four children dies before the age of 5. Productivity Stifled\nIf the pauperization of the countryside is perpetuating malnutrition, it is also stifling efforts to improve agricultural productivity in Bangladesh, according to agronomists here.\n''It is clear that crop intensity and productivity are highest among small, owner-operated farms,'' Mr. Brammer, the F.A.O. official who is an Agriculture Ministry adviser, commented during a recent drive to the relatively prosperous eastern district of Comilla. ''The cutoff seems to be five acres, which is about what one family can farm by itself. Yet about 50 percent of the agricultural land is held by farmers with five acres or more - sometimes considerably more.''\nAccording to Mr. Brammer and others, absentee landlordism is pervasive in Bangladesh, particularly in the western part of the country. The F.A.O. official, who is one of the acknowledged authorities on Bangladesh agriculture, said that he knew one landowner in the northwest who holds 250 acres and gets around the unenforced limit of about eight acres of landholdings by registering the land in the names of children yet unborn. ''That's a novel form of family planning,'' he added.\nOther Westerners in Dacca say it is not uncommon to meet lawyers and politicians in the capital who do not even know where all of their land is.\nThe holdings of these absentee landlords are small by Western standards. In Bangladesh, five acres is enough to make a farmer one of the richest men in his village, and most farmers till tiny plots of a fraction of an acre like horticulturalists. But the point is that the larger holdings farmed by tenants are not as productive as the smaller farms tilled by their owners. Profit of About $20 a Year\nAbdur Rashid, a dignified, bearded 42-year-old farmer in the village of Joypur, said that he had calculated that, if a sharecropper cultivated one kani, four-tenths of an acre, in an improved way, his profit, after costs and paying off the landlord, would amount to about $20 a year. Speaking through a translator in his sparsely furnished, dirt-floored house, Mr. Rashid concluded: ''He won't do it. He could earn more by putting the money in a bank and earning interest without having to do any work.''\nA few voluntary organizations, both foreign and Bangladeshi, are attempting on a small scale to reform this system. Caritas, a Catholic relief and development group, has introduced the tebagha system in a few communities around the country. More common in West Bengal, in India, this arrangement gives the tenant two-thirds of the output of the land and the landlord one-third.\nNevertheless, with the Government dominated by landowners - about 75 percent of the members of Parliament hold land - no one foresees any official support for fundamental changes in the system. ITALIC NUTRITION BOX\nThe world food economy is characterized by rising production but greater instability, by the persistence of malnutriton in some areas but rising consumption in others.\nPrevious articles in the series have dealt with the pitfalls of relying on the United States as the major source of food in world markets, the problems of huge farm exports from the United States, the possible slowdown in productivity that faces American agriculture, the Reagan Administration's farm policies and the extent of hunger and malnutrition in the United States and other countries."}, {"text": "EVEN MIRACLES HAVE THEIR PRICE, GREEN REVOLUTIONARIES DISCOVER\n1981-01-11T05:00:00.000Z\nIn the 1960's, the conviction dawned on many people that if continued population growth was not matched by dramatic increases in the world's food supply, large parts of the globe would face widespread hunger and famine. One response to this potential crisis was the ''green revolution,'' a term first used to herald the development, by American plant geneticists working in Mexico and the Philippines, of dwarf varieties of wheat and rice capable of doubling or tripling yields per acre in those regions. The new plants had shorter, stiffer stems and, if heavily fertilized and irrigated, could produce much larger heads of grain that did not fall over from their own weight.\nIn the late 1960's and early 1970's, the new grains spread rapidly over wide areas of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Previously unplanted lands were opened for cultivation while plant geneticists in many developing countries refined the dwarf varieties for better adaptation to local conditions.\nBut the achievements of the green revolution, dazzling as they have been, may have reached their limit as a solution to the problem of hunger. The rate of growth in world food supplies is now slowing while the world's population continues to increase. At the same time, large-scale farming of dwarf grains has created new economic and social problems for the developing countries.\nIn several of the countries once short of food, the crop increases from new grains have been stunning. Until the mid-1970's India, for example, had to import huge quantities of food. Now, in normal monsoon years, it feeds itself, however meagerly. Indian wheat production has soared from 12.3 million metric tons in 1965 to 24.1 in 1975, to 34.9 this year. Rice production rose from 45.9 million metric tons in 1965 to 74.3 million in 1977.\nIndonesia has increased rice output by 37 percent in the past decade; the Philippines by 40 percent. Pakistan has doubled its average wheat crop and increased rice production by 30 percent. In Columbia, rice yields have doubled and sorghum production has quadrupled. Mexico, which planted sections of its northwestern states with the new wheat varieties, has increased production by 30 percent.\nIn the past 15 years, these advances have raised total world production of food and feed grains from 951,000 metric tons in 1965 to an estimated 1.432 billion tons this year. Moreover, larger wheat, corn and grain sorghum crops mean more livestock feed, better human diets and, usually, increased poultry production. But these bountiful gains have exacted a price.\nThe high-yield grains are particularly vulnerable to insects and disease. To prosper, they require large quantities of fertilizer and pesticides, more irrigation water, and ever more expensive fuel to pump the water and to run machinery. As developing countries struggle with the transition from simple, labor intensive farming to high technology agriculture, antiquated transportation systems need to be modernized to move larger crops to expanding urban centers and to nonproductive back country areas. All this takes hard currency. It now costs more than $5 billion annually to provide fertilizer, pesticides and equipment for India's farms. The country's irrigation systems are nearing capacity, and new sources of water will have to be found within the next 20 years if the grain output is to keep pace with population growth.\nIn Bangladesh, the wheat crop has tripled in the last decade and rice production jumped by nearly 25 percent. But in some water-rich parts of the country, the dwarf rice varieties don't grow high enough to escape drowning in the annual floods. If Bangladesh is to continue increasing yields, it will have to build a costly flood control system.\nIn some countries, stepped-up grain production has created shortages of storage for reserves. Two years ago, Kenya was faced with a choice of exporting its grain surplus or letting it spoil. Farmers' prices dropped, and this year they planted less - but as a result of bad weather, production fell below the needs of Kenya's increasing population. Now Kenya is asking the United States for special credits with which to import grain.\nBut such credit may be increasingly hard to obtain. At his confirmation hearing last week, John Block, almost certainly the next Secretary of Agriculture, agreed with many analysts that in the long run the developing nations would gain more from technical help than from financial aid. ''It's to our benefit to help these countries become self-sufficient in grain production as quickly as possible,'' Mr. Block said. ''This improves their economies and makes them better customers of the United States, both for other food products and for our industrial goods.''\nFor now, the green revolution may have hit its peak. On the far horizon, agricultural scientists envision new techniques in genetic engineering and recombinant DNA which could bring another breakthrough in food production. They talk of genetic changes in corn and wheat plants that would endow them with their own nitrogen-fixing capabilities, eliminating the need for fertilizer. And they foresee the creation of plant strains with higher rates of photosynthesis, which vastly increase rates of growth.\nBut until these feats are pulled off, say agricultural economists who specialize in world food production, there will be no dramatic leaps in food yields. Meanwhile, the rate at which more food is produced actually has been declining - while the world's population is increasing by 70 million people each year. Worldwide, the margin between these two factors is discouragingly narrow. In Africa it has already disappeared and the increase in the amount of food grown each year, despite the gains from the green revolution, is less than the annual population increase.\nLester Brown, director of Worldwatch, an international food and resource study group, says the green revolution has not been the final solution to world food supply problems. ''It has been a way of buying time until the brakes can be put on population increases,'' he explained. ''There may be other important breakthroughs down the road if the scientists do find the key to increasing photosynthesis. But the gains from those discoveries would also be only time buying if population increases aren't checked.'' end"}, {"text": "BANGLADESH AT A GLANCE; History\n1981-05-31T05:00:00.000Z\nWars between Moslems and Hindus have been erupting on the subcontinent for centuries. In the 12th century Moslem invaders brought Islam to Bengal, which is now part of Bangladesh, and the Moslem rulers remained until the British arrived in the 18th century. In 1947, predominantly Hindu India won independence from Britain and a separate Moslem state, Pakistan, was created in two parts divided by 1,000 miles of Indian territory. With power centered in West Pakistan, the more populous East Pakistan demanded greater economic benefits and political change. Rioting broke out in the East in 1968. In 1970 the separatists in the East won a majority in the National Assembly and called for more independence, but Assembly sessions were postponed by Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan, who was then President. Rioting in the East erupted into civil war and Bangladesh was declared independent, forcing the resignation of Mr. Yahya Khan. Sheik Mujibur Rahman, a leader of the Bengali nationalists in the East, became Prime Minister but was killed in a 1975 coup. His successor was also deposed, and Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated yesterday, became the martial law leader in 1976 and President\nin 1977. Population The vast majority of the 87 million people are Moslems. Most of the Hindus have fled to India since 1971. Hindus now make up only 14 percent of the population, which includes 650,000 Buddhists and a few Christians. Bangladesh is the world's eighth most populous country. Geography Bordered by India and Burma at the bend in the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh has an area of 55,126 miles -about the same as Wisconsin. The largest cities are Dacca, the capital, with 1.7 million people, and Chittagong, with nearly 890,000. The country is primarily a low plain cut by the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers and their deltas. Bangladesh is sub- ject to heavy monsoon rains. Economy About 70 percent of the people are employed in subsistence agriculture. Rice is the most important food crop. Others are sugar cane, wheat and other grains, and tea. The country has a small industrial base but produces most of the world's supply of jute. Among the other small industries are cement, textiles and fertilizer. In the current fiscal year, the United States sent more that $154.7 million in aid to Bangladesh, including more than $74 million for food, clothing, medicine and other essential needs. The country used about $80 million in economic development aid."}, {"text": "THE WORLD; Everyone Loses In Bangladesh Coup Attempt\n1981-06-07T05:00:00.000Z\nIf there are worse places than Bangladesh these days, much credit goes to Ziaur Rahman. From his rise to power in 1975 until his assassination last weekend, General Zia instilled new motivation in the New England-sized nation of 92 million people to produce more food and fewer children.\nHis murder by army rivals raised fears in Dacca of another period of political instability and bloodshed like the one that occurred after the army overthrew Sheik Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first President, in 1975.\nThere are no obvious successors to General Zia. One possibility, Maj. Gen. Mohammed Abdul Manzur, led the plot against the President and was himself killed after his arrest. According to the Government, he and two other conspirators died in an exchange of gunfire between their guards and a group of ''agitated armed people'' who tried to seize the detainees. Seventeen other officers remained in custody and were to be tried by a military court.\nThe plot collapsed two days after rebels shot President Zia in a guest house in Chittagong, Bangladesh's second largest city and main port. General Manzur, the local army commander, appealed to other units to join the uprising but in vain. Like General Zia a hero of Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence, General Manzur chafed at his transfer to Chittagong in 1977 and was apparently even more incensed at the President's plans to make him head of the army staff college, a noncommand post.\nAlthough President Zia reinstituted elections in 1978, whoever succeeds him will have to be acceptable to the army. Acting President Abdus Sattar, 75, said poor health would keep him from running in elections which are to be held within six months. Hasina Wazed, the daughter of Sheik Mujib and head of the opposition Awami League Party, recently returned to a tumultuous popular welcome after six years in India. But at 32, she is eight years too young to be President."}, {"text": "I.M.F. PUTS PRESSURE ON BANGLADESH\n1981-10-30T05:00:00.000Z\nThe International Monetary Fund, which has recently come under pressure from the Reagan Administration to tighten its lending policies, has cracked down on one of the poorest countries in the world - Bangladesh.\nThe I.M.F. suspended payments in July on a three-year $912 million loan given to Bangladesh only seven months before. The fund cited that country's failure to cut Government spending and scale back food subsidy programs.\nAs a result of the suspension, Bangladesh has lost $100 million in funds it had expected this year, forcing the Government to line up $200 million in short-term credits with several commercial finance companies, including American Express, Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Morgan Guaranty.\nThe banks, apparently flush with cash and eager to lend, offered Bangladesh, which a few years ago was labeled an ''international basket case,'' even more money than the bankrupt country needed to meet its immediate needs, sources in Dacca said.\n''They assume that the I.M.F. credit will be resumed shortly, and that they'll all be paid back with fund money,'' one international official commented. Early Resumption Doubted\nA resumption of loan payments by the fund may not come quickly, however. The fund's representative in Dacca has told American officials that a team will be visiting Dacca in late November or early December, but that a reinstatement of payments at that time was doubtful. ''One thing the I.M.F. doesn't take lightly is a complete lack of homework and planning,'' said an American diplomat, ''and Bangladesh has no idea how to come to grips with its economic problems.''\nBut in the wake of the I.M.F. cutoff, Bangladesh has had to ban all imports except for oil shipments, which are being held to last year's levels. Because oil has to be paid for in cash, and Bangladesh has virtually no foreign exchange reserves left, the Government has had to go to the banks for relief or face deprivation unimaginable in the West.\nOil here is used not so much for industry as for cooking, so the fiscal crisis threatens the very survival of a population half of which is said to be malnourished already.\nThe crisis occurs as Bangladesh faces national elections on Nov. 15 to choose a President to replace Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated last May.\nBecause of the impending elections, Government officials are reluctant to make the hard economic decisions desired by the fund. These include drastic reductions in Government spending, including cuts in a huge subsidy system that guarantees cheap food to the country's army, police and politically active urban middle class.\n''Just before elections is not the time to take the kind of hard political decisions that the I.M.F. wants them to make,'' said a high American official here. ''I don't see how we can say we want countries to be democratic and then penalize them for not being able to do things that only dictatorships can do,'' he added.\nIronically, the I.M.F. suspended its credit primarily because of a huge budget deficit that resulted in large part from policies that the fund and other international agencies had urged upon the Bangladesh Government. Farm Aid Key Factor\nThe country's international donors have been prodding the Government to offer higher support prices for farmers to stimulate agricultural production. The Government has responded, and last year, because of excellent harvests, it had to purchase a record one million tons of grains from farmers, causing roughly half of this year's deficit.\nThe I.M.F. credit to Bangladesh was one of the largest ever made by the international lending institution, which provides funds to countries experiencing balance of payments difficulties. The loan also made the I.M.F. the largest dispenser of funds to the South Asian country, surpassing the United States and the World Bank in outlays.\nThe $912 million loan amounted to almost 450 percent of Bangladesh's quota in the fund, and therefore carried the highest performance criteria attached to fund loans. The Reagan Administration had attacked the fund recently for relaxing the conditions under which the fund's loans were dispersed.\nThe payments to Bangladesh were suspended primarily because the country had exceeded the previously agreed-upon ceilings on Government spending at the time of the annual review of the credit last July. The fund wants the Government to cut various commodity subsidies and to reduce the drain on the treasury by numerous state enterprises, mainly by raising prices on additional goods and services. Instead, Government spending has skyrocketed, while revenues have been declining. Export Earnings Down\nForeign aid, which amounts to about 70 percent of the development budget of Bangladesh, has been stagnant in recent years, at an annual level of $1.2 billion. Export earnings have dropped sharply, along with the price of jute, which accounts for 70 percent of such earnings.\nJute prices currently are about half of what they were two years ago, while the price of oil, which consumes 60 percent of Bangladesh's export earnings, has doubled. In addition, other world prices are rising by about 19 percent a year.\nThe Government has been unable to mobilize internal resources to make up for the earnings loss. Tax receipts here are about the lowest in the world - amounting amount to 8 percent of the gross national product, compared to 18 percent in India."}, {"text": "Around the World; Bangladesh's Acting Chief Enters Presidential Contest\n1981-06-23T05:00:00.000Z\nThe ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party has unanimously nominated acting President Abdus Sattar as its candidate in the Sept. 21 presidential election, Prime Minister Shah Azizur Rahman announced today.\nThe announcement came as something of a surprise, since Mr. Sattar, 74 years old, suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure and told reporters on June 4 that he would not be a candidate because of his failing health. Mr. Sattar became the acting leader after President Ziaur Rahman was slain in an attempted coup on May 30.\nThe election date had been set earlier and eliminated a major candidate. By law, the President must be at least 35 years old. Hasina Wazed, president of the major opposition party, the Awami League, and daughter of the late Sheik Mujibur Rahman, the first president of Bangladesh, will become 35 years old one week after the election. The Awami League is generally considered the best organized of the nearly 55 political parties in the country."}, {"text": "BANGLADESH REPORTS DEATH OF PRESIDENT ZIAUR RAHMAN\n1981-05-30T05:00:00.000Z\nPresident Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh was killed today in the southern city of Chittagong, the Bangladesh radio reported. He was 45.\nIt was believed here that General Zia died in an accident, but there was no immediate confirmation. The Press Trust of India, a news agency, reported from Dacca, the Bangladesh capital, that the announcement was made in a special broadcast, but the circumstances of the President's death were not given. According the radio, Vice President Abdus Sattar took over as acting President. Reports said a 40-day period of national mourning had been announced by the Bangladesh Government.\nCommunications between Dacca and Calcutta were cut off. President Zia seized power soon after Sheik Mujibur Rahman, who led the country to independence from Pakistan in 1971, was assassinated Aug. 15, 1975. ---- A Strict Leader By LES LEDBETTER\nWhen Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman seized power in Bangladesh six years ago, he was hailed as the strict leader that struggling nation needed.\nAfter the coup that gave him the presidency, soft-spoken military man was described as hard-working and incorruptible in his personal life and able to make the tough decisiions needed to lift the new nation to its feet.\nSome critics even called General Zia ruthless because he was unfazed by the secret trial and execution of at least 200 soldiers who tried to overthrow him in October 1977.\nHe told an interviewer, however, that his type of rule was necessary in Bangladesh, which broke away from Pakistan in 1971. And even his critics acknowledged that he seeemed to be making headway against the problems of overpopulation and poverty in his country. Urged Population Control\nShortly after the coup that brought him to power in 1975, General Zia began making unpopular statements, such as ''Population control must be our nation's No. 1 priority'' and ''Bangladesh must feed itself and stop depending on the world for help.''\nContrary to his predecessors, the general eliminated much of the politics in the civil service and began streamlining state industries. Inflation went down and food production went up.\nBorn in the northwestern city of Bogra on Jan. 19, 1936, he joined the army when he was 17. In the late 1960's he grew increasingly sympathetic with Bengali nationalism, and in March 1971, after a Pakistani crackdown on civilians, it was Ziaur Rahman, then a regimental commander in the port city of Chittagong, who declared the independence of Bangladesh.\nIn that radio broadcast, he indicated that he would be President of the new country. But soon he had to yield that power to Sheik Mujibur Rahman, a flamboyant leader who became his enemy.\nIn the war with Pakistan that followed the declaration of independence, Ziaur Rahman, then a lieutenant colonel, commanded a brigade that became known as the ''Z Force.'' And he acquired a reputation for icy bravery.\nGeneral Zia had just been fired as army Chief of Staff in 1975 when he took power after the assassination of Sheik Mujib. Moshtaque Ahmed, who had seized the presidency in a coup three months earlier, had tried to strip General Zia of his power and that caused the military to move against him.\nIn 1978, General Zia ran for a five-year term as President. He won overwhelmingly, although opponents said the voting was rigged."}, {"text": "IN BANGLADESH, PEACE FOR NOW; News Analysis\n1981-06-05T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the surprise of some pessimists, Bangladesh has weathered the all-important first stage of its present political crisis, which is one of the gravest it has had to face in its precarious decade of independence.\nFive days after the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman, the country is at peace, following a constitutional and orderly transfer of power to a caretaker government. Civil war and a military takeover - either of which seemed a distinct possibility just a few days ago - have both been averted in this Bengali-speaking nation, at least for the present.\n''Bangladesh today is a proud nation,'' a member of Parliament said during a round of eulogies to President Zia yesterday. ''A griefstricken nation, to be sure, but a proud nation, too. We have lived up to the democratic ideals of our martyred leader.''\nBut behind the scenes, the politicking, the intrigues and the recriminations were already well under way to fill the power void left by the death of the 45-year-old President, who had been for some time the pre-eminent figure in the country, leaving no obvious successor. People Far Removed From Politics\nAnd, as is often the case in third-world politics, the biggest losers were likely to be the common people, whose traditional lives are run by ancient rhythms, far removed from the posturing of the politicians or the murderous intrigues of the highly politicized army.\nWith 92 million people crowded into a land of 55,000 square miles, Bangladesh is, by many measures, one of the poorest nations. Its infant mortality rate is 14 percent (compared with 1.7 percent in the United States), average life expectancy is 47 years and, by Western standards, most people are undernourished.\nIn more than five years of running the country, first as a general and then as a civilian, President Zia identified birth control as ''our No. 1 problem'' and his tough, no-nonsense approach began to make some progress.\nIn his helicopter tours of villages, in which most of the people live, he also coaxed increased food production out of them, and his rural development plans began to chip away at the old-fashioned agricultural practices that have kept this land dependent on foreign aid for food, despite its fertile soil. Independence From Pakistan in '71\nBut perhaps his most important gift to the nation was a degree of stability that it had never had before. Marcus F. Franda of the American Universities Field Staff, who has been studying Bangladesh since before it acquired independence from Pakistan in 1971, said early this year that ''for the first time in its independent existence, Bangladesh has an effective government.'' Now that is certainly gone.\nIn the maneuvering over the next six months until a presidential election is supposed to be held, the two dominant personalities are likely to be two dead men - President Zia and Sheik Mujibur Rahman, the father of the nation, who was assassinated in 1975, in a middle-of-the-night hail of bullets like the one that brought down President Zia last weekend.\nThe Awami League, made up of Bangladeshis still loyal to the memory of Sheik Mujib, is the second largest party in Parliament. And just last month, it acquired a powerful political asset when his daughter, Hasina Wajed, returned from self-exile in India. She has been drawing huge and emotional crowds at rallies around the country. Zia's Party Has Less Cohesion\nPresident Zia's party, a loose coalition called the Bangladesh National Party, has less cohesion. Some people expect that without him it will fall apart, although its leaders are considered likely to try to use the memory of their own martyred hero in the same way that the Awami league uses Sheik Mujib's.\nBut, as a Western European remarked, ''the sad thing in all of this is that more politicking and less action is just exactly what Bangladesh does not need now.''\nThat comment goes to the heart of a traditional third-world argument about democracy versus development and the question of whether American-style politics is a luxury that a country like Bangladesh can afford.\nPresident Zia certainly returned this country to civilian rule, with a strong institutional structure vindicated to a large extent by this week's stability. But it was a flawed democracy, with elections of questionable integrity, and along the way at least 200 military men who opposed him have been executed. Risks of Democracy in Third World\nIn years past, Western diplomats, including representatives of some of the world's most democratic countries, were privately urging General Zia not to go even as far as he went in bringing democracy back to Bangladesh because they feared the deadening effect that politics would have on development. The debate rages on here and elsewhere.\nIn India, which dominates this region whatever it does, the people affirmed their claim to the title of the most populous democracy in 1977, when they voted out Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's authoritarian regime. But in the dithering of the disparate government that succeeded hers, democracy degenerated into just politics, and she was returned to office last year.\n''Democracy in our part of the world is a portmanteau word malleable enough to take all shapes and postures,'' Chanchal Sarkar, an Indian columnist, said this week, applying the lesson in India to the problem in Bangladesh. ''But whatever the shape it now assumes in Bangladesh, it will be pulled more tightly over the frame.''"}, {"text": "BANGLADESH LEADER IS SHOT AND KILLED IN A COUP ATTEMPT\n1981-05-31T05:00:00.000Z\nPresident Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh was shot and killed in the port city of Chittagong early today and a broadcast by the Dacca radio said a little-known opposition group was responsible for the assassination.\nA state of emergency was declared by Vice President Abdus Sattar, who assumed the duties of Acting President. Rebels announced over the radio from Chittagong that they were taking over the Government, but officials in Dacca said that they were still in control.\nThe 45-year-old President Zia, two aides and several bodyguards reportedly were killed as they were sleeping in a guest house in Chittagong, a district capital of 890,000 people.\nCivilian Rights Are Suspended\nThe news of the killing and a proclamation of an emergency were broadcast over Dacca radio this morning. Acting President Sattar signed emergency legislation suspending the rights of citizens in the country of 87 million.\nThe Acting President ordered a curfew in Dacca, the capital, Chittagong and other major cities and called for a 40-day period of mourning for the President. President Zia, an army general who took over the Government in November 1975, was reported to have been shot during his visit to Chittagong near the border with Burma. Many opponents of the Government have been active in the area.\nDacca radio said ''miscreants'' were responsible for the killings, but it gave no details. Another broadcast quoted the Government as saying that a group called Biplabi Parishad was responsible for the assassination and it called on a Maj. Gen. Manzur Ahmed to surrender. The organization was said to include rebels from the armed forces, and Major General Ahmed was believed to be its leader. Army Reportedly Remains Loyal\nLater radio reports said the rebels were led by Maj. Gen. Abul Manzur, The Associated Press reported. The rebels claimed to have taken control of the Government.\nLieut. Gen. H.M. Arshad, the army chief of staff, was quoted as saying that a revolutionary council headed by General Manzur had taken control of Chittagong radio station. But General Arshad said other members of the armed forces were remaining loyal to the Government.\nReports carried by Bangladesh radio and quoted by the Press Trust of India, a news agency, said President Zia and several aides and bodyguards were killed as they were sleeping in a district guest house in Chittagong at about 3:30 A.M. (5 P.M. Friday, New York time).\nDacca radio announced the news seven hours later along with an appeal to the armed forces ''not to be guided by provocations from outside.'' The first reports of President Zia's death suggested only that he had died in an accident.\nAccording to information reaching New Delhi, the group that seized Chittagong radio also appeared to be in control of the Chittagong area. Among the radio announcements was one declaring that a treaty of friendship between Indian and Bangladesh signed in 1972 was abrogated. Communications Are Interrupted\nChittagong radio went dead at about 2 P.M. Communications between India and Bangladesh also ended as telecommunication lines were cut. Acting President Sattar, a 76-year-old lawyer who had been in key positions of the Government since 1975, said in his broadcast that there would be no change in foreign policy and that agreements with foreign countries would be honored.\nPresident Zia had been in firm control of the Government since he seized power five years ago in the last of a series of army coups following the assassination of President Mujibur Rahman, an immensely popular figure who led Bangladesh to independence from Pakistan in 1971.\nSome Bangladeshis use their first names as the surname. Ziaur Rahman becomes Zia, instead of Ziaur, in subsequent references because the last two letters of his surname form an article that is used with the second name. Similarly, the name of Mujibur Rahman becomes Mujib on second reference.\nPresident Zia, designating himself as the martial law administrator, kept the country under strict controls for awhile. But he appeared to have consolidated his position after he put down a series of revolts by low-ranking servicemen in northern Bangladesh, including an abortive coup by air force rebels in 1977. An Overwhelming Election Victory\nHe was confirmed in the office in a national referendum that showed overwhelming support for his Government. President Zia lifted martial law and began to push a popular concept of revolution aimed at making Bangladesh self-sufficient in food.\nNational harvests usually fall about 20 percent short of fulfilling Bangladesh's needs, and the country has remained largely dependent on international aid. Western countries have contributed $10 billion in food and other aid since 1971.\nPresident Zia was generally regarded as a benevolent dictator as he strived to change the image of his country as one of the world's most backward. Huge irrigation projects and vigorous campaigns for birth control appeared to be making headway.\nPresident Zia was also pursuing a plan for regional cooperation among Southeast Asian countries that found a ready response in several countries of the region, including India.\nHowever, political problems resurfaced suddenly. Daughter Returns From Exile\nSheik Mujib's Awami League elected his 33-year-old daughter, Hasina Wazed, as president of the party. Sent into exile in India after the death of her father, she returned to Dacca this month to a tumultuous welcome even as the Government-controlled media unleashed a propaganda barrage against her, saying she was an Indian agent.\nDisputes over an Indian-built dike that diverted some water from the Ganges to the Indian side and sovereignty over a new island that emerged near the coasts of India and Bangladesh have soured relations between the two countries.\nAs Dacca appeared to be adopting a policy of confrontation with India, New Delhi attributed the belligerence to growing internal tension threatening the stability of President Zia's Government.\nIn a message today, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India expressed ''deep concern'' over the development in a ''friendly'' neighboring country and renewed a pledge of cooperation and friendship with Bangladesh."}, {"text": "BANGLADESHI KEEPS EYE ON WEATHER, NOT POLITICS\n1981-06-07T05:00:00.000Z\n\"What matters here is the rain,\" said Mr. Mustaf, a subsistence rice farmer, automatically casting his eyes up to the leaden sky in the traditional June ritual of waiting for the all important monsoon rains to begin falling.\nLike most of the 68,000 villages of Bangladesh, Masail has a life that changes very little over the the years or decades except when there is too much rain or not enough. And on Mr. Mustaf's family plot of just less than half an acre, he uses tools and procedures with which his grandfather would have felt entirely comfortable.\nThanks to the transistor radio, which has revolutionized communications in the many parts of South Asia that do not have electricity, Mr. Mustaf and his friends heard promptly about the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman in an attempted coup last Saturday, and they discussed its implications as they sat in a circle under three coconut palms, drinking sweet milky tea and playing cards. President Had Visited the Area\n\"Of course it is a terrible thing to kill a good man like that,\" Mr. Mustaf said, as his friends, all dressed like him in brightly colored sarongs, nodded gravely. \"He came in a helicopter to a village just near here one day last year and we all went over to see him.\"\nPresident Zia visited thousands of villages like this one, tirelessly promoting his plan for what he called a \"peaceful revolution\" to bring the country out of its horrific poverty.\nThey were simple and obvious goals - birth control, literacy and increased food production by the use of more modern methods. But a visit to Masail, which consists of several little clusters of grass-roofed mud huts surrounded by plush green rice paddies, illustrates what a difficult task it was and how easily it could be abandoned in the political confusion and instability in the wake of President Zia's death.\nMr. Mustaf, who is 32 years old, has three sons and two daughters and would not mind having a few more children, he says. Because of President Zia's campaign, one of the most vigorous by a third world leader, especially in a predominantly Moslem country, there is now a family planning clinic only a few miles from Masial, and some of the people from here go to it.\n\"But I've never been,\" Mr. Mustaf said when asked, indicating, without a lot of embarrassed circumlocution, that traditional sexual fears were only part of the reeason for his reluctance.\nA more basic reason, which is prevalent all over this part of the world, is that to people who have almost nothing, children can be more of an asset than a liability, soon bringing in money and helping with crops. Moreover, with infant mortality at 14 percent, a couple often feels that they must have many children in order to be sure of eventually having two adult sons to see them through old age.\nMr. Mustaf's children, though not starving, are badly undernourished, like at least three-fourths of the children in Bangladesh. One in particular, a 5-year-old girl named Rabea, who is about the size of an American 3-year-old, is particularly listless from her inadequate diet, and she spends much of her time sitting in the dust outside their two-room mud hut, barely moving and not even bothering to brush away the flies."}, {"text": "SPREAD OF 'MIRACLE' RICE LAGGING IN ASIA\n1981-03-12T05:00:00.000Z\nIn parts of Asia, the shift from the use of hand knives called ani-ani to sickles during the 1960's brought a major technological revolution. The number of workers for each rice paddy was reduced. The time of harvesting was shortened. The community structure changed.\nSo when a new rice - a sturdy, fast-growing, high-yielding variety called IR-8 - was introduced in 1966, it promised something called a Green Revolution in Asia. With its introduction came the promise of eventual self-sufficiency in rice and a new way of life. This hope was stirred despite some initial controversy. In some of the countries of the Indochinese peninsula, for example, the grains were considered ''American,'' and therefore subversive, and the seed was sometimes planted there surreptitiously.\nFifteen years later, countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are within reach of the goal of self-sufficiency. And the Philippines, a rice importer until 1976, is now an exporter, with overseas sales of 250,000 metric tons in 1980. ''It was a victory,'' said a spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture. Developed for Ideal Sites\nBut one shortcoming of the Green Revolution has been that IR-8 and other varieties based on that strain were developed for planting under the best circumstances: irrigated paddies where fertilizers could be used. Under those conditions, the new rice strains tripled production. But the conditions exist only for a small percentage of rice farmers.\n''More than three-fourths of the world's farmers still do not grow the new rices,'' said Nyle C. Brady, director general of the International Rice Research Institute, an institution supported by the United Nations, the European Economic Community, the Asian Development Bank, the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and several nations, including the United States.\n''The reason is too little or too much water for the strains we have developed,'' he said, ''or the soil is too salty, acid or sandy. Our research is now focused on helping these farmers who have not had the benefit of the Green Revolution.'' Luzon Output Rises Sharply\nNevertheless, in the past 10 years under a Government-sponsored program called Masagana 99, rice production in the Philippines' fertile Luzon area has climbed from 2.2 metric tons of rice from a hectare to an average of 3.3 tons, or a rise from just under one ton an acre to one and a half.\n''If there had not been a Green Revolution, most of the countries of Asia would be short, maybe desperately short, of rice,'' said Surajit K. Da Datta, an agronomist at the research institute. ''Now they are keeping up with their population gains, making up the difference that a slightly higher standard of living has on rice demand and in some cases moving from importer to exporter.''\nIt takes five or six years to develop and test a new rice that will produce guaranteed results. Grain by grain, under sterile conditions, the rices are catalogued and indexed for size, color and shape, so farmers can request by number the rice that meets their needs. The most popular rice now being grown in Southeast Asia is IR-36. Resistance to Pests\nIR-36 combines the characteristics of IR-8 with a high resistance to pests. But it does not grow well in deep water or in drought areas. ''In Bangladesh, for example, two million hectares of land are under deep water,'' said Gurdev S. Khush, a breeder at the institute. ''India needs rice that will take long periods of drought. Ideally, what we need is a rice that will tolerate both floods and droughts, since most of the world's farmers rely on monsoons for their water. If we can solve this problem, we will have a truly miracle rice.''\nWhat the new rice promises is a new way of life for rice farmers, greater employment opportunities and development of local subsistence economies. ''There has been a lot of talk about who wins and who loses,'' said Robert W. Herdt, an agricultural economist at the institute.\n''It takes so little to influence the structure of subsistence economies. The introduction of a new rice can do that. With each variation, we create ripples in the local economy,'' he said.\nThe impact of the Green Revolution on the Philippines has been the development of rice barter and trade and a general increase in the income of rice farmers.\nSince most of the farmers grew rice primarily for their own families, extra rice crops were cash crops. With ample rice and additional money, farmers became consumers. Health improved. The standard of living increased.\n''Our studies show that hired labor in central Luzon earned 320 kilograms of rice per hectare in 1966 and 543 kilograms per hectare in 1979,'' Mr. Herdt said. ''Much of our work in this phase of rice development is aimed at insuring that more, not less, employment is created by the new technology.''"}, {"text": "WORLDWIDE WORK OF U.N. AGENCY SEEMS ENDLESS\n1981-10-15T05:00:00.000Z\nEach day dozens of weary women, children and men file across the Ethiopian border, walking 40 miles to a southeast corner of the Sudan in search of food, water, medicine and tents at a camp run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugeees.\nIn northwest Tanzania, 25,000 Hutus, who years ago fled from their Tutsi rivals in Burundi, have settled down in sturdy, mud-baked homes. They grow enough tobacco, corn and peas to feed themselves, finance a cooperative bus and discotheque and enjoy transistor radios. They are on their way to citizenship in underpopulated Tanzania, thanks to aid they no longer need from the United Nations agency.\nFor 30 years the Office of the High Commissioner, which was awarded the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize today, has been providing for the victims of war. The organization operates from Geneva with a staff of 1,000, which is small by United Nations standards. About two thirds of them work in the dismal corners of the globe where refugees huddle.\nUnlike most bureacracies, the High Commissioner, which is both the name of the agency and the title of its chief, tries to shrink its constituence. Success is measured by the number of those returned home or permanently resettled in a new land. Its goal is precisely opposite from that of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugeees, the body responsible for Palestinian Arabs that is directed to keep its camps filled. Its Most Awesome Task\nThe High Commissioner's most awesome task was providing for the nine million Bengalis who in 1971 fled what is now Bangladesh to escape the clash between Pakistan and India. With India's victory and the independence of Bangladesh, the Bengalis went back home a year later.\nLast year the agency celebrated the arrival of a train carrying 1,200 schoolgirls to Bulwayo, Zimbabwe. They were the last of 250,000 returning Zimbabweans who had fled to Mozambique, Botswana and Zaire until black guerrillas could wrest independence from the white minority rulers of what had been Rhodesia.\nBut the agency, which first won the Peace Prize in 1954, never runs out of fresh clients. The turmoil in Africa and Asia in particular has currently created about 10 million refugees.\nThe Commissioner is not supposed to look after victims of natural disaster, flood, earthquake or famine. In fact, the distinction is often difficult to make and many of the hundreds of thousands of Ethiopian refugees, for example, have left their country because they cannot find a living. Indeed, the chief criticism of the agency is that it has been drawn into providing machines, roads, tools and other items that enable the homeless to settle down into a new life. A Shrewd, Paternal Dane\nSince 1978 the agency has been run by a shrewd, paternal Danish politician, Poul Hartling. A former teacher in a Congregational seminary, Mr. Hartling for years led Denmark's middle-of-the-road Liberal Party. He was Prime Minister from 1973 to 1975.\nHis political talents are useful. To care for refugees from Cambodia, he must stay on equable terms with both Thailand and the Communist regime installed in Phom Penh by Vietnam. Mr. Hartling has been successful enough so that 310,000 Cambodians could return home last year.\nThe High Commissioner is equally astute at rallying other agencies to share his burden. The World Food Program is enlisted everywhere, and notably in Somalia, to supply cereals, dried milk and other necessities to the 1.2 million refugees, mostly from Ethiopia, who swamp that arid and impoverished nation. The United Nations Children's Fund insures safe water in Cameroon for those fleeing Chad's civil war.\nNo fewer than 200 private agencies also help out, supplying doctors, blankets, stoves and more. Among the more pervasive are Oxfam, Care, Caritas, Catholic Relief Services and Medicin Sans Frontieres of France. 1.4 Million Afghans Embroiled\nThe latest and largest disaster has caught up 1.4 million Afghans escaping Soviet troops attempting to suppress insurgents fighting a Moscow-backed regime. The refugees are camped in Pakistan, another poor nation that cannot afford the burden but nevertheless makes cash grants to each newcomer. The High Commissioner finds tents and tarpulins, tea and sugar, blankets and clothing to make life bearable for the refugees.\nLike so much at the United Nations, the High Commissioner owes its origins to an agency created by the League of Nations after World War I. Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian explorer, was in charge, largely caring for 1.5 million Russians fleeing from the revolution and civil war.\nAfter World War II, international efforts concentrated on settling the millions driven across Europe's borders. The millions forced out of newly independent Pakistan and India were largely ignored. But 125,000 European refugeees remained to attract attention and they were the reason that the United Nations agency was established.\nEurope soon provided a new group of clients, 170,000 Hungarians who fled in 1956 after Soviet tanks crushed an uprising. Additions to the Caseload\nToday, nearly every political disturbance adds to the High Commissioner's caseload. Violence between left and right in El Salvador has created another 80,000 refugeees in Latin America.\nAnd since the end of the war in Vietnam, hundreds of thousands have been driven from or have fled Indochina, presenting the agency with a new problem. Thai and Malay pirates regularly prey on the boatloads of hapless refugees, raping, robbing and murdering. Last year it was estimated that 2,000 a month were subjected to the ordeal, sometimes twice on the same trip.\nThe agency regards itself as responsible for refugees' safety, but neither the Thai nor Malaysian Governments responded to its appeals for protection.\nWith considerable delicacy and a touch of irony, the High Commissioner donated a patrol boat to the Thai Navy, a strong hint that it might do better.\nThe High Commissioner does not enjoy a large budget. Last year he spent $500 million and expects the total to fall in 1981. The United States made the biggest contribution, $123.5 million, followed by Japan at $64.5 million, West Germany at $19.8 million, Sweden at $19.2 million and Britain at $17.8 million.\nThe Soviet Union contributes nothing, and neither do its East European allies. Moscow believes that refugeees are a ''colonialist'' legacy and, by definition, the Soviet Union is not colonialist."}, {"text": "POVERTY, NOT SCARCITY, CALLED CHIEF CAUSE OF WORLD HUNGER; A World to Feed 17th and last of a series of articles that appeared periodically\n1981-12-07T05:00:00.000Z\nOf all the ills afflicting the human race, none seems more soluble - and at the same time more intractable - than hunger. On the one hand, enough grain is produced now to provide every man, woman and child on earth with some 3,000 calories a day. That is more than the average level of consumption in the United States and about 50 percent above what is now considered to be a minimum acceptable level of caloric consumption. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition persists, often in countries where plenty of food is available, such as in India and Brazil. Uncertainty as to Numbers\nThere is widespread uncertainty as to the actual number of malnourished people. But no one challenges the fact that a minimum of 100 million to 200 million people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Southeast Asia, are severely malnourished, in the sense that they do not have the energy to function normally. Hundreds of millions more would eat better, and possible more, if they could, nutritionists maintain.\nWhy, then, does widespread caloric deprivation persist? Why has the real progress that has been made not eliminated hunger altogether? The answer, a surprising number of international food experts agree, is that hunger is overwhelmingly the result of income inequality and poverty. Until these stubborn social and economic problems are solved, no amount of tinkering with relief programs or population control will eradicate world hunger, most of those in the field agree. Hundreds of Interviews\nThis view has been supported in visits to areas both rich and poor in food production and consumption and in hundreds of interviews for this series with farmers, agronomists, agricultural economists, nutritionists and policy-makers in the United States and abroad.\n''Highly skewed rural incomes contribute both to widespread hunger, especially among the landless and near-landless, and also to stagnating food production,'' said Prof. C.P. Timmer of the Harvard Business School. ''Without question, basic poverty - the lack of adequate purchasing power among consumers and food producers - is the most important cause of hunger. Elimi nating poverty is the only solution to basic hunger.''\nMalnutrition, a confusingly imprecise term, must be distinguished from outright famine, the emergencies that are almost always the result of sudden political upheavals or natural disasters, and which are dealt with through several generally effective international emergency relief agencies, such as the United Nations Children's Fund.\nA growing awareness of the distinction, and of the more systemic causes of malnutrition, has led many hunger organizations to shift their emphasis from relief efforts to attempts to reform the agricultural and social patterns within developing countries.\nHowever, there are as many answers as to how this can and should be accomplished as there are countries and cultures. A growing number of experts argue that the ultimate solutions will involve some combination of free-market incentives for agriculture and equitable land-holding systems and social policies.\nRichard Critchfield, an author who has spent more than 20 years in peasant villages in 50 countries, believes that solutions range from land reform in India and Bangladesh to better price policies and more agricultural investment and technical training in Africa.\nOfficials of relief organizations such as Save the Children, World Vision and Caritas, the Catholic relief organization, for example, now talk not of feeding programs but of the need to increase employment and purchasing power among landless peasants - one of the toughest economic problems facing developing countries. Stress on Production Urged\nCritics of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization argue that the agency needs to do more to push food-deficit countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, to put more emphasis on agricultural production.\nThe World Bank and other multinational lending institutions are now pouring almost one-third of their loans into agricultural and rural development, and commitments to those sectors have more than doubled since 1975, to almost $5 billion last year.\nIn the United States, which supplies a rapidly increasing share of the food consumed in developing countries, some re-evaluation of the nation's food policies is beginning to be made. Increasingly vocal critics of food aid, on the right and the left, charge that the help rarely reaches those who need it the most. In Bangladesh, for example, several officials with international relief agencies have estimated that only about 25 to 30 percent of the food aid distributed there ever reaches the poorest people.\nEven the wisdom of the United States's all-out grain export policies has come under challenge. The huge shipments, it is argued, help perpetuate an inherently unstable dependence of many countries on imports of basic staples.\nThough there is currently an abundance of cheap grain in the world, a spate of bad weather in the 1980's could easily result in new food shortages, price runups and a clamor for American grain. The richest importing countries, such as the Soviet Union and Mexico, could easily bid the poorest nations out of the market, exposing their populations to the danger of real famine. Idea Not Taken Seriously\nOne proposal aimed at preventing such a development, put forward by United Nations food agencies, would have the major grain-exporting countries promise to sell a certain amount of food to the poorest nations, at a roughly commercial price. Thus far the Reagan Administration has not taken the idea seriously.\nSoil experts also warn that all-out exports are threatening American farm productivity by encouraging the planting, year after year, of erosive crops such as corn and soybeans. Already, partly because of increased fuel costs, agricultural productivity in the United States is leveling off. From an average annual rate of increase of 2.6 percent over the last 25 years, the growth of farm productivity slowed to about 1.5 percent over the last five years.\nThe comparative advantage in agriculture may in fact be shifting to the developing countries, which still make relatively little use of fertilizer or the higher-yielding seeds of the Green Revolution. The potential gains from increased use of these methods are much greater than the gains that the West can expect from existing technology. Combined with the dramatic crop improvements promised by more advanced biological techniques the poorer nations are certain to raise their food production to levels unimagined only a few years ago.\nBut no amount of international assistance or technology can substitute for real change within many of the food-deficit countries themselves, nutritionists and agricultural economists agree.\nSpeaking of Bangladesh, but echoing what is said of much of the third world as a whole, Father R.W. Timm, a Roman Catholic priest working with Caritas in Dacca, argues that ''there must be more equitable land-holding arrangements, better credit for farmers, more work in the countryside.'' One Farmer's Bumper Crop\nAn example of what is possible even in Bangladesh, frequently considered the most hopeless of the hungry nations, is the performance of one farmer, who is poor, in Comilla, a relatively prosperous area in the eastern part of the country.\nLast year, on his patchwork collection of 17 parcels of land, adding up to a total of three acres, Abdur Rashid turned out a bumper crop of vegetables and about three tons of rice - an output equal to the highest rice yields in the world. The bounty from those three acres, every inch of it tended like a backyard garden, was enough to support the slim, wispy-bearded 42-year-old farmer's household of 10 comfortably, and earned him a national award as the outstanding farmer in Bangladesh.\nHis success demonstrates that the rich delta soil of Bangladesh could easily produce enough food to support the 90 million people living in the country. Unfortunately, it is also completely atypical. Absentee Landlords a Problem\nThe average rice yield in Bangladesh is roughly half of what Mr. Rashid produces, thanks to a rural system characterized by absentee landlordism, sharecropping and growing landlessness. And even if more food were grown, millions of people in Bangladesh would still be malnourished, because they do not have enough money to buy what they need to fill their stomachs.\n''This year and next year we will have enough food,'' said Obiadullah Khan, who, as secretary to the Minister of Agriculture, is the man who directs Bangladesh's food policies. ''But no one is looking at the purchasing power of the buyers,'' Mr. Khan stated in a recent interview in his spacious but shabby office in Dacca. ''We don't know if anyone will be able to buy the food we are planning to produce.''\nIn a sense, the world is in much the same predicament. In most parts of the world the food is there, and the means to produce much more is at hand. But no one is sure about how to get it to those who need it."}, {"text": "ZIAUR RAHMAN WAS STRICT LEADER WHO TRIED TO GIVE NATION DIRECTION\n1981-05-31T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman seized power in Bangladesh six years ago, he was hailed as the strict leader that the struggling nation needed.\nAfter the coup that gave him the presidency, the soft-spoken military man was described as hard-working and incorruptible in his personal life and able to make the tough decisions needed to lift the new nation, created when it broke away from Pakistan in 1971, to its feet.\nSome critics called General Zia ruthless because of the manner in which he put down internal political and military opposition. After one attempt to oust him, his critics charged, 200 soldiers were secretly tried and executed.\nBut even his opponents acknowledged that, with Western nations and international banks pouring money into the country, he seemed to be making headway against the problems of overpopulation and poverty. Urged Population Control\nSoon after the coup that brought him to power in 1975, first as army Chief of Staff and then as chief martial law administrator, General Zia began making unpopular statements, such as ''Population control must be our nation's No. 1 priority,'' and ''Bangladesh must feed itself and stop depending on the world for help.''\nUnlike his predecessors, the general eliminated much of the politics from within the civil service and began streamlining state industries. But although inflation went down and food production went up, the nation's problems remained serious.\nLess than a year ago, as he took his campaign for what he called a ''peaceful revolution'' to the nation's villages, he stressed four points in his program: a commitment to double food production in five years; a mass literacy campaign; family planning and population control, and, most controversial, the establishment of a volunteer militia that would be used for both police and development work.\nSome of his opponents questioned whether the militia was intended less for use in development work than to strengthen his Bangladesh Nationalist Party.\nBorn in the northwestern city of Bogra on Jan. 19, 1936, Ziaur Rahman joined the army when he was 17 years old. In the late 1960's he grew increasingly sympathetic with Bengali nationalism. The province of East Bengal was separated from the rest of Pakistan by 1,800 miles of India, which encouraged the nationalistic fervor on its eastern border.\nIn March 1971, after a Pakistani crackdown on civilians, it was Ziaur Rahman, then a regimental commander in the port city of Chittagong, who declared the independence of Bangladesh. Yielded Power to Mujibur Rahman\nIn that radio broadcast, he indicated that he would be President of the new country. But he soon had to yield that power to Sheik Mujibur Rahman, a flamboyant leader who became his enemy.\nSome Bangladeshis use their first names as the surname. Ziaur Rahman becomes Zia, instead of Ziaur, in subsequent references because the last two letters of his surname form an article that is used with the second name. Similarly, the name of Mujibur Rahman becomes Mujib on second reference.\nIn the war with Pakistan that followed the declaration of independence, Ziaur Rahman, then a lieutenant colonel, commanded a brigade that became known as the ''Z Force.'' He acquired a reputation for icy bravery.\nGeneral Zia, a dapper man with a trim salt-and-pepper mustache, a rigid military bearing and the habit of wearing sunglasses even on cloudy days, lived with his wife, Begum Khalida, and two sons in a white-stone bungalow in Dacca, the capital of Bangladesh.\nAfter the assassination of Sheik Mujib in 1975 and a series of coups and countercoups, General Zia consolidated his power when the military moved against Moshtaque Ahmed, who had assumed the presidency in another coup and tried to strip General Zia of his power. Won Five-Year Term in 1978\nHaving named himself President by executive order in 1977, General Zia ran for a five-year term in 1978 and was overwhelmingly elected. His opponents said the voting was rigged.\nLate in 1978, he proclaimed his intention to end almost four years of martial law. He called for parliamentary elections and the full restoration of the democratic process. The elections were held in 1979, and his Nationalist Party won a two-thirds majority in Parliament."}, {"text": "WITHOUT ZIA, LESS CHANCE FOR THE 'PEACEFUL REVOLUTION'; WILLIAM BORDERS\n1981-06-07T05:00:00.000Z\nIf the population of the entire world were squeezed into the continental United States, that land would be about as densely populated as Bangladesh is now.\nThat is the kind of illustration prized by the legions of aid and development experts who for years have been drawn to this country because its demographic statistics are so appalling.\nThe life expectancy at birth is 47 years. Eighty percent of children below the age of five are undernourished. Seventy percent of the entire population is anemic. Only one person in five can read. And, despite improvements in agricultural efficiency and the enormous quantities of foreign aid, the average per capita consumption of rice, the dietary staple, is less today than it was 20 years ago.\nIt is easy to feel hopeless about Bangladesh, and many people do. But in the past few years there have been some small signs that things were getting a bit better and hopes that they would get better still.\nLast weekend, when President Ziaur Rahman was killed in a hail of bullets during an attempted army coup d'etat, a good many of those hopes died with him. There were are least two reasons why. His death at the age of 45 plunged the nation into a crisis that no one could quite see the end of, and political instability can scarcely be good for development efforts. Moreover, since he seized power in 1975, President Zia had become one of Asia's most effective heads of government. His regime was beginning to make progress, though it was very much a one-man show and much of what he did went against the traditions of this ancient land. Whoever eventually succeeds him, whether a general or civilian politician, seems unlikely to follow the same course.\nBirth control is clearly the country's most important need, since by the year 2,000 Bangladesh will have half the population of the United States living in a land smaller than Wisconsin. Sheik Mujibur Rahman, the founder of the country (who also died by assassination nearly six years ago), used to say, when pressed on the subject, ''We Moslems love our children. If there are many of them, Allah will provide.'' That is the traditional view.\nBy contrast, President Zia, a tough and often ruthless former general who took power a few months after Sheik Mujib was killed, repeatedly referred to the population explosion as ''our number one national problem.'' He gave a military-style impetus to the drive to solve it, cutting through Government inertia in providing birth control means to the villages where most of the people live. There were signs that the approach was beginning to work. ''This is the first time that the leader of a developing country and an Islamic country has put himself totally behind population control programs,'' Health Minister M. A. Matin said optimistically a year ago.\nPresident Zia's commitment to birth control was part of what he called a ''peaceful revolution'' for Bangladesh. Other points included a literacy campaign and an almost certainly overly optimistic plan to double food production over five years with expanded irrigation of the land and the introduction of higher yield seed varieties.\nTirelessly hopping around this green marshy country in a helicopter, and spending as much as 20 days a month outside Dacca, he sold the message personally and it had some effect. ''I remember Zia came here one day last year and he talked about irrigation canals,'' a farmer in Julal, a village 30 miles north of the capital, recalled last week. ''But it wasn't just talk. A canal actually got built, and now it irrigates that plot of land right there and we can have an extra crop in the dry season. No leader ever did that before. Zia will be missed very much in Julal. We are very sad.''\nIn a part of the world where political leaders are often venal or lethargic, there are not many figures like President Zia. In the period of electioneering that is about to begin leading up to a presidential election that under the Constitution is supposed to be held within the next six months, some new national saviour may emerge. But it is far easier to imagine a return to the slippery political intrigues which center on the capital or to a new round of murderous army plots and takeovers.\nAt the center of the Government now is a vacuum, and no one can say who will come along to fill it. On the civilian side, neither President Zia's Bangladesh National Party or the opposition Awami League (Sheik Mujib's party) has an obvious presidential candidate, and both are badly factionalized. As for the 65,000-man army, it too is beset by bitterness and rivalry that date back to the war of 1971 in which Bangladesh, backed by India, won its independence from western Pakistan. In the long round of eulogies last week, much was made of what former Chief Justice Abdus Sattar, the ailing, 75-yearold Acting President, called ''the democratic heritage left to us by our beloved martyred leader.'' Critics said that President Zia's was a flawed democracy, and the Government was certainly autocratic. But the orderliness of the transition last week may have been an indication that the political institutions he built over recent years had more solidity than the pessimists thought.\nStill, a period of serious instability with a deadening effect on development activities seems inevitable. It had already started last week with late night meetings, hints, posturing and horsetrading in the Parliament, the ministries and the officers' quarters of military garrisons all over the country.\n''Will Bangladesh make it?'' people in the West sometimes ask, as if it were a patient hovering between life and death in some intensive care ward. The answer is, of course. The country is not going to disappear and 92 million Bangladeshis, soon to be 100 million, will still be here, whenever anyone cares to look, and still hungry. At times, the signs for them will be a bit better. At other times, they will be a bit worse. Last week they seemed very much worse indeed."}, {"text": "EMBRACING DEMOCRACY, ASIA TENDS TO CRUSH IT\n1981-11-22T05:00:00.000Z\nAs vote-counting in Bangladesh's second direct presidential election was nearing completion last week, Abdus Sattar, the 75-year-old jurist who was clearly winning, declared that the poll had reaffirmed the country's faith in democracy and that the election was ''the fairest ever held in this part of the world.'' But Kamal Hossein, a former Oxford University law professor, who ended up a distant second in the 26-candidate race, contended that the results were fraudulent. He said intimidation had kept his supporters from the polls, that ballot boxes had been stuffed and electionrigging had been widespread.\nThere was no way to categorically uphold or refute the conflicting assessments. Foreign journalists and Western diplomats, who were given freedom of movement, saw no evidence of violence or bullying. But at most, they covered only 100 of 21,000 polling places. Even President Sattar acknowledged there had probably been some irregularities, endemic, he said, to the region. He insisted they were minor and could not have reversed his landslide victory. But Mr. Hossein's Awami League threatened to take to the streets to protest the results. In South Asia, where democracy has gained a vulnerable toehold, credibility in the electoral process is both essential and rare. India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are among the handful of third world countries with multiparty democratic systems. In Pakistan, which had democracy and lost it, the idea of free and fair elections is still widely yearned after - and vaguely promised by the military Government.\nMaking democracy work has proved as difficult in these countries as growing more food or generating sufficient energy. In Pakistan, election-rigging by an overwhelmingly popular but evidently insecure Zulfikar Ali Bhutto prompted demonstrations that led first to the military takeover and later to Mr. Bhutto's conviction and execution for the murder of a political opponent. And in India, after a court ruled that an overwhelmingly popular Indira Gandhi had won a rigged parliamentary election, she responded by declaring the emergency rule in 1975, which led eventually to the movement that ousted her in the 1977 elections. Similarly, in Sri Lanka, where former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike had canceled scheduled elections, she was barred by Parliament from participating in politics.\nA political controversy is brewing in India over the cancellation last week of a rerun of a parliamentary by-election that had been nullified because of violence. In this race, in the Garhwal district, H.N. Bahuguna, an independent candidate who had left Mrs. Gandhi's party expressing loud disapproval, was given a good chance for victory. But at the election in June, his people complained to the election commission that armed police from four adjoining states shot at and chased his supporters at the polls. A new election was ordered, but last week the state government canceled it, contending that a statewide prison strike was tying down the police needed to insure peace at the polls. Aides of Mr. Bahuguna said the postponement was merely a ploy by the ruling party, forcing him to exhaust his campaign funds. Votes in the 'Bank'\nEven without outright chicanery, elections in these poor and densely populated countries are highly risky undertakings. For example, how does a candidate get his program across when as many as 70 percent of the electorate is illiterate? In Bangladesh, the election ballot contained 39 different symbols - a ladder, bicycle, elephant, sheaf of rice or boat - one for each candidate on the original list. Some symbols have so much totemic or cultural significance that they are passionately fought over.\nThen there is access to the media, which operate under an element of Government control in Bangladesh. While leading newspapers covered the speeches of all main candidates, they clearly gave bigger headlines and larger crowd estimates to Mr. Sattar, who became acting President when Ziaur Rahman was assassinated. State television also sought to give the appearence of fairness, but the Awami League contended that coverage was slanted against it. In addition, as acting President, Mr. Sattar had the use of a helicopter to fly around the country; his opponents had to rely on trains and cars. To help turn out crowds, students were reportedly paid up to $2 to attend political rallies for any of several parties.\nBallot-counting was also an issue. In Bangladesh, the count is made at the polling place. Some political scientists argue that this practice discourages participation by sizable minorities who may fear retribution if their votes show up as very different from the dominant group. Bangladesh minorities include Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Ballots in India are moved from polling places to a central district for counting, precisely to remove such pressures. But in India, as elsewhere, cultural hierarchies and cultural oppression remain real. The term ''vote bank'' is in common use in India, signifying blocs of votes that can be delivered by the command of a local leader. A diplomat recently reported that ''while politics was a career all over the world, in India it tended to be a business.''\nThe blemishes and imperfections are obvious and opportunities for abuse are many, but the sight of tens of millions of Bangladeshis at the polls showed that the idea of democracy retains great power and appeal. They may be poor and illiterate and some may be tempted to sell their vote or cast it in accordance with someone else's wishes. But people in one country polling place after another stood patiently waiting to mark their choice. And they all seemed proud."}, {"text": "Malthus and Marx, on Food Day\n1981-10-16T05:00:00.000Z\nNo better occasion than today, the first world Food Day, to exorcise the gloomy spirit of Malthus that clings to discussions of world hunger.\nPopulation is growing, but at a lower rate than demographers once feared. And food production isn't lagging. Global output now outstrips population growth. Getting food to empty bowls is another matter, but the task is far from hopeless. President Reagan could address it at the upcoming summit meeting on economic development at Cancun, Mexico.\nWhen Malthus lived (1766-1834), agricultural technology was primitive and birth control meant abstinence. The baby crop leapt, food output crept. But the Green Revolution changed that grim calculus. In a generation, global corn and wheat yields rose 50 percent. India tripled grain production; so did Bangladesh, once considered a basket case.\nGranted, food supplies are unevenly distributed. Perhaps 500 million people throughout the world are underfed. And the impressive gains in output remain at the mercy of weather and crop diseases.\nBut new seeds and fertilizers clearly have worked more effectively in unpromising places than the experts predicted. Population trends also confound the experts. Relative fertility is declining in countries like China, where birth control is vigorously promoted, but also in Mexico, where it is not. Thus those who feared the earth's population was on the way to quadrupling now say it may level off at 10.5 billion.\nWhat checks fertility is the prospect of a better life, of which the best evidence is better diet. That's why Food Day is a time to think about economic systems as well as grain yields. And here the United States holds trump cards. The Soviet Union, unable to feed itself, buys domestic peace with abundant American grain. ''Who's feeding whom?'' Mr. Reagan taunts. ''I can hardly remember a year when Soviet harvests have not been victimized by 'bad weather.' ''\nThe President ought to say it again at Cancun: Marx will not defeat Malthus. Avoiding food/population disasters requires better farming, genuine land reforms, fairer income distribution and - not least - real incentives for development. That is what unhungry nations should encourage."}, {"text": "WORLD HUNGER IS EXACTING HIGH HUMAN TOLL\n1981-08-17T05:00:00.000Z\nWidespread hunger remains intractable throughout the world and is exacting a high human toll. About half a billion individuals are still crippled by hunger, and a billion or more others should have a more varied diet, according to nutritionists. The great majority of the undernourished - some 80 percent, by World Bank estimates - are women and children. In recent testimony before Congress, Jean Meyer, the president of Tufts University and a noted nutritionist, said the human toll of hunger took the following forms:\n- Blindness caused by a lack of vitamin A occurs in more than 100,000 children every year.\n- Up to 5 percent of the population in remote inland regions of Africa and South America, and in the Himalayas, are affected by cretinism caused by iodine deficiencies in childbearing women.\n- From 10 to 50 percent of women in South America, Africa and Asia are estimated to have iron deficiency anemia.\n- In adults and children alike, undernourishment brings listlessness, muscle wastage and a reduced capacity for learning or activity, a legacy that perpetuates the poverty at the root of the hunger issue.\nThis problem of pervasive deprivation, it is agreed, is the real hunger problem, affecting far more people than outright famine and far harder to solve.\nAs C.P. Timmer of the Harvard Business School put it in a recent paper: ''The moral will of the rich is successfully spurred by emergencies; it is dulled by the chronic hunger of the masses of the poor.''\nThe public has responded to famines, those crisis situations amenable to crisis solutions. In 1979 and 1980, publicity by such celebrities as Rosalyn Carter and Liv Ullmann prompted an unparalleled international relief effort for Cambodia that successfully prevented the wholesale starvation of the Khmer people. A Million Refugees in Somalia\nThis year, the emergency is in Somalia, one of the poorest nations in the world, where more than one million refugees huddle in 33 camps. Elsewhere, in Thailand, the Sudan, Zaire, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Pakistan, severe hunger faces as many as nine million more refugees.\nThe undernourished are less visible. Most are in Asia: in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Cambodia. These six countries, along with Brazil, Zaire and Ethiopia, account for two-thirds of the world's hungry.\nIn India alone, 300 million to 400 million people do not have enough to eat, despite the country's plentiful wheat stocks, and in Pakistan, 30 percent of the population is not obtaining the minimum levels of nutrition.\nWorst of all is sub-Saharan Africa, where the food supply is so limited that fully 70 percent of the population is not getting enough to eat, according to Joseph C. Kennedy of Africare Inc., a nonprofit agency for development in rural Africa.\nThe region, the only one in the world where per capita food production has declined since 1960, is rapidly becoming a chronic food deficit area. Most of the countries there cannot even afford to pay for essential food imports.\nIn his paper, Mr. Timmer of the Harvard Business School dealt with the question of ''what do these people need to alleviate their hunger.'' His answer was that ''they need more of their basic food.''\n''Hunger is a calorie problem,'' he added. ''If solved by additional intake of traditional foods, especially basic cereal grains such as rice, wheat, or coarse grains, not only is the hunger problem solved but so too are many of the secondary nutritional problems, especially any protein deficiencies.''\nVirtually all the authorities on world hunger agree that the problem is due not to overpopulation or a lack of food availability. Even at the height of the world food crisis in 1974, the world was producing two pounds of grain a day -more than 3,000 calories - for every man, woman and child on earth. The cause of hunger, it is agreed, is poverty and poor income distribution in most of the affected areas. Many Cannot Afford Food\nIf poverty and inequality are the root causes of hunger, then it is not surprising, as Mr. Timmer of the Harvard Business School puts it, that ''successful relief efforts and a decreasing population growth rate in the third world have left much of the human hunger problem untouched.''\nThe problem is that many of the people who most need food simply cannot afford to buy it. According to a recent study by Amartya Sen of Oxford University, in three of four contemporary famines - two in Bangladesh and two in Ethiopia - there was no decline in food output; a breakdown in the economic system and in people's purchasing power caused the starvation. Indeed, in Bangladesh in 1943, Mr. Sen pointed out, people died of starvation in front of well-stocked food shops.\nThe higher the food prices, the greater the incidence of hunger, for in developing countries the poorest people already spend some 60 to 80 percent of their income on food.\nAnother problem is that governments of the countries in which most of the hungry live, with the recent exception of India, have not placed a high priority on food production or distribution. Much Land Left Uncultivated\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization, less than 60 percent of the world's cultivatable land is now under cultivation. Less than 20 percent of the potentially arable land in Africa and Latin America is cultivated, and throughout the developing world, vast increases in food production could be achieved through the adoption of more sophisticated farming methods.\nMost governments in developing countries have particularly neglected the needs of small farmers, although small farms produce most of the food in developing countries and have been shown to produce higher yields per hectare - 2.471 acres - than large farms.\nMany observers argue that this neglect of poor farmers, and inequality in the countryside, contributes both to widespread hunger and to stagnating food production. In their book, ''Food First,'' Frances Moore Lappe and Joseph Collins maintain that this issue is especially acute in Central America and the Caribbean, where in the mid-1970's approximately half of the agricultural land was used to produce cattle and crops for export or for a domestic elite, rather than basic staple foods. The pattern changed after the revolution in Nicaragua, where the new Government has put the old cotton plantations into bean production. More for Cattle Than Peasants\nIn Mexico, the authors point out, more basic grains are consumed by livestock than by the country's peasants. And, they say, in the Sahel, a region in north central Africa, south of the Sahara, characterized by periodic drought, agricultural exports actually increased in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when the desert tribes were faced with mounting hunger.\nSympathetic groups in the industrial countries have argued that more food aid, which has been declining in real terms, is needed to eliminate hunger. But the amounts that would be required to wipe out malnutrition dwarf the current amounts of aid.\nAccording to Mr. Timmer's calculations, the world's calorie deficit amounts to 30 million to 50 million metric tons, compared with total food aid shipments of 8 million to 10 million tons in recent years. The deficit amounts to only 2 to 3 percent of world grain production, however, and 15 to 25 percent of internationally traded grain.\nMoreover, it has frequently been demonstrated that food aid undermines the ability of countries to develop their own agricultural capabilities. The Only Lasting Solution\nThe only lasting solution to hunger, it is agreed, is not food aid but a more aggressive emphasis on agricultural productivity and food distribution within the food deficit countries themselves.\nTo achieve this, the international food agencies have suggested land reform and assistance for small farmers; the building of agricultural institutions with skilled personnel in developing countries; more research on tropical agriculture; sharply increased employment opportunities for the rural and urban poor and food subsidies for the needy.\nThe hungry themselves seem to agree that help in improving production is preferable to charity. Joseph Short, the executive director of Oxfam America, an international hunger relief organization, said that, when it was distributing food rations one day last year in Cambodia, hundreds of people waited quietly for their share, but when fishnets were handed out, the crowd cheered."}, {"text": "OTHER BUSINESS; TELL IT TO THE POLES\n1981-08-23T05:00:00.000Z\nStatisticians who know their business are always suspicious, keeping one eye on the calculator and the other on the lookout for inconsistencies inherent in manipulating layer on layer of mass numbers.\nIt doesn't always help. Take the World Bank numbers showing country by country the average daily food supply as a percentage of minimum daily requirement to sustain normal activity (reproduced in The Times as a chart on Aug. 16). The data are the latest available, from 1977, and the source is the World Bank's World Development Report for 1981.\nSome of the figures are predictable. The United States, for example, is 35 percent above the minimum. But what, for instance, is Poland doing at 40 percent over minimum? Have the food riots of this year been over a figment? And does Bangladesh (91 percent of the minimum food supply) really eat better than Saudi Arabia (88 percent)?\nThe World Bank report explains that the numbers were arrived at by dividing the calorie equivalent of the food supplies in a country by its population. But this was not done by the World Bank. The estimates are from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome. Their liaison office in New York City explained, ''Food supplies are different from food consumption. Part of what is classified as food supply could be animal feed and so these figures do not take into account an individual's diet.''\nIndeed, the F.A.O.'s report contains a section on the accuracy of the complete food balance sheets, supplied by the governments involved. ''These vary a great deal between countries,'' it said, ''both in terms of coverage as well as accuracy.''\nOne thing that Aaron Tenenbein, professor of statistics at the New York University Graduate School of Business generally keeps in mind is that a lot of people who report statistics are trying to prove a particular point. ''In the late 60's,'' he recalled ''a foreign car manufacturer claimed that 95 percent of all their cars sold for the past 11 years were still on the road. They didn't report on how many were sold each year. It turns out that 75 percent of the cars were sold in the last three years.''\nOn the whole, Professor Tenenbein has more faith in statistics than some, but he is fond of a quote supplied by the statesman Benjamin Disraeli: ''There are three kinds of lies - lies, damned lies, and statistics.''\nKatya Goncharoff"}, {"text": "INNOVATIVE FISHERMEN IN INDIA TRYING MOTORBOATS\n1981-01-22T05:00:00.000Z\nMariappan Jayapalan has become a pioneer in this fishing community on the outskirts of Madras City since he acquired a motorboat to replace his sailing raft.\n''My income has doubled since I got this,'' he said as he expertly steered the specially designed motorboat, called a beachcraft, out to sea. ''Before this I often thought of becoming a factory worker instead of remaining a fisherman. Now I have changed my mind.''\nMr. Jayapalan, who is 27 years old, bought the boat through the Bay of Bengal Program, a project administered by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and financed by the Swedish International Development Authority.\nThe program assists the Governments of the countries around the Bay of Bengal - India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Thailand - in the development of small-scale fisheries and, in the process, is raising the income of the abysmally poor fishermen. A Year of Experimentation\nAfter more than a year of experimenting with boats, the beachcraft was developed as most suited to the needs of the Coromandel Coast, which extends 300 miles on either side of Nettikuppam.\nUntil recently more than 30,000 rugged but primitive catamarans, sailing rafts of three to five logs tied together, were thought to be irreplaceable, and they accounted for 70 percent of the fishing in the area. The strong surf and shifting sands punish boats and there are no natural harbors, so the 900 fishing villages, with more than 150,000 fishing families that have followed their trade for generations, have always depended on the catamaran for their living.\nThe beachcraft, like the catamaran, can cut through the surf and is self-draining. Insulated with polyester that gives additional buoyancy, it is equipped with a five-horsepower engine within a watertight case.\nInnovation and mechanization are generally resisted by the tradition-bound people, but as the overwhelming advantages of the new craft have been demonstrated, resistance to change has been breaking down. Fishermen who have clung to the catamaran for want of a suitable alternative are realizing that their low productivity will never give them the relative prosperity of a factory worker or even of a coolie at a construction site. After 30 Years, Nowhere\n''I have sailed for 30 years, but where has it taken me?'' said Ramasamy Gopal, an elderly fisherman whose family of eight lives in a small hut. Mr. Gopal said he could no longer afford a catamaran, which needs replacement every five years because the logs lose their buoyancy.\n''The beachcraft takes care of all these problems,'' said Larz O. Engwall, director of the Bay of Bengal Program. ''It retains the advantages of the catamaran, is large enough to carry more fishing gear for a better catch and it lasts longer.''\n''There is only one problem in the way,'' an official of the local fisheries department said. ''We are not equipped to manufacture the beachcraft on a large scale.'' Efforts are being made to produce it more cheaply and with local materials. The craft costs about $2,500, several times the cost of a catamaran, but its durability and other advantages make it more economical.\nThe governments of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala are involved in the program, which is also experimenting with more efficient and cheaper nets and devices for locating fish.\nThe demand for fish has been growing in India and abroad. The United States and Japan have been importing large quantities of Indian shrimp and sardines.\n''Fishing as an industry has great potential,'' the fisheries official said. ''For the first time we are going about it in a scientific manner.''"}, {"text": "2 AMBASSADORS TEST THEIR MARRIAGE\n1981-06-08T05:00:00.000Z\nHe gets the Hindu cloth painting. She gets the Persian miniatures. He gets the two Lhasa Apso dogs. She gets the textiles from Iran.\nThey will divide the Persian rugs and Mozart and Haydn records between them, but he gets most of the Burpee seed packets she ordered for the garden. And that leaves the touchy question of the Christmas decorations. ''After all,'' Jane Abell Coon observed, ''we'll each want a Christmas tree in our residence.''\nIt has been like this ever since Jane and Carleton Coon decided to split up, in a manner of speaking. ''Will the dogs be happier in Katmandu?'' they ask each other. ''Can one grow tomatoes in Dacca? Can a good marriage withstand having two Ambassadors in the family?'' New Living Arrangements\nIt is not the Coons' marriage that is breaking up these days, just their living arrangements. In a few weeks Jane Coon is expected to take up her new post as Ambassador in Dacca, Bangladesh. At about the same time Carleton S. Coon Jr. is to assume his assignment as Ambassador in Katmandu, Nepal.\nIf this sounds like an odd way to run a marriage, listen: He: ''One argument is, absence makes the heart grow fonder. It may solidify the relationship. You take each other for granted when you're together all the time. I think it's going to be all right.''\nShe: ''It's not going to be ideal, but I know I'd be awful hard to live with if I was unemployed.'' Even Separate Interviews\nMrs. Coon, who is 52 years old and has short salt-and-pepper hair and the kind of warm, sympathetic smile that makes you want to tell her your life story, talks in her State Department office, where she is Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. Her 54-year-old husband was interviewed by telephone while visiting relatives in New Hampshire in the wake of the death of his father, the noted anthropologist. Together but apart, the Coons told the story of the ultimate two-career family.\nThey are not the first American married couple to serve simultaneously as Ambassadors. Carol C. Laise, a career officer, and her husband, Ellsworth Bunker, did it in the late 1960's; she was assigned to Nepal and he, a political appointee and an Ambassador at Large, was later sent to South Vietnam, which was then at war. But the Coons are the first married career Foreign Service officers to rise together to ambassadorial rank. For a time, it seemed, the State Department did what it could to prevent such an occurrence.\nCarleton Coon Jr., fresh out of Harvard, joined the Foreign Service in 1949 and served in West Germany, Syria, India, Iran, Nepal and Morocco. Jane S. Abell, a Wooster College graduate, appeared to have an equally promising career when she joined the service in 1951, serving in Pakistan and India. A Sharp Change in Direction\nWhen she and Mr. Coon were married in 1968 - they had become friendly while both were assigned to Washington - her career came to a halt. According to State Department regulations then in effect, male Foreign Service officers could marry, but female officers could not. ''When I asked her to marry me, I knew that was the price she would have to pay,'' Mr. Coon said. ''We felt at the time it was a pretty stiff price.''\nSo while Carleton Coon continued his climb up the diplomatic ladder, Jane Coon set about rearing his six children, aged 4 to 16, whose mother had died of cancer in 1967. How did she feel about the sudden, forced shift of focus? ''I found it at least as challenging and rewarding as my Foreign Service career,'' she replied. ''I gained a whole new dimension in terms of interpersonal relations.'' She broke off with a laugh. ''That's a dreadful term,'' she continued. ''But I guess during my career years I had been stretched intellectually. During my child-raising years I grew emotionally.''\nThe experience was an eye-opener in other respects. As a Foreign Service wife, traveling with her husband to posts in Nepal and Morocco, Mrs. Coon noticed that people treated her differently than when she was a political officer. At diplomatic receptions she was shunted off to the ''women's end of the room.'' Instead of being addressed on current issues, she was asked about food and shopping. And a New Batch of Friends\n''One of the things I learned during that time,'' she said, ''was to appreciate my sex more. When I came up competitively in the 1950's and 60's there was a strong tendency to disclaim your own sex and work in a man's world. I began to make good women friends.''\nIn 1976, after the State Department abandoned its policy on marriage, Mrs. Coon rejoined the Foreign Service and moved quickly through the ranks. The post she is leaving, Deputy Assistant Secretary, outranks that of her husband though his longevity has earned him a higher Foreign Service officer rating (F.S.O. 1, $50,000) than hers (F.S.O. 2 at the same salary).\nMr. Coon has served in recent months as liaison to Robert G. Neumann, newly appointed Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, who helped direct the Reagan State Department transition team. When it came time to assign the embassies, the Coons got their wish to go to adjoining countries. While neither Nepal nor Bangladesh is considered in the first rank among diplomatic posts, Bangladesh, an impoverished nation beset by political instability whose President, Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated late last month, is viewed as the more important assignment of the two. Limitations on Shop Talk\nCommunication between the mountaintop (Katmandu) and the river delta (Dacca) perhaps 500 difficult miles away will not be all that easy.\n''When I was in the Foreign Service and Jane wasn't,'' Mr. Coon said, ''I confided in her a great deal and got a lot of useful advice. Then when she was first put on the firing line as country officer for Pakistan, I performed somewhat the same function for her.''\nNow such shop talk will be next to impossible. ''I doubt whether the State Department lines were set up for us regaling each other in extenso with private stories,'' he said. ''It takes about three days to get a call in to Katmandu.'' Said his wife: ''There are a couple of direct flights a week between Dacca and Katmandu. I think it takes about two hours. We hope to get together once a month.''\nNot perfect, they say, but enough to maintain what both agree is a good marriage. ''We're both tremendously engaged in what we're doing,'' Mrs. Coon said.

And East Sixth Street looked upon all this Indian cooking and saw that it was good.\nOr at least plentiful. In this city, which seemingly contains no end of gastronomic surprises, the miniature genesis known as Little India down on Sixth Street in the East Village is singular: 10 restaurants along about 200 feet of the street west of First Avenue, eight of them representing the varied cuisines of India and six of the eight owned and staffed by six brothers.\nSaid Manir Ahmed of himself and his five brothers: ''We wanted to make an Indian street.'' It all began in 1968, when the brothers, all recent immigrants from that portion of what once was India and known successively as East Pakistan and Bangladesh, were living on the Lower East Side, some studying engineering, accounting and business administration at New York University and other colleges in the city, others working at various jobs. ''We found we had no place to eat the way we were used to,'' said Manir Ahmed, 48 years old. Thus it seemed almost heavensent when he noticed that a small Japanese restaurant on East Sixth had a for-sale sign in the window.\n''We bought it for $2,000, everything, the stoves, the tables, the refrigerator, everything,'' he said. ''Actually not for $2,000, for when it came time to pay we could only find $1,800. But the owner accepted it. We had a place to cook our food and to get together every day.''\nThe oldest of the six brothers, Moin, 56, a cook of some knowledge, prepared most of the food, and the brothers would sit around eating their vindaloos and curries and bhunas, chatting, studying and reading.\n''But people kept knocking on the door or walking in thinking we were a restaurant,'' Manir Ahmed went on, ''so we thought that maybe we should open a restaurant.'' Within months Shah Bag opened at 320 East Sixth Street with Manir as proprietor and Moin as first cook. ''Very quickly we made good money cooking for Americans,'' Manir Ahmed said.\nTwo years later the brothers opened Kismoth, at No. 330, splitting its costs among them and installing brother Hasib, 42, as its proprietor. The cooking took a more traditional turn as bay leaf and cardamom and ground ginger began appearing in that chicken-and-rice dish known as biryani. Next came the building at No. 330, which the brothers bought in 1972. Because a tenant, Hiro, a Japanese restaurant, was doing so well they decided to keep it and operate it too. ''For variety,'' according to Manir Ahmed.\nThen in 1976 the Romna, at 322 East Sixth Street, was opened by one of the waiters at Shah Bag. ''We thought it was fine for the street,'' Mr. Ahmed commented. Presumably the brothers thought it would also be fine for the street to have another restaurant, Nishan, in 1978. With help from the family it was opened by Hasib Ahmed, who will be remembered as the brothers' permanent representative at Kismoth. And later that same year Manir Ahmed opened Anar Bagh at No. 338.\nIt did not end there. Because Sawar Jahan, a brother-in-law and a former waiter in Shah Bag, was now in the family, he opened Shamoly, also in 1978, at No. 328 with a little help from his brothers-in-law.\nIn the summer of 1979 an interloper appeared, a waiter from an uptown Indian restaurant, Kashmir, who opened Mitali, an outpost of tandoori chicken, at 334 East Sixth. That was all right with the Ahmed brothers because it added to the Indian Street. To keep in practice the bothers opened Bangladesh last year, at No. 324, and an uncle, Abu Shufian, opened Indian Kitchen at No. 342.\nThe brothers now own three buildings in the line of eight attached old-law tenements, and five of them live above their stores. To supplement the Indian flavors and aromas that emanate from their restaurants they have added brown rice to many of the menus because, Manir Ahmed said, ''it is wanted by some of the introspective people and students in this part of New York.''\nTwo other considerations are present. At 344 East Sixth Street is the Arunachala Ashrama Bhagvan Sri Ramana Maharishi Inc. meditation center, which Manir Ahmed says is ''Eastern and holy.'' Second, the youngest of the brothers, Hobib, 25, after years of being part of the family restaurant operation ''has given up everything to pray.'' It is not that Hobib is connected with the meditation center, Manir Ahemd said, adding: ''It is just that he prays. He cooks a little bit but generally he prays.'' He lives over the store in the brothers' buildings at No. 328 and likes brown rice.\nThe remaining brothers, Saleh, 34, and Malik, 38, have formed an import-export concern, Saleh Ahmed & Company, at Lexington Avenue and 29th Street, through which imported chilis, ginger, garlic, cumin, turmeric, coriander and saffron come to their restaurants and to others and through which oil and chickens and other food travel to such places as Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern Moslem countries.\nThe Indian restaurants along the street, all small and modest affairs with a minimum of decoration, serve meals in the $5 range. They are cooperatives, sharing the cost of imported spices, lending chefs to one another when their own become ill or need days off, and exchanging waiters. They buy their rice jointly by the carload; their parathas and nans and other breads come from bakers on Canal Street. Each morning Manir Ahmed goes to the Bronx Terminal Market and buys fresh vegetables for all. ''We help each other - my brothers, my sister, my brothers-in-law, my sisters-in-law, we all help,'' he said. Eighteen family members are in the business.\n''Once a month,'' Mr. Ahmed said, ''we sit down together in one house. We have dinner and we talk. Who needs money? Whose restaurant is doing well? Whose is not? I am the chairman, and although I give the orders for the family, any brother has the right to overrule me.''\n''If we lend money we lend it free,'' he continued. ''Our help is for each other, free. If a brother goes to another's restaurant no brother is ever charged, nor is a brother's friend. We do not charge brothers for anything. That is our custom.''"}, {"text": "U.S. IS A DISSENTER AS U.N. AGENCY VOTES BABY-FORMULA CODE\n1981-05-21T05:00:00.000Z\nThe United States voted in the World Health Organization today against the adoption of a voluntary code that would ban promotion of infant formulas that could discourage breast feeding.\nThe code was adopted in a committee of the whole of the United Nations agency by 93 votes to 3, with 9 abstentions. The two countries joining the United States in voting against adoption, Chad and Bangladesh, explained that they had cast negative votes to protest an early cutoff of the debate, not to oppose the code itself.\nIn Washington, two officials of the Agency for International Development announced that they were resigning as a protest against the American vote. (Page A10.)\nCode Opposed by Industry\nThe code, which is strongly opposed by the baby-food industry, is basically a set of guidelines that governments are urged to follow to insure the ''protection and promotion of breast-feeding.'' Breastfeeding is described in the code's preamble as an ''unequaled'' way of providing ideal food for infants and a ''unique biological and emotional basis for the health of both mother and child.''\nWhile recognizing the existence of a ''legitimate market'' for substitutes for breast milk, the code says that these should not be marketed in ways that may interfere with breast-feeding.\nAfter the vote, Gerald B. Helman, the United States representative, explained that the ''central basis'' for Washington's opposition was the serious concerns felt over W.H.O.'s ''involvement in commercial codes.''\nThe United States strongly supports breast-feeding, Mr. Helman said, but it nevertheless objects to the code's prescribing a ''rigid set of rules applicable to companies, health workers, and health care system in all parts of the world.''\nThe code is based on a set of principles for the promotion of breast-feeding that was adopted in 1979 at a meeting sponsored by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund, baby food manufacturers and activist supporters of third world causes.\nThe rules that the assembly wants governments to incorporate in their laws or regulations would ban all advertising and direct or indirect promotion of infant formulas as substitutes for breast milk. It also recommends that labels on infant formula containers containiers should not carry photographs of children or a promotional text.\nUnder the resolution adopting the code, governments are asked to monitor its effectiveness. W.H.O.'s director general, Haldan Mahler, is requested to report on compliance to the 1983 assembly.\nThe United States position has been that the passage of laws to comply with such a code would come into conflict with antitrust and other legislation.\nThe International Council of Infant Food Industries, representing 14 Western and Japanese companies with about 85 percent of the market for baby foods in the third world, has similarly complained of the code's lack of ''flexibility''.\nActivists accused the producers of being ''baby killers'' because, they charged, their marketing practices encouraged mothers in the third world to bottle-feed their babies. Many of these mothers were said to be unable to prepare formulas properly, using contaminated water and failing to sterilize the baby bottles,\nWhen introducing the reports of the W.H.O. executive board on the proposed code, Dr. Torbjon Mork of Norway recalled that ''not a single dissenting voice'' was raised when the board approved the text.\nThe board, he said, had decided to propose that the code be adopted in the form of a recommendation to governments rather than in the more binding form of a W.H.O regulation to permit its adoption without delay by consensus.\nDr. Mork stressed that the code does not ban all advertising and promotion of infant formulas but attempts to foster such foods only as a ''suitable partial or total replacement'' for breast-feeding.\nThe assembly, he concluded, was dealing not with an economic issue but with a health issue of importance to children the world over and ''thus to all future generations on our spaceship earth.''"}, {"text": "Answers to Quiz\n1981-06-06T05:00:00.000Z\nQuestions appear on page 13. 1.

Haig Jr. said this afternoon that the conference had ''got off to an extremely auspicious and promising start,'' with concensus among the ministers on several key points. He added that ''the spirit of Cancun can be captured in a phrase that I coined: shared responsibility for mutual benefit.''\nBut while the October meeting is not conceived as a negotiating forum that will produce concrete decisions on crucial development issues, there is still disagreement between the industrialized and developing countries on whether a fixed agenda should be followed and whether a communique should be issued at the end.\nThe developing nations are anxious to extract some commitment from the industrialized powers to advance long-paralyzed economic negotiations, but the United States and Britain, in particular, are insisting on totally informal conversations.\nMr. Haig said a consensus was ''beginning to form'' that the October conference would ''avoid specific agendas, be characterized by open discussions and relieve the heads of state and government of the burden of a final communique.''\nBut the Mexican Foreign Minister said this afternoon that the October conference would focus on four basic areas: food security and agricultural development; trade and industrialization; energy, and monetary and financial questions. He said the conference would end at least with a statement from its chairman, President Jose Lopez Portillo of Mexico.\nPresident Reagan, who was said to have threatened to boycott the conference if President Fidel Castro of Cuba was invited, has so far shown little enthusiasm for the meeting and has repeatedly argued that the priorities for all major industrialized nations must be to put their own economies in order.\nThe developing countries, which vary from such semi-industrialized nations as Brazil, India and Mexico to deeply poor Bangladesh, Tanzania and Guyana, have called for a huge transfer of resources from rich to poor regions of the world.\nAlthough developing nations have long struggled, and failed, to obtain significant economic concessions from the industrialized countries, their position won powerful endorsement last year from a report issued by a special commission on development headed by former Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany, who also conceived the idea of a North-South conference.\nThe political significance of this weekend's talks is that they will establish the link, if any, between the Cancun conference and the continuing talks in the United Nations and other forums on perennial development questions.\nThe developing nations, for example, would like to see Cancun give immediate impetus to the so-called global round of negotiations between rich and poor countries at the United Nations, while the United States and Britain want to avoid taking positions in October that would imply concessions in the global talks at the United Nations.\nAs in the past, the entire debate about relations between industrialized and poor countries is being ignored by the developed countries of the Soviet bloc, which insist that only the ''imperialist'' powers are responsible for the backwardness of their former colonies. The Soviet Union therefore refused to attend. China accepted its invitation.\nThe main political squabble surrounding preparations for Cancun involved Cuba, which, as current chairman of the group of nations calling themselves nonaligned, insisted on its right to participate. But the 11-nation committee organizing the conference eventually went along with the United States and did not invite Mr. Castro.\nThe industrialized nations represented here are West Germany, Austria, Canada, the United States, France, Japan, Britain and Sweden. The developing nations represented are Yugoslavia, China, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, Algeria, the Ivory Coast, Guyana, Tanzania, India and the Philippines.\nAn unlikely setting for a conference on world poverty, this luxurious new resort on Mexico's Caribbean coast was a deserted tropical sandbank a decade"}, {"text": "MAN IN THE NEWS; SUAVE IRAQI AT U.N. HELM\n1981-09-16T05:00:00.000Z\nIsmat Kittani, a sophisticated practitioner of the convoluted diplomacy at the United Nations, grew up as a barefoot boy in a Kurdish mountain village in western Iraq. He never saw an electric light until he was 12 and recalls that he was awed by his visits as a youth to Baghdad.\nToday, the General Assembly's new President is a moon-faced 52-year-old diplomat with a reputation for a suave manner in dress and politics. His victory was due not only to the luck of the draw. The fact that he gained as many votes, 73, as his chief rival, Khwaja Mohammed Kaiser of Bangladesh, was a triumph of individual labor over long odds. Mr. Kittani had to overcome the handicap of representing a nation that last year invaded its neighbor Iran and still regards itself at war with Israel.\nMr. Kittani, fingering his ever-present worry beads, accomplished the task with his customary adroitness. He urged the delegates he met in the corridors, at offices and over meals to vote for Kittani of the United Nations rather than Kittani of Iraq. In 25 years around the glass and concrete complex, he had picked up many chips to cash in.\nHis father farmed an unyielding plot near their home village of Amadiya. ''We were simply poor,'' Mr. Kittani recalled today. But his family urged its sons to study, the Koran to learn Arabic, and English, the language of Iraq's former rulers. The Wonders of Chicago\nAt 17, Mr. Kittani was awarded one of 300 scholarships available to Iraqi youths for study abroad. He chose to go to the United States rather than Britain because, in those early postwar years, ''conditions were better in America.'' The Assembly's new leader, who sometimes muses about retiring in Geneva, enjoys creature comforts.\nAn older brother, studying for a doctorate at the University of California, advised Mr. Kittani to pick a small school and he chose Knox College in Galesburg, Ill.\n'' The first time I saw Chicago it was like leaping forward two or three centuries,'' Mr. Kittani said. Mr. Kittani studied English and taught it in high school after he returned to Iraq. But he had been a ''ferocious reader of newspapers, always interested in what was going on in the world,'' and soon joined Iraq's foreign service.\nThere, he won an essay contest sponsored by the United Nations that earned him a month at the New York headquarters. He was fascinated by both the city and the organization and arranged his subsequent careerto have only one other foreign posting, in Cairo. Tough Task in Pakistan\nAfter seven years with the Iraqi delegation to the United Nations, the last three as mission chief, Mr. Kittani joined the Secretariat, the organization's bureaucracy, where he worked his way up to Assistant Secretary General. In 1970, he was handed his trickiest assignment. Pakistan was then cracking down on dissent in its east region, Bangladesh today. The United Nations was urged to send a relief mission to Dacca, chiefly to discourage the repression.\nMr. Kittani worked on Pakistan's President, Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan, who first refused the United Nations mission. But the Iraqi's bargaining skill succeeded and the United Nations team was allowed in. The next year, the east wing gained its independence.\nA new Secretary General, Kurt Waldheim, chose Mr. Kittani to head his private office. There he served as Mr. Waldheim's ''ears and eyes on what is going on'' in the national delegations. He built a web of friendships that paid off in today's election.\nMr. Kittani went back to Iraq's foreign service in 1976 and became one of four under secretaries, charged with looking after his country's affairs in international organizations. In Baghdad, he lives with his sister. Mr. Kittani is divorced and his former wife, Hala, works here for the United Nations Children's Fund. They have a 14-year-old son.\nMr. Kittani, whose nation is rigidly opposed to Israel, must preside over an Assembly that will consider a host of anti-Israel resolutions, including one denouncing Israel for its attack on Iraq's nuclear reactor. But the Iraqi envoy contended that he could be an impartial chairman.\n''Why should I step down?'' he said. ''I and my Government fully recognize my capacity as President of the General Assembly and my capacity as representative of Iraq.''\nDebate over Iraq's war with Iran may take place, but Mr. Kittani has no intention of leaving the chair. ''I'll give the floor to anyone who wants to speak. I'm not shaking in my boots when this is discu ssed.''"}, {"text": "INDIA'S ROPE TRICK: PRESERVING U.S. TIES\n1981-09-13T05:00:00.000Z\nAs the global perceptions and strategic concerns of India and the United States grow farther and farther apart, officials of both countries are trying to keep the deterioration from undermining a wide range of economic, cultural and scientific links.\nThere is little doubt that in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Reagan Administration's tough stance toward Moscow, India and the United States are looking at the world very differently. But the two countries retain considerable importance for each other. The United States is India's largest trading partner, with trade this year approaching $3 billion. The Indian Government is encouraging productivity in the private sector and joint ventures with American concerns are booming. Furthermore, virtually every family within the Indian elite has relatives in the United States, where 333,000 residents of Indian descent earn the highest per capita income of any ethnic group. More Indian students are studying in the United States than in any other foreign country.\nThe conflict and challenge of juggling relations was put succinctly last week by Archer K. Blood, the outgoing American charge d'affairs in New Delhi. Speaking to United States residents, he appealed for a tolerant approach, saying that the embassy would have to ''try to insulate'' the web of mutually valued relations ''from the effects of our current differences on the geopolitical plane.'' Indian and American diplomats agree that differences are sharpening over such issues as India's tolerance of Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and its recognition of the Vietnamese-supported Government in Cambodia. Mr. Blood noted that the divergence derived largely from the state of relations between Washington and Moscow. ''When U.S.-Soviet relations are reasonably good, our relations with India are bound to be good,'' the diplomat said, adding that conversely, because of the current tensions between the superpowers, ''there was bound to be a spillover effect on our relations with India.''\nMrs. Gandhi Snubbed Moscow\nMr. Blood, the senior American diplomat here, said this equation did not mean that India was under Moscow's domination. He noted that the ''recent noncelebration of the Indo-Soviet friendship treaty showed that Mrs. (Indira) Gandhi's Government is determined to maintain somewhat of a distance between itself and the Soviet Union.'' Two weeks ago, Prime Minister Gandhi let it be known that she was too busy to go to Moscow to commemorate the signing of the treaty in 1971.\nThe diverging perceptions in New Delhi and Washington have been shaped by the difference in their respective roles. India, as Mr. Blood said, is essentially a regional power while the United States has global concerns and responsibilities. While the United States regards the Soviet Union as its main rival, India views the Russians as steady friends who have provided crucial support during its wars with China and Pakistan. Other Western diplomats noted that the Reagan Administration had decided to supply arms to Pakistan largely out of global strategic considerations, while in New Delhi, the arms sale was viewed in terms of its effect on the regional military balance.\nMr. Blood spoke a week after India's decision to bar an American diplomat was disclosed in Washington. The State Department said George G. B. Griffin, who was to have become a political counselor in New Delhi, had been the target of a Soviet ''disinformation'' campaign that identified him as a spy. India said, however, the decision stemmed from Mr. Griffin's activities as an envoy in Calcutt a at t he time of the Bangladesh war. Indian officials described the Griffin incident as unfortunate. One said he was surprised the matter was made public by Washington and noted that at least three S oviet diplomats have been similarly barred from India inthe past 18 m onths.\nIn an attempt to accent positive relations, a senior Indian Foreign Ministry official echoed many of Mr. Blood's remarks. He said the Gandhi Government hoped to refrain from rhetorical escalation of the differences, and also cited Mrs. Gandhi's refusal to accept an invitation to Moscow. A second gesture, he said, was the virtual abandonment of public condemnations of United States military activity in the Indian Ocean. The official said that India was even willing to liquidate a 30-year agreement on United States deliveries of nuclear fuel to an atomic power plant rather than permit Congressional blockage of the deliveries (because of India's refusal to sign the nonproliferation treaty) to poison relations. The agreement is virtually dead and the Indians say they would like to bury it as gracefully as possible.\nGovernment spokesmen have also gone out of their way to squelch charges by Indian leftist journals that the United States was seeking to impose painful conditions for a record $5.68 billion loan to India by the International Monetary Fund. Officials in the Indian Finance Ministry have said that the United States has not insisted on devaluation of the rupee as it has in previous applications. Also, the Indians said Washing ton had not invoked i ts traditional objections to alloting funds to finance energ y development in the third world.\nA number of Indian commentators, some close to the Government, are advocating a grin-and-bear-it response to what they regard as a dismissive attitude toward India by the Reagan Administration. Several noted that India does not have the power to challenge the United States directly and said no purpose would be served by raising temperatures. A corollary was offered by an Asian diplomat who said that it would be fruitless for India to attack the United States for supplying arms to Pakistan, but ''pressuring Pakistan about receiving arms, that is something else again.''"}, {"text": "Foreign Affairs; THE POOREST OF THE POOR\n1981-09-04T05:00:00.000Z\nThe way development problems have evolved and perceptions changed in the last decade is reflected in the current United Nations conference here.\nIt is focused on deve lopment dropouts. They are the 31 ''poorest ofthe poor'' co untries, measured by per-capita income, illiteracy and local product ion.\nTheir total population is 268 million, more than the U.S. But except for Bangladesh and Ethiopia, only five come near the population of New York State and the rest have fewer people each than Philadelphia. Many are landlocked, with little strategic or economic importance, which helps explain why they've been largely overlooked in the scramble for material progress.\nThe poorest could not absorb large investments even if they were available. Impressive evidence has accumulated to show that just keeping them alive with food handouts actual l y makes them worse off.\nSo some new approaches to the poignant and dangerous human problem are emerging. In many ways they parallel the lessons of welfare in industrial countries. Just sharing out existing wealth doesn't help much or do lasting good. Sharing the capacity to produce wealth is the key, and that is immensely more complex than the dole.\nThe emphasis here is on collecting seed money to help the poorest work out development strategies so they can use better and waste less of what is available. That means organizing their own planning and economic institutions to request and spend aid.\nThe obstacles aren't all of their own making, nor only due to smug selfishness among the rich. Political and bureaucratic vested interests have grown with the very idea of aid to the poor, and they tend to block the way.\nRobert McNamara, near the end of his long and dedicated leadership of the World Bank, firmly concluded that the ''trickle-down'' theory of putting money into big projects because it would eventually spread around was all wrong. He found best results came from helping farmers, improving health and educating women - crucial to containing the population explosion.\nBut the tremendous international bureaucracy that makes big projects doesn't like cutting back on administration or giving more responsibility to clients. It needs to be pushed.\nAs a metaphor for recognizing enlightened self-interest by creating purchasing power in potential markets, a Marshall Plan for the third world makes sense. However, most of the conditions that made postwar U.S. aid to Europe desirable don't exist.\nBut one Marshall Plan idea can help the fragmented, disorganized world that remains from the rubble of empires: it is the test of mutual contribution. If each European country had spent the money on its own most pressing needs, most of it would probably have gone for housing and transport.\nInstead, a requirement of cooperation brought an emphasis on German coal, which got French steel mills working, and so on, multiplying the effect and stimulating trade. Finicky pride of sovereignty makes this harder in the third world, but more regional schemes are urgent. Northern Nigeria, for example, could make up all of West Africa's food deficit if oil-rich Nigeria weren't plunging so hard for big industry.\nU.S. policy now is to make the test more political, reinforcing rivalries among states. In his speech on Africa last week, Assistant Secretary of State\nChester Crocker said American aid would be ''targeted where our interests are most clearly manifest and focused more to produce policy changes of broad and lasting impact.''\nAnother block to more effective aid comes from a combination of farm politics and simple charity. Food production per person has dropped in 60 developing countries in the last decade, and in many of these it has gone down absolutely.\nThere has been too much reliance on food aid, too little incentive to grow more. That spells disaster ahead, both for poor countries and eventually for the U.S., which is being stimulated to draw down its water and soil resources to swell food exports.\nAlain Vidal-Naquet, senior adviser to the head of the World Food Council, points out that many millions of refugees, Afghans in Pakistan, Cambodians in Thailand, Somalis and others are learning to live on aid and may never go back to working the land.\nBut where production has been stressed there have been some startling improvements. India became a net grain exporter in l979 with a stockage system to insure against recurring famines. That's a near miracle, provoked when food aid dwindled and techniques were improved.\nCompassion requires large doses of direct help at times. But it is becoming ever clearer that the medieval idea of charity to earn grace or dispel guilt, and the mercantile idea of exporting as much produce as possible, won't ease the problems of the poorest. The emphasis must be more and more precisely on helping people to help themselves and assuring more stable prices for the fruits of labor w hen they do."}, {"text": "DEMAND OUTPACES WORLD FOOD SUPPLY; A World to Feed:; First article of a series appearing from time to time.\n1981-08-16T05:00:00.000Z\nThe world food situation is like a basket half empty, half full. On the bountiful side, for the last three decades global food production has steadily increased, slightly outstripping population growth and enabling more people to eat better than at any time in history.\nThis year, world grain production is expected to set historic records, permitting some rebuilding of world food stockpiles. India, once written off as a hopeless case, has almost tripled its food production in the last 30 years. Laborers in the Soviet Union expect a regular portion of meat, and Chinese peasants no longer fear the killing famines that in the past have swept over the land. 500 Million Suffer Malnutrition\nDespite the real progress, however, there are still more hungry people in the world than ever before - both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of total world population. The rising cost of food has contributed to this situation.\nBy most estimates, more than 500 million people - roughly one out of every nine - suffer from serious malnutrition today, compared with 100 million to 200 million - one out of every 14 to 25 people - in the 1950's. Mismanagement Adds to Woes\nRefugee camps are still filled with wide-eyed children with swollen bellies. Millions of malnourished adults in Asia and Africa are still doomed to live and work far below their normal capabilities. And even in relatively prosperous countries such as Poland, economic mismanagement has produced shortages of food so severe that the population has taken to the streets.\nThe coexistence of bounty and want is, in short, as stark as it ever was. The reason is that food production has not kept up with rising incomes around the world and those income gains are not being equitably distributed.\nAs more countries - particularly the rapidly developing middleincome countries - and wealthier people in those countries gain in purchasing power, they consume more food. This in turn puts pressure on food prices, and means that poorer people everywhere have a harder time buying enough to eat.\n''There has been significant progress in a few developing countries,'' John Mellor, head of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, said in a recent interview. ''But the gains do mean that the poorest people will be worse off. It's a good development, but it is increasing inequalities.'' 'Ghost of Malthus Not Buried'\n''The ghost of Malthus,'' as Shahid J. Burki of the World Bank recently put it, ''is not buried yet.'' But the fact remains that the doomsday theorists who warned only a few years ago that a ''human tidal wave'' would swamp the world's capacity to produce food have so far been proved wrong. Between 1960 and 1980, thanks to the Green Revolution's new seeds and fertilizers, global corn and wheat yields have jumped by 50 percent, and rice yields by 30 percent.\nAs a result, by the late 1970's global per-capita food consumption had increased to 108 percent of the minimum essential for good health, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, compared with slightly below 100 percent in the early 1950's. Many Uncertainties Remain\nWhat are the chances of extending these gains, and more important, of translating them into food for the millions with empty stomachs? Will the 1980's bring a more secure world food system and more equal distribution of food, or a recurrence of the periodic shortages, price instabilities and inequities of the 1970's?\nThe answers to these questions are as uncertain as the weather. But most international food experts agree that in the next decade the world will be entering a new era, characterized more by food shortages than food surpluses, by widely fluctuating prices, and by a steadily widening gap between those who have plenty and those who go hungry. At worst, a disaster to dwarf the food crisis of 1973-74 is seen as a possibility.\nA number of new stresses on the world food system are responsible for the insecurities that lie ahead. The most important structural changes are these:\n- Agricultural productivity in the United States seems to be leveling off, and idle cropland in this country has virtually disappeared. Because the United States now supplies more than half of the grain in world trade, this could mean less food available in the future for deficit countries.\n- The United States may also be forced to curtail its food exports because of accelerating soil erosion and the pressure of foreign demand on domestic food prices. Some experts, such as Walter P. Falcon, director of Stanford University's Food Research Center, believe that ''the 1980's will almost surely see a reduction in the rate of growth of export supplies from the United States.''\n- Even if exports of food from North America could continue expanding indefinitely, many believe that the very dependence of the rest of the world on a single region is a danger. According to the World Bank's Mr. Burki, if a drop of more than 10 percent in the North American grain crop coincided with a shortfall somewhere else, the result would be ''disaster.''\n- World food prices now rise much faster in times of scarcity, because of the spreading tendency of food-importing countries, notably Japan, the European Economic Community and the Soviet Union, to keep their domestic grain prices fixed. This means that, even when global food supplies shrink, consumers in these countries can continue to purchase the same amount of food and producers have no incentives to hold stocks or increase production. As a result, supplies do not adjust, international prices go higher than they would otherwise and the poorest food importers suffer.\n- The improvement in living standards and the growing demand for food around the world have put pressure on food prices, making it harder for the poorest countries to import their food needs. Many Eating More Meat\nRapidly developing, middle-income countries such as Mexico, South Korea and Thailand are eating more meat than ever before. The Eastern European bloc - with the exception of hard-pressed Poland - has decided to maintain levels of food consumption through good years and bad. And the Middle East oil producers have adopted Western diets with abandon, increasing their food imports from 3.1 million metric tons, valued at $350 million, in 1970 to 15 million tons, valued at $3 billion, in 1980.\nBehind these new consumers looms the enormous shadow of China. Its food imports tripled in the period from 1961 to 1977 and are still growing. In all, these purchasers are putting great pressures on the international grain markets and, consequently, on prices.\nAs a result of these trends, world grain prices are increasingly unstable. In the 1970's, world wheat price fluctuations were more than seven times greater than in the 1960's, and swings in rice prices were more than twice as extreme. Virtually all the authorities expect prices in the 1980's to be even more unpredictable, adding to the insecurity of the poor importing countries and of food producers and consumers in the United States, one of the few countries that allows international grain prices to be fully reflected in its domestic market.\nSince the World Food Conference in 1974, a major goal of the antihunger movement has been the establishment of an international wheat reserve system to stabilize prices, so that poor countries could be assured of affording food imports in cases of emergency. But negotiations on a global grain reserve were adjourned without success in 1979, and the prospects for such a system being established now appear to be nil. A Modest Wheat Reserve\nIn late 1980, the United States did act to guarantee that a modest Government-held wheat reserve of 4 million metric tons would be established to backstop shipments of food aid in cases of severe food shortages. The United States is also committed to a minimum annual level of 4.47 million tons of food aid under the Food Aid Convention of 1980, which guarantees that at least 7.6 million tons of food aid a year will be available from exporting countries as aid.\nCurrent food aid levels are about 9 million tons a year, of which about 6 million tons are from the United States. That amount is negligible compared with the needs of the food-deficit areas, however. According to the F.A.O., 72 low-income, developing countries received some 8.1 million tons of food aid in 1980, compared with import requirements of some 17.7 million tons of wheat, 4.6 million tons of coarse grain, and 4.8 million tons of rice over the 1980-81 crop year.\nThe poorest countries will obviously have to go into the commercial markets to cover their food deficits. To enable them to afford emergency purchases, the International Monetary Fund recently established a criterion for lending that would enable poorer countries to receive additional financing from the fund when their food imports rose above a base level. This could make an additional $500 million to $700 million available to food-short countries.\nTo keep such an influx of funds from pushing prices even higher, and to guarantee that the poorest countries would have access to grain purchases in tight periods, several international food groups, including the F.A.O., the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food Council, have proposed an international food security reserve. A 9- to 18-Million-Ton Reserve\nThe reserve, which could be from 9 to 18 million tons in size, would assure developing countries that they would not be squeezed out of the world food market if prices skyrocket during a shortage. Grain exporters would promise to make available to the poorest countries in times of scarcity an amount of wheat based on their normal commercial import purchases. The sales would be at roughly commercial rates, although a ceiling on the price, based on long-term market trends, would be set.\nOver the longer run, however, the only real world food security is an increase in food production in the deficit countries. The World Food Council, a United Nations policy group set up in 1974 to monitor international food security, is working with some 50 developing countries to establish national food plans.\nFood experts agree that greatly increased investment in technical assistance, irrigation networks and agricultural research will be necessary in the coming decades if the world is ever to achieve freedom from hunger. The World Bank, the chief international lending agency for such projects, is now putting 30 percent of its resources into agriculture, 80 percent of which is going directly into food production. The $1 billion International Fund for Agricultural Development, based in Rome and heavily financed by the Arab oil producers, is also devoting all of its resources to agricultural development.\nThese investments are only a drop in the bucket compared with the world's need, however. World Bank calculations indicate that an investment of $600 billion in developing countries, largely in expensive irrigation systems, will be required over the next 10 years just to maintain food supplies at present levels of hunger.\nNo one is sure where that vast sum will be coming from, or whether the agricultural development that is necessary will be accomplished before the next poor harvest years.\n''Say the economic policies in the United States don't work, and we get heavy inflation here, and then a bad crop year or two,'' Mr. Mellor of the International Food Policy Research Institute speculated recently. ''Food prices here soar, and the Government decides to slap on an export embargo, sending global food prices through the roof. What would a Tanzania or a Bangladesh - which already spends 80 percent of its export earnings on food imports - do then? That's the disaster scenario, and it's a perfectly possible eventuality.''\nNext: The human cost of worldwide malnutrition."}, {"text": "News Summary; TUESDAY, JUNE 2, 1981\n1981-06-02T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational The end of a revolt in Bangladesh was confirmed 48 hours after the attempted coup had begun.

Padmanabha, the census commissioner, said that more than one and a quarter million people, most of them schoolteachers and civil servants, were being used to count the people in India, where large numbers are registered in groups called ''lakhs'' and ''crores.'' A lakh is 100,000 and a crore is 10 million.\nCounting Sidewalk Dwellers\nTo underscore how much work is involved, Mr. Padmanabha said 75 census workers had been assigned to count the sidewalk dwellers in the area of the Sealdah railroad station in Calcutta.\nThe homeless in the cities are only one of the problems that face the census workers. There are thousands of Indian villages that are reachable only by ox cart or foot, and many require a long journey. But following procedures established during British rule, census takers hike to every settlement to seek information that, in addition to numbers of people, includes such topics as fertility and reproduction rates, religion, caste membership, employment and earnings.\nThe first census was taken in 1872 and, despite wars, famines, riots, epidemics and partition, new tabulations have followed every 10 years. In the original census, which included areas that are now Pakistan and Bangladesh, more than 206 million people were counted.\nBy 1947, when India gained independence, the combined population of India and Pakistan had grown to 320 million. Since then the population has surged, virtually doubling in the last 30 years as the death rate dropped from 28 per thousand people 30 years ago to less than 16 now. The birth rate, meanwhile, has remained at around 40 per thousand. Last Total: 548 Million\nThe last census, taken in 1971, showed a population of 548 million. Demographers have predicted that the current count will reach 665 million, though several economists have said that the figure might exceed 700 million.\nThe counting is done by physical check, and the goal is to have every person in India counted by visits to households. The reports will be fed into computers, and the preliminary findings are expected within a month.\nThe full census report will be issued in successive volumes by the Registrar General of India. The data will provide, among other things, source material for economic planners. If the population exceeds expectations by even 5 percent, it will require a major revision in a new $120 billion, five-year plan intended to generate jobs and provide food, housing, drinking water, power and essential needs for the poor."}, {"text": "ARCHITECTURE: ASIA SOCIETY BUILDING, A DESIGN FULL OF CIVILIZED\n1981-04-11T05:00:00.000Z\nINTENTIONS By PAUL GOLDBERGER\nIt may well be that no large, elaborate and expensive institutional building put up in New York in recent times has proceeded as swiftly and smoothly as the headquarters of the Asia Society, which will be dedicated at noon Tuesday. The society broke ground 17 months ago at the corner of Park Avenue and East 70th Street, and the $16.6 million eight-story museum, office and conference building, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, is nearly complete. More unusual still in these trying times for construction, it has come in within its budget.\nWhat the $16.6 million and rapid scheduling has bought is a more complex story. This is an ambitious building, full of civilized intentions, some of which succeed and others that do not. Curiously, the building is weakest where it tries the hardest - in its exterior of red Oklahoma granite, where it struggles to put on a graceful and proud public face and ends up looking more than a slight bit confused.\nFirst, then, a word about the exterior. The site is one of Park Avenue's finest, at the crest of Lenox Hill and amid distinguished apartment buildings and fine town houses; until the society purchased it, it was occupied by the old Milliken house and its neighboring brownstones. Mr. Barnes's desire was to respect the traditions of the avenue by building a strong facade, a straight front of masonry that would continue the even line of masonry buildings that make Park Avenue such a powerful urban corridor.\nThus, the building altogether rightly fills its entire site all along its Park Avenue frontage; on 70th Street, however, where its architectural colleagues are not large apartment buildings but small town houses, the new structure is set back, to blend easily into the smaller scale of the side street. As it sets back in steps, the space it leaves free is given over to a terraced garden, which helps even more to tie this building gently to the block of town houses.\nThe problem comes not with this overall building shape, which is admirable, but with Mr. Barnes's attempt to give the building a vaguely Asian air through the use of reddish granite finished in two tones, a semicircular window at the top of the facade and another semicircular window on the side, facing 70th Street. The facade changes color frequently - the granite is highly polished at the base, left in a rough finish for most of the middle floors, and then polished again at the top and for certain vertical sections.\nIt all creates a lot of visual activity, yet somehow, despite everything that is going on, this facade is really not a little dull. Part of the problem is the large single-paned windows in the office floors, which can make any lively building go flat. But there is also something not quite right with those semicircular windows, which do not seem to fit naturally - they come off as slightly jarring, as if drawn on in a hasty gesture to enliven the facade.\nHow different these arches are from, say, the great, generous arches of Louis Kahn's capital buildings in Dacca, Bangladesh, or of his structures at Ahmedabad, India. Arches are like entrances into caves; we should feel as if we were burrowing into a deep volume, but at the Asia Society. we feel more as if we are looking at paper cutouts.\nBut all can be forgiven once inside the portals. Mr. Barnes is among the most distinguished museum architects in the nation - he has designed the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Scaife Gallery in Pittsburgh, among others - and for his first major New York museum he has produced a set of handsome interiors. Most exciting, surprisingly, is the very first room each visitor will encounter, an entry that is at once gracious and monumental, a combination vestibule-lobby-gallery that is pleasing as pure space in itself and absolutely suited to the functional demands of this complex building's program.\nThe room must serve as an entrance to the society's public galleries, to its offices and bookstore, to its meeting and conference rooms, and to its new and well-equipped basement auditorium. The use of a single entrance to fulfill all these functions was intended as a deliberate symbol of the society's desire to integrate its various programs; it was desired that gallerygoers and research scholars meet and mingle, and here they will.\nThe room is long and fairly narrow, with a two-story-high barrel vault, which is to say the ceiling is completely rounded. The room runs for the full frontage of the building along Park Avenue, with its south end, on 70th Street, filled by one of the big semicircular windows. We enter this space on its side, an unusual architectural experience in itself - most of us think of barrel vaults as tunnels that we enter only at the end. But here we burst into it unexpectedly; the ceiling swoops up around us, and to the right, a stair of sandstone glides up to a second-floor balcony with a rounded front, which projects into this unusual space like a tongue.\nThe building will not be absolutely finished for another few weeks, and the society's collection of Asian art, most of which is a gift of John D. Rockefeller 3d, will not be installed until the last scaffolding has been folded away. So it is impossible to make final judgments at this point about the building's success as a place for exhibitions.\nBut it is hard to imagine that this main entry hall, which will contain Asian sculpture, will not work superbly. There will be a number of pieces of sculpture on the sandstone floor right near the entry, and others will be upstairs on the second-level balcony, which will be known as the Arthur Ross Gallery. Those pieces will have a particularly unusual setting - on the second floor of this space, there is no straight wall; the curve of the barrel vault functions as both wall and ceiling. Sculpture, thus, will be seen against the curve of the vault, which should produce an almost mystical sense of uncertain depth.\nFrom this balcony, visitors can move out to the building's garden terrace, set one level above 70th Street. This is a superb urban courtyard - the landscape by the architects Zion & Breen's design will include sycamore trees and a fountain, and there are relaxing and intimate views of one of the city's most gracious town-house blocks.\nBack inside, there are other, more conventional, galleries - a large rectangular room on the second floor for the permanent display of the Rockefeller collection and a similar space, the Starr Gallery, on the ground level for traveling exhibitions. The total exhibition space is 7,000 square feet - a vast increase over the 1,700 feet in the old Asia Society on East 64th Street, but still little enough to maintain the feeling of intimacy that has always made the Asia Society a special kind of museum.\nThe upper floors of the building will contain offices for the society's programs, to be designed by Tod Williams, and an elaborate conference center on the eighth floor. They give every indication of being pleasing, not to mention elegant, places in which to work. The immense semicircular arched window that dominates the Park Avenue facade lights the main room of the conference center."}, {"text": "PARTIES ARE SERIOUS BUSINESS AT FINANCIAL BAZAAR\n1981-09-28T05:00:00.000Z\nThe money men are displaying their wares in Washington this week as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank hold their 36th annual joint meeting.\nMore than 13,000 financiers, private-sector bankers and economic and finance ministers from around the world streamed into the capital over the last few days for the four-day meeting that officially begins tomorrow at the Sheraton Washington hotel. It is an enormous money bazaar, a time of meeting and greeting, of fence mending and cajoling, of talking shop and renewing business and Congressional ties. And much of it takes place at the breakfasts, the luncheons, the dinner parties and the dozens of receptions and cocktail parties that are scheduled all over town.\nCeremonial Occasions\n''The bulk of the work - I sometimes think all of the work- is done outside the conference halls, in the corridors and in the evenings over dinner,'' said Sir Rabindrah Ghurburrun, a Governor of the World Bank and Minister for Economic Planning for Mauritius. ''The formal sessions and the speeches are often ceremonial.'' Sir Ghurburrun is lunching later this week with the vice president of the Bank of America, he said, ''to discuss loans for rural development.''\n''The conversations that take place at the parties and dinner parties are more fruitful because they are free from restraints and inhibitions,'' said M. Saifur Rahman, Finance Minister of Bangladesh. Barbecue, Brunch and Dinners\nToday Bankers Trust entertained more than 200 people at a country barbecue at Prospect House, the Georgetown home it has leased for the week. Chemical Bank of New York had a dinner for 30, serving seafood and roast leg of lamb in the upstairs parlor of the historic Decatur House. Chase Manhattan offered brunch on a cruise down the Potomac.And Thomas R. Wilcox, chairman of the board of the Crocker National Bank of San Francisco, was host to 170 at dinner under a pink tent in the garden of the Woodrow Wilson House, a national trust property.\nHarriet Schwartz of Washington Whirl-Around, a conference-@ and party-planning concern, has 39 clients who are entertaining this week. ''They all want to outdo each other and offer something special and different,'' she said. ''Last year we did a 1920's party and two barbecues, this year we are doing a couple of Thanksgiving dinners. One year a German bank held an Octoberfest on the Mall with German beers and wurst.''\n''The personal contact is very important,'' said James E. Humphries of the monetary fund's conference office. ''The private banks are invited to attend the meeting as special guests because they cofinance man y of our projects and they help sell bonds issued by thebank. It's an opportunity for a David Rockefeller to sit down and talk informal ly about deficit financing or private investment with finance minis ters from third world countries.'' Preparations for 1982\n''They are working sessions,'' Mrs. Schwartz said of the parties. ''You can move the chairman of the board and the head of your international division into a leased home and entertain there.'' She has already traveled to Toronto to line up private homes for her clients for the 1982 meeting. And it is all very private. None of Mrs. Schwartz's clients would give details or permit photographs.\n''These people are very sensitive right now,'' she explained, alluding to Washington's general uneasiness with ostentatious displays.\nThat was reflected in the response to a query about what food would be served to the 1,000 guests who will gather in the East Wing of the National Gallery Thursday evening at the five-hour reception planned by the Republic National Bank of New York.\n''I don't know that we want to share our menu with the public,'' said Kathleen Rizek, an investor relations officer with the bank."}, {"text": "The World; THE POOR NEED A LOT MORE THAN GOOD WILL\n1981-08-02T05:00:00.000Z\ndeveloped.'' At the same time, the economic relationship between these nations and those of the industrialized West - between the South and the North, as they are styled today - has steadily deteriorated.\nThe South is now launching its most ambitious effort to obtain concessions from the North to help it climb out of its chronic poverty. This weekend in the Mexican resort of Cancun, foreign ministers from 22 developing and industrialized nations, including Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., are meeting to prepare an unprecedented summit conference of their leaders here in late October.\nBut the mood is not alive with optimism. For those who dare look back, the road to Cancun is littered with exhausted rhetoric, broken pledges and failed strategies. Governments in the industrialized world seem more worried about their own economic troubles and less committed to foreign aid than at any time in recent memory.\nWhat hope is there, then, that a genuine North-South dialogue can at last replace the monologues that have droned on interminably and futilely in assorted international forums? Such is the crisis facing the third world - hunger, disease and illiteracy increasingly compounded by huge debts and trade deficits - that a select group of key leaders has agreed to try to break the stalemate.\nThe inspiration for the Cancun meeting came from a sobering report issued last year by an 18-member commission on international development issues headed by the former West German Chancellor, Willy Brandt. The report not only warned of the danger of mass starvation in the third world unless a ''program for survival'' was adopted, but also called for a meeting of government heads ''to enable initiatives and concessions to be thrashed out with candor and boldness.''\nThe idea, quickly picked up by Mexico and Austria, was that representative world leaders should meet for two days in as informal a setting as possible, without press coverage or set speeches, in the hope of creating the momentum and good will that would permit negotiations to advance.\nEven before substantive questions could be analyzed, however, an 11-nation preparatory committee formed by Mexico and Austria faced the problem of deciding who should attend. President Reagan, for example, indicated that he would not participate if Fidel Castro did, so Cuba was not invited. The Soviet Union and China were invited, but while China accepted in the category of a developing nation, Moscow reiterated that underdevelopment was the fault of the ''imperialist'' powers and refused to come. In the end, eight industrialized and 14 developing nations were chosen.\nThe cosponsors were not only anxious to keep East-West tensions from short-circuiting the North-South debate but to have participants come with open minds, not with predetermined bloc positions. After the North's seven top leaders discussed development issues in Ottawa last month, however, the South's foreign ministers decided to hold their own preliminary meeting in New York last week. Although the Reagan Administration wants to avoid even the suggestion of an agenda, apparently fearing that a precedent of ''linkage'' will be established between various development issues, the South's foreign ministers last week accepted a Mexican proposal identifying five basic areas for discussion:\n* Cooperation. The South would like developed nations to commit themselves to providing foreign aid equivalent to 0.7 percent of their gross national product by 1985, and 1.0 percent by the year 2000, with an increasing share of the aid channeled through such multilateral institutions as the World Bank. But there is resistance to this idea. In the United States, where foreign aid's share of G.N.P. has shrunk from 0.60 percent in 1961 to 0.27 percent last year, less than 20 percent of economic assistance is multilateral, while half of all bilateral aid goes to Israel and Egypt. In contrast, Northern European countries such as Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands already give almost 1.0 percent of their G.N.P.\n* Trade. The third world's share of international trade has fallen steadily over the past 30 years as commodity prices have failed to keep up with those for manufactured goods. The South seeks mechanisms to secure the value of their commodity exports as well as greater access to developed markets. The protectionism of industrialized countries, however, is often greatest where laborintensive and agricultural products are involved.\n* Food. Between 40 million and 500 million people, most of them in the poorest countries of Africa and Asia, are believed to suffer from chronic hunger. The South wants the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to create a system of food reserves based upon agreed, rather than voluntary, contributions and it favors approval by the International Monetary Fund of a compensating financial facility for food imports.\n* Energy. The rise in oil prices over the past eight years has had a devastating effect on the non-oil producers among developing nations. The South is therefore seeking aid to develop alternative sources of energy, but it is also urging greater conservation by industrialized countries that currently consume 75 percent of world energy.\n* Monetary and financial questions. The South's external debt is estimated at $500 billion and $44.2 billion was spent in 1979 just to service the debt. Developing countries argue that only a massive transfer of resources - the Brandt commission suggested between $50 billion and $60 billion annually by 1985 - can enable their economies to grow steadily. The South also seeks a greater voice in managing the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other such bodies.\nSuch is the complexity of the issues, however, that even within the traditional North and South blocs there are widely differing positions. Among those represented at Cancun, for example, Canada, Sweden, Austria and France favor reforms in the world economic structure to assist poor nations, while the United States and Britain insist that priority be given to strengthening the industrialized economies. In the third world camp, the problems of such middleincome nations as India and Brazil are also dramatically different from those of, say, Tanzania and Bangladesh. An even greater gulf exists between oil-exporting and importing nations.\nThe challenge facing the presidents and prime ministers in October is as great as the implications of failure to make progress. ''It is not enough to sit around tables talking like characters in Chekhov plays about insoluble problems,'' the Brandt report noted. ''We have to lift ourselves above the immediate constrictions and offer the world a plan and a vision of hope without which nothing substantial can be achieved.''"}, {"text": "A NEW ECONOMIC ORDER IS THE FOCUS AT CANCUN\n1981-10-21T05:00:00.000Z\nLeaders of 22 nations are flying here for a meeting that its organizers hope will ultimately redesign the world economy to favor developing nations.\nPresident Reagan and the others gathering at this Caribbean resort have decided in advance that they will make no hard decisions to reshape the way the world conducts business. But the 14 countries grouped as the developing south and their northern industrial supporters, notably Canada and France, hope that the two-day gathering will end with an understanding to open negotiations under United Nations auspices. Their goal is to assign control of the array of measures sought by poorer nations to a body in which each country would have one vote.\nIn effect, such a body could overrule actions taken by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. All these institutions are now controlled by the United States and the other industrialized nations. Inroads Resisted by West\nThe United States, Britain and West Germany have strongly resisted any inroads on the power of these world economic bodies. The trio of Western nations contends that the world institutions that aid nations with balance-of-payments problems, provide loans for development and fix trade rules are capable of change and must not be subjected to the veto of a body like the United Nations.\nBut the poorer countries, and some rich ones like Saudi Arabia, argue that the world economy is so heavily against them that a new bargaining forum must be found.\nMr. Reagan, urging free trade and free enterprise as the key to development, is the real target of this meeting. Most of the others hope to have persuaded him to accept some form of global bargaining by the time the meeting ends Friday. Until now, however, he has given no sign that he will accept anything more than a cosmetic move in which a United Nations body would review decisions taken by the established institutions.\nThe leaders, minus some who are ailing, like Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany, will gather for the first time at a buffet supper tomorrow night at the Sheraton Hotel, a mud-colored pyramid guarded by scores of soldiers and plainclothes men. Formal Agenda to Start Thursday\nThe formal work will begin Thursday when representatives of all 22 nations and Secretary General Kurt Waldheim of the United Nations deliver opening speechs. They are supposed to limit themselves to 10 minutes each, but the speech making is expected to consume the day.\nOn Friday, the presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers plan less formal talks on a wide range of topics. They include food and agriculture, energy, trade and finance.\nTo underscore the nonbinding nature of this gathering, no communique is expected to be issued. Instead, the host, President Jose Lopez Portillo of Mexico, will summarize the talks for reporters. He was to have been assisted by Chancellor Bruno Kreisky of Austria, but Mr. Kreisky is also ill.\nAlthough some of the third world nations at the conference such as Nigeria, Brazil, Venezuela and Yugoslavia could be classified as middle income or even rich, others are among the world's poorest and most populous. Income per person in Bangladesh is $90 a year. In India, per-capita income is $190 a year, and in China it is $260. By contrast, the United States level is $10,630, and in West Germany it is $11,730.\nThe poor seek what they call a ''massive transfer of resources'' from the rich. They want to achieve it through a doubling of foreign aid, cartels to increase the prices of the raw materials they export, a bigger voice in the International Monetary Fund and a larger share of the drawing rights or fiat money it gives central banks, aid to find their own oil, cut-rate tariffs on goods they sell the rich and a shift of industries from north to south."}, {"text": "FOR LIV ULLMANN, A NEW ROLE ON BEHALF OF UNICEF\n1981-04-13T05:00:00.000Z\n''There are many different languages to talk about suffering,'' said Liv Ullmann, the actress, who for the last year has been traveling around the world as a good-will ambassador for the United Nations Children's Fund. ''There are so many people you can never forget. I try to take the faces and images that I've seen and share them with others.''\nAs she relaxed in the lobby of the Watergate Hotel here, her strawberry blond hair caught back from a face that was free of makeup, she quietly told of an emaciated child with a swollen belly who ''cries only when it rains,'' of an old woman whose face had been held in a fire but who lived to embrace her doctor, and of a homeless little girl who gave Miss Ullmann a ring, her only possession.\n''I go to the theater now and I feel no urge to be up there on the stage,'' she said. ''I feel very fulfilled. I feel that I am useful, that I am talking about something more important than my next part.''\nMiss Ullmann was in Washington in mid-March to testify before three House subcommittees on behalf of the Reagan Administration's $77 million African aid proposal for fiscal year 1982 and to meet with State Department officials.\n''Governments are in danger of cutting foreign aid,'' she said later, ''but in the end whatever you give in foreign aid will sooner or later benefit your own country.''\nAt one of the National Theater's weekly programs for children, 1,200 youngsters and their parents, many of them from Washington's diplomatic community, sat transfixed as she spoke. Hand-Digging for Water\nAlthough the images were vivid, her words were simple as she told the audience of mothers who ''dig for water with their hands only to find mud,'' of children who ''have to lie in sandy groves because they have no beds, no blankets that their parents can tuck around'' and of refugee camps ''that are not a summer camp, but an enormous place, sometimes as big as a city, where there is seldom a flower.''\n''Do you know that these children cry because it hurts to be hungry?'' she asked. Her speech to the group was her first to an audience of children, and she confessed later: ''I was very nervous because I thought, 'What are the words they know and don't know?' Either you get them on such a difficult thing or you don't. But I think the proof was their silence.''\nWhen it came time for questions, a pigtailed girl in a red jumper asked: ''How do the children get the food?'' Another wanted to know, ''Do they worry about the children first?'' A third asked: ''Does being an actress help?'' 'Celebrity Is the Event'\nYes, being an actress helps, acknowledged Miss Ullmann, who has received many honors for her stage and film work.\n''Unicef is using me because I am a celebrity, I am this thing,'' she said, adding: ''The celebrity is the event, but what is really happening is in Africa. This is how it is and it is sad.''\nShe first became involved in the refugee problem when she participated in the ''March for Survival'' a year and a half ago, joining a group of women who traveled to Thailand with 20 truckloads of food and medicine, hoping to enter Cambodia to dramatize the plight of refugees there.\nSince joining Unicef as an unpaid representative, she has traveled the equivalent of twice around the world, she said, to such nations as India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\nShe spent a month this year in England working on a film, and also took time off to direct ''Acts of Love,'' a Canadian film based on a story she wrote. But in the fall, she said, she must return to her career ''because I must make some money, and if I am to continue in this work I have to keep my name and face before the public so that they will come and listen to what I have to say.''\nAs she travels she is in frequent touch by telephone with her 14-year-old daughter, Linn, who attends school in New York City. ''I always say what I really want is to stay home and lead a private life and that family is the most important, but my whole life is in defiance of that wish,'' she said with a smile.\n''But I think children should see their mothers as something more than just a model mother, to see that there is a woman who is trying and failing and succeeding and messing up.''\nMiss Ullmann wears on her little finger a slender silver band embossed with a heart. It was given to her by a 14-year-old girl who came up to her after the program at the National Theater.\n''She heard me tell about the little African girl who gave me her ring,'' Miss Ullmann said, ''and she asked me, 'Please, could you take this ring and when you go back to one of those countries, will you give it to a little girl who doesn't have a ring?' ''"}, {"text": "Ideas & Trends In Summary; FUROR OVER BABY FORMULAS-WHERE, WHEN AND HOW\n1981-05-24T05:00:00.000Z\nOne hundred and eighteen lands - from tiny, dirt-poor African states to rich, Western European giants, from the Communist bloc to right-wing Latin American regimes - joined last week in Geneva under the auspices of the World Health Organization to approve a voluntary international code. The purpose: to curtail the promotion of artifical milk mixes for infants as a life-threatening hazard. The lone negative vote was cast by the United States, which found itself in the unenviable position of opposing what seemed a ''mother and apple pie'' issue -the health and well-being of babies.\nThe action brought outcries from abroad. At home, it provoked the resignations of high-ranking officials in the United States Agency for International Development, Dr. Stephen C. Joseph and Eugene N. Babb, who accused the Reagan Administration of being ''swayed by the self-interest arguments of the infant formula lobby.''\nAt the center of this uproar stood the code itself, prompted by persuasive scientific evidence that bottle-feeding is associated with unusually high levels of infant disease and death, particularly in poor, primitive regions where commercial baby formulas are often mixed with polluted water or are diluted to the point that infants are malnourished. Where adopted by individual nations, the code would not forbid the sale of infant formulas but would restrict the more aggressive forms of marketing and advertising them. It would outlaw, for example, the practice of using saleswomen, called ''mothercraft'' nurses, who enter maternity clinics dressed in white to promote the mixes as the ''scientific'' and ''modern'' way to feed infants.\nIt is universally agreed, even by the formula manufacturers and by the Reagan Administration, that for baby health and well-being there is nothing better than mother's milk. Breast feeding offers all the nutrients needed for the first four to six months of life. It also confers immunological protection against disease and promotes psychological bonding between mother and newborn, as a recent study comparing mortality among breast-fed and bottle-fed infants in Cooperstown, N.Y., confirmed. Further, lactation offers contraceptive protection against renewed pregnancy and thus constitutes an important natural form of population control of particular relevance to developing countries.\nBut beneath these medical facts of life are complex public health and social issues that have been obscured by the political and diplomatic furor surrounding the baby formulas. For in a world in which the need for women to work is frequently an economic and social imperative, and in which socio-economic conditions vary enormously within countries, even some medical advocates of breast feeding agree that bottle feeding can substitute for, or at least supplement, breast feeding.\nThe shift toward bottle feeding among women in poor lands is occurring as American women are returning to breast feeding. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that 25 percent of new mothers left the hospital breast feeding their infants in 1973, and 35 percent in 1975. According to more recent local surveys, the figure is about 50 percent, sometimes 65 percent, among bettereducated groups. With this shift, paralleled in Western Europe where Swedish women, for example, are obliged under law to breast feed for five or six days, the formula makers have sought new markets in the third world.\nThe result of bottle feeding in third world nations, says the World Health Organization, is that one million babies a year die from diarrhea, gastroenteritis, malnutrition and other maladies. This estimate, which is not supported by ironclad evidence, is disputed by companies such as Nestle, which dominates the third world baby formula market and has been the target of a boycott in the United States. The manufacturers also argue that the shift toward bottle feeding is not linked to their promotional practices.\nDr. Davida Coady, a pediatrician at the University of California at Los Angeles who has worked in Bangladesh, India and Africa, told a forum held by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts last week that ''most children put on bottles in Bangladesh die.'' She showed slides of the filthy conditions under which infants were bottle-fed in that country and of promotional displays in remote shops showing chubby, smiling, white infants sucking bottles. A recent study by the Sao Paolo School of Medicine in Brazil found that 23 percent of bottle-fed babies in that city's slums were hospitalized, as against 9 percent of breast-fed babies, and that the nutritional condition of bottle-fed infants was inferior.\nSuch arguments are disputed by the formula manufacturers, who say there is no conclusive evidence associating bottle feeding with disease. They insist that there is a substantial legitimate need for their product - for working women, for undernourished women and for those who prefer to bottle feed and can do so properly. Many nutritional authorities would add that although even the most chronically undernourished women can provide good breast milk for their babies at first, they are unable to produce enough milk to avoid supplementing it with artificial food of some type. According to Dr. Barbara Underwood, a nutritionist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied child development in Pakistan and other countries, mothers in third world nations often feed their offspring starchy gruels or other homemade mixes and through the same unsanitary bottles used for the commercial formulas. Formula Dispute May Hide Many Sins\nWhile she calls herself ''a great advocate'' of breast feeding, Dr. Underwood argues that these women should have the freedom of choice and that the Western world should concentrate on cleaning up the environment and relieving poverty in these countries, rather than on trying to impose marketing restrictions. The marketing question, she says, should be handled by each nation, since cultural, social, economic and health conditions vary widely.\nIf that argument is valid, many observers were nevertheless mystified as to why the United States chose to take a public relations beating by standing alone against the code. Since its provisions can be implemented only by the actions of each sovereign nation, then presumably countries like the United States could choose to ignore it for domestic purposes. Further, countries such as Ghana, Jamaica, Algeria, Colombia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico and Papua New Guinea have already moved independently to restrict the sales and marketing of the formulas or bottles.\nWhy, then, did the American companies that produce infant formulas - Abbott Laboratories, American Home Products Corporation and Bristol Myers Company - lobby so vigorously against the code? Why did the American Government also oppose the agreement?\nThe Reagan Administration said it was preserving the principles of free enterprise and preventing the World Health Organization from becoming an ''international Federal Trade Commission.'' Government spokesmen said that to enforce the agreement in the United States would violate American antitrust laws and free speech rights. The code, they said, thus constituted an unwarranted intrusion by a United Nations agency into international, and national, commercial activity. But others, like the American officials who resigned, believe the Administration was persuaded by an industry that may have feared for its $1.4 billion worldwide market."}, {"text": "2 MILLION MOSLEMS CONVERGING ON HOLY SITES\n1981-10-08T05:00:00.000Z\nAbout 2.2 million Moslems from 64 countries streamed from Mecca to the plain of Arafat today for the climax of their annual pilgrimage.\nAt twilight tomorow, the pilgrims will huddle in the foothills, the men clad in white seamless robes to signify equality in the eye of God. The women wear floor-length robes and head sca rves.\nPrinces from Persian Gulf states and from Saudi Arabia, merchants from China, dignitaries and paupers from Bangladesh and India, mingled with Poles and Hungarians, pilgrims from Spain, Zanzibar and Senegal - all shouting in unision, ''God is Great!''\nA string of dormitories, tent cities and clinics line the vast expanse, 14 miles east of Mecca. This year's pilgrimage ceremonies began Friday and end Thursday.\nA total of 649,324 pilgrims flew to Mecca, the Interior Ministry said. Thousands more came by car, by boat and on foot. Some 1.3 million pilgrims trekked here from remote desert regions and cities inside Saudi Arabia. Largest Group From Nigeria\nThe largest single contingent of pilgrims - 100,300 - came from Nigeria, followed by Egypt, which sent 83,907. Having spent billions of dollars to accommodate the pilgrims this year, including a new $5 billion airport in Jidda, the Saudis said that they wanted the pilgrimage conducted without incident.\nThe governor of Mecca, Prince Majed, has warned that the Kingdom would ''strike with an iron fist at whoever tries to break law and order or misguide the hajis,'' the Arabic word for pilgrims.\nThe Interior Minister, Prince Nayif Saud, warned the pilgrims against engaging in political activities at holy areas. About 80 Iranians were deported at Jidda airport and at Medina, the city from which Mohammed, the prophet of Islam, ruled his empire after his flight from Mecca in A.D. 622. The Saudi authorities said the Iranians were carrying political leaflets and pictures of the Iranian revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Six policemen and a dozen Iranians were hospitalized in a clash at Medina. Iranian Actions Criticized\n''The Iranians are trying to spread political propaganda under the camouflage of Islamic teachings,'' said one Moroccan pilgrim. ''They are trying to get us to glorify Khomeini when we are here to glorify on ly Allah.''\nOne Iranian pilgrim insisted it was the duty of the Iranian Moslems to ''trigger the long overdue reawakening of Moslems all over the world.'' He said the pilgrimage season was a ''perfect opportunity to address these efforts to the largest Islamic congregation.''\nAyatollah Khomeini has in the past called for his Islamic revolution to be exported to other Moslem countries. Iran sent 75,391 pilgrims to Mecca this year - more than seven times the number who came in 1980.\nThe pilgrims visited the Grand Mosque of Mecca, the Haram. There, they circle a small building, the Kaaba, seven times, often bending to kiss the sacred Black Stone, which is apparently of meteoric origin and is set in silver on the cube-shaped granite structure. The Kaaba stone is the most venerated Moslem object and it is the place toward which Moslems face while praying. Agony of Hagar Commemorated\nThen they run back and forth seven times between two hills nearly a half-mile apart inside the mosque. This commemorates the agony of Hagar, the handmaiden of Abraham's wife, Sarah, and the mother of his eldest son, Ismail. Moslems believe she ran between the hills searching for water for her son until God guided her to a spring that is said to still feed the sacred well of Zamzam in the heart of the mosque.\nAfterward, the pilgrims travel to the nearby village of Mena to throw seven stones at each of the three ''devil pillars'' that mark the place where Moslems believe the devil tried to tempt Abraham to disobey God's command to sacrifice his son. God provided a ram which Abraham sacrificed instead, according to the Koran.\nAt Arafat, the pilgrims slit the throats of hundreds of thousands of sheep, cows and camels."}, {"text": "THE COSTLY ARMS TRADE\n1981-12-22T05:00:00.000Z\nThe arms trade has flourished mightily since the oil-price increase in 1973. Rich countries sell weapons to offset the increased costs of their imports; the main purchasers are poor countries all around the world. My extrapolations from 1978 arms-sale data (the latest available) suggest that this boom may have produced as much as $100 billion in international trade. But many poor countries will pay heavily for their buying spree, forfeiting badly needed economic development.\nArms exports from industrialized countries grew by 241 percent, from $6.5 billion in 1970 to $15.7 billion in 1978, according to the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. By 1978, these sales accounted for more than half of the trade surplus of the combined advanced capitalist and Socialist economies. The main beneficiaries were the United States and Soviet Union, which each sold about 40 percent of the 1978 export total.\nMembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with persistent trade surpluses (Saudi Arabia, Libya, Iraq, Iran in the 1970's, and the smaller Arabian Gulf states) were not the chief recipients of the arms merchants' largesse. They took only $4.6 billion in arms transfers in 1978. The rest went to economies that were least able to afford militarization. For example, between 1977 and 1980, eight countries without oil surpluses - including India and desperately poor Ethiopia - spent more than a billion dollars each on major weapons systems. In 1978, the third-world countries that export oil paid a total of $4.6 billion for arms imports, while third-world countries that have to import oil bought $6.5 billion worth. The oil exporters' foreign deficits totaled $17.6, while importers' deficits amounted to $25.5 billion - and arms imports accounted for roughly one-quarter of their trade deficits.\nWhat are the economic consequences of the weapons trade and related military efforts in countries that buy arms? The most important result is that military spending can lead to war. Arms exports often go to nations engaged in conflicts that make headlines in the Western press. During the 1970's, the list in the third world was long: countries in Indochina, the Indian Subcontinent, southwest Asia, the Horn of Africa, Southern Africa, West Africa and Central America all fought full-scale wars.\nThe results in many cases were disastrous. Famine, for example, is in many cases produced by the cumulative social and economic consequences of an external shock - like war - in a population living on the edge of subsistance. Cambodia, Bangladesh, Uganda, Nigeria, and several other countries suffered famines in the last decade, forgoing several years of economic growth. Taking into account population increase, per capita incomes in these countries probably fell by 10 percent or more. If this trend continues, arms exports to parts of the third world may bring economic progress to a devastating halt, particularly in countries of sub-Saharan Africa, where the percentage of total imports devoted to arms rose from 1.3 to 9.3 percent between 1969 and 1978.\nEven when wars do not erupt, arms purchases hurt economic prospects in several ways. A trade deficit is in principle a helpful thing. If a country purchases more than it produces, resources are flowing in. If these resources are transformed into increases in investment or productivity, the economic payoff can be large. But arms imports soak up foreign-exchange loans that could otherwise finance purchases of capital goods. They also require skilled labor for operation and maintenance. Scarce technical and managerial personnel who would otherwise contribute to to capital formation are preoccupied instead with increased military efforts, and as a result their countries get much less real productive growth for each dollar of existing investment.\nEconometric studies suggest that each extra dollar spent on arms reduces domestic investment by about 25 cents and agricultural output by 20 cents. For a country like Ethiopia, which devotes 30 percent of its gross national product to weapons imports, the implications for development are grim. The required sacrifices in resources that would otherwise be devoted to building factories, training management, and, most important, producing food are all very large.\nPoor countries are under strong pressure from advanced countries to accept larger imports of arms. Sales of weapons are a key element in the strategies that industrial countries, both capitalist and Socialist, have adopted to shift the burden of oil-price increases. For poor arms importers, these strategies translate into financial packages, pressure to participate in regional military alliances, and the expansion of the superpower conflict to new corners of the world. A whole collection of rewards and punishments supports the arms trade, which will not slow until both sides rethink their needs. There is scant rational justification for backward economies to import arms rather than food or capital goods - and rich countries could sell these other goods just as well. Development is the victim of the industrial countries' attempt to slough off their own economic malaise with weapons exports to the third world. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Lance Taylor is professor of nutrition and economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Talks 'Without Purpose'\nPresident Lopez Portillo of Mexico suggested that talks in such forums would be ''without purpose, without future.'' Brazil's representative said two of the forums suggested by Mr. Reagan, the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, had not done justice to the third world's problems before and would not now. Other delegates suggested that only the United Nations could. (Page A12.)\nIn his speech to the meeting, which brought together the leaders of 14 developing countries and eight industrialized nations, Mr. Reagan nevertheless sought to be conciliatory and seemed anxious to avoid finding himself isolated during the two days of talks.\n''The U.S. is here to listen and learn,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''And when we leave Cancun, our search for progress will continue. The dialogue will go on. The bonds of our common resolve will not disappear with our jet trails.'' Global Talks Supported\nThe President then addressed the principal demand, already echoed by several earlier speakers today, for a global round of negotiations at the United Nations on all aspects of development.\n''We are prepared to carry out the commitment in the Ottawa summit declaration to conduct a more formal dialogue - bilaterally, with regional groups, in the United Nations and in specialized international agencies,'' he said, referring to the meeting last July of the leaders of the West's seven major industrialized powers.\nBut while most developing nations defined the global negotiations as a move to establish the hierarchy of the United Nations over such specialized agencies as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Reagan stressed today that ''the decisions reached by these agencies within respective areas of competence are final.'' The Crucial Question\nThe question of which international body exercises authority over the global negotiations is crucial. At the United Nations, where the one-state one-vote rule applies, the industrialized world is in a minority, but in the specialized agencies, where voting rights are weighted on the basis of financial contributions, the United States and other Western powers are able to control decisions.\n''The talks should respect the competence, functions and powers of the specialized international agencies upon which we all depend,'' Mr. Reagan said today. ''We should not seek to create new institutions.''\nThe President also suggested an agenda for the talks composed of trade liberalization, energy and food resource development and improvement of the investment climate. In these areas, however, the strong United States preference for free trade and private investment over more traditional forms of direct aid runs counter to the position of most developing nations.\nExplaining his thoughts for ''a positive program of action for development,'' Mr. Reagan said, ''It rests on a coherent view of what's essential to development - namely political freedom and economic opportunity.''\n''If these understandings are accepted,'' he went on, ''then the U.S. would be willing to engage in a new preparatory process to see what may be achieved. I suggest that officials of our governments informally confer in the months ahead as to appropriate procedures.''\nIn contrast, the leaders of several other industrialized nations, including France's President, Francois Mitterrand and the Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, were more direct in their endorsement of global negotiations at the United Nations. Mr. Mitterrand and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany also specifically backed the proposed creation of an energy affiliate attached to the World Bank, an idea to which Mr. Reagan made no reference and is believed to oppose.\nAlthough today's session began with televised speeches by the conference's co-chairmen, President Jose Lopez Portillo of Mexico and Prime Minister Trudeau, and was followed by brief prepared speeches by each delegation head, the plan is for talks to be held on as informal and spontaneous basis as possible.\nFor example, after a 23-minute speech by Mr. Lopez Portillo, in which he noted that ''the first achievement of this event is the very fact that we are gathered here together,'' Mr. Trudeau asked participants to cut the usual diplomatic courtesies from their speeches and suggested that applause be eliminated.\nThe first unexpected informality of the conference, however, was that President Reagan arrived 15 minutes late for the opening session, prompting Mexican television cameras to turn on the empty seats of the United States delegation and on the impatient looks of other heads of states.\nAmerican officials later explained that Mr. Reagan was delayed at a private meeting with the Austrian Foreign Minister, Willibald Pahr, who is representing Chancellor Bruno Kreisky at the conference.

Baker Jr., the Tennessee Republican who will lead the Senate majority next year, obtained approval for moving ahead on the bill from Mr. Reagan's transition team and other Republican leaders in the Senate and House.\nConsultations also were said to be under way among Republican leaders on giving consideration during the lame duck session to a $3.2-billion authorization bill providing new funds for the International Development Association, a World Bank affiliate that lends to the poorest developing countries.\nA Politically Sensitive Issue\nReplenishment of funds for the development organization is a politically sensitive issue on which conservative critics of foreign aid in both parties and economy-minded budget managers are matched against members of Congress who believe that its long-term, lowinterest lending helps maintain political stability in countries such as Bangladesh and the Sudan.\nOn June 21, the Senate authorized the United States share of the $12 billion that is being donated by the 33 nations that finance the organization, but the Democratic leadership in the House avoided putting the bill to a vote before the election.\nWithout the United States share, representing 27 percent of the total, the International Development Association cannot receive new funds from the other donors since the replenishment does not take effect until 80 percent of the total is officially pledged.\nLegislative leaders have been urged by Treasury Secretary G. William Miller to act before the failure to provide new funds brings loans to a standstill. Former Republican Treasury chiefs, including George P. Shultz and William E. Simon, who backed the development organization in their time, have also been approached for support. I.M.F. Bill Awaits Action\nAnother financing measure that the Administration hopes will be approved during the current session is a bill appropriating $5.5 billion to subscribe an additional quota in the International Monetary Fund. This bill passed the House but is awaiting Senate action.\nAs of Friday, 119 I.M.F. countries had officially given notice of their subscriptions, representing 70 percent of the fund's voting shares. The deadline for reaching a total of 75 percent, which would put the increase into effect, is Dec. 31. The United States share in the fund's capital is now 21 percent.\nFailure to approve the I.M.F. measure could reduce the United States share to 14 percent if the increase goes through without American participation. This would cost the United States $137 million in special drawing rights on the fund's currency pool, which has been used before by the Treasury to cover payments obligations in foreign currency, such as marks or yen.\nBut the main effect of failure to act on the International Development Association and I.M.F. bills, according to supporters of the measures, would be to convey to the world's industrial and developing countries the sense that the United States, under a Reagan administration, was withdrawing longstanding support of the principal international financial agencies. Moving In on the Tangle\nThe Republican decision to move ahead with the foreign-aid authorization conference was seen as an indication that the new Republican leadership does not want to leave the foreign-aid issues hanging until the next session of Congress and wants to clear up the legislative tangle surrounding the subject.\nThe foreign-aid bill now in conference provides spending of $7.2 billion in military and economic assistance. Among those is favor of action on the bill are those who support increased military sales to Israel. The $1.4 billion in military sales credits submitted by the Administration for Israel may be increased by $200 million, legislative sources said.\nThe appropriation bill for financing foreign aid for the current fiscal year was scuttled last week by the Democratic leadership in the House when informal talks with Republicans indicated that the requested funds would risk sharp cutbacks in a floor debate.\nFinancing will be provided by a continung resolution maintaining the same level of aid for the coming year as during fiscal 1980, with a few amendments.\nAmendments that are expected to be proposed at a Senate-House conference on a continuing resolution would include additional military sales credits to Israel and more money for refugee programs that put a burden on local communities, such as the settling of Cuban and Haitian refugees in Florida."}, {"text": "BUSINESS DIGEST; TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1981; Companies\n1981-11-24T05:00:00.000Z\nMobil said it had received 23 million shares of Marathon Oil, well short of its goal of 30 million shares, or 51 percent.

Visits by Scientists Planned\n''Tell your people we are friends, we are not enemies,'' Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, told the veterans in agreeing to accept American doctors and scientists to assess the impact of the herbicide Agent Orange and to work with the Vietnam Veterans of America on the question of Americans missing in action.\nLife is bleak in Vietnam today, a situation brought about by political isolation, malnutrition in the countryside and urban centers, inflation believed to run as high as 200 percent a year, a series of devastating typhoons that damaged crops, a textbook Marxist five-year plan that began in 1976 and ended in failure, and the damage wrought by the war. The exodus of ethnic Chinese tradesmen and skilled workers has further aggravated the problems.\nBeyond this, as a major legacy of the war there remain numerous reeducation camps, where former South Vietnamese officials, military men, intellectuals, lawyers, doctors and businessmen have been placed to be ''rehabilitated.'' Estimates of the number of people confined range anywhere from 20,000 to 200,000; even an approximate figure cannot be determined. Travel Is Restricted\n''The human rights situation in Vietnam is very grave,'' said one Western diplomat in Hanoi. He said that the Vietnamese now needed travel permits to take a trip outside their own provinces, that job allocations have split up families, and that freedom of association was banned.\nEven in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, which retains some of the frenetic tempo of the old ''pre-liberation'' days, authorities have closed down the city's renowned book market and confiscated ''unconstructive'' works, including children's fairy tales, romantic novels, mysteries and histories of the French and American involvement, the diplomat said.\nAt the moment, food is the major problem. Although Nguyen Lam, chairman of Vietnam's State Planning Commission, said the nation would meet its goals this year and produce a record 15 million tons, 600,000 tons more than last year, the effect of two typhoons in recent years coupled with the north's unsuccessful attempt to impose farm cooperatives and collectivization on the peasants in the south has left the population stricken and hungry.\n''My students sit and stare and clutch their stomachs with hunger,'' said Nina McCoy, an American who works for a Swedish aid group teaching English to Vietnamese medical students at a hospital in Vong Bi, l00 miles northeast of Hanoi, as well as in the capital. ''People are lucky if they have rice and maybe a boiled vegetable twice a day. There's no fish, no high protein, and the malnutrition among children scares me.'' 'I'm Seeing People Shrink'\nMiss McCoy, who is from Cottage Grove, Ore., and is a 1967 University of Oregon graduate, has worked in Vietnam since July 1979, without any difficulty from the Hanoi authorities. ''I'm seeing people shrink before my eyes,'' she said. ''It's unbearable. Whatever food people have they try to give to their kids.''\nFood rations in many parts of the country, especially the north, have been cut from an average of 31 pounds a month to 25.5 pounds, far below the 33 pounds considered the minimum subsistence level necessary before the onset of serious malnutrition. Fish, which used to be plentiful, is now in short supply, partly because fuel is scarce and many boats have sailed away with refugees.\nOn the free market, chicken costs about $2.04 a pound, other meat about $1.30 a pound, and rice about 45 cents a pound. The average income in Vietnam is put at only $160 a year, and one Asian diplomat in Hanoi said that the nation's economy reminded him of ''Bangladesh on a good day.'' Mistakes in Planning Admitted\nVietnamese officials publicly concede that ''mistakes in economic planning'' - or rigid adherance to collectivization and nationalization of farms - has jolted food production. One of the reasons for increased food output in recent months is a relaxation of controls that opens the way for some incentives and private enterprise.\nIt is this delicate balancing between ideology and reality that has made it clear to diplomats in Hanoi that the Government seeks relations with the United States. It seemed clear to the American veterans, who met Vietnamese officials - as well as foreign diplomats - that the Hanoi Government's view of the United States was skewed by the antiwar movement during the 1960's. The Vietnamese Government presumably feels that by meeting private groups of American citizens now, such as the veterans, it can build up pressures on the American Government.\nThe American group was led by Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America. His companions were Michael R. Harbert, a former Air Force sergeant; Thomas A. Bird, a former infantryman, and John F. Terzano, who was a Navy seaman. All are members of the Vietnam Veterans of America. Ties Seemed Near in '78\nWhat Vietnamese Government officials seem not to realize, judging from a journalist's conversations with some of them, is that Hanoi hardly has the kind of popular support in the United States that the Government here assumes it has, and that normal relations with Vietnam are not a priority among Americans.\nAccording to several accounts, normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam appeared near at hand in the fall of 1978 and discussions began on establishment of embassies. In Hanoi, the Vietnamese now show American visitors the elegant villa on Hai Ba Trung Street that was to have been the United States Embassy. But the Carter Administration drew back at the last moment because of the impending normalization of relations with China, which was antagonistic to Vietnam.\nWhat followed, in November 1978, was a Vietnamese-Soviet treaty of cooperation that makes the Hanoi Government firmly reliant on Moscow. Estimates of Soviet aid run from $3 million a day to $6 million a day for military and civilian projects, including most of the upkeep of the 200,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. There are thought to be 8,000 Russians in Vietnam now, and the Soviet Air Force and Navy have acquired repair and refuelling facilities in Da Nang and Cam Ranh Bay. 'Guest Workers' Sent Abroad\nTo repay the huge military and economic assistance, Vietnam has sent approximately 50,000 ''guest workers'' to factories in the Soviet-bloc countries, according to Western diplomats. In effect, the workers are paying off Vietnam's debt by receiving only a part of their East European salaries. The rest is set aside for debt servicing.\nVietnam's total external debt has climbed to $3 billion, according to official Vietnamese sources. Of this amount, about $1.6 billion is thought to be owed to Soviet-bloc countries.\nTensions between the Soviet Union and Vietnam have already arisen over Soviet influence in Cambodia, and some diplomats here predict that the intensely nationalistic Vietnamese leaders, who fought the French and the Americans, will never fall under the total sway of the Russians.\nThere are grumbles in Hanoi about the poor quality of some of the corn and rice that the Soviet Union has sent. Beyond this, there are personal complaints. ''The Russians make it obvious that they want no contact at all with the Vietnamese,'' said one foreign aid worker. ''The Vietnamese say privately that the Russians are rude, overbearing people. The Vietnamese laugh at them. Everyone listens to the Voice of America, and everyone knows what's going on in Poland, and the Vietnamese are not fooled at all.'' Value of Aid Questioned\nMoreover, Asian and Western diplomats in Hanoi say that the Russians are probably already realizing that aid to Vietnam is of questionable value. According to the Far Eastern Economic Review, published in Hong Kong, a team of Soviet shipping experts was shocked recently to find that goods sent from the Soviet Union in 1968 were rotting in the Haiphong Harbor docks. The Vietnamese refused a Soviet request that they clean up the goods.\nSweden, the major Western donor of aid, is finding ''severe difficulties,'' according to one Asian diplomat in Hanoi. Sweden has spent nearly $400 million on a paper mill outside Hanoi that was called ''a classic disaster'' by the diplomat. ''They are building a high-cost, high-technology paper mill,'' he said, ''and the problems of electricity and water and labor are incredible.''\nThe problems for this nation of 54 million, which has failed to grow enough or earn enough to feed itself, are compounded by the fact that about half the national wealth is used to support the armed forces. With more than 2.6 million under arms, Vietnam has the third largest military force in the world after the Soviet Union and China."}, {"text": "CLAUSEN AND THE POOR\n1981-07-01T05:00:00.000Z\n.2,2WASHINGTON - An important issue facing the World Bank's new president, A.W. Clausen, is the future level of programs serving the poorest countries and poorest people in the developing world.\nThe expansion of lending under the retired president, Robert S. McNamara -from $953.5 million in the first year of his presidency, 1968, to about $12.4 billion in the last fiscal year - was impressive. But the redirection of bank programs toward a more explicit concern with world poverty was even more so. Much of the bank's $3.8 billion lending for agriculture and rural development in the last fiscal year was for subsistence farmers previously ignored by the governing elite in most developing countries. Lending has also increased dramatically for low-cost housing and slum rehabilitation to meet the crushing problems of third-world urbanization. The bank, while still funding many traditional activities, was transformed into the world's largest antipoverty agency.\nBut the future of these initiatives is in jeopardy. Key Reagan Administration figures such as budget director David A. Stockman do not like what they view as the ''socialistic'' and ''redistributionist'' implications of the bank's ''new-style lending.'' Budgetary stringencies in developed and developing countries are thought to argue against bold new initiatives on the world antipoverty front. If this is not the time to rebuild the South Bronx or restore Watts, then it is not the time to alleviate poverty in Bangladesh or the Sahel.\nThe result is that the poorest of the world are faring no better than America's poorest under President Reagan. The Administration has given only tepid support to the Carter Administration's pledged $3.2 billion contribution to the International Development Association, the arm of the bank that provides long-term, no-interest credits to the poorest countries.\nMr. McNamara's efforts to steer the bank toward alleviation of poverty ran into considerable difficulties. Elites in many countries did not like the empowerment of the poor implied by this approach. Organizational, managerial, financial, and political problems in recipient counties consistently bedeviled projects.\nSome bank inadequacies became evident. With 94 percent of the professional staff in Washington, the bank did not always have the local-level expertise to understand poverty conditions. Its approach was sometimes high-handed and top-down, involving insufficient consultation with intended beneficiaries about their real needs and desires. The bank worked almost exclusively through governments, which frequently are inappropriate instruments for promoting social change. It attempted the difficult task of remaining faithful to bankers' criteria while attempting to become a development agency.\nBut there is no disputing the bank's antipoverty achievements. Most completed rural-development projects have shown favorable rates of return on invested capital, belying arguments about ''welfare.'' The projects have significantly contributed toward reducing food deficits in poor countries. In addition, more than seven million poor urban people have been assisted by bank housing and slumrehabilitation projects.\nAs Mr. Clausen assumes command, other issues will compete for his attention. He has expressed interest in a proposed ''energy affiliate,'' but the Administration is apparently opposed, fearing that support for energy exploration and development will crowd out private companies. He will give attention to how the bank can work more closely with private commercial banks. With World Bank resources unlikely to grow at 1970's rates, he will be obliged to consider ways in which the bank can exploit its existing resources more effectively.\nBut he should not overlook the central issue of world poverty. It is likely that there will be more than one billion people in absolute poverty in the year 2000, given current trends in developing countries. Such conditions are likely to lead to intolerable political situations in countries important to America. The Administration is insufficiently aware of the principal beneficiaries of the bank's antipoverty projects: the small-scale farmers and urban entrepreneurs who have been integrated into their countries' market economies through the projects and who are forces for reform. Rescuing them from poverty has forestalled and pre-empted revolutionaries. This is obviously congruent with any realistic conception of American national-security interests in the developing world.\nThat is why it is important that Mr. Clausen continue the bank's antipoverty programs. Nobody else seems poised to take over the bank's recent role - not private investors with profits on their minds, not the American bilateral aid program, which is overwhelmingly concentrated on Egypt and Israel.\nThe restoration of an American leadership role in foreign affairs does not only mean larger military budgets; it also means a renewed role in the development of poor countries, because such development is in our own political and strategic interest. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Robert L. Ayres, a senior fellow with the Overseas Development Council, a research organization that specializes in relations between the United States and developing countries, is completing a book on the World Bank under Robert S. McNamara."}, {"text": "THE CORPORATE HALLS OF IVY GROW\n1981-08-30T05:00:00.000Z\nWHEN Jonathan S. Kamkwalala, an investment banker from Malawi, decided to return to school for a graduate degree in management, he asked his supervisor to recommend the best educational program. His answer was brief: Try an American corporation.\nHeeding the advice, Mr. Kamkwalala enrolled as a student in the Arthur D. Little Management Institute in Cambridge, Mass., a profitmaking educational subsidiary of Arthur D. Little Inc., the international research, engineering and management-consulting concern.\n''I didn't know really what Arthur Little was, I thought it was just a company,'' Mr. Kamkwalala said. ''But my boss and several other people from Malawi had attended the program, and were very impressed.''\nIn 1973 the Arthur D. Little Management Institute became the first corporation in the country granted the authority to award a Master of Science in Management degree. Since then, buoyed by a new wave of popularity for ''practical'' and career-oriented education, a growing number of corporations are offering degree and nondegree programs at the graduate as well as undergraduate level.\nWang Laboratories, for instance, created the separate Wang Institute to give a master's degree in software engineering. The entering class last year included employees of Digital Computer, Prime Computer and Honeywell, as well as Wang.\nAlthough the program was conceived by Wang Laboratories Inc., it is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization, and is not affiliated with the parent corporation. Wang, and also the Massachusetts General Hospital are now applying for accreditation by the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.\nSimilarly, since 1979 the Bell & Howell Education Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell & Howell Company, the Illinois-based manufacturer of learning systems and business equipment, has offered degree programs in computer science for business. And in yet another approach to corporate participation in education, Ronald Taylor and Dennis Keller left the Bell & Howell Education Group in 1973 to found their own private, profit-making school offering a master's degree in business administration. Since then, the Keller Graduate School of Management has granted degrees to more than 600 students.\nSince 1970, the Rand Graduate Institute, a division of the Santa Monica-based research center, has been offering a doctoral program in policy analysis. The program currently enrolls about 50 students.\nAt the undergraduate level, the R.J. Reynolds Company adopted High Point College in North Carolina as its own, underwriting, as a job benefit, the education of several hundred of its employees in the last two years.\nAltogether, the Program on Noncollegiate-Sponsored Instruction of the American Council on Education has recognized more than 2,000 courses at 138 corporations as worthy of regular academic credit. Such companies as A.T.&T., General Electric, General Motors and Xerox each offer several dozen of these courses.\nThe Arthur D. Little Management Institute is perhaps unique because it focuses on the management problems of public and private institutions in developing countries. More than 550 students from 46 countries have successfuly completed the program designed for managers in multinational organizations and private and governmentowned enterprises. Enrolled in the most recent session were students from 22 countries, including Bahrain, Botswana, Lesotho, Malaysia and Venezuela, which were represented for the first time.\nThe dean and vice president of the institute, Arnold K. Weinstein, said, ''While we offer all the traditional subjects you would get in an M.B.A. program - economics, quantitative methods, accounting, finance and organizational behavior - our instructors approach their subjects with the understanding that the students are from an international environment.''\n''That differentiates them from the traditional M.B.A. program that trains them for being a brand manager at General Foods,'' he added. ''Nobody here is going to be the brand manager of General Foods - they're going to be the managing director of the Tanzanian Tobacco Company, or some such thing.''\nAlthough Arthur D. Little has conducted management-education programs on the graduate level for more than 25 years, the degreegranting Management Education Institute really began in the early 1960's when the concern accepted a request from the Government of Nigeria to replace the existing on-the-job training in that country with a more comprehensive educational program in the United States.\nSince then, the institute has evolved from a seven-month program conducted in alliance with several other universities to an 11-month intensive 50-credit program entirely under the control of the corporation. In addition to the M.S.M. degree program, the institute offers such courses as an 18-week program, designed to help petroleum companies and governments develop managers and staff analysts in administering energy policy; an eight-week course for managers in export sales, and a six-week forum on energy, including technological updating on energy sources.\nMr. Kamkwalala is enrolled in the Project Analysis and Management Program, an eight-week course designed for professionals responsible for industrial development in international public and private institutions.\nDespite the corporation's leading role in developing profit-making educational programs, the program is not widely known outside the Boston area. ''Our name is known one heck of a lot better outside the United States than inside,'' Mr. Weinstein said.\nIn order to attract prospective students, the institute relies extensively on favorable word-of-mouth reports from former students and managers involved in Arthur D. Little's international consulting business.\n''In Japan, for instance, a student will come here as an experiment, and gets so turned on by the experience that he goes back to his organization, and where there was one one year, there are 10 the next year, and it snowballs,'' Mr. Weinstein said.\nMost of the M.S.M. students already have significant work experience in management and decision-making in their developing countries and often receive promotions shortly after completing the program.\n''We had a group of applications from Bangladesh, and the best application was from the chief of an agricultural development with more than 20 years of experience and direct responsibility for 10,000 people,'' Mr. Weiss said.\nMost students cannot afford the institute's tuition - currently about $8,580 a year, plus $840 for books - and are usually supported by scholarships and grants awarded by either employer organizations, home governments, or international agencies, such as the Agency for International Development."}, {"text": "Gallery View; A SPLENDID NEW HOME FOR ROCKEFELLER' S TREASURES\n1981-10-11T05:00:00.000Z\nAs of this coming week New York will have a new museum building at 725 Park Avenue, on the same cross street as the Frick Collection at 74th Street. Designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, it is the relocated headquarters of the Asia Society. The Asia Society was founded by John D. Rockefeller 3d just 25 years ago. It was not meant to be primarily an exhibiting society, and indeed the display of works of Asian art is only one of the activities that are already going forward in the new building. The word ''multi-purpose'' applies as much to the society itself as to the enfilade of conference rooms with which Mr. Barnes has endowed one of the upper floors of the building. The nuances of Indian Buddhist sculpture in the 6th century A.D. are important to the Asia Society, but so are the latest breakthroughs in Japanese technology and the population problems of Bangladesh.\nTo most laymen, however, the Asia Society is known above all for the exhibitions of Asian art that were held at the original Asia House Gallery at 112 East 64th Street. The gallery in question was designed by Philip Johnson and consisted of two quite small rooms. Those rooms had a confidential quality. Among the 70 exhibitions that were mounted by the society between 1960 and 1980 there were many that would have looked wonderful anywhere. But the Asia House gallery had a private quality, an atmosphere of meditation and withdrawal, that communicated itself even to works of art that had long been famous in other places. Everything looked well there - Khmer sculpture, Muslim miniatures, Iranian ceramics, treasures from the Kabul Museum in Afghanistan, Korean pots, Japanese prints, paintings of the Nanga school from Japan, Rajasthani temple hangings, Gandhara sculptures from Pakistan and Asian nomad rugs.\nThe good news is that this modesty of scale has been carried over into the society's new galleries. In this, they fulfill the wishes of John D. Rockefeller 3d. ''I would stress my sincere belief,'' he once said, ''that the society's collection should always remain small. In this age of ever-growing museums of major importance, there is a particularly useful role for the small specialized museum of high quality. Not only can it serve as an initial point of contact with a great culture for the casual visitor, but it can raise the sights of those knowledgeable in the field by the sheer beauty and quality of the items on display.''\nIn this matter an ideal standard has always been set by the society's new neighbor, the Frick Collection. To turn the Asia House Gallery into ''the Asian Frick'' has in fact been the latent unspoken ambition of the gallery's directors: George Montgomery (1960-62), Gordon B. Washburn (1962-74) and Allen Wardwell (1974 to present). But before it could qualify as the Asian Frick, the gallery had to have a permanent collection. That requirement was fulfilled in 1973, when Mr. Rockefeller intimated to the society's trustees that he would like to turn over to the society the collection of Asian art which he and Mrs. Rockefeller had been forming since 1951. And the inaugural exhibition in the new galleries will consist of a selection from their former holdings. Their collection had, and has still, a part icular quality. Mr. Rockefeller had been going to Asia since 1929 , but it was not until 1951, when he went to Japan with John Foster Dulles in connection with his Peace Treaty Mission, that he and Mr s. Rockefeller began to collect works of Asian art. What they had in mind was a specifically private collection. Everything in it had to f it comfortably into their home, and every piece had to speak to t hem directly in a way that is not always possible when people colle ct with a museum in mind. (''It has to stir and lift me,'' was ho w he once put it.) It also had to remind them in almost every case of a particular journey and a particular place.\nInitially the collection was built up by instinct and intuition and without formal advice. But by 1963 it was getting to be ''important,'' almost in spite of the collectors' wishes, and in that year Mr. Rockefeller asked Dr. Sherman Lee, the director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, to act as adviser to the collection. Dr. Lee knows a great deal about Asian art, and he is a particularly forceful persuader, but stirring and lifting remained the essential prerequisite to purchase. The collection remained a Rockefeller collection, and not a Lee collection. Nor was it intended to be either ''complete'' or competitive.\nIt has still, for instance, the emphasis on the third dimension that marked it from the beginning. Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller responded above all to sculpture, stoneware and ceramics. For one reason or another they were not so keen to acquire paintings and prints. Chinese and Japanese paintings in particular can take up an enormous amount of room and call for stable conditions of humidity that are not always easy or convenient to maintain in a private house.\nAnyone who looks through the new handbook to the collection, in which every item is illustrated, will see at once that the role of paintings and prints is still a subordinate one. But with the Metropolitan Museum only a 10-minute walk up the road, there was no reason to aim at an equilibrated panorama. (There is nothing ''balanced'' about the Frick collection, either.) The plan is to rotate the co llection in such a way that about three-fifths of it will be on vi ew at any one time. (All of it is stored in the building, by the way.)\nMeanwhile the Asia Society has in hand a number of very promising temporary exhibitions. Each one of these will consist of between 50 and 100 objects, and they are remarkably various. As of Dec. 3 there will be a selection from the celebrated exhibition of Chinese paintings that was organized not long ago by the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Nelson Gallery-Atkins Museum in Kansas City. Next spring there will be a show of 50 Oriental rugs to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Hajji Baba Club. In the fall of l982 Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan will lend a part of his collection of Islamic manuscripts, book covers, ceramics and metalwork. After that, there will be an exhibition organized by the White Gallery in the University of California in Berkeley. ''The Silk Route and the Diamond Path'' is its arresting title, and it will consist of objects from the monasteries that lay along the silk route in East Asia.\nWith a program like that, who could deny that ''small is beautiful''?"}, {"text": "ASIAN MUSICIANS SERVE UP A BLEND OF EAST AND\n1981-08-07T05:00:00.000Z\nWEST By ROBERT PALMER\nASIAN music still sounds exotic to many Americans who routinely sample Asian cuisines. But among the city's better Asian restaurants can be found some of the city's more intriguing Asian musicians. And while their playing is little more than a background drone to many diners, those who are interested can listen and enjoy - and learn.\nThe Asian musicians to be heard at Raga, the Indian restaurant at 57 West 48th Street, and in Pongsri, the Thai restaurant at 244 West 48th Street, are not the staunch traditionalists that Westerners might expect them to be. They are progressive players who mix old and new, East and West, classical and pop and jazz. To many diners, they will always be part of the decor. But their music, and their stories, can be exceptional.\nConsider Badal Roy, whose fingers fly over his traditional Indian tabla drums at Raga on Mondays through Saturdays from 6 to 10 P.M. On most evenings, Mr. Roy performs duets with Arooj Lazewal, who plays the sitar, the stringed instrument that was popularized in the West by Ravi Shankar. To the casual listener, the music these two musicians play sounds like classical Indian - shimmering, dreamy music that builds to spectacular rhythmic climaxes. But Badal Roy is not an Indian classical musician. His tabla playing was a hobby until he came to the United States in 1968 and found himself in demand - among American jazz musicians. He has performed and recorded with Miles Davis, John McLaughlin, Pharoah Sanders and many other stars, and he is now a member of a group led by the jazz flutist Herbie Mann.\n''I was born in Bangladesh and I went to college in Pakistan, where I got a master's degree in statistics, specializing in demography,'' Mr. Roy explained between sets at Raga the other day. ''When Duke Ellington played in Karachi, I was there, and I loved Louis Armstrong and Elvis Presley records. I came here to get a Ph.D., but I got involved in jazz instead. I'm not a classical tabla player; I was never trained like that. So here we play a lot of different things. Some of it is strict Indian classical music; some of it is our own compositions, which are influenced by a lot of things. Some of it is popular songs from Indian films, and sometimes we just improvise. If you listen, you can tell the difference.''\nOne of Mr. Roy's continuing projects is his work with Steve Gorn, an American former jazz saxophonist who lived in India for several years studying the traditional Indian bamboo flute. Because Mr. Roy and Mr. Gorn are familiar with both Indian music and jazz, they have been able to develop an unusual fusion, a quick-witted improvisational music that mediates effortlessly between the two worlds. Beginning next month, Mr. Gorn will be back at Raga with Mr. Roy.\nThe band at Pongsri is considerably louder than the duos at Raga. It is an amplified band, with electric piano, bass guitar and drums, but the musicians are Thais and they play some light jazz, American pop and Thai pop, which is an intriguing mixture of Asian and Western elements. Brian Eno, the influential English rock producer and composer, spent some time in Bangkok several years ago visiting the recording studios where Thai pop records are made, and he says that he has been influenced by the music he heard. David Bowie, who has collaborated extensively with Mr. Eno, has also listened to Thai pop music. So the sounds at Pongsri may not really be unfamiliar to rock listeners. The band starts playing at around 11:30 P. M. on Friday and Saturday nights, and the restaurant is open until 4 A. M.\nA number of Asian countries have supported thriving jazz subcultures for decades - most notably Japan, which actually exports jazz musicians to the United States. There are Japanese musicians in the brass and reed sections of big bands such as Lionel Hampton's, Japanese musicians playing avant-garde jazz in downtown clubs and lofts and a few Japanese musicians making records for American labels. The most popular Japanese jazzman living and working in New York is probably the trumpeter Terumasa Hino, who performed at the Kool Jazz Festival last month before leaving on a tour of Japan with his mostly American band.\n''Double Rainbow,'' Mr. Hino's new album on Columbia, finds the trumpeter under the spell of Miles Davis. But at his best, he brings something extra to the music, a command of atmosphere that plays off dramatic flourishes against hypnotic stases and occasionally recalls the timeless feeling of Gagaku, the ancient Japanese court music. On one selection, ''Aboriginal,'' Mr. Hino moves beyond the Miles Davis sphere altogether and conjures a blend of primitive and electronic instrumentation that compares favorably with the work of Weather Report, America's most consistently innovative jazz-ethnic-fusion band. If Mr. Hino develops further in the directions suggested by ''Aboriginal,'' he will be a very interesting musician indeed.\nA few weeks ago, a hefty parcel arrived in the mail from the Korean Cultural Service. It turned out to be an impressive, gilt-decorated box containing 15 records of traditional Korean music. Some Korean music has been heard and much remarked on in this country, particularly Pansori, Korea's dramatic, virtuosic vocal music. But ''Traditional Music of Korea,'' the new anthology, makes it clear that Pansori is only a fraction of the wealth of music that Korea has to offer.\n''Traditional Music of Korea'' is made up of nine disks of court music, much of it played by orchestras of wind and stringed instruments, and six disks of folk music, a category that includes lyric and dramatic songs and Buddhist chant and is primarily vocal. Anyone who has heard and become enamored of Gagaku and other traditional Japanese music will notice similarities; it seems that much of the Japanese Gagaku repertory came from Korea, probably in the eighth century. Disks 6 and 7 in this anthology are both complete performances, around 40 minutes each, of court music for wind and string ensembles, and they are hypnotic and ravishing.\nA 15-record set is clearly not within everyone's budget, so a limited number of sets has been manufactured. But the anthology is available to libraries and, according to Hoseon Cheon, consul of the Korean Cultural Service, sets will be available to the public if there is a demand. Interested parties can contact Mr. Cheon at the Korean Cultural Service, sixth floor, 460 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022 (759-9550)."}, {"text": "CANCUN APT SITE FOR RICH-POOR PARLEY\n1981-10-21T05:00:00.000Z\nIn the last decade, $1.1 billion worth of investment has transformed this L-shaped island from a deserted strip of sand into an exclusive vacation resort, with 48 hotels, a convention center, a golf course, luxury villas and the inevitable bevy of discotheques.\nA service town, across the 200-foot bridge that links Cancun to the mainland, has also sprung up amid the coastal mangroves over the last 10 years. But in the town investment has fallen behind the growth rate, and half the population - some 30,000 people -live in rudimentary shacks.\nThe venue for this week's meeting of developing and industrialized nations that will be attended by 22 world leaders, including President Reagan, is therefore a microcosm of some of the problems affecting development in the third world. Visitors who consider this an unusual place for a conference on world poverty need only drive a few miles to see the other face of Cancun.\nAffluent Tourists Were Target\nPrompted by the need for foreign exchange, the Mexican Government took the initiative in developing Cancun, hoping to woo affluent tourists from both the United States and Europe. To do so, it invited the participation of such well-known multinational hotelmanagement concerns as Hyatt and Sheraton, which have their own worldwide reservation networks.\nPart of the financing - $21.5 million - came from the Inter-American Development Bank, which argued that the foreign exchange and job opportunitites generated by the project justified its supporting the construction of a resort that would cater only to the wealthy.\nIn building an entire town from scratch, the Government was also confident that careful planning could avoid a repetition of the problems of marine pollution, peasant migration and chaotic growth that have blighted Acapulco and some other Mexican resorts.\nGreat care was taken to build sewage treatment plants, no squatters were allowed to settle on Cancun Island, and the Government's tourist development agency, known by its Spanish acronym of Fonatur, assumed responsibility for constructing the nearby service town. ''It was our Brasilia,'' one official said. Surrounding Region Is Poor\nBut Cancun is on the northeastern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula, one of Mexico's poorest regions where most people still speak Maya, wear traditional costumes and live at subsistence level off the produce of tiny, infertile corn plots. The jobs created by construction of the resort therefore quickly turned Cancun into a focus of migration by poor peasants.\nAt first, construction companies set up special camps for their workers. But when one contract was completed, the migrants soon found jobs at a new site, and the temporary camps became permanent. Some workers even helped build the service town, with its elegant main avenue lined with government offices and tourist shops. But the migrants were too poor to acquire the few low-cost houses that were available.\nWhen the first hotels opened in the early 1970's, some migrants became waiters and attendants overnight, and others brought their wives and sisters from their villages to work as maids and waitresses. Construction work, meanwhile, continued to pull peasants from all over the Yucatan Peninsula. At night, they all return from the hotel strip to their improvised homes on the outskirts of Cancun. 26,000 Rooms by 1991\nCancun has some 4,200 hotel rooms, and 1,000 more should be finished by the end of this year. The resort should be completed in 1991, when a total of 26,000 rooms will accommodate about two million visitors a year. By then, however, the area's population will have grown from 60,000 to 200,000 and, if present trends persist, most residents will be living in poverty.\n''Already our growth is anarchic,'' said Maria-Cristina Castro, an adviser to Cancun's Mayor, Jose Irabien Medina. ''We have an average of 15 families arriving to settle here every day. Public transportation to the hotel zone is inadequate. We're growing so fast that there isn't time to train people properly.\n''The people on the construction sites go from the primitive life of the jungle to the electronic age,'' she went on. ''Women who speak only Maya and arrive from Indian villages are expected to serve at tables.''\nBecause of the development of Cancun, the surrounding territory of Quintana Roo became a national state in 1974. But Cancun is still effectively run by Fonatur, which is principally concerned with tourists, and the local municipality's $5 million annual budget is insufficient to deal with local social problems, notably housing. 'Enormous Tax Holidays'\n''The state congress is currently discussing a new tax on the hotel operations,'' Miss Castro said, ''but the hotels are protesting strongly. They all enjoy enormous tax holidays and don't want to support the municipality.''\nThe decision to hold this week's meeting here has helped Cancun, not only by giving the resort international publicity but also by accelerating such projects as the extension of the airport runway to handle wide-bodied airliners, the installation of a satellite ground station and the completion of the asphalt highway along the island.\nCancun, however, still seems culturally and geographically remote from the rest of Mexico. English and Maya are spoken here as much as Spanish, and radio stations in Cuba and the United States can be heard more clearly than those of the rest of Mexico. Last weekend, to coincide with the meeting, two Mexican television stations began beaming their programs here for the first time.\nThe world leaders visiting Cancun this week will see the resort only during their 20-minute drive - and President Reagan will travel by helicopter - to and from the airport. During the rest of their three days here, they will be isolated inside the Cancun Sheraton Hotel. Cancun Meeting What Is It? Informally known as the North-South conference, its official name is the International Meeting on Cooperation and Develop- ment. When and Where? Thursday and Friday at the Sheraton Hotel in Cancun, Mexi- co. Who Will Be There? Government leaders from 8 industrialized and 14 developing nations and Secretary General Kurt Waldheim of the United Na- tions. From the North President Reagan, the United States Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Britain Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Canada President Francois Mitterrand, France Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki, Japan Prime Minister Thorbjorn Falldin, Sweden Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, West Germany Foreign Minister Willibald Pahr, Austria From the South President Jose Lopez Portillo, Mexico Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang, China Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, India President Luis Herrera Campins, Venezuela Crown Prince Fahd, Saudi Arabia President Chadli Benjedid, Algeria President Julius K. Nyerere, Tanzania President Ferdinand E. Marcos, the Philippines President Forbes Burnham,\nGuyana President Shehu Shagari, Nigeria President Sergej Kraigher, Yugoslavia Foreign Minister Ramiro Saraiva Guerreiro, Brazil Foreign Minister Mohammad Shamsul Huq, Bangladesh Foreign Minister Simeon Ake, Ivory Coast. Who Will Preside? The co-chairmen will be President Lopez Portillo of Mexico and Prime Minister Trudeau of Cana- da. What Are the Topics? No formal agenda has been prepared in the hope that spontaneous and free-ranging talks will take place, but four general areas of discussion have been identified: food security and agricultural development; trade and industrialization of basic products; energy, and monetary and financial questions. Specifically, developing countries hope to persuade the developed nations to begin global negotiations on development questions at the United Nations. The United Stats opposes this idea. The developing countries will also press for creation of an energy affiliate at the World Bank and a compensating financial facility for food imports by the International Monetary Fund. Origins of Meeting Early last year, an 18-member commission on international development headed by former Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany called for a ''program for survival'' to aid poor countries and suggested an informal gathering of world leaders where initiatives and concessions could be thrashed out with candor and boldness. The idea was picked up by President Lopez Portillo and Chancellor Bruno Kreisky of Austria, whose Governments formed an 11-nation preparatory committee to draw up a list of participants. The Soviet Union was invited but refused, contending that the ''colonialist'' powers were responsible for third world poverty. Fidel Castro of Cuba was eager to attend but President Reagan successfully conditioned his own attendance on exclusion of the Cuban The Prospects At a preparatory session of foregn ministers in Cancun early in August there were no signs that this week's meeting would produce a breakthrough after years of fruitless negotiations between industralized and developing nations. Some government leaders say it is a success that the meeting is taking place at all, but others worry about what will come after Cancun."}, {"text": "U.N. MAITRE D'HOTEL IS A DIPLOMAT, TOO\n1981-03-04T05:00:00.000Z\n-------------------------------------------------------------------- Allan Ripp is a journalist who lives in New York. By ALLAN RIPP UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. FROM his desk on the fourth floor of the United Nations Secretariat Building Norman Manjaka enjoys a unique view of the world. A few yards away is the entrance to the delegates' dining room, where he presides daily as maitre d'hotel. Spanning the top of the desk like one long pennant are 152 miniature flags representing the member countries. Considering the flags and then the dining room, Mr. Manjaka offers his summary of international affairs.\n''Many people are surprised to learn this,'' he began in his careful French-accented English, ''but Algeria throws some of the biggest parties at the U.N. There is always a grand buffet with stuffed lamb and rice; also an excellent turnout by the other delegates.''\n''Brazil,'' he went on, ''usually waits for nice weather and holds its receptions outdoors. Japan - ah, Japan is one of the most ceremonial hosts. For the Emperor's birthday the mission sets up a beautiful rock garden and the women wear long kimonos. It is always an impeccable affair.''\nThe list continues: ''For some reason Australia doesn't have many of its functions here, but Cuba and Israel and many third-world countries do and often televise them to their citizens back home. Iran used to throw some of the biggest receptions, but not any more.''\nIn diplomatic circles perhaps no one keeps up with as many countries as Norman Manjaka, a 43-year-old native of Jordan who is widely known as Monsieur Norman. As a spokesman at the Tanzanian Embassy suggests, ''he is one of the most favorite people at the U.N.''\nThere are two sides to Mr. Manjaka's professional life. As head of the dining room, a post he has held since 1973, he attends to the innumerable details that routinely fill his clipboard, from arranging menus and seating plans to taking reservations and printing up name cards.\nThen there is his staff - two assistants and four captains and, when the General Assembly is in session, a service crew of nearly 75. For his duties he draws on a service career that began with hotel schools in Switzerland, followed by hotel and casino jobs in the Caribbean region and North Africa and then five years as maitre d'hotel of the Swiss Pavilion restaurant in Rockefeller Center.\nThe other aspect of Mr. Manjaka's work, a rarity even among the best-trained maitres d'hotel, could only have grown out of his love for pomp and protocol and his unrivaled experience with international dignitaries. He is one of a dwindling breed who practice the dying art of announcing guests at formal occasions.\nIn white tie and tails, white gloves and cummerbund, he greets the guests as they approach the receiving line. With a bow he asks their names; in some cases he receives a calling card. He then announces - or, rather, quietly proclaims - the name for the benefit of the hosts, adding the appropriate form of address, from mister and miss (never ms.) to excellency and majesty.\nMr. Manjaka will stand at his post for a minimum of two hours. Only when he senses that all the eminent folk have passed will he release the hosts and let the party run its course.\nThough the idea of a reception announcer may seem as outmoded as that of a reader of royal proclamations, he has his uses. If Mr. Manjaka stands alone as a regular announcer in New York, it is because the more elegant hosts and hostesses consider him without peer.\nBesides announcing all United Nations functions, including hundreds of independence days and the frequent ambassadorial debuts, he is constantly sought for outside affairs as well. When President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France received well-wishers at the Hotel Pierre in 1979, Mr. Manjaka was there to announce them, as he has done for other heads of state and government, from Helmut Schmidt of West Germany to Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh. Nelson A. Rockefeller retained Mr. Manjaka for an average of six parties a year, dispatching a limousine to pick him up at his East Side apartment and delivering him to the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills. ''He was always asking me where he should stand,'' Mr. Manjaka recalled.\nHe has also announced an occasional fashion show or banquet. The one time the White House called he had to decline because of a commitment at the United Nations.\nIn addition to the clear voice and gracious manner that are an announcer's most important skills, Monsieur Norman offers a few of his own.\n''I had no conception of how important he was before we used him,'' said Gillian M. Sorensen, who, as head of the City Commission for the United Nations and the Consular Corps, has hired him to announce her office's annual party in June honoring the entire diplomatic corps.\n''It's a tremendous affair,'' she said, ''with well over 2,000 people swarming into the Metropolitan Museum's Great Hall - ambassadors, consular employees, press attaches - and I was amazed at how many of them Norman knew on sight. He has an encyclopedic memory for names and faces.''\nMasahiro Nisibori, the Japanese delegate to the United Nations, marvels over Mr. Manjaka's feats of pronunciation, a reflection of his fluency in six languages and his casual command of twice that many.\n''He almost never has to ask twice for a name and then repeats it perfectly,'' Mr. Nisibori said. ''That is very flattering to a Japanese visitor.''\nSome guests do not understand the announcer's function or know how to react. ''Some people, especially if they are shy, take a step backwards,'' Mr Manjaka said. ''They seem to think I'm going to demand to see their invitation if I don't know them. In that case I would bring the host forward to meet them.''\nOthers, not so reticent, hand Mr. Manjaka their coats or seek directions to the bar before he can ask their names. On rare occasions people will glimpse a flash of his temper if they interfere with his sense of propriety. Chris Little, a photographer, who was covering a cocktail reception last December for the Aga Khan, tried to reshuffle the receiving line to suit his camera, only to have Mr. Manjaka curtly forbid the switch.\n''In a correct receiving line,'' he instructed, ''the host should always stand before the guest of honor.'' There are those who try to deceive the announcer. At a United Nations function an art historian originally from the South identified herself as ''Princess Zara'' and was dutifully sent down the receiving line, her bogus title intact.\n''Why should I feel embarrassed?'' Mr. Manjaka said later with a laugh when he was informed of the fraud. ''It gives me pleasure to serve people, and when people are served they tend to behave like royalty.''"}, {"text": "INDIA'S ROYAL GHOST TOWN\n1981-11-01T05:00:00.000Z\nA couple of years ago, while I was in a hospital in New York, my then-11-year-old daughter wrote me from our home in India describing her first visit to Agra. In an attempt to cheer me up, she wrote: ''When you tell people you've been to Agra, of course, they ask you about the Taj Mahal. It's always the Taj this and the Taj that. Now don't get me wrong, the Taj is really quite nice, it's okey dokey, but there's a lot of other stuff around Agra and the most fun is this terrific old city called Fatehpur Sikri.''\nIn due course I returned to India and traveled several times to Agra, and learned that my daughter was entirely correct. Fatehpur Sikri, a Mogul ghost town 26 miles from Agra, is for my money a much more stimulating attraction than the marble Taj.\nIt is not my purpose to bad-mouth the Taj, though I confess the sheer iconoclasm of such a notion has a certain appeal. But such a stance would be posturing. The Taj is extremely beautiful. It is every bit as beautiful as I thought it would be before I saw it. It is beautiful by moonlight. It is beautiful in morning mist. It is a great place to sigh languorously. One can admire the craftsmanship that went into the construction of the Taj Mahal and applaud the fixation of Shah Jahan, who built it over a period of 18 years, between 1630 and 1648, as a tomb to commemorate his love for his first and favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.\nBut if the Taj is for sighing languorously, then Fatehpur Sikri is for playing hide-and-seek and having picnics. It is an unpopulated royal city in excellent shape, with secret passageways, courtyards, pools, bridges and palaces. Older than the Taj, it was built more than 400 years ago by Akbar, the most ecumenical and enlightened of the Mogul emperors, and its sandstone and marble architecture combines elements of Hindu style with the Mogul geometry that itself was mellowed by Sufi mysticism.\nIt is clearly a playful place. On one square a huge parchesi board was built into the stone to permit courtiers to direct courtesans serving as living pieces. There is a wonderful filigreed building of five open stories that could only have been built as a place of recreation: for feeding pigeons and green parrots, flying kites and watching sunsets. It is still used for such activities. There is one building, the Ankh Michauli, where the Emperor is said to have played hide-and-seek with the women of his harem. But taken separately or viewed as a whole town, the groups of squares, pools and buildings have the majesty of medieval cathedrals while conveying the sense of a Mogul Disneyland .\nPart of the charm of the place is in the approach to it from Agra. You can cover the 26 miles by tourist bus, local bus or hired car. In any case the route goes through Agra, a large, dusty, usually hot and noisy city of more than a million people. The road passes narrow bazaar streets and the cantonment quarter, where air force officers occupy high-ceilinged bungalows surrounded by flowering shrubs.\nBut beyond the city's sprawl, the avenue becomes the quintessential Indian country road. It passes villages where in the warm season people live in front of their homes, chatting from their charpoys, or rope beds. People pray, eat, entertain and work in public view. It is as if the visitor were passing through living rooms and kitchens. Though at times the drive also seems to pass through bathrooms, this green country setting is much cleaner and more organized than the congested cities. Women mill grain. Children drive herds of buffaloes to ponds where both beasts and youngsters wallow.\nAbout halfway along the road, past a grove of fruit trees, is a settlement of bear wallahs, families who keep trained Himalayan bears. Wallah simply means person, and along the road, in addition to the bear wallahs, there will be buffalo wallahs, tea wallahs, possibly a camel wallah. The bear wallahs make their animals dance on their hind legs and beg from passersby. Usually there are about 10 of the keepers and bears strategically positioned along the road.\nA short distance past the bears one gets a first glimpse of Fatehpur Sikri, situated atop a low sandstone ridge that is the only elevation on the expansive plain. Here in 1569 Akbar built his capital. The legend is that the Mogul leader came here to visit a Moslem ascetic, Sheik Salim, who foretold the birth of Akbar's son, Salim. When the son was born, Akbar began to build the royal city near the cave of the ascetic, who is known as the Chishti saint. It is a good legend, but Akbar may also have been influenced by the commanding prospect that his walled city would have over the flat countryside.\nNevertheless, the Emperor lived in Fatehpur Sikri for only 16 years. He shifted to Lahore to deal with discontent in the northwest and then moved back to Agra. His beautiful royal city, it seemed, had chronic water shortages.\nIn its glory Fatehpur Sikri must have been a glittering place indeed. In 1574, when Akbar was shifting his court between Agra and Fatehpur Sikri, which was still under construction, William Fitch, a British traveler and one of many foreigners welcomed by Akbar, described the life of the royal community:\n''The King hath in Agra and Fatehpur Sikri, 100 elephants, 30,000 horses, 1,400 tame deer, 800 concubines and such other store of leopard, tiger, buffaloes, cocks and hawks that it is very strange to see. Agra and Fatehpur Sikri are very great cities, either of them much greater than London.''\nT oday there remains only a settlement of a few thousand people, whose houses stretch down the hill from the monuments, palaces and the mosque on the crest. It is not a tourist town, and the townsfolk go about their business of selling goods to farmers in the area and caring for goats and buffaloes. There is an active market within the old caravanserai - a large enclosed square made of soft red sandstone - where the lower ranks dwelt. The shouts of peddlers still evoke the bawdy good humor of the people.\nThrough the market runs one of the roads to the Grand Mosque or Jamma Masjid, with its 176-foot-high victory gate looking out over the main road up to the citadel. The mosque itself is about 70 feet high and is said to be a copy of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, except that the pillars that enclose its three main chambers are carved in an elaborately ornamented Hindu style, with depictions of flower petals and animals, though no deities.\nThroughout the city there are echoes of Akbar's tolerance and his attempt to create a state religion combining elements of several beliefs. The Emperor, who extended Mogul rule through much of the south in the Mongolian conquest of India, entertained Jesuit priests at his courts and enjoyed their debates. His chief minister, Birbal, was a Hindu, who is celebrated in India today in hundreds of children's stories that emphasize his quick wit and cunning.\nAt one end of the mosque square is the small marble tomb of the Chishti saint. The intricately carved marble screens around the small building have many bits of thread tied to them. These are left by women who travel from all parts of the subcontinent to pray in hopes that they will conceive. The screens, which measure about 4 feet by 8 feet, have designs in the shape of stars, crescents and curlicues carved into them.\nBeyond the mosque area and separate from it on the northeast lip of the hill is the royal city itself, with more than 20 buildings ranging from huge palaces and barracks to jewel-like structures whose functions are still being debated by historians. This is the area for aimless meandering or discreet games of hide-and-seek.\nThere are all sorts of discoveries to be made, such as the frescoes on the walls of the house of Miriam, the wife who bore the son Akbar had sought. The frescoes have been defaced over the years, apparently by Moslems who believed that they violated Islamic prohibitions against graven images. One fresco seems to contain the wings of angels and is thought by some scholars to depict the Annunciation.\nIn a splendid two-story building called the house of Birbal, said to have been built by the chief minister for his daughter, there are four rooms decorated with elaborate geometrical carvings. Marble screens, cupolas, pilasters, recesses and arched doorways combine in symmetrical profusion. The craftsmanship is awesome, but unlike the Taj Mahal the building has a lived-in appearance - though the activities there may only be imagined.\nOn the second floor are carved marble screens behind which the royal harem gathered to view the passing scene outside. There is a half-buried round boulder in the lawn, a large cloister and a conference hall known as the Diwan-i-Am, or hall of public audience. It is believed that the Emperor's killer elephant was tethered to the stone and that convicts were hurled into the courtyard and left to the animal's mercy. If they were trampled, it was proof of guilt; if they were ignored by the beast, they were considered innocent.\nSuch bits of information are hard to glean. At the entrance there are people representing themselves as guides, but their historical knowledge and mastery of English vary greatly.\nMyth and fact blur in India. One wonderfully red-whiskered guide pointed to the Panch Mahal, the structure whose name means ''Five Building,'' and said, ''Panch Mahal, five stories.'' He held up his hand with fingers spread apart and counted. ''One, two, three, four, five.'' It did not really add much to his customer's awareness, but the guide's beard alone was worth whatever he charged.\nOne recommendation for those who like names and facts and want to know how tall whatever they are looking at is and when it was built is to buy ''A Handbook for Travellers in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,'' edited by Prof. L.F. Rushbrook Williams and published by John Murray in London. It is fairly expensive at about $27, but the price is worth it, and its section on Fatehpur Sikri, as on all other sites, is far more thorough and intelligible than any local guide. Signs in English at some buildings provide basic data.\nBut beyond the knowledge that comes with facts there are also the intuitive powers of the traveler, for which no more is needed than open eyes. For me the two most memorable sites at Fatehpur Sikri are the two small buildings that border the parchesi court.\nThe first is the Panch Mahal, the five-story building with its higher tiers diminishing in size like a wedding cake. On the first floor are 56 carved pillars holding up the second floor; no two of these are alike. The pillars are about eight feet tall, and their capitals provide a cornucopia of symbols for graphic artists, including leaves, petals and braided cords. The capital of one shows elephants with interlaced tusks; some have human forms, such as that of a man gathering fruit from a tree.\nAt the top of the building is a cupola to provide shade. It is an excellent place to picnic, and it is recommended that one bring sandwiches and a thermos. Lolling under the cupola, watching the green parrots swoop and hearing them call in the late afternoon is a rare experience, and the pleasures of doing nothing recapture the spirit of the age.\nThe second delight is the Diwan-i-Khas or private audience hall, a square two-story building whose interior is dominated by an ornate, massive octagonal pillar rising from the center and forming a sort of bowl at the upper story. This bowl is reached by marble bridges from the four corners. Its function is as obvious as that of a seesaw. Akbar must have sat on silken cushions in this marble fruit bowl, chatting with his advisers and generals. Perhaps supplicants were led in to cringe on the floor below as the lengthening rays of the sun pierced the marble screens. If one lies in the fruit bowl, it becomes clear that this was a position from which to command. Agra and Fatehpur Sikri Tours\nThe Indian Tourism Development Corporation provides tours of Agra from New Delhi that offer a Fatehpur Sikri visit as an option. Because of its distance from town, Fatehpur Sikri is less frequently visited, and the relative solitude is a benefit for those who go: It is one of the few places in India where you can be virtually alone for several minutes. Where to stay Most travelers will choose to stay in Agra, where the Mughal Sheraton is the newest and most luxurious hotel. But there are many other hotels in all price ranges, and the Government guesthouse in Fatehpur Sikri provides clean, sparsely furnished rooms for about $7 a night. The cost A taxi from Agra to Fatehpur Sikri and back costs about $20. The tourism corporation tour from Agra by air-conditioned bus for a twohour visit to Fatehpur Sikri is less than $3. If one has the time, staying over and walking the alleys and courtyards of the Mogul ghost town in early morning is well worth- while.M.T.K."}, {"text": "TRANSITIONAL PAINS AT THE FORD FOUNDATION\n1981-02-08T05:00:00.000Z\nNot long after he settled into his imposing office as the new president of the Ford Foundation, Franklin A. Thomas ordered blinds for the floor to ceiling windows and installed a screen of decorative planters. In the days of McGeorge Bundy, Mr. Thomas's predecessor, the curious had an unobstructed view of the president, who was frequently spotted with his feet on the desk in relaxed conversation.\nIn small and in significant ways, Mr. Thomas is setting a new style at the foundation. During his 13-year presidency, Mr. Bundy, a former White House adviser accustomed to shaping policy, reveled in using his position for public and often provocative pronouncements. Mr. Thomas, by contrast, has been reticent - maddeningly so, in the opinion of Ford observers and some members of the staff, who have been waiting 18 months for clear signals of the new administration's direction.\nIn what has surely been one of the longest transition periods for any large institution, Mr. Thomas has been almost totally absorbed in a painstaking analysis of every activity of the foundation. Meanwhile, the hiatus has baffled officials in the philanthropy circuit and, according to one foundation president, ''has caused disquiet among organizations which look to Ford for grants and worry which programs may be phased out.''\nBasic Questions and Root Changes\nTo add to the uneasiness of his staff, Mr. Thomas seems in no hurry to replace some senior Ford officials who have left since he arrived. There have been suggestions that the new president wants to have his preliminary biennial budget, to be submitted in March, firmly in hand before naming senior officers - possibly to forestall competition for resources among the ''barons.'' Moreover, his insistence that long-term officers justify activities that have gone on for years seems to have nettled some administrators accustomed to the Bundy style of enunciating policy and leaving its administration to others.\nBut a number of foundation administrators concede that any changeover causes trauma. An experienced official who is retiring from Ford noted it was time to ''shake the roots and prune'' at the 45-year-old foundation. Alexander Heard, who has headed Ford's board since 1972, said that at the time of Mr. Thomas's election, the trustees feared he might make changes in a rush. Instead, Mr. Heard says, ''He has taken his time, showed caution and that is the right way.'' Although there has been talk that the trustees have rejected programs and high level candidates proposed by Mr. Thomas, Mr. Heard insists that decisions have been worked out in conversational, not confrontational, manner.\nMr. Thomas, who is 46 years old, seems unperturbed by the ripples he has stirred. Soon after taking over, at a meeting with his senior advisers, he had pointedly told them, ''I'm not Mac, I'm Frank.'' Recalling this incident recently, he smilingly suggested that ''maybe I was too subtle.''\nWith assets of $2.2 billion, Ford is the country's wealthiest foundation. Like other private philanthropies, it has seen inflation erode the value of its dollars, but by diversifying investments, it has been able this year, for the first time in several years, to maintain the level of grants without dipping into capital. Still, pondering how Ford can hope to make an appreciable impact on the problems it has tried to address - hunger and population pressures abroad, urban blight and societal inequalities at home - Mr. Thomas said that his 18-month review has been a ''humbling experience.'' During its years of peak prosperity and grandest ambitions in the 60's, the foundation had assets valued at $4 billion and its annual grants topped $200 million. The slump in the stock and securities markets in the 70's compelled Mr. Bundy to reduce radically both programs and staff, but the cutbacks were accomplished mainly by ''miniaturizing,'' rather than by fundamental changes in direction.\nThe new president seems to have just such changes in view. In his post, he seems to be drawing on two major career experiences. During his years as director of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, he turned the experimental urban renewal program into a nationally-praised model in community revitalization. And, having served as board director for a number of large companies, he is also intimately familiar with the corporate world.\nSo far, a closer relationship between business and foundations is emerging as one of the hallmarks of the Thomas administration. In practical terms, this translates into developing joint programs overseas to tackle such problems as malnutrition and related health needs in third world countries. ''We could bring to the table our credibiliy, intellectual focus and some money,'' Mr. Thomas says. Admittedly, past abuses by multinational firms have soured relations in some countries, but Mr. Thomas argues that having Ford as a senior partner could make such ventures work. Pushing the partnership approach at home, Ford last year joined with seven corporations and foundations to form the Local Initiatives Support Corporation in an undertaking to revitalize decaying communities.\nMr. Thomas emphasizes that he favors this type of ''hands on'' activity, rather than ''studies leading to more studies.'' He also wants to expand assistance at local community levels, arguing that aid has to be supplied both at the top and at the bottom, ''the macro blended with the micro.'' This commitment is reflected, for example, in a plan to provide outside financing for Bangladesh banking firms and induce them to extend credits to small, rural cooperatives or to individual farmers otherwise unable to purchase equipment, fertilizer and high-yield seed.\n''Thomas essentially is a doer, an organizer, manager or arranger with a great social consciousness, as much as Bundy's or maybe more, but with a very different style,'' says Harold Howe, a Ford vice president who has worked with both men and will retire this spring. In some areas, Mr. Thomas is advocating more intense engagement. In the past, the foundation has worked in reception centers, helping South-East Asian refugees with language training to ease resettlement. It is considering stepped up aid for African refugees and help for Mexican and Caribbean migrants.\nAnother Thomas emphasis is on women's issues. He has doubled Ford's outlay for programs aimed at advancing women's opportunities and has started to examine all Ford grants to determine their impact on women. Closer to home, he has approved the innovative practice of paid parental leaves for Ford employees, to permit fathers as well as mothers to spend time with newborn children.\nBut elsewhere, Mr. Thomas thinks that Ford has extended itself beyond its means. The foundation will continue devoting a third of its $100 million annual budget to foreign aid, but large-scale support for population control is being phased out because it has entered the ''world agenda'' and is getting larger funds from United Nations agencies. Some overseas offices are probably going to be closed. ''We cannot do everything,'' Mr. Thomas says simply.\nCommenting on the Thomas philosophy, Waldemar A. Nielsen, a foundation consultant and author who has known all of the Ford presidents, has said that Franklin Thomas seems to be bringing to the foundation ''a new perspective that is in harmony with the more pragmatic, if not conservative mood in the country.'' His low-key style has puzzled some, but Mr. Waldemar thinks that Mr. Thomas ''may turn out to be the leading force in philanthropy in the years ahead.'"}, {"text": "DAYS OF CAPTIVITY: THE HOSTAGES' STORY\n1981-02-04T05:00:00.000Z\nFROM THOSE INSIDE, AN ACCOUNT OF HOW THE EMBASSY FELL AND HOW THEY ENDURED CAPTIVITY THE EMBASSY OCCUPIED The Narrators\nThis description of the embassy takeover and the 14 1/2 months that 52 Americans spent as hostages in Iran, based on detailed interviews, is from and about these men and women: Thomas L.

Kennedy Jr., the mission's thirdranking diplomat, was in his second floor office as a seething crowd of Iranian demonstrators shrieked outside.\n''I remember standing in a window and looking down on all the noise and anti-American anger,'' the economics specialist said. ''And I wondered to myself what it would be like to die.''\nOn the broad avenue of Takht-E-Jamshid outside, the throng of 450 angry young protesters had appeared at 7:30 A.M., as it had for days, to take up its venomous chant:\n''Death to the Shah!'' ''Death to Carter!'' ''Death to America!'' Two weeks earlier, on Oct. 22, the overthrown Shah of Iran, Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, had been admitted to the United States for cancer treatment. Since then, the demonstrators had grown increasingly hostile in daily protests outside the whitewashed brick walls of the park-like embassy compound.\nNow, the crowd's rage had reached a fever pitch. Many members of the embassy staff were openly uneasy. At midmorning, a Marine guard burst into Mr. Kennedy's office and shouted: ''Everybody downstairs! There's a break-in.'' Screaming protesters had breached the great wrought-iron main gates and were pouring over the walls. Some waved clubs and sticks. Huge posters of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini bobbed on poles as the crowd went wild.\n''I looked out again as we left,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''and saw this sea of fanatical faces and heard these voices. They were like - they were lowing for death.''\nIt was the opening cry of an international crisis that was to last for 444 days, a siege that would scar the lives of scores of American hostages and their families, transform the United States and Iran into almost warlike enemies and rally Americans together in a sense of outrage and national purpose that had not been seen in years.\nThe story of the embassy takeover and of the hostages' experiences in captivity is an account of men and women who explored the limits of human endurance in an ordeal that led to several attempted escapes and at least two attempted suicides.\nIt is, in many respects, an ugly story. No hostage reported subjection to systematic torture, mutilation or sexual abuse. But all were mentally or physically maltreated and many have come home with bitter feelings for their Iranian captors. Some also speak ill of the clergymen who visited them in captivity, of the Carter Administration, the Iranian revolution and, reflecting the tensions of their ordeal, of one another.\nSome tell of beatings, mock executions and cruel episodes of Russian roulette. A few describe the agonies of months of solitary confinement in dank, windowless dungeons and dark closets. Most relate ordeals of deprivation, in which conversation, fresh air, exercise, news, mail and showers were forbidden.\nThere are also accounts of the kinds of resourcefulness well known to prisoners: the use of toilet paper and wastebaskets as secret communication links; nicknames and words of contempt for captors in codes and languages the Iranians did not understand; a marine's morale-boosting cartoon drawings; arm-wrestling matches between one hostage and a guard, and hours spent teaching English and other subjects to captors.\nMost, however, recount a time of boredom, loneliness and doubt, of bad food, filthy living conditions and numbing routine relieved only by books, playing cards, solitary thoughts and occasional conversations with, or outbursts of defiance against, their captors.\nThe captors emerge as people with goals, desires, faults and opinions on matters ranging from politics and revolution to cookery and culture, and with personalities ranging from brutal to friendly and even compassionate.\nThe accounts, above all, show the complexity of a tale that involves 52 to 66 Americans held by hundreds of Iranians in dozens of places in addition to the embassy, including apartments, homes and jails in Teheran, Tabriz, Qum, Isfahan and other cities and villages. Some were moved as many as 24 times.\nThe United States Embassy in Teheran is a 27-acre compound of trees, lawns and some 25 buildings crisscrossed by paths and driveways and surrounded by 8-to 12-foot walls secured by a number of metal gates.\nIt is an imposing setting, even by diplomatic standards, situated between elegant and ugly extremes of a city of four million people dating to Ninth Century Persia. To the south rises the dazzling downtown skyline of palaces, monuments and skyscrapers; to the north lie slums, with shanties and open sewers. The peaks of the Alborz Mountains shimmer in the background.\nThe main buildings in the compound are the chancery, near the south wall; the consulate, on the west; the residences of the ambassador and his deputy on the east; an apartment building for visitors, to the north; and in the middle a warehouse known as the Mushroom Inn.. Barracks, guard houses, a commissary and utility buildings dot the compound.\nLike most embassies, it was a militarily indefensible position. Just 13 Marine guards with light arms and a handful of civilian personnel were responsible for the security of an area roughly the size of 25 city blocks bounded by a mile-long wall.\nSundays are working days in the Islamic world, and Nov. 4 began as had many earlier days, both inside and outside the compound. The day was overcast, and early-morning temperatures hovered in the 40's as the embassy personnel arrived for work, joined by dozens of Iranians who served in clerical posts and as guards.\nRelations between the United States and Iran had badly deteriorated, and one result was that the top-ranking officials of the embassy were not present on the day of the takeover. A new United States Ambassador, Walter L. Cutler, had been named the previous April to succeed William H. Sullivan, but his selection had been rejected by a new Iranian Government anxious to register its displeasure with Washington. Mr. Cutler had never taken up his post.\nThe embassy was under the direction of a charge d'affaires, L. Bruce Laingen, a career Foreign Service officer. On the morning of the takeover, he and Victor L. Tomseth, the embassy's senior political officer, and Michael H. Howland, a security officerchauffeur, went to the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Foroughi Avenue, a mile to the south, to discuss continuing diplomatic problems.\nThat left Moorhead Kennedy in nominal charge of the staff, with security in the hands of Col. Leland Holland, an Army officer who was chief of security. Mr. Kennedy recalled that the embassy had repeatedly warned the State Department, after the Shah was hospitalized in the United States, that the situation was getting out of hand and that Iran could not be relied upon to protect the embassy in case of attack. The warning was apparently ignored.\n''That was a fundamental mistake,'' Mr. Kennedy said. Allowing the former Shah into the United States had given the militants the excuse they were seeking, he said, adding: ''We threw a burning branch into a bucket full of kerosene.''\nAs the Sunday morning wore on, the menace from the demonstrators outside the walls seemed to grow, and staff workers inside watched with mounting concern. Some were ordered to lock their safes and offices.\nBut it was too late. The invasion began between 10:15 and 10:30 A.M. ''To put it bluntly,'' said Sgt. James M. Lopez, a young marine, ''all hell broke loose and we couldn't stop it.''\nDozens of Americans - perhaps as many as 45, but in any case most of the embassy's personnel - were trapped in the chancery when the mob, armed with sticks, baseball bats, lead pipe clubs and, by some accounts, a few pistols, rushed into the compound.\nElsewhere on the grounds, at least 14 members of the embassy staff were in the consulate; four others were in the apartment building inside the north wall and three were in the warehouse. A few Americans were outside the embassy compound. To many, it was unclear what was happening or what the Iranians intended to do.\n''We did expect the possibility that they would come over the wall and burn some buildings, but it was low on the list of possibilities,'' said Duane L. Gillette, a Navy petty officer involved in low-level intelligence work. ''The fact that it happened just showed that we were unprepared.''\nAt the chancery, the heavy front doors were bolted shut by marines who retreated from the main gatehouse as the crowds rushed up the steps and began pounding to get in. As he fell back, Cpl. Westley Williams pulled out his walkie-talkie and radioed a warning to all security personnel in the compound.\nEmbassy personnel inside the chancery, meanwhile, were ordered to high-security areas behind heavy steel doors on the top floor of the two-story brick building. Looking out windows, some saw a bedsheet banner with a message in English suggesting that the demonstrators wanted access to the building only to stage a sit-in.\nMeanwhile, several marines, including Corporal Williams, who had put on flak jackets and helmets, began prying open a case of rifles, shotguns and pistols on the ground floor of the chancery. They also carried tear gas grenades.\nAlan B. Golacinski, the embassy's regional security officer, reached Mr. Laingen by radio just as the charge d'affaires was leaving the Iranian Foreign Ministry. Mr. Laingen decided to stay at the Foreign Ministry rather than return to the besieged embassy.\n''It was clear at that point,'' Mr. Laingen said, ''that I could not ever have gotten there physically.'' To minimize bloodshed, he ordered that no guns be fired at Iranians. Later, when it became apparent that the invaders intended to seize the compound, Mr. Laingen ordered the destruction of secret documents.\nNo shots were fired and only tear gas was used in what proved to be a delaying action to give the document-shredders time to work. Corporal Williams recalled that Mr. Golacinski had asked Mr. Laingen's permission to go outside to try to persuade the demonstrators to disperse. Mr. Golacinski went out and, moments later, apparently became one of the first hostages.\nSoon afterward, Mr. Kennedy looked out a second-floor window and saw Mr. Golacinski being led around outside with his hands tied behind him. ''Golacinski was outside yelling in to us to surrender, that resistance wouldn't work in the long run,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''We were delaying. We didn't know there was a pistol at his head.''\nIn the east wing of the chancery's 30-room second floor, activity by American and Iranian employees was feverish. This area, consisting of the charge d'affaire's office and the political and communications sections, was sealed off by steel security doors.\nA group of about 10 persons, following contingency plans, was locked behind the six-inch-thick steel doors of the top-secret security vault. They shredded documents, smashed electronic equipment and fed codebooks and other secret data into grinders.\nOthers in sealed-off outer offices manned radios and telephones, calling Washington and Iranian Government officials. Before the lines went dead, some calls reached the State Department, but Iranian officials were either unreachable or unresponsive.\nJohn W. Limbert Jr., a political officer, reached the office of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. ''I kept saying to the man on the phone, 'What are you going to do?' And they kept saying that help is on the way - sort of like, 'The check is in the mail.' And I kept saying 'But what are you going to do? They're coming through the windows.' ''\nThe Iranians got into the chancery by rolling up a truck, attaching chains to the bars of basement windows and ripping them away. Sometime before noon, the intruders began pouring into the basement.\n''There were between 300 and 500 of them and they came in like water over a dam,'' said Charles Jones Jr., a communications specialist. The embassy personnel, he said, ''kept moving to higher floors, like people trying to escape a sinking ship.''\nCorporal Williams and another marine, Sgt. John D. McKeel Jr., under orders not to fire, met the invaders on a stairway, leveled their shotguns and started backing up. Two tear gas grenades were set off and the marines donned masks as gas began billowing through the area. Sergeant McKeel sprayed one attacker in the face with chemical Mace.\nRemembering the crated weapons on the first floor, the marines ran upstairs and grabbed armfuls of rifles and shotguns and fled toward the second floor as the shouting invaders moved up from the basement.\nOn the top floor, the weapons-laden marines reached the secure east wing. They were admitted, and Iranian employes were let out through the big steel doors. There were closed-circuit television cameras inside, enabling embassy personnel to see what was happening outside the secure doors. But what they saw did not help.\nAt least one bound, blindfolded hostage, possibly Mr. Golacinski, was being held in front of the television camera. Over a hand-held radio that had been taken from him, an Iranian told those inside that the hostage would be killed if they did not open up. It was sometime between noon and 1 P.M.\nWith the bulk of the group facing imminent surrender, 10 Americans, including Mr. Jones and Frederick L. Kupke, a communications officer and electronics specialist, locked themselves in the top-secret vault room at the far end of the wing and continued shredding material.\nThe decision to surrender ''just happened,'' according to Mr. Kennedy. ''No one was really in charge,'' he said. ''And anyway, to hold out longer wouldn't have changed things.''\nThe outer doors swung open and the Iranians, eyes watering from the tear gas, rushed in. Searching the area, they realized that there were more Americans in the vault room. Efforts to burn through to the vault room with blow torches failed.\nThen, an Iranian leader grabbed a hostage, held a knife at his throat and threatened to kill him unless those in the vault surrendered. ''It was now about 3 or 3:30 P.M.,'' Mr. Jones said, ''and most of the classified documents had been destroyed.'' Before coming out, however, the last holdouts slammed and locked the safe.\nThe Iranians, finding virtually all documents shredded and the safe locked, were enraged. They attacked the holdouts. ''They kicked me in the ribs, stepped on my hands and held a gun to my head,'' said Mr. Jones. ''They wanted to know why I was helping Americans. They thought that as a black man I should be on their side. They said the papers belonged to the people of Iran, not to us.''\n''They wanted the combinations to some of the safes,'' Mr. Kupke recalled. ''I was kicked and knocked down on the floor. There were two or three guys on each leg and a couple of guys on each arm. One of them pulled out a knife, a pretty good-sized pocket knife. The guy in charge said, 'Open up the safes.' I said I couldn't. He said, 'If you don't we'll cut your eyes out,' and I said 'I can't.' ''\n''The other guy,'' he continued, ''then put the knife blade against my eye -the bottom of my eye, and I proceeded to squirm and tried to convince them that that wasn't the thing to do. I was really scared.''\nAnother of the holdouts in the vault, who asked to remain anonymous, said he had the vault's combination coded on a piece of paper in his wallet. A terrorist searching him found the scrap, but did not realize what it was. ''Then he took a bill of lading, which was absolutely meaningless, out of the wallet and kept that,'' the holdout related. When he was alone later, the hostage said, he ate the paper bearing the combination.\nAfter these assaults, Mr. Jones said, ''We were blindfolded and hoods were placed over our heads. We were then led out into the hallway and forced to face the wall or kneel or sit.''\nAs militants began scouring the embassy premises, the new captives were pulled into the hallway, searched, bound with plastic tape and blindfolded. Then they were taken outside, where large crowds chanted: ''God Is Great!'' ''Long Live Khomeini!'' and other slogans.\nDonald R. Hohman, an Army medic, vividly recalled the moment: ''They took me to the outside of the embassy, removed the blindfold and made me face what looked to me like at least two million screaming Iranians. They were yelling, 'Death to the Americans!' over and over and over and over until it was like an earthquake, there was so much vibration from the noise.\n''It sounded like the walls were going to come down on top of me. The whole building was shaking. I have never been so terrified of anything in my whole life. I must have turned white all over with fear. I muttered to one of the guards, 'Please, please take me back inside.' And pretty soon they did.''\nFinally, the hostages were marched across the embassy compound to the ambassador's residence, where they were distributed to various rooms, tied to chairs and told to keep silent.\nSgt. Rodney V. Sickmann, a young Marine guard, said he felt the surrender had been handled as well as possible. ''If somebody had fired a shot,'' he said, ''we probably would all have been shot.''\nIn the two-story consulate building, the place where American travelers went for aid and Iranian immigrants obtained visas for the United States, 60 or 70 people were seeking information or help. On hand also were at least 14 Americans, including several Foreign Service officers.\nUsually, two marines were on duty at the consulate. But Richard H. Morefield, the Consul General, had cut back visa services the day before because of the demonstrations, and as a result only one marine, Sergeant Lopez, was there.\nRichard I. Queen, a consular official who was released after 250 days as a hostage because he contracted multiple sclerosis, also was on duty in the consulate. He said the first word that militants had broken into the compound was overheard on Sergeant Lopez's radio.\n''The news we received was very sketchy,'' Mr. Queen said. ''But shortly afterwards, we started noticing that some of the militants were gathered around the consulate.'' When they moved in, Mr. Morefield ''gave the word that we were to leave the consulate,'' Mr. Queen said.\nThrough a large sliding door on the north side of the building, the consulate had direct access to Bist Metri Street. To their surprise, the consular officials found no protesters there and began moving out in small groups to attract less attention.\nSergeant Lopez remained behind to destroy equipment and drive back the invaders with tear gas grenades. Most of the Americans, including Mr. Morefield and Mr. Queen, were captured nearby, but others escaped, and they gave Sergeant Lopez much of the credit.\n''We turned to the left and walked quickly, not running,'' said Mr. Morefield. Three or four blocks away ''they surrounded us and said 'Come with us.' I said, 'You've got the building - it's yours,' and they told me: 'You're a hostage.' ''\n''The group I was in was about six people,'' Mr. Queen said. ''We started walking and we got about two blocks when we noticed that a group of militants were following us, running after us. We were walking slowly.'' Any inclination to run was forgotten, he said, when a police officer appeared and ''fired a shot over our heads.'' They were then led back by militants who shouted ''C.I.A.!'' and antiAmerican slogans.\nKim King, an American tourist who was at the consulate to discuss some complications concerning his visa, followed five American consular officials on a circuitous route through the streets, then made his own way to Mehrabad Airport and left Iran without incident. The five consular officials were to have a more noteworthy adventure.\nThey were, in fact, beginning an odyssey that was to become one of the most celebrated episodes of the hostage crisis. The five, Robert G. Anders, Kathleen and Joseph Stafford and Cora and Mark Lijek, made a lucky turn and hurried to Mr. Anders's apartment nearby.\nOver the next five days, the five Americans hid in three or four homes, including those of two Americans being held hostage, and they kept in touch by telephone with Mr. Laingen at the Foreign Ministry. Mr. Laingen, in an effort to get them out of the country, nearly blew their cover.\nHe told the Iranian chief of protocol and his colleagues that the five were free in the city. ''We were in effect asking the Government of Iran's cooperation in insuring their security and facilitating their departure,'' Mr. Laingen recalled.\n''They in effect threw up their hands, saying 'Oh, my God, we've got enough to worry about with all that compound situation. Let's not worry about this now.' We never raised it with them again.'' Within days, it was clear they should not have said anything, but the Iranians had apparently forgotten the matter.\nFinally, the five called the Canadian Embassy and were greeted with an invitation to refuge. In late January 1980, they and Henry Lee Schatz, an American agricultural attache who was away at the time of the takeover and had found refuge in the Swedish Embassy, were spirited out of Iran with the help of the Canadians.\nSergeant Lopez, whose rear-guard actions probably saved the five from captivity, was not as lucky. The sergeant was somehow under the impression that the Canadians had a car waiting outside to spirit Americans away.\n''If I had been two seconds quicker, I would have been in the Canadian Embassy also,'' he told CBS News. ''But I evacuated everyone and had torn the red stripes off my blue trousers and thrown an old windbreaker over myself and tried to look as scuzzy as possible to pass for an Iranian.\n''And I was locking all the doors, barricading as much as possible to give them a hard time to get into the building and the last door I locked I came out,and I found out later that as I was walking out the door the car from the Canadian Embassy was driving off. So, it was the luck of the draw with me.''\nAs the takeover began, four unarmed marines, including Sgt. William Quarles and Sgt. Ladell Maples, overheard Corporal Williams's radioed warnings and barricaded themselves in a room on the top floor of the 10-story apartment building at the north end of the compound. With them was the wife of an Iranian employee of the embassy.\nAfter pulling on fatigues and flak jackets, they went to a window and watched in amazement as the Iranians moved over the grounds. Sometime afterward, a band of Iranians entered and began searching the apartment building, which was almost vacant at the time. Led by a man with a pistol, they soon burst into the room where the marines were gathered.\n''Hands up,'' the gunman shouted. The woman was released. The marines were searched, then led downstairs, where they encountered a contingent of Iranian national police officers who apparently had come to turn the captors out and the prisoners loose.\nA heated argument developed between the police and the gunman. A police officer pulled Sergeant Quarles's hands down and the gunman shoved them back up again, and that is where they stayed. It was a symbolic victory for the Iranian protesters, who were now clearly in command.\nAt 10:30 A.M., as the Iranian mobs were breaching the walls of the compound, the embassy's top officials, Mr. Laingen and Mr. Tomseth, were just leaving the Foreign Ministry. They had gone there to discuss possible diplomatic status for some of the embassy's military personnel and, having had little success, they were heading back to the embassy.\nAs they reached their waiting car, the driver-security man, Mr. Howland, told them he had monitored a message over the car radio. There was trouble at the embassy, he said. Mr. Tomseth recalled:\n''We got in and started out, but we had not gone more than a few hundred yards when a second message came to the effect that there were hundreds of people pouring into the embassy compound and that it was advisable that we not return just yet.''\nTurning back to the Foreign Ministry, not so much to take refuge as to seek the help of the Iranian Government in ousting the intruders, Mr. Laingen and Mr. Tomseth found no one willing to take charge. They saw the chief of protocol, the senior Under Secretary, the deputy to the senior Under Secretary; all seemed unable to do anything.\nBy afternoon, Foreign Minister Ibrahim Yazdi appeared, but he had troubles of his own. Within 48 hours, he would lose his job to Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, and already his authority in revolutionary Iran was so vitiated that, as Mr. Tomseth put it, ''Had he gone over to the embassy, he not only would not have gotten those people out of there, he might well have been taken hostage himself.''\nMr. Laingen, Mr. Tomseth and Mr. Howland camped all day in the Foreign Minister's office. ''I staged a kind of sit-in at the Foreign Minister's desk, refusing to go and pressing throughout for assistance,'' Mr. Laingen said. By evening, Mr. Yazdi, apparently willing to promise them anything to get rid of them, told Mr. Laingen that the militants would be removed the next day.\n''We didn't believe it,'' Mr. Tomseth said. ''It was clear he wanted us to leave. He wanted us to go, anywhere, he didn't care. But we insisted on staying.''\nThe Americans spent the night on couches in diplomatic reception rooms on the third floor. The next day, further efforts to gain Government help to oust the embassy invaders proved futile, and another night was spent on the couches.\nThen, 48 hours after the takeover, Iran's clergy-dominated Revolutionary Council ruled that the three Americans should be given ''protection'' at the Foreign Ministry. They were told they could leave, but that safe conduct anywhere could not be guaranteed. And though they were not heavily guarded, they decided to attempt no escape and to do nothing that might jeopardize resolution of the crisis.\nThus, their change from guests to hostages came subtly, almost imperceptibly, Mr. Tomseth said. Theirs was by far the most civil treatment accorded any of the hostages. For all but the last few weeks of the crisis, when they were sent to a prison, the three were housed in a well-furnished former diplomatic dining room, 40 feet by 60 feet, with Persian carpets and crystal chandeliers. They were given blankets, sheets, mattresses, bedrolls, cots, card tables, chairs, a couch, writing materials and a table for table tennis.\nAt first, they were given a couple of 24-hour-a-day telephone lines to Washington, as well as access to the Foreign Ministry's Telex facilities. But these became, after a while, almost vestigial diplomatic tools. ''We found we didn't have that much to say most of the time,'' said Mr. Tomseth.\nAfter the first hectic radio messages on the day of the takeover, there was no contact between the three men at the Foreign Ministry and the hostages at the compound until the day, 443 days later, that they were all released.\nLife at the Foreign Ministry was humdrum, if not oppressive. The Iranian diplomatic staff - the career professionals, as opposed to the political appointees - ''were absolutely appalled at what had happened and totally sympathetic to us,'' Mr. Tomseth said. But they could offer little but sympathy.\nIn contrast to the turmoil at the embassy compound a mile to the south, the office of the Iran-America Society on Teheran's Park Avenue was almost somnolent. Kathryn L. Koob, the director, was holding a staff conference, talking of ways to put the educational and cultural exchange program back on its feet. It had been virtually shut down by the Iranian revolution.\nSuddenly, the phone rang. It was an Iranian director of the society, whom Miss Koob declined to identify, with word of trouble at the embassy. Under instructions to wait for a call from the embassy in such an event, Miss Koob waited until she could stand it no longer.\n''I called the embassy and I heard this strange voice at the switchboard say, 'Embassy occupied.' '' She then called Mr. Laingen's secretary, Elizabeth Montagne, on a private line.\n''I understand you've got company.'' ''You'd be surprised what's going on around here,'' Miss Montagne replied. ''Kate!'' - it was Elizabeth Ann Swift, a political officer, on an extension - ''we're under attack. Bruce is at the Foreign Office - -''\nSuddenly, the line went dead. The compound had fallen. Throughout the day and into the next, she, her bilingual Iranian secretaries and William B. Royer Jr., a teacher who had formerly been director of the society, kept tuned to Iranian radio and television stations for news and, with an open telephone line to the State Department, sent summaries and recapitulations to Washington.\nOn the afternoon of Nov. 5, six Iranians arrived at the society office, but Miss Koob slipped out the back door with her secretaries and fled to the German Institute, just around the corner. Later, after the Iranians had gone, they returned to the office and resumed the calls to Washington.\nIn the late afternoon, however, a much larger group of Iranians appeared and surrounded the office. There was no escape. The Iranian secretaries were released, but Miss Koob and Mr. Royer were taken to the embassy compound. There, like the other hostages, they were bound, blindfolded and forbidden to talk.\nThe first days and weeks in captivity were the worst for many hostages. Nearly all were housed in the ambassador's residence, and were bound to chairs or handcuffed and blindfolded 24 hours a day. They were forbidden to speak and denied showers, exercise and activity of any sort, except for meager meals and trips to the bathroom.\nThere were interrogations, death threats, humiliations before screaming crowds and television cameras, at least one mock execution, daily propaganda harangues and cruelties that ranged from incidents of Russian roulette to incarceration in a closet.\nThe women were separated from the men after the first few days, and the hostages were distributed in smaller groups to various buildings in the compound, but the rigors were unchanged.\nA whispered word by Charles Jones, the communications specialist, to a fellow hostage drew swift retribution from a guard behind him who ''grabbed my head, pulled it back, slammed it into a wall and told me to shut up.''\n''I shut up,'' he said. In the climate of fear and uncertainty that prevailed at the time, every move held terrors. ''On the second day,'' Duane Gillette, the Navy petty officer, said, ''they moved me from one room to another. They blindfolded me for it. One of the others was moved before me. When he went, I heard a shotgun blast. Then they came for me.''\nThe blast was apparently an accident, and no one was hurt. What had seemed like a pending execution was simply a move to the next room, Mr. Gillette said.\nTwo days later, Jerry Miele, a communications officer, and several other hostages were paraded blindfolded before roaring crowds in scenes that were televised to a shocked world. ''They took me outside to the crowd,'' he recalled. ''I thought I was going to get it there.''\nThe fear of death was present even in more relaxed moments. The hostages were guarded around the clock by young Iranian gunmen, many of them students who were ill at ease with their weapons. ''The first week, they had about five people in there with weapons - they were really paranoid,'' said Sergeant Sickmann, who feared that he would be shot accidentally.\nFor a week, Sergeant Sickmann was bound so tightly that his wrists and arms hurt. He could see nothing, say nothing and, after a while, could feel very little. As wearying hours passed into days, the sergeant, who would later awe his captors with feats of armwrestling and calisthenics, grew stiff with inactivity.\n''There was about 15 of us,'' he said. ''and we were sitting at this long table, and I was tied to the back of the chair. You could never get out of this chair, except to go to the toilet. If you wanted to lay your head down, they'd put a pillow on the table. Otherwise, we just sat there until nighttime, when they'd put us on the floor. They'd tie our hands and feet and cover us.''\nIn the middle of his second night in captivity, Mr. Morefield, the Consul General, was awakened by gunmen. ''Are you Richard Morefield?'' one asked. ''Yes.'' ''Come with us.'' Mr. Morefield said he thought he was going to be executed. He and some other hostages were herded into a van and driven somewhere - he believes it was a student dormitory in northwest Teheran - and there he was subjected to the first of three mock executions that he would experience.\n''It was absolute terror,'' he said. He and five other hostages were dragged into what appeared to be a shower room and seated on a plain wood bench. There was a drain in the floor. Visions of their own blood flowing down the drain overwhelmed some.\nMr. Morefield recalled: ''So I just started praying'' - mostly Hail Marys, he said - and listening in an agony of suspense as the captors behind them cocked the hammers and clicked the triggers of their weapons.\nOn the same night, Moorhead Kennedy, the economics specialist, was also awakened about 2 A.M. and taken to a car. A blanket was thrown over his head, and he could hear weapons being loaded into the trunk. ''Some other hostage in the car - I think it was a marine - whispered when he heard the guns rattle that two people already had been shot,'' Mr. Kennedy said.\nBut he and a few others were sent to ''a very fancy home,'' where life improved. Though still under orders not to talk, he said, he and his fellow captives were able to whisper, pass notes in bathrooms and pass the time with chess, card games, books from the embassy library and an occasional censored news magazine.\nOn the third night, Robert O. Blucker, an economics officer, recalled that Ayatollah Khomeini's son, Sayed Ahmed Khomeini, came to the compound ''to see the Persians and greet them and encourage them in what they were doing.''\n''He was fingering his 'worry beads' and smiling and talking to them,'' Mr. Blucker said. ''He didn't want to look at any of us. We were allowed to stand around in this crowd of Persians and watch the proceedings, but he never acknowledged our presence in any way. I figured at this point that the whole affair had Government backing.''\nAfter the first few weeks, the treatment of most hostages improved. Blindfolds came off. Bonds were kept on some, but were loosened. Talking was still prohibited, but enforcement was relaxed. Meals were more regular. Exercise was permitted. Terrors were ebbing and life began falling into rigorous routines.\nNot for everyone, however. ''I remained blindfolded and bound and prohibited from talking from Nov. 4, 1979, to March 17, 1980,'' said Mr. Jones. ''I remember that day because it was my wife's birthday and St. Patrick's Day.''\nFor Col. Charles W. Scott, an Army attache, life as a captive was just the reverse of that of most hostages: he was treated reasonably well for a few days, then subjected to solitary confinement, mock executions and other cruelties. The change apparently came as a result of interrogations when the militants ''accused me of being a spy.''\nThe interrogations, which began soon after the embassy takeover and continued for weeks, were harsh for some and easy for others. Some hostages were openly defiant; others were cooperative.\nThe treatment they were accorded in their captivity sometimes, but not always, appeared to be related to their performances in the interrogations and whether they were perceived to be spies. There were other factors, too, including their positions on the embassy staff and the degree to which they complied with their captors' wishes.\nThere were two sources of information on possible spies among the hostages. One was a State Department document that the militants brandished on Dec. 1 and said they had found in the embassy files. It suggested that Malcolm Kalp, an economics and commercial officer, and William Daugherty, a political officer, were intelligence agents.\nThe militants also found a false Belgian passport in the possession of Thomas L. Ahern Jr., the embassy's narcotics liaison officer. The passport appeared to suggest that Mr. Ahern had a double identity and possibly a dual role in Iran.\nMr. Kalp, who spent 374 days in solitary confinement, more than any other hostage, has denied that he is a Central Intelligency Agency operative. He has said that his alleged role as a spy had nothing to do with his harsh treatment in the hands of the Iranians; that, he said, stemmed from his unwillingness to cooperate and his attempted escapes.\nSoon after the embassy fell, Miss Montagne, Mr. Laingen's secretary, was taken roughly to a gunman who demanded the combinations of locked embassy safes, combinations that she did not know. In one of the most chilling accounts of the captivity, she told NBC News how he had put a gun loaded with one bullet to her heart.\n''He went click, and the bullet went up one chamber - I could feel it go up,'' she said. ''And then he said, 'I'm a very good judge of character, and I know you're lying to me.' And I said, 'If you think I'm lying you're a lousy judge of character, because I'm telling you the truth: I cannot open those safes.'\n''Then he went click and the bullet went up another notch.'' There was further dispute over what she knew and ''click - the bullet up another notch.''\n''Is this worth dying for?'' the gunman asked.\n''I said, 'No, it's not,' and he went click, and the bullet went up another notch.\n''And I - this little game must have taken about four, five, minutes, it seemed an eternity - and I can remember my mind being very, very clear, and very, very sharp. I remember my heart trying to jump out of my chest. He kept pointing the gun at me, and the last - there was one click to go.\n''And he said, 'Do you think I'll pull the trigger?'\n''And the only thing I could think of was, 'I wonder what it would feel like to have bullets go through my chest.' Then, I thought, 'Well, it can't hurt for long.'\n''We stared at each other, and then he - he put the gun down. He said, 'O.K., so you don't know the combinations.' ''I just kind of collapsed.''\nMiss Swift also was subjected to the torments of a gunman seeking the combination of a safe. She knew the combination.\n''You've got five minutes to open the safe or I'll kill you,'' he told her. ''I didn't think he would,'' she said. ''I lied and said I couldn't.'' She waited five minutes and nothing happened.\n''I am very familiar with the kind of courage it takes to fight in combat,'' said Colonel Scott, who served in Vietnam and won the Silver Star and the Bronze Star. ''But I say there is a different kind of courage to face interrogators when you are completely alone and don't know when you are ever going to see another American or whether you are going to get out of the situation alive and in one piece.''\nThe colonel, under questioning by the Iranians, said his mission was to help the Iranian Army obtain spare parts for nonlethal military equipment, but his captors did not believe him. As a result, he said, he was kept in prison throughout his captivity, including eight weeks in solitary confinement.\n''I was never permitted to leave my cell except blindfolded, even to go to the toilet,'' Colonel Scott said. ''In the entire 14 1/2 months, other than the last 25 days, I had only spent 11 days in a cell where it was possible to see daylight. The rest of the time, I was in a cell that amounted to a closet - no windows, no circulation of air.''\nMichael J. Metrinko, an embassy political officer, was also accused of being a spy. He said his captors had seized many of his papers - files, classified reports and address books that listed many Iranian friends he had made in three years of service there - and regarded these as proof of nefariousness.\nHe was amused rather than broken by their interrogation technique, however. They had evidently been told that they could successfully break down a suspect by long periods of intensive questioning. Mr. Metrinko was, in fact, grilled for six hours at a time. But the captors then made the mistake of letting him sleep between sessions.\nThe duration of the questioning varied widely. Mr. Kennedy's interrogation lasted only a few minutes; after his captors found that he was an economics specialist, they seemed to lose interest in him. Col. Thomas E. Schaefer, an Air Force attache, was questioned four to eight hours a day for two weeks.\n''They kept telling me I was black and should help the oppressed people of the world,'' Charles Jones said. He was questioned five times. ''I kept telling them that Iran was their country, and that I had nothing to do with their revolution - that I was an American first.''\nMr. Blucker, the economics officer, was taken to a house in north Teheran and kept in handcuffs on a cold floor for weeks. He repeatedly refused to tell his captors where his apartment was, sure they wanted only to loot it. He was beaten by a group that included a ''monstrous little dwarf'' with a pistol stuck in his belt and ''two or three terrorist thugs.''\nThe interrogations became less frequent after about two weeks, and the first major development of the hostage crisis occurred: On Nov. 19 and 20, 13 of the hostages - five female secretaries and eight black men - were released in what the militants evidently regarded as a propaganda coup.\nMr. Jones was the only black kept in custody; he never learned why he was not released, or why he was treated so harshly. Miss Koob and Miss Swift assumed that it was because of their relatively high positions on the staff that they were the only women not released.\nThe release raised many false hopes among other hostages. Mr. Metrinko, who had been kept with one of the blacks who was allowed to leave, said: ''I could hear the guards discussing the release of the hostages. They kept discussing taking them out to the airport and having reporters talk to them about their treatment. I was naturally overjoyed.''\nThen, the crushing truth emerged. ''I realized when the guards talked the next day about the reception at the airport that they had left.''\nWhen Mr. Blucker was moved to the house in north Teheran, Colonel Schaefer and Capt. Paul Needham, an Air Force logistics officer, were with him. They were kept bound in a bedroom and forbidden to talk.\nOn Thanksgiving, Colonel Schaefer began a hunger strike to protest such things as the lack of mail. On the fifth day, he said, his captors marched him into the kitchen, placed a place of spaghetti in front of him and lowered an automatic rifle at him. ''You will eat now,t,'' they said.'' He ate. ''I was so hunger I was going to eat anyway,'' he said.\nAt 6 o'clock one morning in November, probably toward the end of the month, some of the captors went into the room where Richard Queen was being kept, his hands still bound, and took him and some of the others to a warehouse basement on the embassy grounds. It was the hostages' introduction to the Mushroom Inn.\n''There were no windows,'' Mr. Queen recalled. ''It was like living in a tomb. You didn't hear the outside world. You didn't see the outside world. You didn't know what was going on at all. You were completely cut off, as though you were living in a tomb.''\nThere were several rooms in the Mushroom, and Mr. Queen shared one until mid-March with Joseph Hall, an Army warrant officer. The hostages in the Mushroom were ordered not to speak to one another. And according to Mr. Gillette, the petty officer, who spent some time there, ''It was frowned upon if you looked at the other hostages.''\nMr. Queen and Mr. Hall and some of the others managed to whisper to a fellow hostage, especially on the infrequent occasions on which they were allowed to go to the toilet unaccompanied by a captor.\nAs Mr. Gillette recalled, he was put in a room in the Mushroom 8 feet by 12 feet with 16 others, and was restricted to one corner. ''I was in a location where I had three of the militants in front of my bed with Uzi submachine guns and G-3's,'' he said. ''I could not get involved with the clandestine communications that were going on - notes being thrown back and forth. That was the worst of it, to not talk to any of the other hostages.''\nMr. Queen said he had been able to take a shower ''every second or third day'' in the Mushroom and that once a week he was taken to a ''very small courtyard'' near the ambassador's residence, where ''we were allowed to exercise and see the sun and hear the traffic, hear the birds, for about 20 minutes.''\nAbout Dec. 17, Mr. Morefield, the Consul General, was brought to the Mushroom with about 20 other hostages. Compared with the student dormitory where he had previously been held, Mr. Morefield said, at the Mushroom the food was better and the hostages had more contact with their captors. He and eight or nine others shared a big room that had been divided into small cubicles with temporary partitions. In his space, he was able to walk two steps in one direction, three in another. He, too, was prohibited from speaking with the others. But, through eye contact and gestures, he said, he was able to get some messages back and forth.\nOne of those apparently moved to the Mushroom at the same time as Mr. Morefield was John Limbert, the political officer, who had served in the Peace Corps in Iran, been an instructor at Pahlavi University, married an Iranian woman and was one of the most proficient speakers of Persian among the hostages. Mr. Limbert recalls being kept in a room subdivided with bookcases.\n''The program stayed very much the same,'' Mr. Limbert said of the experience in his new quarters. ''Read, sleep, exercise. I asked some of the students to bring me books in Persian and they brought me some books by Dr. Ali Shariati, a kind of patron saint of the revolution. You kind of made your own routine. I dreamed about the future, past and future. My hands were tied together but pretty loosely and I was getting 13 to 14 hours of sleep.''\nMr. Queen busied himself in the Mushroom by organizing a lending library with embassy books. Others were able to volunteer to work with him and sometimes they would talk.\nMr. Morefield said that some of the hostages seemed to want to establish a dialogue with the captors, but that, initially, he ''felt that I couldn't and didn't want to.'' And he limited his exchanges with them to requests for permission to go to the bathroom, or to ask for more or less food.\nIn the first week in December, Moorhead Kennedy, the economics specialist, and his roommates were moved to the basement of the embassy from an elegant suburban house where they had spent nearly a month. As they were being ordered out of the house, their captors told them not to bring any personal belongings and, for the first time, they were handcuffed instead of being bound with cloth and rope.\n''We still thought we faced death at that point,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''We figured we were going to die the way they went about the move. I went peacefully. I guess that's the way you go. I mean, what else do you do?''\nIn the first months, Mr. Kennedy said, there were a number of ''terrible scares'' and he brooded a great deal about being shot. ''After that,'' he continued, ''we began to feel they had too much invested in us to kill us unless something was done to really endanger us.''\nOne of the scares, Mr. Kennedy said, occurred one day in December as he and others were being moved from one room to another. ''You could smell fear in the second room,'' he said, ''You have to smell it to know what it's like. We thought it was the anteroom to death. Then, suddenly we were taken back to our original room.''\n''We got there,'' he added, ''just as they were putting away the vacuum cleaner. '' Another bad scare came a day later when the students gave writing paper to Mr. Kennedy and some of the other hostages. ''We thought it was maybe for a last letter home, a last will and testament,'' he said. ''But, instead, it was one of those infrequent moments when the students were in a mood to move mail.''\nChristmas 1979 underscored the hostages' predicament and intensified their loneliness. They had been in captivity nearly two months. The initial terror had ebbed, but many were beginning to feel that they were in for a long ordeal.\nMr. Morefield had been cheered to learn that the students were planning to permit American clergymen to conduct Christmas services. But his spirits plummeted, he said, ''when I walked in and saw the obvious propaganda use that had been made of it.''\nThe four visiting clergymen spent two hours negotiating with the captors before they saw the hostages. The Rev. Dr. William Sloane Coffin Jr. of the United Church of Christ, who is the senior minister of the Riverside Church in Manhattan; the Rev. M. William Howard Jr., a Baptist from Princeton, N.J., who is president of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A.; Msgr. Thomas J. Gumbleton, an Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit, and Leon-Etienne Cardinal Duval, the Archbishop of Algiers, were brought to the heavily guarded embassy at 11:30 on Christmas Eve in a police-escorted caravan of Mercedes-Benzes.\nThe clergymen said later that they had told the militants that they wanted to conduct an ecumenical service for the entire group of hostages, and they said they had almost walked out before yielding to a demand that they meet the captives in small groups.\nMr. Howard, the Baptist minister, presided over the session that Mr. Morefield attended. A table laden with food and microphones attached to Coca-Cola bottles dominated the room. On the walls, along with traditional Christmas decorations, were revolutionary and antiAmerican posters. As the hostages prayed with Mr. Howard and sang hymns, Iranian television cameras focused on them. Beyond the view of the cameras, Mr. Morefield said, were ''about 40 of our captors who obviously were there, I think, to intimidate us.''\nHis emotion, that Christmas morning, was ''absolute rage,'' he said. He was so angry, he said, that he worried later that he might have been rude to the minister.\nMr. Morefield said he believed that Mr. Howard had come to Iran because he felt it was his Christian duty. But others among the hostages questioned the motives of the clergymen who visited them at Christmas, and later.\n''Some priests upset us greatly,'' said Mr. Gillette, the petty officer. ''They were more worried about, I think, creating turmoil in the United States, rather than the condition of the hostages.''\nJames Lopez, the Marine guard, described the Christmas services as ''a dog and pony show,'' and he expressed bitterness about the visit by clergymen the following Easter, too. He was shocked, he said, to learn that the clerics were ''saying conditions were nice and everything was copacetic and we were having such a good time in Camp Teheran. We couldn't believe they were actually buying that garbage the Iranians were putting out.''\nFor Sgt. Rodney Sickmann, the political ramifications of the Christmas ceremonies had been signaled in advance. Early in December, he said, ''they started buttering us up, trying to get us to make statements and signing different documents.''\n''Stuff like this,'' he said. ''We knew what they were trying to do, and every time they asked us to make a tape, we'd just say things for America, which really upset them.''\nWilliam F. Keough Jr., the former head of the American School in Islamabad, Pakistan, said he recognized that the Iranians had been trying to exploit the clergymen's visits for propaganda, but he said: ''Many of us thought we should go along with this because every opportunity we had to get our face on camera was assurance for people back home. My feeling was your family needs to see you. You never say what the Iranian students want you to say. There are ways of not answering questions, frustrating questions, switching to the Red Sox. You get off the topic. The clergymen were obviously being exposed to artificial conditions.''\nBy Christmas, Robert Blucker, the economics officer, had been moved back to the ambassador's residence in the embassy compound and had shared two separate rooms there with various colleagues. Mr. Blucker, a quiet, studious man who read voraciously, refused to attend the religious services at Christmas, but he took part in the holiday dinner that the captors prepared.\n''It was quite good, compared to what we had been having,'' Mr. Blucker recalled. ''I think there was turkey and stuffing, two or three kinds of cake and pie.''\n''It was a bang-up meal,'' said Moorhead Kennedy. ''Our morale was very high for the first time.'' Mr. Kennedy said he thought that Mr. Coffin had done ''a marvelous job'' and that he was ''absolutely aware of what we were going through.''\n''It looked very black for us,'' he continued. ''He hit just the right note as far as I was concerned. And I will always be in his debt.''\nOn the other hand, Mr. Kennedy said, ''The group that came out at Easter were a disaster. The priest said to one of our number, 'I sure would like to spend, say, 20 days with you fellows. It would give me a chance to meditate.' ''\n''Well, not long before then,'' Mr.Kennedy added, ''we had been stood up against that wall, and we all said to ourselves, you know, we'd very much like to have had him with us.''\nOn Christmas Day, Miss Koob sat alone in the library on the second floor of the chancery overlooking the main entrance to the embassy and Takht-E-Jamshid Avenue. Outside, hundreds of Iranians were sounding their rhythmic death chants for President Carter and the Shah. Hour after hour, the crowd chorused.\nLike the others, Miss Koob was thousands of miles from home, without family or friends. ''But the message of Christmas,'' she said later, ''was the same.''\nA deeply religious person, she had always believed, she said, that ''Christmas is Christ. It's not tinsel, it's not the tree.'' That afternoon, her beliefs were being tested, and she remembers saying to herself: ''If you really mean what you say, here's your chance, kid.''\nAt 11 P.M. Miss Koob heard what she took to be a church bell ringing, probably, she thought, in the church directly across the street. It was the catalyst she had needed. ''I had a worship service,'' she said, ''and it was Christmas.''\nIn the ambassador's residence, Mr. Blucker had found that if he climbed up on the radiator in the bathroom he could catch a glimpse of the sky and the trees and could even watch the dozens of green parrots and the gray and black ravens waging their daily battles for sovereignty on the embassy grounds.\n''Nice to watch,'' he said, ''It was nice to see the outside.'' But on Dec. 30 he was moved to a room in the basement of the chancery that he was to share with three others: Barry M. Rosen, the press attache; Robert C. Ode, the retired Foreign Service officer who been recalled to temporary duty in Iran, and Bruce W. German, the embassy's budget officer.\nThere had been an attempted escape at the embassy a few days earlier. ''Whether that persuaded them that the ambassador's residence was not a good place to keep a bunch of people, I don't know,'' Mr. Blucker said. ''I had heard one night an unusual amount of gunfire and wondered what in the world was going on. I found out later that was the night of the escape attempt, when they fired on Bill Belk.''\nLife in the basement was worse. There were no windows and the guards seemed more hostile. After a while, one of Mr. Blucker's roommates was moved out. He would not say who.\n''We were known as the bad people in that room,'' he said. ''Next door to us were the good people. They had no guard sitting in their room. They had cards, tennis balls to bounce, picture puzzles to play with, access to a tape recorder with some tapes. At a certain point they decided one of ours was a good man, a good boy. So they moved him into the room with the good boys.''\n''I can't prove anything about the good boys,'' Mr. Blucker continued. ''I am satisfied I know who they are, but I can't prove it so I'd better not say. They were young people, unideological, with no high position in the embassy. I suspect that what they did was that they just didn't resist. That they were politically inert.''\nOn the other hand, Mr. Blucker said, ''A bad guy was somebody who followed my kind of conduct. They passed a petition around calling on the U.S. Government to return the Shah. I refused to sign that. It wasn't appropriate. I refused to write any letters to senators or newspapers demanding that actions be taken to get us out. I was generally hostile. I made no remarks against the Shah, or against David Rockefeller or Henry Kissinger. In fact, I didn't try to be anything but the bourgeoisie, the reactionary. And I fussed at them, I snarled at them.''\nAt one point, Mr. Blucker referred to those who had ''collaborated'' with the Iranian captors. Then he corrected himself and said ''cooperated.'' In their initial days home, neither he nor any of the other hostages reported any instances in which they felt their colleagues had behaved disloyally to the United States.\nPressed to distinguish between cooperation and collaboration, Mr. Blucker replied, ''I don't know. I don't know. The words are hard to define. Where does one stop and the other start? Cooperation includes collaboration and other things. It's just too complicated to go into.''\nOne of the former hostages, who asked that he not be identified, said: ''I know that a lot of people did things that I wouldn't do and I didn't approve of and I wish they hadn't done. But I don't want to label them. There were several people, perhaps, I shouldn't say a lot.''\nIn television footage arranged by the captors, some of the hostages were shown making statements that were critical, in varying degrees, of the Shah and United States policy, and to some extent portraying better conditions than actually existed for the captives.\nIn one 34-minute videotape made by the Iranians, but rejected for broadcast by the American networks, Sgt. Joseph J. Subic Jr., a young Marine guard, talked of United States surveillance flights and showed where computer equipment had been concealed in the floor and ceiling of the embassy warehouse.\nSince returning home, Sergeant Subic has not commented on this incident. But another young marine, Sgt. William A. Gallegos, said that he had been ''forced in various ways'' to be interviewed by two NBC News television reporters under the supervision of the Iranians five weeks after the takeover.\n''I was not beaten,'' he said. ''I did it for my military superiors. I'm sorry the public didn't understand.'' ''I was saying that the treatment was good for my fellow colleagues so that they would not be mistreated,'' he continued. ''But also I was trying to say that we were not being treated well.''\nSeveral of the hostages said that in the final days of captivity they felt obliged to make statements before Iranian cameras. ''I was not forced,'' said Sgt. Gregory A. Persinger. But, he added, ''It was on the view you either do it or you're not going to be released.''\nMost of the hostages said that they had come through the experience surprisingly well, but there were tensions. Had there been conflict among the captives? ''Obviously,'' said Mr. Morefield, ''there were quirks or characteristics that were very annoying.'' Did anyone ever come to blows? ''Yes,'' he said. Seriously? ''No.''\nOn Jan. 18, Mr. Limbert, the political officer, was moved from the Mushroom to solitary confinement in the basement of the embassy in a windowless 10--by-12-foot room, illuminated with fluorescent lights and furnished with a bare mattress, a small typewriting table and two chairs.\nMr. Limbert discovered that his room was next to one occupied by William E. Belk, the communications and records officer, and Specialist Hohman, the Army medic. The rooms were separated by a thin partition that came about an inch short of meeting the permanent wall, leaving a gap like a mail slot.\n''We could slide notes through there,'' Mr. Limbert said. ''We'd trade news, sort of, 'What did you see? What did you hear?' It could be anything, whatever the students might have let slip, anything. One of my neighbors was able to smuggle a radio to me. He left it in the bathroom. It was about the size of a cigarette pack. We had news for about a month then, broadcast in Farsi. They were never able to discover the radio, but, of course, I couldn't take it with me when I moved.''\nOn Jan. 28, the six embassy employees who had been hiding with the Canadians - five members of the consular staff and an agricultural attache - flew out of Iran on a commercial airliner. The Canadian Government had issued them diplomatic passports and the Central Intelligence Agency had helped forge Iranian exit visas.\nIt was not until months later that the hostages learned of the escape. In less than a week, however, they were subjected to a new episode of terror. The hostages say they still do not know exactly what brought it on. Richard Morefield said he thought it might have been in retaliation for an escape attempt. Moorhead Kennedy said he thought it had to do with a suicide attempt.\nIn any case, the first assault came at 1 A.M. on Feb. 5. There would be several more. Seven Iranians wielding automatic rifles and wearing white masks, fatigues and combat boots burst in on 21 hostages sleeping in the Mushroom and herded them together against a wall, spread-eagled.\n''They told us not to talk, not to move,'' said Paul Needham, the Air Force captain who had gone to Teheran to advise the Iranian Air Force. ''One of the guards barked out an order. A round was chambered in each weapon. He barked out another order. I could hear the safety catch go off. He barked another order about 15 seconds later and a round hit the floor. It was ejected and fell to the floor. I thought I was dead as the last order was barked out. I thought it was to fire. I do not speak Farsi and I thought he had said to fire.''\nGary E. Lee, the administrative officer, later recalled thinking as he waited for the bullets to tear into him, ''Boy, I sure hope they hit me in the head and not the back, so I go quickly.''\nColonel Scott, the military liaison chief, was certain he heard someone cry out in Farsi, ''Get ready.'' ''My knees were knocking,'' said the colonel, a veteran of two combat tours in Vietnam. ''I thought things had deteriorated so badly that they were just going to get rid of us.''\nThe men in white masks had put the hostages against the wall in two groups, Mr. Queen said. ''When they moved the first group in, they had everybody lie down,'' he said, ''but, one, Commander Sharer, said, 'You're going to shoot me standing up, not lying down.' He refused to lie down. And they were all standing up when I came in.\n''When we were all in the room against the wall,'' Mr. Queen continued, ''there was dead silence. Then I heard the metallic clicking of the weapons, locking the bolts, removing the safety. I don't know which. It was just this harsh metallic click. And I really thought that was it. I just stood there. I knew it was my last moment. I said the Lord's Prayer and tried to give myself the last rites, because I was sure that we had just breathed our last.''\n''No one said anything,'' he added. ''No one sobbed. Just pure silence.'' ''Then,'' he continued, ''we were taken individually into a small room and stripped to our underpants, searched. While this was going on, another group went into our little rooms and tore them apart. Then we were taken back individually to our rooms.''\nIn the next few days, more of the hostages were terrorized by the men in white masks. Moorhead Kennedy and some of the others sharing his basement room at the embassy were preparing for bed late one night, he said, when two of the masked men charged in yelling, ''Savak! Savak!'' Savak was the Shah's brutal secret police organization, triumphantly dismantled by the revolutionaries.\nThe hostages were hauled out of their rooms and forced to strip to their undershorts in the cold night air. Inside, other Iranians were ransacking their clothing and personal belongings.\nThe sharp clack of rifle bolts resounded in the night. ''The masked men chambered rounds into their weapons,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''They tweaked our elastic bands on our shorts as they walked back and forth behind us. They poked their cold guns into our backs.''\nDeath seemed imminent. Mr. Kennedy said he trembled, but otherwise managed to control himself. When he and his roommate, Frederick Kupke, realized there would be no shooting, Mr. Kennedy said, they ''jumped for joy.''\nBefore the men were returned to their rooms, their belts were taken away, Mr. Kennedy said, and they found that their razors had been seized. Later, the hostages would refer to that night of terror as ''the panty raid.''\nAnother night, Sergeant Sickmann and some of the others were blindfolded by men in white masks and marched down a hallway. One at a time, Sergeant Sickmann said, the masked men took the hostages into a room and told them to strip down to their underwear. Then their blindfolds were removed.\n''We just had our face against the wall,'' the sergeant said. ''He told us not to look. So here we are, we've got our eyes closed, myself and the other hostages, sitting there, shaking like a leaf against the wall. You hear these rifles cocking. We thought we were goners then.''\nIn December, Sergeant Sickmann and some of the others had been shown films, he said, of people ''who were killed lying on the ground with their heads blown off.''\n''All these images started showing, you know? They kept coming into my head,'' he continued, ''and the rifles being cocked and stuff like that. It was sick. I thought I was going to be the same way.''\nOne of the masked men ''started searching private parts of your body,'' Sergeant Sickmann said, and, finally, he and the others were told to get dressed.\nA week later, he said, there was a similar search. On March 13, Captain Needham recalled, he and some others again stood before a firing squad that did not fire. That time, however, the gunmen did not crank ammunition into their weapons, he said.\nRobert Blucker was one of the few lined up. He said later, ''I didn't think they'd shoot us in that fashion.'' In the search, Mr. Blucker said, the Iranians found $1,020 in cash on him. They had known about it and had told him previously that they were not thieves and did not want his money. That night, he said, they kept it.\nColonel Scott said that after he experienced one of the mock executions his fear of being killed disappeared. ''You can just get so scared,'' he said, ''You get angry and once you get angry it sustains you through many sorts of stress. I refused to think about death after that.''\nThe midnight raids and the firing squads constituted probably the most concentrated punishment the hostages endured after the first days of their captivity. And many of them apparently shared that fright.\nBut generally the treatment varied greatly. Hostages suspected of being intelligence operatives and those few who tried to escape had a hard time. At least to some extent, the behavior of the hostages, their personalities and the personalities of the captors who confronted them figured in their treatment. But not always.\nTwo of the hostages, William Keough, who at 6 feet 9 inches towered over the Iranians, and Robert Blucker, were determinedly aggressive. And the Iranians stayed at a respectful distance.\n''We complained about the hotel service,'' Mr. Keough said, ''that the bathroom was dirty and said, 'When the Ayatollah comes around I'll tell him how dirty this place is,' or 'Send in your sister to clean up.' ''\nMr. Keough said he had never been physically threatened ''because I made it obvious early on that this was not the thing to do.'' ''When a man would open a door of the cell and hand out food,'' Mr. Keough continued, ''I would demand more bread or oranges. They would back away immediately and say, 'Bread is finished,' or 'Oranges is finished,' and my large foot would be in the door and the door somehow wouldn't close until such time as we got bread and oranges. There was a lot of testing going on.''\nAs Mr. Keough's birthday approached, he teased the captors for six weeks, saying he was expecting a cake. When the day came on Sept. 11, the guards delivered a cake. After Mr. Keough and the others had finished the cake, he said, he turned to the guards and asked, ''Where's the ice cream?''\nToward the end of the captivity, Mr. Blucker said of his guards, ''I had them so scared they were afraid to come into my room. I wouldn't let them in with their shoes on because they tracked in too much dirt. I yelled at them or I snarled at them. You could get to them by bitching at them. They told me, 'You're like an old woman. You say, 'Do this, do that.' That didn't upset me. I told them they needed an old woman to tell them what to do.''\nAt one point, Mr. Blucker said, one of the captors ''was almost pleading with me to go before the cameras.'' And, Mr. Blucker said, when he refused, the young man replied, ''Oh, you're so stubborn.''\nMalcolm Kalp tried many times to escape. After yet another attempt failed, Mr. Kennedy said, they put him in a room and ''welded his windows shut.''\nPerhaps as draining over the long run as the cold rifle barrel in the back was the daily worry of being accidentally shot. Many of the young guards, the former hostages say, were as awkward with their automatic rifles and submachine guns as a ballerina on a tractor.\n''When we were taken outside,'' said Michael Metrinko, the embassy political officer, ''there were 20 or 30 guards who kept their G-3's and their Uzis pointing at me. I always thought it would be funny if one of them were to go off. They would have a massive blood bath, killing each other because they were also pointing at each other.''\n''Those guys were nervous,'' said Mr. Keough, ''I was afraid they'd make a mistake.'' Sergeant Lopez, one of the Marine guards, found it ''slightly nerve-racking because we had all these little kids running around with shotguns. They were 17-18. They had no weapons training and they're walking around playing John Wayne and Audie Murphy and what have you.''\nIn mid-February, Mr. Kennedy's group was moved out of the embassy basement to an upstairs room that ''had a few windows,'' and was given a stove on which to heat the food that sometimes had been arriving cold from a command kitchen somewhere else.\n''Once,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''we ate by candlelight. We were living the good life.'' Toward the end of the month, conditions improved, too, for some of the others. Mr. Blucker and his roommate at the time, Robert Ode, were moved to an upstairs room with a window, a desk, two leather chairs and a pair of mattresses. They ''also had the privilege,'' Mr. Blucker said, ''of asking for tea and dates. You might not get them, but you could ask for them.''\nA man who implied that he represented the Government, but who Mr. Blucker said he later discovered was associated with the Red Crescent Society, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, dropped in on the two hostages to ''assure us that things were going to be better.''\n''I thought at least,'' Mr. Blucker continued, ''that perhaps the Government was taking control of the situation. There were no serious confrontations at that point. They were doing their best to be kind. People who were usually very solemn put on sort of frozen smiles.''\nAs February blended into March, the hostages with Mr. Kennedy were allowed to make telephone calls home, but not before one of the Iranians had nettled them a bit by asking, ''Who will be the first to give up his turn to call to his friend?''\nThey all deferred to one another. Mr. Kupke was finally chosen by the guards to go first. Mr. Kennedy saw this as another ''ethnic act'' on the part of the guards. Mr. Kupke is one-fourth American Indian.\nMr. Kennedy said his call went through on March 22 at 4 A.M. Eastern standard time. He talked about eight minutes to his wife, Louisa, who had taken a leading role among the hostages' families. He placed the call ''at that hour because I figured that would guarantee that my one chance to phone the states would result in talking to Louisa.''\n''We had a very nice talk,'' he said. In mid-March Mr. Blucker said he asked ''the chief terrorist in charge'' for a nearby private room with a sunny exposure. He said he was told that a C.I.A. agent was being housed there, but that a change could be arranged.\n''I assumed that having been unable to get anything out of me, he was trying to bribe me with kindness,'' Mr. Blucker said. ''So I went into that nice little room by myself, sunbathed every day for a few hours. I was able to throw down the window from the top and finally have perfect fresh air. That brought on a million mosquitoes, of course, and, for a while, my face looked like a battlefield. But I left it open anyway. And I never paid off. I never did a thing for them. I never wrote a letter for them.''\nTHE arrival of April brought spring and mounting hope to the imprisoned Americans. ''Spring was in the air,'' recalled Moorhead Kennedy. ''They began taking pictures of us, as though gathering souvenirs before it was all over. The Red Cross came and checked on us. Everything seemed to be coming up roses.''\nA Swiss Government airplane was on a Zurich runway on April 1, ready to fly doctors to Teheran to prepare for the imminent release of the hostages. Cots had been brought to the Iranian Foreign Ministry for the hostages to rest on before they left for the airport.\nBut the talks collapsed when Ayatollah Khomeini insisted that the issue should be decided by the Iranian Parliament. The hostages knew nothing about that effort, of course, nor did they did know about the plans for the American military rescue mission that were also under way that spring.\nAbruptly, on April 25, the relative peace was shattered. ''All of a sudden there's running up and down the hallways,'' said Sergeant Lopez. ''There's vans being backed in, the door kicks open, and they tell us, 'Pack, you will be leaving soon.' They were very frazzled, they were very nervous, which made us nervous because these clowns were running around with automatic weapons, fingers on the triggers, locked and loaded.''\n''Something had gone down,'' he said. ''We didn't know what.'' It was not until much later that Sergeant Lopez and his fellow hostages learned that the upheaval on April 25 had been caused by the abortive United States rescue mission that ended with eight Americans dead in a conflagration on the bleak salt flats of the Iranian desert.\nThat evening some of the hostages held in the embassy had just finished eating a dinner of chili found in the commissary when their captors announced that the Americans should pack up, Sergeant Sickmann recalled.\nHe said the captors had told the hostages to use the bathroom because it would be 10 hours before they had another chance. ''They blindfolded us and took us down to a van they had waiting,'' he said. ''We got in and they handcuffed us.'' With Sergeant Sickmann were a fellow Marine sergeant, William Gallegos, and Jerry Plotkin, a Californian who said he was in Iran on business.\n''I don't know how many cars were with us,'' said Sergeant Sickmann, ''but we drove from about 11:30 that night till about 7 o'clock the next morning. The roads we were on, they felt like they were cow pastures. We were bouncing up hitting the top of the van with our heads.''\n''You can't sleep,'' he went on. ''You could lean on somebody else's shoulder, but then he'd move, and everybody would have to move because you were handcuffed together. We finally got to Isfahan that morning. We didn't know this until about a month later, when they told us where were were.''\nOther hostages experienced similarly disorienting, uncomfortable journeys to cities and towns around Iran. Moorhead Kennedy remembers hearing a lot of noise outside on the night of April 25. ''We were told to pack,'' he said. ''We were blindfolded again and taken outside into the hall. From under the blindfold we could see that our gear was being piled up. We thought that maybe the Shah was dead, that maybe it was all over.''\nMr. Kennedy's hopes expired when he heard the sound of handcuffs clicking. He was driven off into the night, certain only that the upward tilt of the darkened van meant that he was being taken to the hills outside Teheran.\nFor the two women, Miss Swift and Miss Koob, who were brought together in the embassy in March and stayed there together for the rest of their captivity, the day of the raid brought signs that something unusual had happened.\n''We could hear all the movement and shuffling up and down the hall,'' Miss Koob remembered. ''We knew people were being moved from their current rooms. We didn't know why or where or what.''\nTheir treatment changed slightly. An embassy cook who had been preparing their main meals left and the student guards started doing the cooking.\nThe three Americans at the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Bruce Laingen, Victor Tomseth and Michael Howland, also lost privileges after the raid. The Iranians took away their table-tennis table.\nSergeant Sickmann knew that he was not going to stay long in his new quarters, he said. ''They were buying us food, bringing us sandwiches, little hot dog sandwiches, and we knew this couldn't last forever, because they hated to spend money on us,'' he said. ''Back at the embassy, they just took everything out of the commissary.''\nHe was correct. In a few days, he was moved to the old United States consulate in Shiraz. By the first week in June, he said, he had been taken back to Teheran, where he spent three days in the chancery, then moved to a prison.\nAfter they got home and had time to think about the rescue effort, some hostages wondered if it would have worked. ''I was never sure what I felt about it because I wasn't there to make the decision,'' said Mr. Hohman, the Army medic. ''Thank God for the sandstorm,'' said Miss Koob. ''There was a certain risk and a certain number of the hostages might not make it out. And I just felt from my location in the embassy at the time, I might not be one of those who made it out. I was on the second floor. There was no escape route.''\nOn the other hand, a number of the hostages cheered the attempt after they heard of it. ''I was jubilated,'' said Robert Blucker. ''It was good to know they were not prepared to leave us there forever,'' he said, ''that they were prepared to try something even though it might mean some of us would be killed. I thought it should have been attempted even if a large percentage of us were killed.''\nAfter the rescue attempt, moves were frequent. Some of the hostages believe this was a tactic to upset them psychologically. In an interview with The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk, Va., Comdr. Donald A. Sharer of the Navy described what happened. A guard would come into the room, he said.\n'' 'Pack your stuff,' the guard would say. '' 'Why do we have to pack our stuff?' '' 'Just pack your stuff.' '' 'Are we going home?' '' 'Just pack your stuff.' '' ''Then all through your mind it would go: They're going to take us out and shoot us.''\nScattered about the country, teased by a scrap of information here, a scrap there, the hostages spent the middle months of 1980 trying to cope with the reality of a life without benchmarks, of a tedious imprisonment that showed no signs of ending, and of all-too-frequent reminders of their precarious and hazardous situation. Mr. Kennedy told how, through an open window in a Teheran jail where he was being held, he could hear the gasps and screams of Iranian prisoners being beaten and tortured.\nThe outside world knew of events that had enormous potential importance for the hostages - the release of Richard Queen on July 11, the death of the former Shah on July 27 in Cairo, the announcement by Ayatollah Khomeini on Sept. 12 of terms for the release of the hostages. But for them, after the disruption and dispersion following the failed rescue mission, one dreary day of captivity was much like another. ''I often considered writing a poem,'' said Petty Officer Gillette, '' 'Killing Time is Killing Me.' ''\nOCCASIONALLY, amid their constant fears, there would be a touch of the ludicrous. There was, for instance, Miss Koob's telephone bill. On the day of the embassy takeover, she had kept a telephone line open for hours between her office in the Iran-America Society and the State Department in Washington. Sometime after mid-March, when she and Miss Swift became roommates, there was a knock on the door. An Iranian guard entered and asked, ''Did you make a phone call to the United States Nov. 4 and 5?''\n''Yes, I did,'' she recalled replying. ''Fine,'' he said. ''Then you will take your checkbook and you will write a check for 60,000 tomans (about $6,000).'' ''Wait a minute,'' she replied. ''There are two problems. I don't have a checkbook and I don't have an Iranian bank account and, Number Two, that wasn't my phone call.''\nThey argued. Finally, the guard told her they would ''find'' her account and take the money from it. ''I told him to please bring me what was left,'' she said, ''but I never saw him or the money.''\nFor the most part, though, there was not much to laugh about. The hostages coped in varied ways. ''I determined to live as normally as possible,'' said Mr. Kennedy. ''I made up my mind I would keep myself and my things clean and tidy, that I'd keep myself as presentable as possible, sort of like the British dressing for dinner.'' And so, he said, he would sweep his room until not a grain of dirt remained. He would scrub his toilet so clean that his guards started using it. Moved to a new place, he would immediately post family pictures and begin scrubbing up.\nWilliam Keough, the schoolmaster from New England, treated his captors like recalcitrant pupils, using his height of 6 feet 9 inches to intimidate them. ''Once we got over the initial pushing around, we established early on that this was not the thing to do,'' he said. He advised some of his fellow hostages how to behave. ''I spent quite a bit of time instructing people on certain things they should know: How to push the limits, explaining to them that Iranian students understand confrontation, that we should be training the students, that we should be capturing the students rather than having them capture us.''\nFor some, skill at games became a mainstay of life. Bert C. Moore, an administrative consul, said he had dominated the gamesmanship among his summer roommates, Sgt. Paul Lewis, Philip Ward, a communications officer, and Sgt. John McKeel.\n''We had cards and checkers,'' Mr. Moore recalled. ''After the first couple of games, they refused to play checkers with me. When you win and still have eight men left, they didn't think that was a very good game. Finally, I got them all so they played gin rummy. I started out out slow and went hard, and they decided they didn't like that game.''\nSergeant Lopez found that ''day-to-day life was pretty much boredom.'' But he enlivened it for his fellow captives by sketching cartoons that, said Mr. Morefield, became ''a tremendous morale factor.'' ''Some of them were just devastating,'' he said. At first, the sketches were passed around surreptitiously. Then the captors - who presumably did not understand some of the nuances - permitted them to be posted on a wall near where hostages would be taken to watch propaganda films on videotape.\nMichael Metrinko, who worked in the embassy's political section, remembered feeling ''extremely good'' when he saw one Lopez sketch depicting a mullah with a belfry in the background and bats flying around it. The artist signed it, ''Political prisoner being illegally detained by the Iranian criminals.''\nMr. Morefield laughed at one drawn for his 51st birthday on Sept. 9. ''It showed an old doddering captive flanked by two equally old doddering guards,'' he said.\nMany of the hostages' recollections of this middle period of their captivity were of the fussy domestic details with which they filled their days.\nMiss Koob and Miss Swift recalled a regular routine. They would get up between 8 and 10 A.M. They would visit the bathroom, wash their faces, brush their teeth. Then their captors would bring breakfast, which was bread with cheese, jam or butter, tea, sometimes juice. Then they would study, pray, read Scripture. Between noon and 1 P.M., Miss Swift would exercise. The women would eat lunch, wash the dishes, read some more. Miss Koob would do some needlework. At 5:30 they would exercise for 45 minutes, then eat supper. After evening devotions they would do what Miss Koob called ''junk reading'' - pulp novels, Gothics, mysteries, romances. At 10:30 they would exercise for another 45 minutes, running figure eights or circles around their room.\nSaid Sgt. Gregory Persinger of the Marines: ''I would wake up at 10 in the morning, walk an hour, exercise for close to two and a half hours, doing 1,000 sit-ups to begin with, push-ups and regular calisthenics. After that, I would sit up and read maybe, a couple of hours until the food came for lunch.'' Then more walking, more exercise, more reading, bed.\nMr. Morefield said that he had been overweight - 210 pounds when he was captured. He exercised, touching his toes, simple little things like that, when his captivity began, then built up, by the time the long months ended, to 50 repetitions of off-the-wall push-ups and numerous squat jumps and sit-ups and an hour's jogging in his room. He weighed 178 when he left Iran, he said, ''and if I'm smart, this might have have added 10 years to my life.''\nSOME of the hostages told of attempts to escape. None succeeded. As early as the night of Dec. 23, 1979, William Belk who worked in the embassy's communications section, wriggled free from the twisted sheets that bound his hands, cut through a window screen and slipped onto the embassy roof.\nHe had expected to emerge in darkness. But, he said, ''much to my chagrin, I found that the lights to the compound that embassy workers had not been able to get working in recent days were on. It was lit up like a stadium and here I was sitting on top of a building.''\nHe crawled to a courtyard where young Iranians were walking around in small groups. ''The only thing I could think of was to act like a student,'' he said. ''I had a sweater so I pulled it up over my head and pretended to be putting it on and started mumbling away. I walked right out behind five other students.''\nBut as he ducked around a building, Mr. Belk was confronted by a female guard with an automatic weapon. ''Stop,'' she cried in Farsi. He lunged at the guard and tried to wrestle her gun away. She screamed and got off two wild shots, but he jerked the magazine out of her gun and broke away. He had made it to the top of the compound wall before patrolling guards spotted him and started shooting.\nStartled, and winded from his sprint, the adrenaline pumping through his body, Mr. Belk toppled from the wall, injuring his leg. ''I couldn't run any further and I couldn't get back on top of the 12-foot wall,'' he said. ''I tried to hide as best I could.'' But it was fruitless. In moments he was surrounded. The guards slapped him around, he said, took him back to his room and blindfolded him.\nLater, three Iranians returned to the room and accused Mr. Belk of having connections with the Central Intelligence Agency. One of them kicked his injured leg. Another jammed the barrel of a .45-caliber pistol behind his ear and told Mr. Belk, ''People who try to escape get shot.'' Then he pulled the trigger. The hammer clicked on an empty chamber.\nMr. Belk spent the next 10 days in isolation. The morning after he tried to break out, Miss Swift asked a guard about the noise. ''We shot a hostage,'' the guard told her. It was not until the airplane ride home that she found out what had happened. On that same night, the commotion stirred by the capture of Mr. Belk had alerted guards to the first of three escape attempts by Malcolm Kalp. He tried again, he said, in May and again in June.\nSteven M. Lauterbach, a general services officer, told of an escape attempt in January 1980. Some of the marines said they decided, after the election of Ronald Reagan as President that if they were not freed by Feb. 12, 1981, time enough, they thought, to let the new President secure their freedom, they would try to escape, even though they realized the effort would probably not succeed.\n''I don't want to sound John Wayne-ish,'' said Sergeant Lopez, ''but it wasn't going to be a breakout. It was going to be a kamikaze mission.''\nSgt. John McKeel, another marine, said the attempt would have involved about half a dozen hostages, using handmade weapons. ''We'd mixed detergent and kerosene, razor blades and pins and things of that sort,'' he said.\nDid he think it would have worked? ''No,'' Sergeant McKeel muttered. ''I doubt that I could have gotten out of the country alive,'' said Joseph Hall, the Army warrant officer, ''but it had gotten to the point where I was seriously thinking about it.''\nIn the opinion of a Foreign Service officer who asked not to be identified, the attempted escapes were not serious efforts, but rather appeared to be part of the need of some hostages to offer resistance.\n''There were many such attempts - most phony,'' he said. ''People knew damn well they weren't going anyplace. It was a gesture. It had to do with the military notion that somehow they had an obligation to give their name, rank and serial number and escape if they possibly can, and harass the enemy. And with that kind of mentality, they did all kinds of what I would call idle gestures.''\nThere were at least two apparent suicide attempts, according to the Foreign Service officer and Col. Thomas Schaefer and Frederick Kupke. All three refused to disclose the identities of those who tried to kill themselves. A fourth hostage, Steven W. Kirtley, a Marine corporal, said he had witnessed one of the attempts, by a roommate. He declined to identify the roommate or to say what had happened other than that guards had called an ambulance.\n''I know it for a fact,'' said the Foreign Service officer, ''but I won't go into details of how I know it.'' He said one case involved a wrist slashing in February 1980. ''I'm not sure just what he was trying to do at that point,'' he said.\n''The other case, the man fully intended to kill himself,'' he added. He declined to say how. After the suicide attempts, the captors took away all of the hostages' shoes, belts and razors, and replaced drinking glasses and plates with plastic.\nBoth the suicide attempts and the escape attempts presented delicate problems for the Iranian captors. pick up IRAN III-B\n''One of the leaders, Hussein, told us point-blank what their problem was,'' the Foreign Service officer said. ''They couldn't shoot us. We were their stock in trade. And they couldn't do us much harm. We were gradually learning that. Of course at that point we didn't know.''\n''The Imam's instructions,'' he went on, ''were specific that our health had to be protected. They worked very hard at that. They were inept, but they certainly worked at it. So they had quite a problem in keeping us under control. And according to Hussein, they thought they had to intimidate us, had to show us who was boss.''\nThe earlier mock executions and other cruelties inflicted on the hostages thus might have been part of this tactical intimidation effort at controlling hostages whom the captors were under strict orders not to harm.\nThere were at least two other reasons for the harsh treatment accorded some hostages, the Foreign Service officer suggested. ''There were a few that were treated much worse than the others because there was good reason for the students to think they were C.I.A. or spies or something else,'' he said. ''But many had a psychological need to bring trouble on themselves.''\nAs the days dragged on, the hostages became more resourceful in frustrating their captors' efforts to prevent them from communicating with one another.\n''We had the pony express going through the head,'' said Sergeant Lopez. ''We would leave notes in the toilet paper rolls, under the toilet, in the sink, behind the mirror, under a loose tile. We snatched a thumb tack off a wall one time and we were sticking them underneath a little end table they had in the head. And we had a telegraph system, knocking through the walls. And we also had the system where when you knocked on the door and talked to one of the guards, you talked loud enough so that everyone in the hallway could hear you and you used little acronyms and jargon the Iranians would half understand but everyone else would catch it.''\nSergeant Sickmann said that, inexplicably, one of the books the hostages were allowed to read contained instructions for a tapping code, in which letters were arranged in a horizontal grid so that 1-1 was the letter A, 1-2 the letter B. And they would use that to communicate between rooms.\nMessages from outside were generally welcome - but erratic. ''Letters I write were thrown away and letters they received for me were thrown away,'' said Duane Gillette, the naval petty officer. There was often mail from strangers, Americans who simply wanted to let the hostages know their country was thinking of them, and Mr. Gillette remembered with affection a letter he had received from a child in New York. ''There was Tom Daley,'' he said. ''He is in fourth grade. But he came out and said I think we ought to bomb these bastards. 'Bomb' was misspelled. ''Bastards' was misspelled. It brought tears to my eyes it was so good.''\nAfter the unsuccessful rescue attempt in April, in what seemed to be a gloating gesture, several hostages were shown color photographs in Time and Newsweek of the wrecked helicopters and the charred bodies of members of the rescue team. Some hostages were allowed to read the stories, others were permitted to look only at the illustrations.\nGenerally, however, the Iranians tried to keep the hostages ignorant of world events, especially those relating to the hostage situation. On rare occasions, the hostages were given copies of the news magazines, crudely censored with many pages torn out. But sometimes the censors would forget to cut out the table of contents from a magazine. Some of the hostages learned of the former Shah's death that way.\nHints of the failed rescue mission reached the hostages at the various sites to which they had been moved. The first word came about six weeks after the mission when a letter arrived from a schoolchild. ''We're sorry the rescue failed,'' it read. ''We hope they try it again.''\nMiss Koob and Miss Swift got a censored copy of Time or Newsweek in which the article about the raid had been torn out but was, inexplicably, stuffed inside the rear cover.\nJerry Miele, who worked in the communications section of the embassy, was cleaning the embassy library, probably sometime in August, he thinks, when he found what he called ''an American Socialist newspaper'' that mentioned the failed rescue. Later, in a letter from a young American girl, he said, he learned that eight Americans had died in the attempt.\nSergeant Lopez recalled that ''someone in Europe had written to Gary Lee, who was one of my cellmates, saying something to the effect that so far eight had died, but many more were willing to give our lives to save you.''\n''So,'' he went on, ''we figured it was more or less a rescue attempt. We weren't quite sure. We didn't really find out all the details until we were released.''\nSomeone in the Boston area, who never identified himself, began sending Mr. Keough, whose hometown is Waltham, Mass., the sports page from a local newspaper.\n''Every day the sports page went out and it would come in in clusters,'' Mr. Keough said. ''Sometimes on the back of the sport pages would be news. Sometimes it would be the comics. The Doonesbury comic of Dec. 28, 1979, let me know that this had become a subject of widespread discussion in the U.S. Garry Trudeau is an astute political commentator and just reading that cartoon strip about Iranian students let me know the extent to which this was being handled in the U.S. On the back of the sports pages we would see an advertisement for one of the channels running a TV show, tucked in there was a statement about the recent rescue attempt. We would pick up news that way. The Aug. 14 issue of Sports Illustrated, tucked in that was the announcement that the game had been interrupted with the anouncement that the Shah had died in Egypt.''\nLast December, Mr. Keough said, Algerian diplomats brought him a Christmas package from his wife that contained underwear, socks and three books. The captors withheld a book on the Presidential election in the United States, but they let Mr. Keough have a book of crossword puzzles and a copy of the 1981 World Almanac, which, to the delight of the hostages, contained a summary of the major news events of 1980.\n''That sort of thing was taking place all the time,'' Mr. Keough said. ''Information was coming through. You cannot suppress a group of strong Americans who are an intelligent group.''\nMiss Koob found out about the Canadian-assisted escape of a group of the hostages toward the end of her stay in Iran. A ''compassionate'' guard brought a magazine account of the incident to Miss Koob and told her, she said, that he hoped it would help keep her spirits up. It was ''the most incredibly beautiful thing I've read in my whole life,'' she said.\nLETTERS from relatives and even, in some cases, strangers also provided news on their situation. Usually, the information from relatives was guarded, as if they sensed that direct reports on the hostages would be blocked by the captors.\n''Letters were getting through with one-liners stuck in the middle of this big, long thing about Aunt Thelma's apple pie recipe,'' said Sergeant Lopez.\nGary Lee, the administrative officer, said his wife, Patricia, had let him know about the death of the Shah by reporting that a nonexistent ''Uncle Shaw'' had died. Donald Cooke, a vice consul, said he understood the rescue effort had failed after he asked his family to send him a set of ''Curtis LeMay stoneware'' and they replied, ''We sent the stoneware, but you didn't get it. It got all broken.'' In the Vietnam War, Curtis E. LeMay, an Air Force general, advocated bombing America's enemies ''back to the Stone Age.''\nSome of the hostages discovered that Richard Queen had been sent home when Mr. Morefield's wife, Dorothea, wrote that Mr. Queen was suffering with multiple sclerosis. They wondered how Mrs. Morefield could know that.\n''We put two and two together,'' said Sergeant Sickmann, ''and figured that he had gotten out, and had an interview on television, and that's what Mrs. Morefield was trying to tell us.\n''She didn't come right out and say it,'' he continued, ''because they hated whenever someone wrote and gave us information like that.''\nWhile unaware of Mr. Queen's release, Miss Koob and Miss Swift realized that something had changed when the amount of food they had been preparing was cut back. They had taken over the cooking for six people after their captors had difficulty doing so, burning food and the like. Then, all of a sudden, they found themselves cooking for only five.\nAt first, they had no idea for whom they were cooking; they eventually found out by reading notes hidden in a wastepaper basket. Or occasionally the guards would allow a note on the tray, signed by ''the boys in the backroom'' and asking for more salad or some other item,\nThe Shah died July 27. Quite a while later, Michael Metrinko, who worked in the political section of the embassy, remembers, he read about it ''from a line in Sporting News - something about a horse race.'' At first, he said, the realization ''raised our hopes, till we found that he had died quite a while back. And if he's dead, what we we doing here?''\nBarry Rosen, the embassy's press attache, said that the controversial decision to admit the Shah to the United States had dominated the conversations of hostages for months. ''It was killing us,'' he said. ''We were eating ourselves alive. Why? Why? What were we doing here?''\nThe embassy, he said, had sent ample warning to the State Department on the likely consequences of admitting the Shah. He said he and other hostages had doubted the propriety of the decision.\nThe depth of the anti-Shah, anti-American feelings of their captors impressed the hostages. In those long middle months of their captivity, they had time to study the people who had seized them, to differentiate among the various levels of command, even to confer nicknames upon their guards.\n''Some were old enough to be graduate students working on their fourth or fifth degrees,'' Mr. Keough said. But many of them seemed to be genuine students. ''I don't think the terms 'student' and 'terrorist' are necessarily mutually exclusive,'' said Colonel Scott.\nThe Foreign Service officer who asked not to be identified said the students had told him of being trained in the summer at Palestine Liberation Organization camps on how to handle hostages. He said they might even have had a manual on the subject.\n''It was something we assumed,'' he said, ''because they couldn't possibly have thought up all those things by themselves. They had some kind of instruction, some kind of guide, something more than their training, which they admitted to.''\nMany of the militants were incompetent gunslingers, he said. Guns often roared in the compound, and, while many hostages feared being shot accidentally, they could not resist joking about it. ''We'd laugh and say, 'There goes another toe,' '' he said. ''They were playing around with the firearms and didn't have good training. They ended up by having accidents. I know for a fact that one student was shot in the foot or the leg in the Mushroom Inn.''\nCharles Jones also had a low opinion of the captors. ''The majority of the so-called students were young unemployed kids,'' he said, noting that unemployment among the young in Iran was 70 percent. ''Many of them call themselves students because they have no better names to call themselves.''\nJohn Limbert said two interrogations he underwent persuaded him that his captors were incompetent. In the first, he was blindfolded; in the second, the interrogator had a bag over his head. ''I don't think they had any idea how an embassy actually works,'' he said. ''It was so amateurish you couldn't believe it. It was silly, blindalley stuff.''\nHe recalled one captor's interrogation: ''He asked me, 'Did you meet with Hassan so-and-so?' and I said, 'I don't know Hassan so-andso, and we argued for 15 minutes.''\n''He said, 'You're lying,' and I said, 'How do you know?' ''It was this kind of searching question that went on and on,'' he said sarcastically. The women prisoners felt that they had fared better than most of the men and, said Miss Koob, the probable explanation was that their captors' Islamic beliefs demanded different treatment for women.\nShe divided her captors into three groups. First, she said, were students - elite, very conservative students, 16 to 22 years of age, men and women, who had been picked from the various universities around town. They were the guards.\nThe second group, all male, ranged in age from the mid-20's to the early 30's. They were administrators. ''They all said, 'We're all equal, we have no bosses,' '' Miss Koob said. ''But they plainly did.''\nThe third group was the interrogators. They were highly trained and motivated, she said. There was, for instance, Hamid, known as Tooth because of a gap in his front teeth; he said he had studied computer science at Berkeley and he spoke fluent English.\nThe ''chief terrorist'', said Mr. Blucker, was named Ahmed. Another was called Pretty Boy, another Plowboy, another Bozo the Clown, remembered Mr. Morefield. ''They were all, I think, committed revolutionaries,'' he said.\nMr. Kennedy thought the nicknames were a bad idea because, he said, they made some of the guards angry. ''A polite approach is the way I was brought up in life,'' he said. ''I didn't kowtow. I didn't grovel. I treated them like you treat a waiter.''\nSome guards were compassionate, said Duane Gillette, particularly those who had been in prison themselves. But even these were careful not to let others see them being friendly, he said. ''To speak out against the treatment would have allowed the other militants to turn against that student and his life would have been in jeopardy,'' he said.\nSome guards achieved an off-and-on rapport with the hostages. Sergeant Sickmann, a high school football star, had beaten one of them repeatedly in arm wrestling, and one night in June, the guard challenged the sergeant to a real wrestling match, with two hostages and four guards as spectators. Sergeant Sickmann threw the guard across the room. ''They had to take him to the hospital and he came back with a sling on his arm,'' the sergeant said.\nOther guards would argue with their captives. Mr. Limbert, the political officer, told about it. ''One of them said to me, 'Why is America the greatest enemy of mankind?' That's where the conversation would start. Then I'd say, 'No wonder you don't go to school. You know everything. You know that the U.S. causes droughts in India and floods in Bangladesh. I envy you, you have such simple solutions. My 8-year-old son thinks better than you do.' ''\nOther guards used their captives as tutors. ''We helped them study for their exams,'' said Miss Koob. ''We helped them with their English. One girl was learning English for medical purposes and was studying the names of bones.''\nOther guards tried to stir dissension among the hostages, Sergeant Sickmann said. First they would favor one of his roommates, Sergeant Gallegos, by delivering letters from home, then they would favor him. ''But we'd sit down and talk it out,'' he said, ''and say this is just what they're trying to do. Because we knew there were people writing to us.'' The attempt failed, he said; all letters were shared.\n''It was like they had read that this is the way hostages are treated in Solzhenitsyn, treat them in random ways,'' said Mr. Limbert. ''It was like they had taken a course, Hostages 101, and they were doing it badly. I'd have given them a C-minus.''\nMiss Swift remembers that ''the students were quite willing to die for what they believed and during the first four or five days they repeatedly told me they were going to be martyrs because the United States was going to come in militarily and rescue us.''\nFor many hostages, the final months of captivity were a time to think and talk about the meaning of the experience, about President Carter's handling of the crisis and about the Shah, who, in a sense, had gotten them all into it.\nMoorhead Kennedy regarded the Shah as ''an awful man,'' and said the United States had shown incredibly bad judgment in its involvement with him. He did not criticize Mr. Carter, however, and spelled out what appeared to be the Administration's continuing predicament:\n''I didn't think you should negotiate with people who had seized an embassy. Maybe that means death for hostages. But you don't talk to terrorists. At least you don't for a while. But, of course, in the end you do.''\nDuane Gillette, the Navy petty officer, put the problem another way: ''If I die, would I be dying for America - or because of America?''\nAs for Mr. Carter, Mr. Gillette said that, whatever mistakes were made, he respected the former President for having had the ''courage'' to go to Germany and ''face us.''\nCharles Jones was less sanguine: ''Carter came to Germany to explain to us what he was trying to do and what was on his mind at the time. He was a sincere man, but it was all above him.''\nComdr. Donald Sharer of the Navy, like many of the military men among the hostages, said that government policy was not theirs to formulate.\n''We realize that America could not let the lives of 50 people jeopardize the principles in the lives of 200 million others, and we talked about it quite a bit,'' the commander said. But he added: ''Every once in a while, we'd say, 'Well, God bless it, I wish they'd nuke this place.' ''\nKathryn Koob said that in general she sympathized with the aims if not the means of the Iranian revolution. ''I had no quarrel with the 24-year-old girl who sat with tears in her eyes and talked about the need for education for the young girls of Iran,'' she said, adding:\n''I think the Shah made a lot of mistakes. If he personally was not cruel there was a great deal of cruelty done during his reign. I would like to see some sort of system set up so that leaders of countries are held accountable for their actions.'' pick up Iran IV\nAfter 11 months of captivity in which mob denunciations of the United States had become routine, the hostages suddenly heard a most outlandish sound waft into their cells one day: a stirring band recording of the quintessentially American march, ''Stars and Stripes Forever.''\n''Three cheers for the red, white and blue'' was being played through the streets, not for the benefit of the hostages but to stir Iranians to patriotic heights in the new and sudden war that had erupted with Iraq's invasion in late September.\nImmediately, Moorhead Kennedy deduced the meaning of the familiar martial music. ''We figured Iran must be involved in a local war of some sort, probably with Iraq,'' Mr. Kennedy recalled. ''The guards didn't react to all the war sounds in a way that threatened us, so we knew we weren't involved.''\nFrederick Kupke listened in fascination to the Sousa music and then tried to decipher the chants of the new street demonstrations outside - rallying cries that reminded him of nothing so much as a familiar football cheer: ''Get tough, Big Red! Get tough!''\nWhile Mr. Kennedy had no certain confirmation until a letter arrived weeks later from his wife, Louisa, hostages closer to the war action saw tracer bullets shooting through the air as they peered through the tiny windows of their cells.\n''We could feel some of the concussions,'' Sergeant Sickmann remembered. ''There was shelling and blackouts and stuff like that. They were telling us this was just their practice, that they were practicing for war.''\nCaptain Needham, an Air Force officer, leaped happily to the conclusion that a nighttime bombing was the work of the United States.\n''Not knowing the planes were Iraqi,'' he said, ''that these were not American planes, we put our candles in our windows and said, 'Here we are. Come and get us. Help put a hole in the wall so we can escape.' ''\nAs it became clear the trouble was with the Iraqis, hostages dared to hint at bias in discussing the new war with their captors, Sergeant Sickmann said. ''We would sit there and have discussions about how they were getting their ass beat, and they would say no, no, they were just preparing for an attack.''\nMichael Metrinko, the embassy political officer, could not resist defining a lesson for his captors, contending that the Iranians' preoccupation with holding the hostages had left them vulnerable to outside attack.\n''I took great joy in telling them all the people who had been killed had been killed because of their stupidity in taking the American embassy,'' he related, ''that if the American Government had relations with Iran, Iraq would never have attacked because they would have been afraid.''\nFrom their cells, the Americans could sense the sudden shift of Iranian attention. Richard Morefield, a former artillery officer, heard the Iraqi bombs land in Teheran and overheard guards discussing casualties. Even more, he saw increasing evidence of American trade sanctions against Teheran as food and kerosene became limited and long blackout periods were ordered, as much to save energy, it seemed to him, as to wage war.\n''It was working,'' he said of the American countermeasures. ''I was sure of this.'' Such stirrings of fresh anticipation fed into the final month of the Presidential elections going on back home, an event marked well by both hostages and captors. The Iranians began predicting President Carter's defeat and saying it would mean freedom for the Americans.\n''They would come in and say, yeah, Carter has to do something before the election to get us out that would make him look good in office,'' Sergeant Sickmann recounted, annoyed at the notion that domestic politics might intrude into a life-and-death issue. He said he was hoping instead that the President would come over and ''blow the country apart.''\nEach day of the far-off campaigning was echoed in the jail cells of Iran by some of the same questions about President Carter's dilemma that fascinated political analysts back in America.\n''We kept telling them that he didn't have to do anything,'' Sergeant Sickmann said. ''And they said, 'Oh no, no. It will be for sure, he will do something.' ''\nFor the hostages, the only certainty of such talk was that they had better steel themselves for the likelihood of another siege of hope and disappointment coinciding with the first anniversary of their captivity.\nSoon after the vote was cast in the United States, guards in Iran gleefully appeared to announce the defeat of ''the great Satan Carter.'' Moorhead Kennedy recalled that his main reaction had been a new sort of worry, that the change in administrations in Washington might require restarting the entire negotiating process with the Iranians.\nBy this time, at the beginning of their second year of imprisonment, the sporadic talk by some hostages of a breakout attempt began to interest such an earlier skeptic as Colonel Scott, the embassy military attache. He did not think an escape could work, but he indulged the talk nevertheless because he decided he could not wait ''forever.'' Accordingly, he and other hostages began to discuss an attempt at breaking out sometime after the beginning of Ronald Reagan's administration.\nFear was not a factor in such talk after the experience of the mock firing squad, he said. ''You can just get so scared, you get angry,'' he explained, ''and once you get angry it sustains you through many sorts of stress.''\nIn retrospect, incidents of resistance were recounted with pride by the repatriated Americans. ''When they attempted to give me the story about how religious they were, I would tell them they were a bunch of criminals,'' Michael Metrinko said, recalling that some of his worst confinement was suffered in the final months because of his resistant attitude.\n''I was being punished by the guards for my inability to establish a polite rapport,'' he said, telling of a final stretch of 17 days straight in a ''special punishment cell'' with no light, heat, bedding or books.\n''I was keeping warm by constantly jogging in the cell,'' he said. ''There wasn't enough room to walk.'' As Christmas approached, the hostages suddenly were gathered from their different points of jail-like confinement and put in comfortable surroundings they considered more reminiscent of the Shah's era. It was as if they were being reconditioned for freedom, but, even as the Carter Administration worked furiously to end the ordeal, again the captives guarded against certain conclusion.\nFor their second Christmas in captivity, some of the hostages boycotted the church service and rejected their jailors' gift of candy. ''I refused at that point to be used for propaganda purposes any more,'' Mr. Kennedy said, recalling the final three-week period of hunkering down amid endless rumors of approaching freedom.\nOn Jan. 19, a familiar figure from the opening weeks of captivity, ''Mary the terrorist,'' reappeared. With her was a man who instructed some of the hostages that ''candidates'' for freedom were about to go on television tape. The implication was clear that kind comments from the Americans would hasten their release.\n''Myself, I felt I'm not going to help this guy,'' Sergeant Lopez remembered. ''I'm not going to say anything just to get out.'' He did not cooperate. ''We figured it was just another dog-and-pony show to get the interview from us, to build up America's hopes and dash them again.''\nSgt. Gregory Persinger, on the other hand, decided freedom depended on the interview, in which he said he had not been mistreated by the Iranians. ''I was not forced,'' he said. ''You either do it or not, you're not going to be released. Let's say we were under pressure.''\nMaster Sgt. Regis Ragan, 38, said he had told the Iranian television workers, ''I have nothing to say to you people.'' They coaxed him to say ''the treatment is good, the food is good,'' but he continued to say nothing and eventually, he said, he was taken aside for special attention.\n''They physically abused me,'' he said. ''They hit me in the face and told me I was going back into that room to make a statement. I told them I had nothing to say to them.''\nThey called him obscene names, he said, ''and they threw me around.'' The rumors of freedom heightened about 5 P.M. on Jan. 19 when Navy Commander Sharer was told he was a ''candidate'' for freedom he recalled replying: ''I haven't believed you the last 10 months, why should I start believing you now?''\n''Well, you're going to be talking to 300 newsmen,'' the Iranian replied, as if ever conscious of the media aspects of the event. Robert Blucker said that by this point, after months of forced moves all around Iran, the band of hostages had bags of string, glasses and other handy materials. ''We were like the vagabonds who live on the sidewalks of New York,'' he said, describing his unsuccessful demand to take two bagloads with him to freedom. He got out with nothing much beyond a souvenir blindfold, and he did not fully believe the promised freedom that night until one of the people involved in final medical checks told him, ''We're the Algerians.''\nThe career diplomats, in particular, were heartened at the sight of neutral mediators in their midst. Richard Morefield finally believed freedom was at hand ''when I saw the Algerians.''\n''My impression was that they were true professionals and hard as nails,'' he said. At the height of the final confusion and doubt, an Iranian appeared with a simple, clear message as remembered by Commander Sharer in an interview with The Norfolk (Va.) Virginian-Pilot.\n''O.K., it's time,'' the hostages were told. ''Everybody's going home.'' ''There wasn't any cheering,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''We just did it.'' They were ''stacked like cordwood'' in buses and rushed out to the waiting airplane. They were hurried through what some took to be a token gauntlet of final vituperation, the words sounding almost like a sticks-and-stones jingle to some of the hostages.\n''Bad, bad, America's bad,'' the Americans heard in the blur and din of departure. ''Bad, bad America.'' ''I chimed in right with them, 'Bad, bad Iran.' '' Commander Sharer said, recounting his final hustle to freedom. Hurried along, Kathryn Koob took a last glance at Iran and the Iranians. ''I'm sure there were some among them who thought we should never have gone home,'' she said. ''But I think that for most of them they were pretty glad to see us go.''\nInside the aircraft, the Americans, some still doubting freedom was in the offing, shouted greetings after 14 months of captivity. ''When we heard the plane engines kicking in we knew we were going home,'' said Sergeant Persinger. ''I got inside that airplane,'' Commander Sharer said, beaming at the recollection, ''and some of the marines were already in there. I love those marines and I started giving college yells and cheers like I was on a football field and scoring a touchdown, and we were happy from then on.''\nOthers, visualizing all three dimensions of their captivity, would not yield to the moment until the Algerians turned the pilot's conversation onto the cabin speakers and let the control tower note the precise instant that the plane, dubbed Freedom One, was passing from Iranian airspace and jurisdiction -from captivity to freedom.\n''It brought tears to the eyes,'' Duane Gillette said. ''It was beautiful.'' In the air, the Americans, the walls between them gone, quickly began piecing together their common lives, filling in blanks, particularly the tantalizing ones of daily routine.\n''Everybody was asking questions,'' Sergeant Sickmann said of that flight from Iran. ''We'd recognize everybody's voices but we would ask questions, like, you know, 'what were you guys playing that night when I heard all that racket?' ''\nThe source of the racket of rolled dice, the counted moves, the oohs and ahs, it turned out, was Parcheesi. And that strange game of flopping sounds? It was hostage basketball, played with rolled-up socks tossed toward a cardboard hoop.\nAs the Americans returned and dispersed across the nation, crowds of compatriots seemed to be waiting almost enviously to hear of the discoveries made by the battered mission from Iran.\n''I found out I was not afraid of being shot,'' Michael Metrinko told the people back home in Pennsylvania. ''Of other things, yes, but not of dying.'' And of his country? ''I discovered I love it more than ever.''\n''I am amazed, surprised and elated at the America that we've come home to,'' Colonel Scott declared in coming home. ''It's not the same America that I left 17 months ago. It's a new America and I think no greater gift could be given to a professional soldier by his country than the gift of unity that I have seen since I've been back in America.''\nThe former hostages groped to describe the elation of fresh liberation, comparing it to an almost organic state. ''The feeling of freedom,'' said Jerry Miele, a Foreign Service communications officer. ''That's it. Freedom. You don't know what that is till you've come out and you are free. It changes your insides and you are alive again.''\nThis reconstruction of the 14 1/2-month ordeal of the American hostages in Iran is based on detailed interviews by The New York Times with 20 hostages plus public statements and other accounts by the hostages and their families.\nThe writers of the four segments presented here were, respectively, Robert D.

Knopf. $13.95.\nTHE literary map of India is about to be redrawn. The familiar outline -E.M. Forster's outline essentially -will always be there, because India will always offer the dualities essential for the Forsterian vision: the open sewer and the whispering glade, Mother Theresa and the Taj Mahal. Serious English-language novelists from India (often called Indo-Anglians), or those from abroad who use Indian material, have steered a steady course between these two vast, mutually obliterating realities; hence the vivid patches of local color provided by the timeless South India of R.K. Narayan's novels and the cool pastels added by the later fiction of Anita Desai. The Indian novels of Paul Scott and Ruth Jhabvala also fall comfortably between those two poles. For a long time it has seemed that novels from India write their own blurbs: poised, witty, delicate, sparkling.\nWhat this fiction has been missing is a different kind of ambition, something just a little coarse, a hunger to swallow India whole and spit it out. It needed a touch of Saul Bellow's Augie March brashness, Bombay rather than Chicago-born, and going at things in its own special Bombay way. Now, in ''Midnight's Children,'' Salman Rushdie has realized that ambition.\nIf I am to do more than describe my pleasure in this book, if I am to summarize and interpret, I would have to start by saying that ''Midnight's Children'' is about the narrator's growing up in Bombay between 1947 and 1977 (and about the 32 years of his grandparents' and parents' lives before that). It is also a novel of India's growing up; from its special, gifted infancy to its very ordinary, drained adulthood. It is a record of betrayal and corruption, the loss of ideals, culminating with ''The Widow's'' Emergency rule. As a growing-up novel with allegorical dimensions, it will remind readers of ''Augie March'' and maybe of Gunter Grass's ''The Tin Drum,'' Laurence Sterne's ''Tristram Shandy,'' and Celine's ''Death on the Installment Plan'' as well as the less-portentous portions of V.S. Naipaul. But it would be a disservice to Salman Rushdie's very original genius to dwell on literary analogues and ancestors. This is a book to accept on its own terms, and an author to welcome into world company.\nThe ''midnight's children'' of the title are the 1,001 children born in the first hour of Indian independence, Aug. 15, 1947. Two of these babies are born in the same Bombay nursing home on the very stroke of midnight: a boy born to wealth and a boy born to the streets. And, of course, a nursemaid switches babies: a street singer cuckolded by a departing Englishman is given the aristocratic Muslim infant and names him Shiva; a wealthy Kashmiri-descended family, the Aziz/Sinais, is given the ''cucumber-nosed'' English-Hindu and names him Saleem. Shiva and Saleem (the narrator) are destined to be mortal enemies from the stroke of midnight.\nSaleem receives all the attention. His birth is celebrated with fireworks, and Prime Minister Nehru sends a letter saying that his fate will forever be entwined with that of India. Growing up on a Bombay estate, he bumps his head one day while hiding in his mother's laundry hamper and discovers a gift for telepathy. From the age of nine, he can enter other lives at will, see through walls, plumb all secrets, including the secret of his true parentage. But his telepathic gifts bring death and destruction and very little happiness. He discovers that every one of the midnight children is miraculously gifted; only Saleem is telepathic, but some can travel through time (and even report that India is destined to be ruled by a ''urinedrinking dotard'') and one can change sex at will. The extravagance of Mr. Rushdie's inventions will call to mind the hovering presence of Gabriel Garcia Marquez; call it a tropical synchronicity.\nThe midnight children are the hope of the nation, and they await Saleem's calling of a ''midnight parliament.'' The only thing inhibiting Saleem from embracing his political destiny arises from his fear of the murdering street tough Shiva, whom he knows to be the rightful inheritor of all his privileges. And so, because of Saleem's fear and guilt, the gifts of the midnight children are never pooled. When they do finally meet, it is during Mrs. Gandhi's ''Emergency.'' Because of the threat they pose to the Only True Succession, the 581 surviving midnight's children are sterilized, and then treated to an even deadlier procedure: They are sperectomized - drained of hope.\n(Perhaps you wondered about the real reasons for the Emergency, the various Indo-Pakistani wars, the deaths of certain Indian and Pakistani political figures? Simple: to destroy Saleem, the Sinais and the gifted extended family of midnight's children. The plot of this novel is complicated enough, and flexible enough, to smuggle Saleem into every major event in the subcontinent's past 30 years. Saleem the Nose - variously called Snotnose, Stainface, Baldy, Sniffer, Buddha and Piece-of-the-Moon - knows).\nThe complex plotting of the book can be gauged (and its playfulness appreciated) by observing how closely an old seer's prophecy is followed. Of Saleem, it is predicted shortly before his birth: '' 'A son ... who will never be older than his motherland - neither older nor younger. ... There will be two heads - but you shall see only one - there will be knees and a nose, a nose and knees. ... Newspaper praises him, two mothers raise him! Bicyclists love him - but, crowds will shove him! Sisters will weep; cobras will creep. ... Washing will hide him - voices will guide him! Friends mutilate him - blood will betray him! ... Spittoons will brain him - doctors will drain him - jungle will claim him - wizards reclaim him! Soldiers will try him - tyrants will fry him ... He will have sons without having sons! He will be old before he is old! And he will die ... before he is dead.' ''\nAs a Bombay book, which is to say, a big-city book, ''Midnight's Children'' is coarse, knowing, comfortable with Indian pop culture and, above all, aggressive. Salman Rushdie assumes that the differences between Colaba and Chembur are as important, and can be made as interesting, as the differences between Brooklyn and The Bronx. ''We headed north,'' Saleem notes, ''past Breach Candy Hospital and Mahalaxmi Temple, north along Hornby Vellard past Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium and Haji Ali's island tomb ... We were heading towards the anonymous mass of tenements and fishing-villages and textile-plants and film-studios that the city became in these northern zones. ...'' Its characters speak in many voices: ''Once upon a time there were Radha and Krishna, and Rama and Sita, and Laila and Majnu; also (because we were not unaffected by the West) Romeo and Juliet, and Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.'' Much of the dialogue (the best parts) reads like the hip vulgarity - yaar! - of the Hindi film magazine. The desiccated syllables of T.S. Eliot, so strong an influence upon other Anglo-Indian writers, are gone. ''Midnight's Children'' sounds like a continent finding its voice.\nHow Indian is it? It is slangy, and a taste for India (or a knowledge of Bombay) obviously heightens the response. Here is a description of a cafe where Saleem's mother goes secretly to meet her dishonored first husband: ''The Pioneer Cafe was not much when compared to the Gaylords and Kwalitys of the city's more glamorous parts; a real rutputty joint, with painted boards proclaiming LOVELY LASSI and FUNTABULOUS FALOODA and BHEL-PURI BOMBAY FASHION, with filmi playback music blaring out from a cheap radio by the cash-till, a long narrow greeny room lit by flickering neon, a forbidding world in which broken-toothed men sat at reccine-covered tables with crumpled cards and expressionless eyes.'' Very Indian.\nOf course there are a few false notes. There is a shorter, purer novel locked inside this shaggy monster. A different author might have teased it out, a different editor might have insisted upon it. I'm glad they didn't. There are moments when the effects are strained, particularly in the early chapters, when an ancient Kashmiri boatman begins sounding like ''The Two-Thousand-Year-Old Man.'' On a more serious level, Mr. Rushdie at first has a difficult time endowing the villains of Indian politics with mythic stature (Grass's Germany made it so easy); petty household intrigues seem more momentous than the misaffairs of state (Marquez's Latin America made it easy too). But with Ayub Khan, the Bangladesh war, ''The Widow'' and her son, the later pages darken quite handsomely. The flow of the book is toward the integration of a dozen strongly developed narratives, and in ways that are marvelous to behold, integration is achieved. The myriad personalities of Saleem, imposed by the time, place and circumstance of his extraordinary birth (''So much, yaar, inside one person,'' remarks a Pakistani soldier, of the Saleem then known as Buddha, the tracker, ''so many bad things, no wonder he kept his mouth shut!''), are reduced to a single, eloquent, ordinary soul. The flow of the book rushes to its conclusion in counterpointed harmony: myths intact, history accounted for, and a remarkable character fully alive."}, {"text": "HOSTAGE CRISIS CRACKED U.S. MIRROR-AND THE WORLD'S\n1981-01-18T05:00:00.000Z\nPARIS THE story of the American hostages in Iran was a peculiar episode in United States and world history, not unique in itself, because the fate of prisoners is one of the oldest recurrent dramas, but quite extraordinary in its impact.\nThe first result - and it must not be forgotten because it was surely the motive for the act - was the fall of the Bazargan Government in Teheran. An international crisis developed duly and immediately. But only slowly came widespread understanding that the arousal of emotional hostility to the United States was a crucial element of Iranian revolutionary politics, not merely an act of defiance or retribution and not at all the mindless, crazy gesture it seemed.\nThe shock traveled much faster than perception of its purpose. For Americans, it was an inexplicable affront and all the more frustrating because it appeared pointless and out of all proportion to the presumed grievance, admission of the dying, deposed Shah to the United States and to a New York hospital. To governments everywhere and to millions of their people, it was an outrage, a dangerous challenge to the fragile structure of international relations, which rests on so little law and so much force and deceit. If even the essential code of diplomatic immunity were to be flouted, how could there be reliance on any kind of order except jungle violence, where mosquitoes were free to drive lions wild? Terrorism, attacks on and even murder of diplomats had become familiar headlines. But this time it wasn't freelancers or rebels seeking explosive attention, it was a regime accepted, if not admired, by the whole community of nations.\nThe seizure of the embassy and the hostages brought an unpredictable, awesome risk for countries in the area and countries that depend on the area for their oily economic blood. If the United States reacted to the provocation militarily, as the Iranian militants seem to have expected and even hoped, where would that lead? Would the whole Persian Gulf take fire from the sparks? Would other regimes be forced to take sides? Would the Russians intervene?\nFeeling menaced by the Iranian precedent on one side and the possible American response on the other, American allies accepted with a certain relief the United States call to the United Nations Security Council and other ritual deplorings. President Carter ordered nonstudying Iranian students deported - an emotionally satisfying move to television viewers appalled by the hateful grimaces of the self-styled students in front of the United States Embassy in Teheran, but one that fizzled in a country that doesn't require identity cards and can't track down illegal immigrants. Puzzling and Sneering\nThen he ordered a ban on oil from Iran and froze Iranian assets. Some hostages were freed, but after zealots seized the Grand Mosque at Mecca, there was a sudden rise of tempers between much of Islam and the West. United States embassies in Pakistan, Turkey, Bangladesh and India were attacked. Other governments, trying to puzzle out the direction of events, began to worry about the lack of forceful American action as much or more than about the danger of it, and officials in various capitals took to private little sneers about how much tougher they would have been. Israel's raid on Entebbe to free hijacked plane passengers was a favorite comparison, though none suggested how the tactic might have been applied to Teheran.\nThe focus was still on the deposed Shah as the supposed heart of the problem. Mexico, where he had gone to live in exile, refused to readmit him. Panama gave him temporary refuge in December 1979, and in March 1980 he was welcomed to Egypt in a gesture of widely admired courage and courtesy by President Anwar el-Sadat.\nGradually, Iranian militants, officials and assorted spokesmen, often contradicting each other, shifted the emphasis of their tirades. There was only a brief flurry of complaint that the United States had somehow colluded with death in cheating the revolution of its most coveted victim when Mohammed Riza Pahlevi died in Cairo in late July.\nThe factional infighting, the absence of decisive authority, and the importance of the American hostages to Iranian politics grew more evident. The Iranians, after the intoxication of revolutionary victory, were trying to organize a new regime. Each stage was described as a kind of watershed, a period too critical and politically delicate to permit consideration of the face-saving compromises proposed by a series of would-be mediators. A new Constitution gave Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini supreme power for life. But it turned out he didn't want to use his power to seek a settlement.\nThe United States called at the United Nations for sanctions on Iran, but the Russians vetoed them. After some hesitation, Washington proclaimed economic sanctions itself and urged its friends to do likewise. By then, mid-January 1980, the momentum of world reaction was ebbing. The invasion of Afghanistan had provoked a new and far more direct international issue for America's allies to consider. The hostage drama became familiar, the shock began to wear off and few people elsewhere realized how deeply offended and infuriated the American public remained.\nAbolhassan Bani-Sadr, who as Foreign Minister and Finance Minister had issued encouraging words about a possible settlement, was elected President and more meetings were planned. But each time there appeared to be some chance of real negotiations, nothing happened except to remind America of its failure and increase its frustrations.\nSympathy soured into renewed allied carping about American performance of its role in the world. The West argued about how to register protest over Afghanistan. Again, sanctions were sought but limited mostly to United States action, and attention was concentrated with little result on who would go to the Moscow Olympics.\nDiplomacy was spinning its wheels and nothing else was moving. Then, suddenly on April 25 came the almost incredible news of the United States rescue mission aborted with casualties in the Iranian desert before a shot was fired. That was a blow that thundered around the world. In foreign countries, people came up to Americans to express their sorrow, but compassion had turned to pity and then disdain. In the United States, there were recriminations over who was to blame and what went wrong. Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance, who had opposed the operation, resigned.\nThe rest of the world, however, was stunned by the simple question of what it meant about America, for two generations the model of modernity, efficiency, technological expertise and, above all, the very symbol of military power. Was it all a myth? Did the giant have clay feet up to its noggin? If American forces couldn't even successfully launch the rescue of American hostages, was the United States capacity to rescue allies still credible?\nThe questions were extravagant, but so was everything else about the story. It looked more and more like Grand Guignol, awful but not to be taken all that seriously by people with problems of their own. As a consequence of the American raid, the hostages were dispersed, ruling out any chance of a luckier second rescue try but also demonstrating that their captors did not intend to kill them. Lurching and Sputtering\nAfter that, the impasse was obvious. Iran lurched on through its endless upheaval, a replay of the French revolution complete with reign of terror, internal war with the Kurds, teetering struggles for power. Exchanges about conditions for release of the hostages sputtered through the press, but no one in Teheran seemed to have the authority and the will to make anything stick.\nIn September, a spate of border clashes between Iran and Iraq suddenly escalated into full-scale war. Ayatollah Khomeini had been preaching export of Iranian-style revolution around the Persian Gulf and doing what he could to provoke the downfall of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. After purges in the army, continued chaos and signs of disillusion in Iran, the Baghdad leader obviously thought a quick, fierce strike would topple the Ayatollah.\nIraq's aggression wasn't exactly a Bay of Pigs, but it had the same boomerang effect of consolidating domestic support for the Teheran regime against the foreign invader. Once again, there was a sense of looming global crisis. Efforts to produce a cease-fire failed and the war still drags on fitfully. But so far it has been contained and has not seriously disrupted the vital flow of oil from the Persian Gulf.\nStill, Iran began to hurt, and predictably found itself unable to drive out the foe. Money and arms could no longer be brushed aside by mullahs as imperialist concerns of little importance, and it mattered more that Iran found itself with few friends in the world.\nThe war forced a tilt in perceptions and probably a tilt in the political battle still being waged in Teheran. But that took time, and meanwhile the United States was waging an election campaign. The hostages, the whole history of policy toward Iran, were a domestic American issue. It was played with a theatricality that advertised cynicism.\nIt isn't clear what factors influenced Teheran to go on toying with Washington's hopes right through the elections, but the calculations evidently shifted when it was settled that a new Administration would take office Jan. 20. Whoever makes decisions in Teheran decided the time had come for an earnest attempt to end the affair. There was still a try at bazaar bargaining on a scale of billions. With the help of Algeria, the price was narrowed essentially to release of the hostages in return for Iran's frozen assets.\nIn a way, that would restore the situation of 14 months ago for both sides. There is still suspense. It will bring tremendous relief for Americans if the hostages are home on Inauguration Day, providing a symbol of reconciliation and of a fresh era after the elections. But the whole incident leaves deep scars, not only on IranianAmerican relations but on America's profile in the world.\nIt was one thing that the United States fought a war in Vietnam. What does it mean, however, that hatred of America should be an effective political weapon in the internal struggles of a distant country? When the drama has finally ended and the pains and passions subside, that question will have to be pondered."}, {"text": "MCNAMARA WARNS U.S. OF PERILS IN REDUCING AID TO WORLD'S POOR Washington\n1981-06-21T05:00:00.000Z\nRobert S. McNamara, who will retire at the end of this month after 13 years as president of the World Bank, believes that United States economic and political interests will be seriously injured if this country retreats further from its earlier commitments to aid the poor people of the third world.\nIn an interview in his office in Washington last week, Mr. McNamara said Congress was ''on the verge of repudiating'' agreements made by the Carter Administration, and endorsed by the Reagan Administration, to provide $658.3 million as the American contribution toward a general increase for the World Bank and $3.2 billion over a period of three years to the sixth replenishment of the International Development Association, the bank's ''soft loan'' affiliate that lends to the poorest countries. 'We Are Bankrupt Today'\n''With respect to I.D.A.,'' he said, ''essentially we are bankrupt today. At the end of next week, the end of our fiscal year, we will have about $1 billion of I.D.A. credits approved by our board, but for which we have no commitment authority, and hence no authority to sign.''\nAnd, he added, ''those are for projects that are to deal with these very basic problems,'' of poverty and financial crisis, ''the solution to which will benefit not only the developing countries but the United States.''\nIf the United States fails to support the development affiliate, Mr. McNamara believes that other countries will exercise their right under a trigger clause tied to the United States contribution and will withhold their own support, and the affiliate will collapse. Reduced to $1.9 Billion\nWhile the Republican-dominated Senate, following the White House endorsement, has voted the full authorization of $3.2 billion for the development affiliate, the Democratic-led House Banking and Currency Committee has cut the authorization to $1.9 billion.\nBut since there is actually little support for even the truncated bill among Republicans or Democrats in either the House of Representatives or the Senate, it may be excluded from the huge reconciliation bill that ultimately emerges from Congress.\nThus, with just over a week to go in his present job, Mr. McNamara is worrying and working down to the wire. At 65, he looks thin and fit; his eyes are bright and restless behind silver-rimmed spectacles. He is deeply tanned, both from his wanderings in the hot countries of the third world and from the tennis courts of Washington; last week, however, he was wearing a surgical harness on his right arm, having just broken his wrist playing tennis.\nHe still works in shirt-sleeves, donning a jacket only for picturetaking. He seems as passionately involved in his job as he did when President Lyndon B. Johnson accepted his resignation as Secretary of Defense in 1968 during the Vietnam War and backed him for the presidency of the World Bank. This post has always been held by an American, and Mr. McNamara's successor will be A.W. Clausen, former chairman of the Bank of America, with headquarters in San Francisco, which was also Mr. McNamara's hometown.\nIt was President Carter who named Mr. Clausen to the post, with Mr. Reagan's concurrence, although the extent of the Reagan Administration's commitment to the World Bank's aid program remains in doubt. Roll-Call Vote Shunned\nSo unpopular is foreign aid with voters, at a time when even domestic food stamp and welfare programs are being slashed, that the Democrats in Congress are loath to support foreign aid on a roll-call vote, lest they be attacked by their Republican rivals as ''big foreign aid spenders.''\nThe crucial factor that will determine whether the authorization of aid for the World Bank Group dies in Congress or passes is likely to be the pressure exerted by President Reagan and his lobbyists on Capitol Hill on behalf of the bill.\nBut the White House appears reluctant to fight hard for foreign aid, hoarding its capital for what it regards as more urgent causes. Some high Administration officials, such as David A. Stockman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, are on record as favoring deep cuts in foreign aid, including funds for the World Bank. Wide-Ranging Talk\nIn last week's interview, Mr. McNamara talked extensively on a wide range of economic, political and technical subjects, rarely consulting notes for data. But the McNamara personality is not computerlike but a blend of precision and emotion. He himself speaks of the need to combine ''a soft heart and a hard head.''\nHis uppermost immediate concern is to rescue and strengthen United States support for the World Bank. He said he believed American economic and political interests would be seriously injured if this country retreated further from its earlier commitments to aid the poor people of the third world, which appears likely as Congress wrangles over economic legislation.\n''The United States contribution to development assistance,'' he said, ''is disgracefully low; it has declined in relation to national income 90 percent since the Eisenhower Administration at a time when national income in real terms per capita has more than doubled. It is today the 15th lowest among the major industrial nations. There is no other large industrial nation providing as low a proportion of its national income to development assistance; it is disgraceful.'' 'A Hard-Headed Look'\nMr. McNamara declined to criticize the Reagan Administration for not lending the bank stronger support. ''The Administration,'' he said, ''is a reflection of the views of the American people.'' But he said: ''I think our people have failed to recognize in the last 10 or 20 years what has happened to the world they live in. They do not understand how our nation should respond to these changes in ways that address its national interest. I am not talking about 'dogoodism' now. I am talking about taking a hard-headed look at where the nation's interests lie.''\nMr. McNamara said that if the United States slashed its support for poor countries, the country would be penalized in the following areas:\n- Inflation, because the World Bank finances production of essential commodities, the scarcity of which could raise world prices - foodstuffs and energy, for example.\n- Economic growth, because third world countries absorb roughly a third of United States exports. If lack of financial support erodes this market, domestic production and employment could be badly hurt.\n- Strategic interest, because lower rates of economic and social advance in the developing countries are almost certain to bring political instability damaging to the United States, adding to its military costs and adversely affecting its national security.\nMr. McNamara, who will leave the World Bank on July 1, is in a sense the last of the generation of post-World War II crusaders for a better world order to hold high public office. It was a group who combined a militant anti-Communism with a concern for world economic development. Commissioned Pentagon Papers\nAlthough Vietnam was for a time called ''McNamara's War'' - it was he who commissioned the Pentagon Papers, which explored the origins of the war -he declined in the interview to give his present views on the American involvement in Vietnam, saying: ''I have not talked about my period in Vietnam, and I am not going to start today. I may some time, but not while I am in this institution. It is inappropriate for an international civil servant to do that.''\nWith both the cold war and the drive for social and economic reform at home and abroad in their background, Mr. McNamara and others like him have been attacked from the left as self-interested capitalists pretending to be socially responsible and from the right as socialists undermining the free-enterprise system.\nMr. McNamara considers such charges to be baseless and ignorant as applied to himself and the institution he has headed. When asked about the assertion made by some on both the right and the left that the World Bank is supported by American commercial bankers as a kind of bailout operation for banks that lent too heavily to the developing countries, Mr. McNamara responded:\n''On the contrary, it's supported by individuals in this country who understand that our own economy will suffer, not the banks. The banks are intelligently managed; their loans to developing countries are a relatively small percentage of their total loans outstanding; they have appropriate reserves in relation to them; they are concentrated in some of the stronger developing countries. Brazil, for example, is a very rich country, even if it does at times have liquidity problems. Over the long run the banks aren't going to lose a lot of money on Brazil.\n''So the charge that this bank is moving in ways that are designed to bail out U.S. commercial banks is absurd. This bank is, however, moving in ways that are consistent with the broad economic interests of the U.S. And if this bank is prevented from continuing to move in those ways, not only will the developing countries be hurt, and particularly the poorest people in those countries, but the U.S. economy will be hurt, and the American people will be hurt.'' Criticism Rejected Harshly\nMr. McNamara rejects harshly the criticism, offered by a host of conservatives, including some within the Administration, that the World Bank is undermining private enterprise and promoting socialism. He called the accusation an extreme hindrance to the bank's operations, especially in the United States.\n''They are ignorant,'' Mr. McNamara said of the conservative critics. ''They are ignorant of what the bank is doing. The bank in a very real sense is the largest single source of financing of private enterprise in the developing world, without qualification.''\nMr. McNamara noted, for instance, that more than 30 percent of the bank's financing went to agriculture, almost all of it for financing individual, private farmers. He said the bank urges developing countries to increase their efficiency by relying on the price system to direct resources and to stop subsidizing the urban centers at the expense of the poor rural people. ''We consistently urge real interest rates,'' he added, ''that is, avoidance of interest subsidies, in order to stimulate savings and assure a directing of capital investment to situations where there will be a real rate of return. We consistently advise against, and as a matter of fact we'll refuse to loan for investment in utilities, public utilities, electric companies, water companies, railroads where the tariffs, the prices, are not set to yield profits, real rates of return so that they are self-sustaining investments.''\nHe feels that the bank has made great strides in its attack on absolute poverty. The most obvious accomplishment of the bank under his administration, he said, had been to increase its annual commitments of loans from $1 billion in 1968 to $13 billion in the fiscal year ending June 30, which has meant, after allowing for inflation, quadrupling or quintupling its real lending. But the most important accomplishment, he feels, was learning to focus resources and technical assistance on the poor, raising their productivity and hence their output and real income.\nWith the statistical exactness for which he has long been noted, first as a Harvard Business School professor, then as a statistical controller in the United States Air Force during World War II and as president of the Ford Motor Company, Mr. McNamara reeled off the rates of return from investments in antipoverty programs in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Burundi and other poor countries. These rates of return ranged as high as 50 percent and averaged 19 to 20 percent on invested capital. Greatest Accomplishment\nThis, he feels, was his greatest accomplishment: the discovery that the bank could help the poor and society simultaneously. It is with some regret that Mr. McNamara will leave his post at the World Bank. ''I don't want to quit yet, either,'' Mr. McNamara said. To that end, he has already accepted a number of appointments to the boards of nonprofit institutions, including the Brookings Institution, the Ford Foundation, the Urban Institute and the California Institute of Technology, as well as to the boards of such corporations as Royal Dutch/Shell, Corning Glass and The Washington Post.\n''I am going to divide my time roughly 50-50 between the public and the private sectors,'' he added. ''I hope to be active in continuing to advise both our own Government and other governments in fields that I may have some competence in. I am not wealthy, but I don't have to choose my activities on the basis of compensation, and I don't care about status or prestige. I am willing to do anything that will be of assistance to either our Government or other governments. I do believe in public service, I am interested in it, excited about it. Foreign governments have asked me to provide advice and I will be doing so. And I am not going to accept compensation. I'm just going to do it when I feel like it, and when it will be helpful.'' Disappointments Cited\nHas he any disappointments as he looks back over his performance as president of the World Bank? He said he had, among them ''the deferral of certain actions that I had hoped to initiate.'' One of them would have been a ratio change - a higher proportion of lending relative to the bank's capital. Another, he added, '' would have been an expansion of our research program, a very substantial expansion, because I think that through that we would increase the world's understanding of the development program and how to accelerate it, with advantage to all parties.''\nHe said his greatest disappointment was that ''we and others have failed to inform the people of the industrial countries of the nature and magnitude of the changes in the relationships among nations, economically and politically, over the last decade'' - especially their greater interdependence.\n''For that reason,'' he said, ''we have failed to show them where their own narrow interests lie. We have failed to convince them that there is a plus-sum game as part of which they can move to assist the developing countries to achieve economic and social advance with benefits to both the developing and industrialized countries.''\n''Now that is my strong belief,'' he added. ''It is a belief I think is shared by most of my associates, and by many others outside the institution, and it is that failure which I think is leading to less than rational action by many of the nations, particularly the United States.''"}, {"text": "THE U.N.'S MAN IN THE MIDDLE\n1981-09-13T05:00:00.000Z\nJane Rosen is the United Nations correspondent for The Guardian of London. By Jane Rosen lmost every weekday morning around 8:30, a plainclothes security guard steps out of an East Side town house and scans the block. A few minutes later, a tall, angular man in his early 60's emerges, formal in a dark suit, head bent, face preoccupied, strung tight. United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim strides quickly downtown, full of energy, and the guard falls into step beside him. There isn't much conversation. ''Occasionally,'' the guard says, ''he'll talk about the new plan for the U.N. garden or the weather or how he wishes he could stay home some night.''\nAmid others hurrying to work, somewhat to Mr. Waldheim's sorrow, no one recognizes him. Which is curious, since the work he does affects virtually every country in the world, and is not conducted in obscurity.\nAt United Nations headquarters, they take an elevator reserved exclusively for the Secretary General to the 38th floor of the Secretariat building. Mr. Waldheim says good morning to the receptionist, w ho is also an armed guard, enters his own suite of offices and, with his usual courtliness, shakes hands with each of his five secretaries (anyone still there when he leaves at 8 or 9 or 10 P.M. gets a good-night handshake as well).\nMr. Waldheim has been following more or less the same routine for the last 10 years, and he hopes to continue for another five. Kurt Waldheim of Austria may very well be the last European to run the United Nations, and the last Secretary General who is committed to Western democracy. He is up for re-election before the end of this year but whenever he leaves office, his successor is likely to be a man of the third world (see box, page 68), and most probably a representative of a one-party state.\nAs the United Nations prepares to decide whether to give Mr. Waldheim an unprecedented third term, he is surrounded by controversy. Conservative American critics charge he is too responsive to pressure from the Soviet Union and the third world. Third-world critics maintain he accommodates too readily to superpower demands. Almost everyone complains that he will not move without a consensus, which often means he cannot move at all. United Nations employees feel he doesn't pay enough attention to his administrative duties, and morale among the staff is low. To critics of the United Nations itself, he symbolizes that organization's shortcomings: its inability to resolve problems of war and peace, its endless rheto ric, its failure to compel the 154 member nations to submerge thei r parochial interests for the common good.\nDespite all of this, Mr. Waldheim's supporters - and many of his critics -believe he is the best available candidate. ''The problems here are so complicated, and the points of view so divergent,'' says a Western ambassador, ''that no matter who was Secretary General, he couldn't do much more than Waldheim.'' A third-world diplomat agrees, saying, ''He isn't an activist but the big powers would never accept an activist. He has a talent for getting people together and he has managed to keep the lid on this organization.''\nMr. Waldheim has not officially declared his candidacy because a would-be Secretary General usually waits until member nations approach him. But during his travels over the past year or so, he has been discreetly sounding out United Nations members - at the 20th anniversary of the Nonaligned Group in New Delhi, the Organization of African Unity summit in Nairobi and a summit of the Islamic nations in Saudi Arabia. He also visited the capitals of the five permanent members of the Security Council - the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union and China.\nTheir support is decisive, since the Secretary General is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council, which means any of the five can veto a candidate. For the moment, none of the other candidates now in the running seem able to command the backing of all five permanent members. So, even though the great majority of the United Nations are third-world countries and most would like one of their own to be Secretary General, Mr. Waldheim still seems to have the edge. nder the United Nations Charter, the Secretary General is both the chief administrative officer and the chief political executive. Each is a full-time job. Mr. Waldheim's annual salary is $158,340, or $91,556 after a United Nations assessment which is the equivalent of taxes, and he gets a hospitality allowance of $22,500.\nMr. Waldheim's office suite includes a conference room large enough for meetings with his two dozen or so top assistants, a private dining room in which he holds working luncheons for ambassadors, visiting diplomats and other guests, a bedroom he never uses and a bathroom. President John F. Kennedy once decided to take a bath there - probably the first person who ever did - but when he ran the tap water in the tub, it was brown with rust. Since then, somebody has been assigned to run the water every day just in case another head of state decides he wants a bath.\nAlmost as soon as Mr. Waldheim sits at his desk, he is on the telephone. His voice - affable, solicitous, with its German accent and syntax - has become familiar to practically every foreign minister and a good many heads of state. ''I rang up Al Haig,'' he says with obvious pleasure, ''and he assured me ... .''\nMr. Waldheim enjoys being at the center, even though he may sometimes be rebuffed. After a special Assembly session in which the United States and Britain had resisted stiff economic demands from the poor countries, Mr. Waldheim telephoned President Jimmy Carter, asking him to be more forthcoming. The President was pleasant, but negative. Later, an American diplomat said Washington felt the Secretary General had overstepped.\nMr. Waldheim is responsible for appointing and running the United Nations Secretariat, the 15,000 men and women who work at New York headquarters and in bureaus from Aden to Zimbabwe. The higher-ranking jobs in this international civil service are supposed to be distributed equitably among United Nations members, and one of Mr.Waldheim's biggest headaches is that all nations press him for more and better posts. ''Every government wants its nationals in the Secretariat,'' he says, ''and the ambassadors come to me all the time, often with formal notes from their gove rnments, insisting on this job or that. I have to spend hours and h ours figuring out how toimited number of good ones, I can't satisfy everyone.''\n''He shouldn't try,'' one of his aides says. ''He isn't nearly tough enough. He ought to tell the governments, 'Go see my personnel director.' But he hates to offend people.''\nMr. Waldheim also hates to dismiss people, and there are many incompetents in the Secretariat. Still, he can only pick his staff from the candidates put forth. Thus, if a government comes to him with a nominee unqualified to be a nonpartisan international civil servant, Mr. Waldheim can reject him; but the next one he is offered may not be an improvement.\nSupervising the Secretariat is burdensome, and Mr. Waldheim is more interested in the political side of his job, dealing with nations and trying to solve conflicts. The Security Council and the General Assembly have fostered the myth that the Secretary General is a kind of political Hercules, capable of doing what sovereign governments cannot do. It is a very convenient myth beause it allows governments to pass the b uck to him. In the last couple of years, the Council and/ or the A ssembly have adopted resolutions asking Mr. Waldheim to get Iran to fee the American hostages, get the Soviet troops out of Afghanistan, get the Vietnamese out of Cambodia, get the Israelis out of the occupied territories, get the South Africans out of Namibia, end apartheid , help the Palestine Liberation Orgranization set up an independent s tate, end the war between Iran and Iraq, bring the Greekand Turkish Cypriots together, and facilitate world disarmanent and the transfer of resources from rich to poor nations, among other things.\n''When there is any possibility of solving a problem,'' Mr. Waldheim tells an interviewer, ''the governments involved do it themselves, either bilaterally or through regional diplomacy. It is only when they can't figure out how to solve it that they throw it to me. At least it shows they have confidence in my readiness to tackle these problems and in my sincerity and nonpartisanship. But I don't have the power to solve them. No Secretary General does.''\nThe Secretary General has no military forces (United Nations peacekeeping forces are assigned to specific tasks by the Security Council), no capacity to take economic measures, and very few political favors to give or withhold. Mr. Waldheim cannot compel the Security Council or the General Assembly to act: They are sovereign bodies made up of sovereign nations. When they do act, he cannot compel member nations to obey.\nAnd yet the Secretary General has a large capability for creating trouble. It was the decison of U Thant of Burma, Mr. Waldheim's predecessor, to withdraw the United Nations Emergency Force from the Sinai that touched off the 1967 war in the Middle East. U Thant's predecessor, Dag Hammarskjold of Sweden, who was the United Nations' most imaginative and forceful leader, created so much opposition that he nearly paralyzed the United Nations. ''Everybody now thinks of Hammarskjold as a huge success,'' says Brian Urquhart, United Nations Under Secretary General for Special Political Affairs. ''The fact is that he became a total lame duck. The Russians and the French wouldn't speak to him and a lot of other people didn't want anything to do with him. By the end of his tenure he was out.'' And Mr. Hammarskjold's predecessor, Trygve Lie of Norway, who was the first Secretary General, so enraged the Russians that they vetoed his reelection.\nMr. Waldheim, aware of his predecessors' problems, is determined to touch base with all the power blocs before he takes major initiatives.\nAnd this is exactly what the power blocs want. While one hears talk at the United Nations about the need for a strong Secretary General, most governments would agree with the former American delegate, Donald F. McHenry, who said, ''Yes, the U.S. would like a strong Secretary General - so long as he agreed with everything we wanted done.'' In explaining Mr. Waldheim's approach to his job, his associates invariably go back to his Austrian background. Born in the village of St. Andrae-Wordern in 1918, just after the armistice and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he grew up during years of economic and political travail. ''Our family was always hungry,'' he says now. ''Almost everyone in Austria was always hungry.''\nWhen he was in his teens, Marxist-conservative civil war broke out, which the Austrian Nazis exploited to increase their power. Mr. Waldheim says that his father, a conservative Roman Catholic school official, spoke out publicly against the Nazis and he himself joined the anti-Nazi Austrian Youth Movement.\nWhen Mr. Waldheim was 19, Hitler annexed his country. H is father was detained by the Gestapo; when released, h e was not permitted to work and the family was almost penniless. ''W e lived in constant fear,'' Mr. Waldheim says. ''My father had to present himself to the authorities regularly. We were always shadowe d by the police.''\nAt the beginning of World War II, young Kurt was drafted into the German Army. ''Fortunately,'' Mr. Waldheim says, ''I didn't last long. My unit moved to the Russian front in the win-ter of 1942. I was badly wounded in the ankle, I couldn't walk, and they gave me a medical discharge.''\nThe fact that Mr. Waldheim served in the German Army has led to charges that he supported the Nazis. ''What nonsense!'' he says. ''I was against the Nazis.'' His aides maintain that the charges were circulated by the Israeli Mission to the United Nations, but Yehuda Z. Blum, the Israeli delegate, denies this indignantly: ''We don't believe Waldheim ever supported the Nazis and we never said he did. We have many differences with him, but that isn't one of them.''\nAfter Mr. Waldheim's discharge, he studied law - and he learned other lessons as well. In Nazi Austria, caution and accommodation were the keys to survival. ''We had always to be very discreet and wehad to appear to conform,'' Mr. Waldheim recalls.\nThe one happy note of those years was meeting a fellow law student, Elisabeth Ritschl in 1943. They were married a year later and, soon after Austria's liberation in 1945, their first child, Liselotte, was born. ''I remember thinking that her coming on the heels of a terrible war was a repetition of myown beginning,'' Mr. Waldheim wrote in a memoir, ''and I prayed ... the world might fashion an abiding peace. ...''\nPostwar Austria was occupied by rival Western and Soviet forces, and young Waldheim, who had a job in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, observed his country's leaders cautiously and skillfully balancing the interests of both sides. He would remember those lessons, too. When the occupation ended in 1955, Austria was committed to democracy at home, and to neutrality in international affairs.\nAnd so was Mr. Waldheim. By then a rising Austrian diplomat, he avoided partisanship even in domestic affairs. Although he was politically conservative, he worked with the Socialists as well as the conservative People's Party. In 1964, a coalition government appointed Mr. Waldheim to be Austria's United Nations delegate; in 1968, he was named Foreign Minister in a conservative government; after the conservatives lost the 1970 election, the Socialist Chancellor, Bruno Kreisky, a good friend of Mr. Waldheim's, asked him to become United Nations delegate again. The following year, Mr. Waldheim ran for President of Austria as an independent, backed by the People's Party, and he lost narrowly. Eight months later, he was elected Secretary General of the United Nations. Mr. Waldheim's performance as Secretary General over the years gives observers the impression that he has developed certain patterns of behavior, responses to the demands on him, which might fancifully be categorized as the Waldheim Rules of Diplomacy - although he certainly would not put it that way:\n(1) The Secretary General must stay on good terms with everybody (despite American wishes, the United Nations is not an extension of the State Department). ''Since I am responsible to the whole U.N. membership,'' Mr. Waldheim says, ''I can't take sides. Even when I myself believe one side is right, I must take into account the positions of all the member nations. This isn't a matter of expediency. If I antagonize one of the parties to a conflict, how can I get it to cooperate with me in solving the conflict?''\nTake the conflict over Afghanistan. The General Assembly twice called for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, and expressed the ''hope'' that the Secretary General would appoint a special representative to go to Afghanistan to promote a political settlement.\nThe Americans immediately pressed Mr. Waldheim to name a prestigious international mediator to keep the heat on the Russians. But the Soviets told Mr. Waldheim that, since they had opposed the Assembly resolution, they wouldn't cooperate with a special representative - that is, let him into Kabul. They also said, in effect, ''Look, Mr. Secretary General, since we won't give our consent, there's no point in trying to send anybody to Afghanistan. Anyway, you aren't obliged to name a representative. The Assembly only said it hoped you would.''\n''One side tells me, 'Implement the resolution,' '' Mr. Waldheim says. ''The other side says, 'No, we don't want it.' Of course, I respect the General Assembly's wishes, but I have to make sure my efforts to implement them will be constructive. Do you remember the crisis over Hungary in 1957? The United Na- tions sent Sir Leslie Munro there, but the Russians never let him in. Year after year, he would report back to the General Assembly and say, 'I'm sorry, but I couldn't go there, they wouldn't admit me.' Is that really what the Assembly wants to happen with Afghanistan? Of course not.'' Last winter, after considerable discussion, Mr. Waldheim decided to name as his representative to Afghanistan one of his closest aidesat the United Nations, Javier Perez de Cuella r of Peru. The Soviets have allowed him to visit Kabul twice, and la st month he got their client regime in Kabul to agree conditionally to discuss a Soviet troop withdrawal along with international gua rantees of Afghanistan's neutrality and the return of it s refugees.\nMr. Waldheim concedes this is not a major achievement, but he believes that the Russians just might have ambivalent feelings about being bogged down in a guerrilla war in Afghanistan and, if they have, his nonpartisan approach might help them get out.\n(2) Quiet diplomacy is the way to get things done. ''Governments don't like to be told publicly how they should behave any more than people do,'' Mr. Waldheim says. ''So I always try first to appeal privately for what I want, using quiet diplomacy. If this doesn't work, and if I believe a public statement wouldbe helpful, then I make it. It isn't true what some of the media say, that I'm too cautious.''\nIn human-rights cases, his ''quiet diplomacy'' has often been helpful, although he is reluctant to disclose the concessions he has won for fear of jeopardizing future efforts. One concession, disclosed by other sources, came from the Pinochet Government in Chile. After the rightist coup, Mr. Waldheim sent Under Secretary General Bradford Morse (now head of the United Nations Development Program), to Santiago. Subsequently, the regime released a number of political prisoners.\nBut many governments have ignored Mr. Waldheim's efforts. For example, Pakistan rejected his appeals - first made privately, then publicly, - to spare the life of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\nQuite often, Mr. Waldheim's quiet, nonjudgmental approach annoys Western countries. Two years ago, he called an international conference to help the Vietnamese boat people, those hundreds of thousands of refugees driven out of Vietnam by the Hanoi Government, who took to sea in small boats. The Western powers wanted to use the conference as a platform to publicize Vietnam's brutality, but Hanoi made it plain that if there were any political speeches, it would not participate. Mr. Waldheim therefore decided that the conference would be exclusively ''humanitarian,'' and he effectively barred anti-Hanoi speeches. Largely as a result, however, he was able to persuade Hanoi to stop the forced migrations.\nMr. Waldheim's stance on Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia has also disturbed the West. The General Assembly asked him to convene an international conference to achieve a political settlement in Cambodia, including withdrawal of Vietnamese troops. Mr. Waldheim delayed, telling associates he believed a public conference would only stiffen Vietnam's resistance. But the West, and some Asian countries, felt he was stalling so as not to antagonize Vietnam's patron, the Soviet Union. Reluctantly, Mr. Waldheim called the conference in July. It got no place; Hanoi is still refusing to budge.\n(3) The Secretary General can be a good connection. Early last May, Secretary of State Haig telephoned Mr. Waldheim and asked if he could get a message to Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. leader (the United States refuses to have direct contact with the Palestine Liberation Organization). Ambassador Philip C. Habib was in the Middle East, trying to effect an agreement between Syria and Israel over the Syrian missiles in Lebanon. Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. was afraid an outbreak of P.L.O. violence would bring Israeli retaliation and jeopardize the Habib mission. Therefore, could Mr. Waldheim persuade Mr. Arafat to exercise restraint?\nMr. Waldheim's assistant, Under Secretary General Urquhart, called in the P.L.O. representative at the United Nations, who telephoned Mr. Arafat in Beirut. Mr. Arafat said to tell the Secretary General he would agree for two reasons: because Mr. Waldheim had asked him to, and because he didn't want to give the Israelis any pretext to blame the P.L.O. if the Habib mission failed.\nSoon afterward, the Israelis attacked P.L.O. positions in south Lebanon and Mr. Arafat sent a message to Mr. Waldheim asking what the United Nations expected him to do. Mr. Waldheim called Mr. Haig; he learned that a message had been sent to Prime Minister Menachem Begin asking him to avoid any further escalation.\nAgain in July, after serious fighting had erupted in south Lebanon, Mr. Waldheim contacted the P.L.O., and Mr. Arafat said he would agree to a cease-fire, provided Israel would, too. Shortly afterward, Ambassador Habib negotiated the cease-fire agreement with Israel.\nAlthough the Secretary General often acts as an international middleman, he is rarely called on to risk his life, as Mr. Waldheim did during his efforts to free the American hostages in Iran. After Iran ignored several calls from the S ecurity Council, Mr. Waldheim went to Teheran. The Iranians asked him to visit a cemetery for the Shah's victims, and there he was gree ted by several hundred demonstrators who rushed his car, threatening to overturn it. Mr. Waldheim tried to get out to lay a wreath on the graves, but Iranian security guards pushed him back in and the ca r sped off. ''I was gladto get out of there alive,'' Mr. Waldheim say s now. ''But I wasn't somuch frightened as angry - that these people should be threatening officials of the United Nations. That brought home to me the emotionalism of that country - if I needed any reminders.'' Later that day, there was another demonstra tion against him. That evening, he was told that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini would not see him, and that he would not be allowed to visi t the hostages in the American Embassy. He left Iran the next day.\nSubsequently, with Washington's approval, Mr. Waldheim set up a commission of inquiry to go to Iran to investigate the Shah's misdeeds. In return, Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotzbadeh agreed the hostages would be released. ''I still have a letter Ghotzbadeh wrote me confirming the main aspects of the plan,'' Mr. Waldheim says. ''He and President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr wanted to solve the problem, but they couldn't deliver the hostages because the militants refused to give them up. ''\nAfter the hostages were finally released, Mr. Waldheim was accused by Pierre Salinger, the ABC correspondent and former White House press secretary, of behaving less than heroically and hampering American negotiations with Iran. For his part, Mr. Waldheim has letters from one of the French attorneys involved in the negotiations and from Hamilton Jordan, President Carter's aide, saying the Salinger charges were inaccurate. Former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance warmly praises Mr. Waldheim, saying: ''He went far out of his way to help us and I'll be everlastingly grateful to him for the efforts he put out.''\n(4) All United Nations members are equal, but some are less equal than others. On issues involving South Africa and Israel, the pariahs of the United Nations, Mr. Waldheim appears to have abandoned his nonpartisanship. He routinely denounces racism and repression in South Africa, but he is much more guarded in criticizing the humanrights violations of the United Nations' third-world and Communist majority.\nHe often singles out Israel for blame, failing to note that many of Israel's actions are retaliatory. When the Israeli commando unit staged its dramatic rescue of the Israeli hostages at Entebbe airport in Uganda in 1976, Mr. Waldheim called it ''a serious violation of the national sovereignty of a United Nations member state,'' only later adding that humanitarian and moral issues had also to be taken into account. At an Arab League dinner a year ago, he endorsed Palestinian statehood without mentioning Israel's right to exist. Israeli violence in southern Lebanon has consistently drawn his rebukes; P.L.O. violence is often played down or unidentified. He denounced Israel for attacking the Iraqi nuclear reactor but he did not criticize Iraq for attacking Iran.\nMost of Mr. Waldheim's official statements on the Middle East are drafted by Under Secretary General Urquhart, who is known to be sympathetic to the Palestinians. Although he stresses that neither he nor Mr. Waldheim is anti-Israel, they both obviously reflect the views of the United Nations majority, which is anti-Israel.\nMr. Waldheim supports Israel's right to exist within ''secure and recognized boundaries,'' as Security Council Resolution 242 puts it, but because 242 treats the Palestinians only as a refugee problem, he thinks that either it should be amended or else the Council should adopt a complementary resolution to take account of Palestinian rights.\nHe also believes Israel and the P.L.O. must recognize each other's right to exist: ''The problem is who does it first. I told Arafat I think it would be best if they did it simultaneously. Arafat replied that recognition was his last card and, once he plays it, he won't have it anymore. Then there's also the fact that the hard-liners in the P.L.O., just as in Israel, don't want recognition. So Arafat probably could not survive politically if he were to accept Israel without in turn getting Israel and the U.S. to accept the P.L.O. So I'm afraid recognition is a matter for the future. I'd be very happy if for now we could maintain the cease-fire in southern Lebanon and make some permanent arrangements to stablilize the situation there.''\n(5) The S.G. can move boldly - when nobody is opposed. One of Mr. Waldheim's proudest achievements was his swift dispatch of a peace-keeping force to the Middle East during the 1973 war. He enjoys describing it:\n''The day the fighting started, Henry Kissinger rang me up - Kissinger, who had never had any use for the United Nations before. He said, 'Kurt, what are we g oing to do? I hope you'll use your connections wit h the different parties in the area and I'll use mine.'\n''That was the beginning of my close relations with Kissinger, and also the beginning of his appreciation of the United Nations' value. After the initial success of the Egyptians, the Israelis counter-attacked, crossing the Suez Canal and encircling the Egyptian Third Army. Suddenly, there were reports that the Soviets were sending troops to Egypt to save the Egyptian Army. The Americans immediately put their forces on worldwide alert and people feared World War III might be at hand. The Security Council asked me to send a peace-keeping force to the area to head off the crisis. Normally, it would take weeks to organize such a force. But I decided on my own to take the United Nations peace-keeping force that was in Cyprus and fly it to Egypt immediately. Within 48 hours they took up their positions.... It sounds like a small thing now, but if we hadn't got there fast, who knows? Certainly, the Americ ans felt the Russians were ready to go in. But I was able to move swiftly and decisively only because the parties involved in the conflict wanted me to.''\nWhen Mr. Waldheim thinks the parties want his help, he can, indeed, move effectively. Repeatedly, he has brought the Greek and Turkish Cypriots together for peace talks; while he has not yet achieved a peace agreement, he has prevented renewed fighting. He helped repair a diplomatic break between France and Guinea. He helped India and Bangladesh resolve a dispute over the Ganges River, and he helped Bangladesh and Burma solve a crisis over refugees. He is working to help Malta and Libya solve their conflict over oil drilling in the Mediterranean. He orgjanized massive United Nations relief operations in Bangladesh and Cambodia, among other places, which saved millions of lives. Mr. Waldheim feels the United Nations, during his tenure, has made three major contributions: It has helped to avoid an armed conflict between the superpowers and to control local conflicts; it has served as a catalyst for decolonialization in southern Af-rica (''and we will continue that struggle until we have won it''); and it has begun to make the world aware of the need for a new economic relationship between rich and poor countries. He believes the United Nations must now become the principle instrument for global economic reform:\n''We have a moral obligation to end the appalling poverty in the developing world and to give people a fairer share of the world's resources. But besides that, there are the pragmatic aspects. The industrial countries are suffering from inflation, unemployment, underproduction, ills that can be solved only through global decisions. I speak to everyone I can about this, pressing for action - Helmut Schmidt, (Francois) Mitterrand, Mrs. (Margaret) Thatcher, President Reagan.''\nWhatever Mr. Waldheim does about any issue before the United Nations strikes some countries as too little, others as too much. The Secretary General is also a handy scapegoat for the many critics of the United Nations. ''You look around and you ask why the United Nations isn't functioning better,'' says Baron Rudiger von Wechmar, of West Germany, president of the last General Assembly, ''and then you answer that it's because of the Secretary General. But you're really venting your anger at the United Nations on this poor fellow from little Austria.''\nIn addition, however, many diplomats feel that Mr. Waldheim has not built up the stature of the United Nations, and that his leadership has not been bold or imaginative enough. The problem is that everybody has different ideas about what he should do. ''We'd like him to knock heads together,'' a Western delegate said, ''and insist that the majority stop passing the same resolutions year after year, stop spending United Nations money on partisan causes and controversial liberation movements.''\n''He defers too much to the West,'' an African said. ''He should find a way to force the U.S. to act against South Africa and Israel.''\n''It's not enough for the S.G. to go to Iran and Iraq and tell them to stop fighting.'' an Islamic delegate says. ''He should have creative ideas about how to make them stop fighting.''\nObviously, there is only a small margin of flexibility any Secretary General could use without violating the requirement of even-handedness. A bolder man who tried to move the organization along the lines of his own convictions would greatly aggravate the United Nations' problems. Neither of the superpowers could tolerate a referee who acted like a partisan or who refused to take its national interests into account.\nAlthough Mr. Waldheim insists that he doesn't mind the criticism, he often complains to associates that his efforts are not appreciated, misunderstood. Looking at a painting in his office of a fisherman on a riverbank, he will say, ''How I envy that man his peace, I really do.''\nHe really doesn't, of course. The United Nations is practically his whole life. He is devoted to his family - his wife, Elisabeth (called Cissy), and his three children - but he spend s almost all his time at the United Nations. Mrs. Waldheim is his ' 'safety valve,'' and he talks over many of his concerns with her. A t all, handsome woman, sheis trained in the law, highly intelligent, am bitious for her husband and fiercely protective of him.\nTheir social life revolves, naturally, around the United Nations, but their favorite evenings are those spent at home alone, listening to Mozart or Verdi. If the Secretary General's eyes aren't too tired, he'll read an Agatha Christie detective story.\nThe Waldheims have a home in Austria near Salzburg, but they seldom get there. They also have the use of a friend's house in Connecticut where they spend occasional weekends and where Mr. Waldheim rides horseback. Over the Christmas holidays, they usually take a house on Florida's west coast. Both the Waldheims are very much involved with the United Nations in human term s. When one of Mr. Waldheim's secretaries left to get married, they gave her a dinner party for 60 people at their home. When another staff member, an unmarried woman, got pregnant and decided to have the baby, the Waldheims invited her to stay with them during her pregnancy.\nConsidering that Mr. Waldheim advocates radical economic and social change, his attitude toward women is surprisingly old-fashioned. Once, when he was helping two countries to resolve a dispute, he said to one of the negotiators, a hard-headed young woman, ''Now, my dear, don't forget to use your feminine charm. ...''\nAt the United Nations, Mr. Waldheim's closest associates include a Briton, a Pakistani, a Somalian, an Ecuadorean, an American, a Yugoslav, a Frenchman and several Austrians - a mini-United Nations. Probably his most trusted advisor is Under Secretrary General Urquhart of Great Britain, knowledgeable, resourceful, articulate, more creative than Mr. Waldheim, less accommodating.\nMr. Urquhart, who has worked for the United Nations since it began, says of Mr. Waldheim, ''In terms of usefulness, not glamour, he's actually been the best Secretary General. He's done what none of the others did, kept on working terms with almost everyone, which is essential. He also manages to get people together in a reasonably constructive spirit and helps them find areas of agreement. People are always underrating him.''\nJust last June, Kurt Waldheim quietly, diplomatically, helped the United States and Iraq reach agreement on a resolution condemning Israel for its attack on Iraq's nuclear reactor. At that time, some of the so-called nonaligned delegates were pressing for Security Council sanctions against Israel, hoping to force an American veto and widen the split between the United States and the Islamic countries. Mr. Waldheim introduced the American delegate, Mrs. Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, to the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Saadun Hamadi; he sat with them for three days during intensive negotiations, making discreet suggestions, providing the right ambiance. When the resolution was finally drafted and approved by the Security Council, Mr. Hamadi and Mrs. Kirkpatrick were lavishly praised. Hardly anybody mentioned Mr. Waldheim's role.\nSalim Ahmed Salim, 39, Tanzania's Foreign Minister, former United Nations delegate, former General Assembly president. Able, articulate, Marxist-oriented, pro-Chinese (when the Assembly admitted Communist China to the United Nations in 1971 over American protests, Mr. Salim danced in the aisle). Washington and London are concerned about his militant support of third-world causes, but they have not yet decided whether to veto him. Carlos Ortiz de Rozas, 55, Argentine ambassador to Britain, former United Nations delegate. Competent, experienced - especially in disarmament negotiations. In the 1971 race for Secretary General, he received more votes than Mr. Waldheim but was vetoed by the Russians because they distrusted Argentina. With the recent American grain embargo, however, Argentina became Moscow's breadbasket and the Soviet Union might now look more favorably on him. Sir Shridath (Sonny) Ramphal, 53, of Guyana. Secretary General of the Commonwealth, former Guyanan Foreign Minister and United Nations delegate. Highly regarded by many Western countries, but the Russians and some Africans consider him too close to white Commonwealth nations. Tommy T.B. Koh, 44, Singapore's United Nations delegate and president of the Law of the Sea Conference. Articulate, nonpartisan, competent, strong personality. Moscow considers him anti-Soviet and would probably veto him. Jorge Castaneda, 59, Foreign Minister of Mexico. Competent but may not get his own country's support because President Jose Lopez Portillo might decide to run for Secretary General one day, and if a Mexican were elected now, it would spoil his chances. Alejandro Orfila, 56, Argentine Secretary General of the Organization of American States in Washington and former Ambassador to the United States. Has held many diplomatic posts, but never served at the United Nations Latin American colleagues are pressing his candidacy. - J.R."}, {"text": "FINDING THE PROPER PLACE, AND PRICE, FOR ARSENALS\n1981-11-15T05:00:00.000Z\nACKNOWLEDGING mounting concern about the East-West nuclear weapons buildup in Europe, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. last week reaffirmed that the Administration is ''serious'' about arms-control talks with the Soviet Union scheduled to start in Geneva on Nov. 30. The peace demonstrations do ''not mean that our European allies are going 'neutral,' '' he also told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ''The invasion of neutral Afghanistan and the violation of neutral Sweden's territory by a Soviet submarine should dispel the illusion that neutrality confers immunity.''\nThese and related concerns were discussed by a panel of specialists who met last month in the ornate Egmont Palace in Brussels under auspices of the Atlantic Institute, a 20-year-old private organization that promotes cooperation in the West.\nIn Paris meanwhile, another group of experts, including one from the Soviet Union who asked not to be identified, examined the economic consequences of weapons spending at a conference organized by the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues. The commission is headed by former Prime Minister Olof Palme of Sweden. Excerpts from their presentations follow. 'Artificial' Arguments BRUSSELS Any discussion of East-West relations in the contemporary setting must begin with the observation that policy toward the East is probably subject to greater diversity in the Western alliance than at any time in the 32 years since NATO was formed.\nSome of the debates, both within and among allied countries, seem somewhat artificial. For example, the Reagan Administration, despite some extreme statements about Soviet complicity in originating third world strife, is well aware of the indigenous and regional sources of instability, and American policies have sought to address these. By the same token, whatever the precise Soviet role in the origins of third world instabilities (and) conflicts, there is ample evidence that Moscow is prepared to exploit them for its own purposes. Consequently, Western policies must be prepared to cope with indigenous and regional sources of conflict as well as with Soviet endeavors to exacerbate and exploit them.\nEven so, one must enter the caution that policies exclusively designed to reduce or remove Soviet ''opportunities'' for expanding influence in the third world may well be insufficient: Many of the demands, grievances and needs voiced in the third world will not be met, or fully met, by even the most generous and sympathetic Western policies and there may thus still remain ample scope for Soviet involvement. The problem of how to deal with various forms of Soviet activism will not disappear.\nThere also seems little point in arguments about whether the problems of the third world are essentially more nonmilitary than military and in the frequently voiced criticism that American policy overemphasizes the military aspects. Experience has shown that whenever the U.S.S.R. does involve itself in third world problems its policy does have strong military components. Moreover, in recent years, such Soviet involvement has frequently been designed to serve purely Soviet military ends (although also catering to the needs and demands of the ''inviting'' authorities). Thus, in Angola, the Soviets use local facilities for their own navy and air force; the same has been the case in Somalia and, since the Soviet expulsion, in Ethiopia.\nIndeed, it is Soviet policy that seeks to draw third world problems into an East-West context and to exploit them for geopolitical gain. Time and again Soviet spokesmen at all levels insist that Soviet support for ''national liberation'' cannot be subsumed under notions of East-West detente. Helmut Sonnenfeldt Guest scholar, Brookings Institution Third World Costs PARIS Compared to their country's total population, very few Americans or Russians have been military casualties since 1945. By contrast, defense spending in many parts of the third world buys very little security at all. Even when only the wars that made the headlines in the Western press are considered, the list during the 1970's in the third world is long - countries in Indochina, the Indian subcontinent, the Fertile Crescent, the Horn of Africa, Southern Africa, West Africa, and Central America engaged in extensive internal and external hostilities.\nThe sequelae in many cases were disastrous. For example, famine is a process of cumulative social and economic disruption in a population at the subsistence margin that is set off by an external shock. Kampuchea (Cambodia), Bangladesh, Uganda, Nigeria and other countries suffered devastating famines - equivalent in economic terms to the loss of several years' growth in Gross National Product - that were the direct results of wars. If this trend of the last decade continues, the 1980's arms effort in parts of the third world may bring all economic progress to a devastating halt.\nWhen wars do not erupt, the decreasing returns case is still valid, but the argument is more complex. It is simplest to proceed step by step - first taking up the complications in a single country, and later bringing in capital flows and international trade.\nPeru is a sobering example, after its large arms imports and extensive commercial bank loans of the early 1970's. The succession of highly contractionary stabilization policies imposed upon that country since 1977 shows how costly in the long run a rapid increase in arms imports can be. In Africa, the share of arms in total imports rose from 1.3 percent to 9.3 percent between 1969 and 1978. Unless they somehow turn these foreign exchange outlays into an export push, some sub-Saharan nations may be forced along the path of Peru.\nThe moral from this discussion is that arms spending has strong effects on the evolution of the economy, mostly of an unfavorable sort. Lance J. Taylor Professor of nutritional economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Unpleasant Options PARIS The United States is, at the moment, alone among the Western allies in having a major military buildup. This creates a major economic problem in the U.S. Its technology industries will be facing problems not faced by their competitors.\nLogically there are only three options for the United States. 1) Simply accept the fact that civilian high technology industries will lose some of their world and American markets. 2) Force our military allies but economic competitors to engage in similar military buildup so that their firms face the same conditions as American firms. 3) Slow down the acceleration in military procurement. I would predict that, within a relatively short period of time, American public opinion will be demanding that the Reagan Administration accomplish the second option or accept the third option. This is particularly true since much of the buildup is targeted on areas (protecting Middle Eastern oil supplies) that are of more direct relevance to our allies than they are to us.\nEssentially the President is proposing to drive his economic car with one foot on the fiscal accelerator and the other on the monetary brake. The result is apt to be high interest rates with modest amounts of growth.\nThus the U.S. is apt to be suffering some supply-side inflation and high interest rates. And given the U.S. role in the world economy, we will be exporting both of these items to the rest of the world.\nThe case for and against more military spending must be based on foreign policy and military factors. Economics plays a very subsidiary role. The Reagan military policies lead to some very adverse economic consequences, but most of those are avoidable consequences if a different set of economic policies accompanied the military build-up. Personally, I oppose the Reagan policies because I do not agree with his interpretation of the threat or his military strategy for countering the threat, but I do not think you can base your opposition upon economic foundations. Lester C. Thurow Professor of management and economics, Sloan School of Management, M.I.T. Hindering Central Planning PARIS Evaluating negative effects of the arms race, we should also keep in mind the problem of the so-called ''lost opportunities,'' i.e. those economic benefits which would accrue from utilizing human, financial and material resources for productive purposes, if these resources had not been diverted to the military sphere. Naturally, this is not a simple question because it concerns the opportunities which failed to materialize, and because of this it is extremely difficult to quantify them.\nIt is quite clear though that the scale of the ''lost opportunities'' immeasurably increases as labor productivity grows, as resource utilization efficiency increases, as achievements of science and technology are implemented, etc.\nThus, the real economic expenses incurred by the arms race consist not only in that extremely valuable and very often nonrenewable resources are diverted; in addition, we have to take into account those potential economic benefits which could accrue from rational and productive utilization of these resources.\nIt is also important to note that negative economic effects of the arms race are not restricted by the frontiers of a few nations on the globe. They concern the entire international community.\nDiversion of resources for military preparations is an obstacle on the way to solving not only the most acute internal socioeconomic problems in many countries, but to solving global problems as well - backwardness, poverty, disease, illiteracy, food and nutrition for the growing population of the earth, discovery and practical use of new sources of energy, protection of the environment, etc.\nMilitary preparations damage considerably the economic interests of many countries also because they raise obstacles on the way to full utilization of advantages which may bring with it the international division of labor; military preparations disturb the normal course of state-to-state economic relations, create artificial barriers for development of trade and scientific and technical cooperation between countries.\nManaging a centrally planned economy means that certain proportions, which are the subject of advanced planning every five years, are kept between individual branches and factors of production. Crisis situations of all kinds occurring abroad, international conflicts whipping up the arms race require that preset priorities be changed, make it necessary to look for additional resources, hinder normal performance of a centrally planned economic mechanism. A Soviet expert Can the Climate Change? BRUSSELS There is a growing frustration and anger caused by the lack of progress in efforts to curb the accumulation of nuclear arms taking hold in West European society. Unless public confidence can be restored in the feasibility of arms control and the credibility of NATO's commitment to pursue it, there is a serious danger that social consensus behind prudent defense policies may disintegrate, leading to polarized social strife and a general crisis in the relationship between state and society in Europe. It seems doubtful whether international stability is attainable in a climate of instability at the national level about the proper approach to security. In such times, temptations may arise, and they should be resisted, to reconstitute the Atlantic Alliance on conservative grounds. Such attempts could make the alliance, as such, a matter of rather intense domestic controversy in West European society. Political forces of the center and left-of-center could be removed from the resulting narrowed consensus.\nArms control has played the important role of integrating such vital forces into a broad consensus behind the Western Alliance. Here it is not a question of making defense policy a hostage to arms control, but rather of creating the requisite conditions for a stable defense policy. The public is right in the perception that the present trends are dangerous and that they should be broken. It is the role of statecraft to break the trends in a manner which will enhance security and political order and not make security the hostage of rampant unilateralism. The pursuit of arms control must not be a blind pursuit of elusive goals, but rather an attempt to make that possible which is necessary. That, in the final analysis, is the essence of political leadership.\nIn addition to formal negotiations with a view to concluding formal agreements on limitations on hardware and deployments, it may prove useful to conduct a dialogue on nuclear doctrine between the two superpowers. The aim of such a dialogue would not be doctrinal convergence as much as clarification and explication. Management of nuclear deterrence involves a series of dilemmas. Their resolution may breed uncertainty and fear.\nNo system of deterrence can be made foolproof in the sense of containing absolute assurance against failure. Hence, the nuclear powers take out some insurance against the event that deterrence were somehow to fail. Such insurance could involve capabilities and procedures for limiting action and war termination. However, insurance of this kind could generate fears of a war-fighting strategy for war-winning objectives. The scope and modulation of the measures involved would be important for the assessment and perceptions of their implications. A Soviet-American dialogue could provide a forum for discussing alternative approaches to the management of nuclear deterrence with a view to minimizing tension, competition and misconception. Johan J. Holst State Secretary, Norwegian Foreign Ministry Consider Moscow's Problems BRUSSELS We face a variety of developments - military, political, economic - in the West, in the Soviet bloc, and in the third world, that pose grave dilemmas to the industrialized democracies. We are in disarray. That we are perhaps less so than others - specifically than our adversaries - needs to be remembered.\nThe Soviets, both as I see it and as some (though not all) of their own analysis and behavior suggest, are thus left with a real question as to whether they could overrun Western Europe quickly by conventional means, and with grave doubts as to the prudence of such a gamble, given the substantial chance of escalation to nuclear war and the defects in the staying power of the Warsaw Pact forces.\nIn the Far East, major Soviet ground and air force buildups, along with an expansion of the Soviet Pacific fleet, have probably substantially outweighed U.S and Japanese additions to military power. At the same time, similar uncertainties must exist in Soviet planning about the consequences of a Soviet attack in the Far East.\nMoreover, both in Europe and in Asia, the trends in the military balance favorable to the Soviet Union must be considered in the context of Soviet (and sadly, of allied) political difficulties. In the West, the reliability of all the Warsaw Pact forces is brought into relief by the Soviet political difficulties in Poland. But these Soviet problems of a loosening of Warsaw Pact ties must also be examined in the light of a degree of loosening of resolve, will and cohesion of which there is some evidence in NATO as well.\nIn the Far East, the Soviet gains in relative military power have been more than offset by the deterioration in the Soviet political position. This includes the development of an implacable (and, by Peoples Republic of China declaration, eternal) Chinese hostility toward the Soviet Union; much closer relations between the U.S. and China; and the major deterioration in relations between Japan and the Soviet Union deriving in large measure from the Soviet occupation of the northern territories. What undoubtedly seems to the Soviets to be at least an incipient alliance among the U.S., China and Japan must rank as a major disaster in Soviet security policy. This highlights Soviet effectiveness in creating, by their actions, but not by their design, coalitions unfriendly to the U.S.S.R.\nNeither strategic war nor conventional war between the Soviet Union and the industrialized democracies ranks as one of the more probable threats to security. However, the military balance and perceptions of it are a major factor in political behavior and, in periods of crisis, may well do so decisively. It is for that reason that the industrialized democracies must pay major attention to the military balance, and act to reverse the adverse trends of much of the past 15 years. The U.S. began to do so five years ago and, even in the face of difficult economic circumstances, the new Administration plans to speed up those actions in accordance with what is generally perceived as a popular mandate to do so.\nThe fact that the base from which we start is so prosperous by any previous historical standards should give the political leadership of our countries a chance to sustain cohesion and morale. The leadership elites can do so, in my judgment, only if they recognize that social and economic justice is not incompatible with national security and with continued economic growth. They also need to recognize...that it is foolish to think of arms control negotiations and agreements as a trap. Our overall security position can be improved by them, and war made less likely. The ABM and SALT II treaties have, in my judgment, had this effect. Harold Brown Secretary of Defense in Carter Administration Examining Anti-Americanism BRUSSELS We are not even living in a world governed by reason. Anybody who calls upon ''reasonable men'' to disarm is establishing the rule of the unreasonable. That is not politics; that is suicide from the fear of death. And so until ''peace can be a child of reason, it must remain the daughter of terror,'' as Churchill said.\nAnti-Americanism in Europe is bound to pave the way in the United States for anti-Europeanism and can lead to American isolationism - this time not of America's own choice, but forced upon her by the Europeans. And without the United States, a policy of preventing war by deterrence based upon the balance of forces is impossible either in or for Europe, so that security cannot be guaranteed.\nBut anti-Americanism does not begin only when national or social personalities pronounce derogatory judgment upon the New World, (on) the present American Administration, or individual representatives belonging to it, or use sheer unbelievable epithets to describe the treatment of the European allies by the leading power in the alliance, such as ''helots,'' ''askaris,'' or ''slaves.'' Anti-Americanism is expressed even - and this is the nucleus of the problem in the present debate - by placing America and the Soviet Union at a single level.\n''Rather red than dead'' is a pseudo-alternative. A war prevention policy which is effective by reason of its credibility offers the assurance that there is no necessity to be either red or dead. Thirty years of practicing a policy of military balance are perhaps no proof that that concept has always been and still is the right one, but they are pretty good circumstancial evidence.\nSecurity policy must be restored to natural priority in the national catalogues of tasks to be accomplished. True, security isn't everything. But without security nothing is anything. The greatest social achievement of a government is still to keep its citizens alive and free. We cannot therefore address our efforts at short notice to this clamoring minority; they must reach the silent majority. Theirs is the support we need if we are to solve the great and inevitable problems of Western security in the 1980's. Manfred Worner Chairman, Defense Committee, West German Bundestag"}]
