[{"text": "The Everyday Disaster of Life in Bangladesh\n1991-05-19T05:00:00.000Z\nA CYCLONE in the south, flooding in the north, and tornadoes in the center. Those are the latest natural disasters in a country that is often regarded, by Bangladeshis and foreign aid workers alike, as bountiful primarily in misfortune.\n\"No country has got a worse natural and environmental deal than Bangladesh,\" The Dhaka Courier said in an editorial this month. \"One must seriously consider whether there is a curse on this land or not.\"\nTo be sure, even for the poorest Bangladeshis, lives are less miserable than they used to be. The economy is growing, and there is generally more ethnic, religious and linguistic harmony than in India and other countries in the region. Even the terrible floods are a blessing of sorts, for they irrigate and fertilize the land.\nBut the 8,000 American troops who arrived a few days ago to help with cyclone relief efforts seem struck mostly by the scenes of wretchedness: babies dying of diarrhea, ragged children begging in the streets, destitute families huddled in shanties and forced to use any bit of open ground as their toilet. They are found not only among the cyclone victims but routinely throughout the country. The cyclone was merely a spectacular addition to a misery that is endemic.\nWhen the American military assistance for Kurds is completed, many of the Kurds may be able to return to their homes and resume normal lives. But when American troops leave Bangladesh, the people will continue to die in appalling numbers.\nThe cyclone captured international attention by killing some 139,000 people, an official count that could be way off in either direction. But each year, even without a cyclone, more than 260,000 children under the age of 5 die of nothing more than diarrhea. Respiratory infections kill another 157,000 each year, and even measles takes the lives of more than 60,000 children.\nInevitably, death by natural disaster catches the eye more than death by diarrhea, and Bangladesh's geographical location insures plenty of catastrophes.\n\"It's very unlucky,\" says Charles H. Larsimont, the resident representative of the United Nations Development Program. \"When you're in a configuration like this, where big rivers lead to a flood plain, then that causes a big mess every once in a while.\"\nIn addition to the flooding from the north and west, Bangladesh faces cyclones from the south and east. Poor communications and government mismanagement sometimes compound the disasters in Bangladesh by slowing the relief efforts and allowing people to die afterward of hunger or illness.\nWith the floods and cyclones, Bangladesh has faced a series of calamities: the 1970 cyclone killed some 300,000 to 500,000 people, the war for independence in 1971 claimed an immense number of lives variously estimated from several hundred thousand to several million, and then there was a famine in 1974, and periodic floods and cyclones ever since.\nIn a richer country, the weather would not be so lethal, but population pressures have obliged people to live in thatched huts on any clump of land that rises above the sea, accepting the risk of drowning as preferable to the risk of starvation.\nThese population pressures will get far worse. The population, now 118 million, is growing by about 2.5 percent a year and by some forecasts will reach 219 million by the year 2025 -- in a country that is the size of Wisconsin.\nThe Government encourages family planning, and the birth control pill and injectable contraceptives are free, while condoms are available at a subsidized price equivalent to one-eighth of a penny each. One-third of Bangladeshi couples now use contraceptives, and population experts see some hope that the population growth will eventually be controlled.\nBut in other important areas, the situation may be deteriorating. Most important, the literacy rate is only 24 percent and has been dropping in recent years. The education system is in disarray, and one-third of children of elementary school age are not enrolled.\nIn some respects, Bangladesh resembles countries like China before their Communist revolutions. Not only is it poor -- per capita income is $170 a year -- but social inequities are overwhelming, with homeless beggars sharing streets with tycoons riding in imported cars. There is a substantial class of peasants without property, who must till the soil of others.\nYet while socialist rhetoric has had some resonance here, Communists have never made many inroads in Bangladesh. A prime reason may be that 84 percent of the people are Muslims and disapprove of Communist assertions of athiesm. In any case, Bangladesh now has a democratic government and a tolerance for free expression that may allow steam to be released without challenging the system directly.\nThere is also a measure of hope that life will improve. Real economic growth has averaged between 3 percent and 4 percent in recent years -- a modest increment above the population growth rate -- and Bangladesh has improved its infrastructure and built up an impressive garment export industry.\nSome foreign development experts and diplomats, and more Bangladeshis, cite these achievements to voice a cautious optimism for the country. They note that headlines about disasters tend to obscure the country's progress. This year, for example, there may well be a record rice harvest, despite the cyclone, and Bangladesh will be nearly self-sufficient in food.\nA Western diplomat cited several strengths of the country: a resilient people, absence of major communal violence or secessionist warfare, the presence of an educated group of technocrats, a brand of Islam that is relatively pragmatic and is not anti-Western, and a widespread desire for stability and political dialogue.\n\"There is a lot more going on here than just disasters,\" he said."}, {"text": "U.S. SENDS TROOPS TO AID BANGLADESH IN CYCLONE RELIEF\n1991-05-12T05:00:00.000Z\nIn a major military response to the devastation in Bangladesh from last week's cyclone, the United States has dispatched thousands of marines and dozens of helicopters as part of an amphibious task force to bolster relief operations there, White House and Pentagon officials said today.\nThe officials said the effort was in response to an appeal from Bangladesh that foreign countries play a bigger role in getting food, medicine and clothing to survivors of the cyclone. The storm killed more than 138,000 people, according to the latest official count.\nThe first American teams were scheduled to arrive tonight in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital. On Sunday, C-5 cargo aircraft carrying five Blackhawk helicopters with crews and air-traffic-control teams are to follow. Marines and Sailors\nThe full task force will be made up of 4,600 marines and about 3,000 sailors who are to arrive in Bangladesh by Wednesday, said Lieut. Col. Thomas Boyd, a spokesman for the United States Pacific Command in Honolulu.\nHundreds of other personnel will travel to Bangladesh in smaller units, he said. The team that is heading to the country tonight has fewer than 100 members.\nThe amphibious assault ship Tarawa, which had been sailing toward the Philippines after leaving the Persian Gulf, was diverted and is scheduled to arrive in Bangladesh early Wednesday. It will carry additional marines and helicopters. Medical and Construction Teams\nThe task force includes preventive-medicine teams that will try to curb the rampant spread of disease in Bangladesh as well as Navy construction teams, known as Seabees, which will help with water purification and the rebuilding of homes and bridges devastated by the cyclone or the series of floods and tornadoes that followed.\nWhile the marines were known to make up the greatest number of the troops being sent, Administration officials had not released a breakdown of how many people were dispatched and from what services.\n\"It's quite a significant contribution -- in people and cost involved,\" said Bill Harlow, a White House spokesman. \"But it is not unprecedented. We have a long history of coming to the aid of people who need it.\"\nMr. Harlow said the order from President Bush to dispatch the task force was issued today.\nMilitary personnel have been used for a range of humanitarian relief projects, from aiding the Kurdish refugees in the last few weeks to disaster relief after the San Francisco area earthquake of 1989.\nA recent example of American relief efforts in natural disasters was the Armenian earthquake of 1988, when Air Force jets with rescue workers and medicine were dispatched to aid the victims. In 1985, the United States responded swiftly to earthquakes in Mexico.\nAdministration officials said they could not immediately calculate the cost of their effort in Bangladesh. Before today, the Administration had already donated more than $7.2 million in cash, food and medicine and sent 15 Army engineers to repair damaged ports.\nBut earlier this week, the United Nations and private aid agencies declared after a meeting in Dhaka that foreign nations had failed to mount an effort sufficient to help survivors of the cyclone. They concluded that Bangladesh urgently needed helicopters, water-purification tablets, tents, medical kits, plastic sheets, powdered milk and drugs, particularly anti-diarrhea medicine. The means of transporting other essentials were also requested. The Bangladesh Government appealed for $1.4 billion for relief and reconstruction.\nOfficials of the Asian nation made another plea on Wednesday for helicopters to help as many as 10 million people who live in the area affected by the cyclone. Reaching victims and assessing the degree of devastation has been especially difficult in Bangladesh because it is one of the world's poorest countries and communication is often a problem in normal times.\nBangladesh's Information Secretary, Manzoor Mowla, was quoted by The Associated Press in Dhaka today as saying that his Government had received only $217 million so far.\nSaudi Arabia, the leading governmental donor in terms of money, has given $100 million for the relief effort. Other aid donors include the European Community, which has donated $12 million; Britain, $7 million; India, $5 million; Pakistan, $4.3 million; Japan, $2.5 million, and Canada, $1.5 million. -------------------- Floods and an Earthquake\nDHAKA, Bangladesh, May 11 (AP) -- Surging rivers drowned eight people, swept away thousands of dwellings and marooned at least 150,000 villagers today, while a moderate earthquake shook the hills of eastern Bangladesh, newspapers here reported.\nThere were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the quake, which measured 4.9 on the Richter scale.\nThe Information Ministry said today that the death toll from the cyclone stood at 138,868, an increase of more than 13,000 from the Government's last official figure of 125,000 issued six days ago. It said the toll could rise again, depending on new information.\nAt least 118 people have died in tornadoes and floods since the cyclone and accompanying high waves came ashore from the Bay of Bengal on April 30. To some degree, the foul weather has affected virtually every part of the country.\nThe latest floods were in the area around Sylhet, 120 miles northeast of Dhaka. The region is one of the few hilly parts of Bangladesh and becomes a funnel for rain-swollen rivers that cascade down the Himalaya Mountains in neighboring India. Assessing the Catastrophe\nThe earthquake's epicenter was just across the border in India, 55 miles southeast of Sylhet, said S. N. Chatterjee, a seismologist with the Indian Meteorology Department in New Delhi.\nMr. Chatterjee said that a quake of that magnitude could cause some buildings to crack, and that it was probably felt over a wide area.\nThe New Nation, a Dhaka daily newspaper, said six people, mostly children and teen-agers, had drowned in the Sylhet region. Another paper, The Bangladesh Observer, said two more people died when their houses collapsed in the swirling flood waters.\nThe newspapers, along with other Dhaka dailies, said 150,000 people had been marooned by rivers that burst their embankments in dozens of places. Thousands of mud-and-thatch huts were destroyed. At least two rivers surged over their levees, and others were close to overflowing, the reports said.\nReuters quoted the weather office in Dhaka as saying that a new cyclone was forming in the Andaman Sea, 800 miles south of Chittagong, and that it \"may or may not\" hit Bangladesh."}, {"text": "AID TO BANGLADESH IS STILL HAMPERED\n1991-05-07T05:00:00.000Z\nSurvivors of last week's cyclone in Bangladesh are suffering from a lack of food and clean water, and many could die of disease, the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said today.\nThe official Cyclone Preparedness Center said the death toll as of this evening was 125,672, up only slightly from the previous day.\n\"An estimated four million people are now at serious risk from lack of fresh drinking water and food,\" a statement issued by the league said. \"Many more deaths could follow from lack of water, food and disease.\"\nRed Crescent officials said the toll could climb to 200,000 when rescue and relief teams reached isolated areas. But Bernard Kouchner, French Minister of State for Humanitarian Action, said the toll might go down as more accurate casualty reports are tallied.\n\"It has been my experience, weeks and months later, the number of deaths decrease,\" he said. \"But I could be wrong.\"\nMr. Kouchner toured the disaster area by helicopter on Sunday with Prime Minister Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Mother Teresa.\nHe said the devastation was colossal and the United Nations should convene a meeting to raise money for reconstruction.\nUp to 10 million people living along the low-lying coast and offshore islands were affected by the storm, and damages so far exceed $1.42 billion, officials said.\nThe cyclone flooded farmland just before harvest time, when reserves of food were already low.\nThe Red Cross and Red Crescent societies noted that the cyclone had struck during a full moon and high tide, which \"combined to maximize its destructive onslaught.\"\nPilots braved squalls over the ravaged areas today to drop desperately needed supplies to marooned islanders.\nJournalists aboard one flight said riding the small plane buffeted by the wind was \"like being on a yo-yo.\"\nBangladeshi airmen pushed food and medicine from the twin-engine propeller plane over Kutubdia, one of the dozens of islands swamped by a 20-foot tidal wave that was whipped up by 145 mile-per-hour winds a week ago. Offer From Mother Teresa\nMother Teresa, whose order of nuns operates homes for the destitute and dying in several third world countries, offered to provide temporary shelter for children and old people made homeless by the storm, the state-run television said. She said she was shocked by the scale of the destruction.\nMore than 2,000 trawlers and thousands of fishermen have been missing in the Bay of Bengal since the cyclone pounded the coast for nine hours on the night of April 29, the Deep Sea Fishing Boat Owners' Association said today.\nJournalists aboard the relief plane saw trawlers tossed far inland by the tidal surge and perched incongruously in rice paddies on Kutubdia. Officials said today that the death toll in Kutubdia, which had a population of 90,000, was over 15,000 and rising.\nThe relief plane with journalists aboard was unable to land, so the crew dropped supplies without parachutes 150 feet to waiting crowds.\nSometimes the boxes disappeared under water in flooded fields. Others shattered on impact.\nNizam Ahmed, a local journalist who visited Kutubdia by boat, said hundreds of human and animal corpses still littered inundated fields and \"ghost villages.\"\n\"It looked like the area had been carpet-bombed,\" Mr. Ahmed said, \"with damaged houses and craters created by the tidal surge. People were either half-naked or wearing torn and dirty clothes and appeared to be in shock.\"\nBad weather, communications disruptions and a shortage of boats and aircraft are slowing relief efforts."}, {"text": "Bangladesh's Lack of Oil Is Felt in the Fields\n1991-03-03T05:00:00.000Z\nThe old man with the flowing white beard sat on the veranda of his thatched home and looked across scores of acres of parched, cracked earth. In normal times, he said, the fields would be filled with wheat and the air would be filled with the hum of irrigation pumps drawing water and flushing it across the land.\nThis year, because of an oil shortage that was heightened by the Persian Gulf war, diesel has been difficult to get and many diesel-fed irrigation pumps in this and neighboring villages, about 90 miles north of the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, are silent. At Dhaka, there are long lines of vehicles at gasoline stations.\n\"We have lost the winter crop, a lot of money and we have no idea whether things are going to improve,\" said Mugha Ali Khand, as his 4 sons and several of his 17 grandchildren listened.\nA top economist at Dhaka, Mahboob Hussain, said the country would lose at least 500,000 tons of food grains because of the diesel shortage that was hurting farmers nationwide. Bangladesh produces about 19 million tons of food grains annually and imports about 1.5 million tons to make up a deficit. This year, economists said the country, which is dependent on foreign aid to finance nearly 90 percent of its national economic plans, must import more food.\n\"If we do not get a good crop even in the summer, with the rains, then we may have to think of selling some of our land,\" Mr. Khand said. During the year, he said, his family, which has eight acres of land divided among his four sons, grows two kinds of rice, including one that is sown during the full flush of the monsoon rains.\n\"We also can produce jute if there is rain during this season,\" he said. Bangladesh's farmers are tough, wiry and hard working. The average land holding among landed farmers is about half an acre. But those farmers are outnumbered by the number of rural landless laborers. They subsist on simple meals of rice, salt, oil and occasional lentil curry. For variety in their diet, those who can afford it eat vegetables and fish.\nThe fuel shortage is adding to the immense economic, social and political problems that are swamping this nation, one of the poorest in the world, with a per capita income of less than $170 per year and a rapidly growing population that has doubled in 30 years, to about 115 million. Distress sale of farms by subsistence farmers unable to support their growing families on shrinking holdings, fragmented by divisions among sons, is increasing.\"The land has lost its bearing capacity, yet it is producing more because of the annual silt deposits,\" said Kazi Badruddoza, one of the country's top agricultural scientists. Bangladesh, much of which is a few feet above sea level, is flooded annually during the monsoon rains as rivers overflow, change course and sweep through villages and towns, taking a heavy toll of people and livestock. Those floods leave behind a rich, alluvial soil deposit that enables the highly intensive farming by millions of small and marginal farmers to continue.\nOne result of the pressure of people on land is that there is growing migration to the country's cities. Jalaluddin, one of Mr. Khand's sons, told visitors that many widows and young women were leaving the villages for the towns.\n\"About 90 have left from here to go to Dhaka and work as maids,\" he said.\nIndian diplomats say that landless peasants and their families cross illegally into India, where the pressure of population on holdings is less.\nMr. Khand spoke of his own difficulties with land. He inherited 12 acres from his father, who had divided 24 acres equally among his two sons. He sold four acres to support the family during bad harvests and gave two acres to each of his sons.\nOne son, Ghafoor, who completed high school but failed to get into college, said his share was now only one acre because he had sold the other acre.\n\"I do not think about the future at all,\" he said. \"Very few of us in Bangladesh do. We do not hope, we think about the next day, the next crop and how to survive.\""}, {"text": "Relief Officials Say Bad Planning Proves Calamitous in Bangladesh\n1991-05-05T05:00:00.000Z\nBangladeshis and international disaster experts are criticizing the Government's slow response in assessing needs and moving supplies to survivors of the cyclone that struck this country with devastating force on Monday.\nFive days after the storm ravaged a long stretch of the southeastern coast, the national news agency's estimate of the death toll stood at 125,200 today. Earlier speculation that 200,000 people may have drowned was not repeated today, although one newspaper spoke of 150,000 deaths.\nBut the greatest concern now is that those who survived the storm's huge waves and floodwaters would succumb in vast numbers to disease and exposure. Two Million at Risk\n\"Two million people are at severe risk,\" said Cole P. Dodge, representative in Bangladesh for the United Nations Children's Fund.\nBut no Bangladesh official has been given authority to coordinate and command relief efforts. No substantive assessment of damages has been made. No evacuations of stranded people have been attempted. Until today, no comprehensive list of needs and priorities has been distributed to embassies and international organizations.\nInternational and private relief agencies have thrown themselves into the task of assisting the cyclone's survivors, most of whom are on a long stretch of coast between the port of Chittagong and the resort city of Cox's Bazar, or stranded on islands just off shore.\nThe plight of the survivors turned all the more grave today as foul weather slowed the few relief missions under way and helpless refugees competed with poisonous snakes for whatever high ground they could find.\nUnicef is trying to distribute plastic sheeting for shelters, along with oral-rehydration mixes, water-purification and basic-medicine kits, and intravenous drip for cases of severe dehydration caused by diarrhea. Mr. Dodge said a priority would be given to a vaccination campaign against measles, a life-threatening disease for weakened children.\nCARE, Oxfam and other private relief organizations are undertaking projects, but bad weather in the Bay of Bengal is hampering work and endangering relief workers. Today, a fishing trawler rented by CARE capsized on its way to Hatiya Island, and a CARE representative was reported missing.\nThe Government is having difficulty marshaling its energies for the relief effort. Tonight at a news conference, Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary, Abul Ahsan, said the Government was \"still in the process of receiving information on the nature and expense of damage,\" adding that serious relief work required more helicopters and shallow-draft boats, which Dhaka was asking foreign governments to provide.\nRelief oficials say they still have no clear idea about the extent of death and damage on dozens of offshore islands that took the brunt of the cyclone. Helicopters, unable to land, were dropping relief supplies to the islands and rough seas were preventing boats from ferrying supplies, they said.\nThe relief officials said tens of thousands of livestock carcasses were rotting in the tropical heat, adding to the threat of epidemic disease. Vast areas of rice paddies ready for harvesting had been flooded by sea water, and people's reserves of grains were swept away in the tidal surge.\nBecause farmers were counting on their crops coming in within two to three weeks, their reserves were low.\nOn Sunday, Mohammed Essaafi, United Nations Under Secretary General and the organization's disaster relief coordinator, will arrive with two consultants. But Mr. Ahsan said that although Prime Minister Khaleda Zia was nominally in charge of a committee coordinating the relief effort, it had not been decided who in the Government would meet Mr. Essaafi.\n\"I keep insisting on a common list of needs,\" said Charles H. Larsimont, head of the United Nations Development Program in Bangladesh, in an interview today. \"Let us have one common master. One list of needs. One list of donors. One point of entry. Otherwise we are not going to be able to do much.\"\nSome people who were celebrating the return of democracy to Bangladesh early this year are now remembering how efficient the military Government of Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad was in coping with a disastrous flood in 1988, when nearly two-thirds of the country was under water.\nThe Ershad Government turned over the logistics of relief to the army. Although the two calamaties were different in many ways -- floodwaters rose more slowly in 1988 than the tidal waves that swept the coast on Monday -- aid experts here say the efficiency of the 1988 relief effort kept deaths down to 1,500, far below expectations. Rice Prices Are Rising\nPrices were also under firm control, so that poor people who had lost everything were able to buy basic food when the water receded. Rice was imported to bolster buffer stocks. In Dhaka this week, prices have risen as much as 30 percent or more as opportunists cash in on relief agency buying. People shrug and say, \"This is the way of democracy.\"\nBangladeshis outside the Government are distressed by this sentiment, saying the issue is not democratic government but what kind of democratic government.\n\"In a disaster country like this, disaster preparedness should be a 365-day job,\" said Mohammad Yunus, who has won worldwide acclaim for the success of his village-based Grameen Banks for pittance capitalists.\n\"It's not a question of waking up one morning and hearing that people are killed; this is crazy,\" said Mr. Yunus, who was chairman of a committee that met after the 1988 flood to recommend how Bangladesh could prepare itself better for inevitable future disasters. The report has been sitting around Government offices ever since. Criticism of the Government\n\"I was listening to the radio this morning to find out if there was any fresh news coming out,\" he said in an interview in his office today. \"There was an appeal. Whoever wants to contribute to this relief effort should bring materials, money or even food to a point from which it will all go. Only Government machinery can carry this.\n\"That bread,\" he said, \"will be eaten by cockroaches probably.\"\nThe solution to failed relief efforts, said Mr. Yunus, is not giving more power to outside organizations but putting popular pressure on government to take control.\n\"To those who say N.G.O.'s are the only way out, I say this is opting out,\" he said, referring to nongovernment organizations. \"Government is supposed to do all these things. If the Government cannot serve the people -- if we say let's forget about the government and call the N.G.O.'s and let them do this -- then why do we have to have a government?\""}, {"text": "India Admits Failure to Cut Bangladesh Influx\n1991-12-16T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Indian Government has acknowledged that its failure to deport illegal settlers from Bangladesh has created problems described as serious and complex.\nSeeking better lives, several million Bangladeshis have fled to India to escape poverty, overpopulation and flooding.\n\"We came here in 1971 and we have stayed since,\" said Sheik Barah, a tailor from Dhaka who lives in a crowded slum in New Delhi, where at least 100,000 have illegally settled. He said that his children attended local schools and that they lived more comfortably in India than in Bangladesh.\nOther Bangladeshis find such work as rickshaw drivers, construction workers and laborers or collect and sell things that can be recycled from trash, like wood, cardboard, newspapers and plastics. Others are engaged in smuggling and trading.\nTheir presence here has been both resented and exploited. Because the Bangladeshis, predominantly Muslim, are viewed as an economic and cultural threat, they are often victims of physical attacks.\nUnder the Indian Constitution, state administrations have powers to deport illegal immigrants. But local some politicians, encouraging the migration, have helped settle the Bangladeshis, arranged for them to receive ration cards and illegally enrolled thousands of the immigrants on voting lists. In return, they demand their loyalty and their vote. The number of Bangladeshis on voting lists in the districts neighboring Bangladesh in eastern India are said to often influence the outcome of elections.\nThe exodus is most apparent in the states of Assam, Tripura and West Bengal, where an opposition lawmaker said illegal migrants had recently demonstrated in Calcutta, capital of West Bengal, to demand citizenship rights.\nThe Minister of State for Home Affairs, M. M. Jacob, said in remarks televised nationwide this month that the Government's \"liberal policies\" had led to a \"very large\" number of Bangladeshis settling in this country. Mr. Jacob told Parliament that there were about 587,000 Bangladeshis in West Bengal alone. The authorities estimate that about 200,000 Bangladeshis cross into West Bengal every year.\nMr. Jacob said the Government did not have an overall figure for the number of all illegal migrants, nor did he indicate any steps that the Government planned to take to curb the influx or evict those living here illegally.\nCritics have accused New Delhi of lacking policies to deal with influxes that led to anti-immigrant violence in the northeastern state of Assam between 1979 and 1985. Several thousand people died in ethnic, religious and linguistic clashes among communities in the fertile valley of the Brahmaputra River. The army is now cracking down on Assamese insurgents who are fighting for an independent state.\nLal Kishen Advani, leader of the rightist Bharatiya Janata Party, described the Government's attitude to migrations as \"casual\" and warned that India was \"becoming a dharamsala,\" or cheap boarding-house.\nAn insurgency, ignited by resentment against the presence of aliens, has troubled the neighboring state of Tripura for several years. Indigenous tribespeople in Tripura have been reduced to a minority in recent decades, swamped by the overwhemling migration of Bengali-speaking settlers from Bangladesh."}, {"text": "Time Is Running Out for Survivors As Bangladesh Airdrops Go Awry\n1991-05-06T05:00:00.000Z\nSteady rain and inadequate transportation upset distribution of relief supplies today to an estimated 10 million people displaced by the cyclone that devastated the coast of Bangladesh. Relief officials and doctors warned that many could die soon on remote islands awaiting aid.\nThe Red Crescent, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, said the death toll in the cyclone, which struck on Tuesday, was likely to reach 200,000. The official count so far is 125,720. Newspapers predicted that the toll would reach 500,000.\nA helicopter carrying Prime Minister Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, and Mother Teresa over the disaster area made an emergency landing today but returned safely to Dhaka hours later. The Government television did not report any injuries. Rations Fall Into the Sea\nAlong the stricken southeastern coast, some packages of food were airdropped into the sea atop piles of bodies, newspapers said. Some plastic containers of drinking water were dropped from a level of 500 feet, bursting upon impact, a foreign photographer on one relief flight said.\nGusty winds and rain continued to handicap Bangladesh's fleet of 17 helicopters and a few fixed-wing airplanes.\nAs time began to run out for refugees without shelter or food, relief officials criticized the Government for failing to come up with a specific relief plan. Reflecting the lack of coordination, Bangladesh's political parties are conducting relief efforts apart from the Government operation.\n\"The critical period has started,\" said Dr. Mohammad Musa of CARE International, a relief organization. \"Famished men, injured men can only survive for four to five days under the circumstances.\"\nThe Weather Bureau predicted that winds of 60 to 70 miles an hour would hit nine northern districts as well as eastern parts of the Noakhali region, which caught the lashing edge of the storm last Tuesday.\nFishing boats and other small craft along the eastern coast, including the country's main port, Chittagong, were warned to keep away from the sea. Few trucks could travel southward because the roads were flooded.\nThe independent Bengali-language newspaper Sangbad said that groups of hungry men looted at least three trucks carrying rice in Faujdarhat, 135 miles southeast of Dhaka, on Saturday.\nThe paper, quoting an official, reported that the men left a note on one of the trucks saying: \"People are dying of hunger. So we need the food. Until now no relief has reached us. The food will be distributed among us.\"\nThe misery has been compounded by the disorganized way in which relief distribution is being handled, other news reports and officials said. Leaders Fail to List Needs\nRelief officials said the Government had not given foreign relief organizations a list of specific needs, issuing only a general appeal for help.\n\"If you ask me about the relief efforts so far, I can simply tell you that we are not satisfied,\" said an army commander involved in the relief operation, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\nPrime Minister Zia's six-week-old Government has rejected charges of ineptitude, saying that the job at hand is enormous."}, {"text": "New Storms Add to Misery in Bangladesh; Disease Threatens Many\n1991-05-08T05:00:00.000Z\nA tornado and thunderstorms today brought new misery and death to Bangladesh.\nThe new storms occurred as Bangladeshi officials renewed their appeals for more international aid to cope with the effects of last week's devastating cyclone, which has killed more than 125,000 people, according to an incomplete official count. Aid workers raised new alarms that disease could threaten millions of the cyclone's survivors.\nThe tornado struck today at Tungi, an industrial suburb 13 miles north of Dhaka. The United News of Bangladesh, a privately owned news agency, quoted fire department officials as saying that 9 people were killed and 100 hurt.\nA cyclone is a tropical storm consisting of a spiral of high winds and heavy rain. A tornado, a violent rotating column of air in contact with the ground, is usually much narrower, ordinarily visible as a funnel-shaped vortex.\nTungi was not in the path of last week's cyclone. But Chittagong, one of the hardest-hit areas in last week's storm, was hit with a round of thunderstorms today. No casualties were reported.\nChittagong, 135 miles southeast of the capital, Dhaka, has been Bangladesh's premier port.\nThe official death toll in the cyclone was reported at 125,730 today, but newspapers said the total would probably surpass 225,000. One paper, the Government-owned Dainik Bangla, said the total was unofficially estimated at 500,000. That would equal the death toll in what had been Bangladesh's worst natural disaster to date, a 1970 cyclone.\nIn addition to the victims counted by the Government, newspapers said at least 100,000 fishermen were missing since the cyclone and were feared to be dead. The independent Bangladesh Observer and other newspapers quoted the Deep Sea Fishing Association in Chittagong as saying the fishermen had been aboard about 2,000 boats and had not been heard from since the cyclone had struck.\nBangladeshi Government officials said they had no new fatality totals but bodies were still being counted. Threat of Cholera Epidemic\nThe biggest threat to survivors was disease and lack of adequate food and water. A relief official warned today that a cholera epidemic threatened eight million people.\nCARE, a United States-based international relief organization, said all 10 million people in the hardest-hit area were threatened by diarrhea. Of these, eight million are also at risk from cholera, Dr. Mohammad Musa, a CARE project coordinator in Dhaka, told reporters. Cholera, spread by contact with human waste, can be treated, but left untreated it can kill its victims within hours.\nThe relief effort since the cyclone falls far short of needs. Only 11 to 16 helicopters a day have been deployed to drop rice and drinking water to famished cyclone survivors who lost their food, clothing and homes to the storm. Trucks also are plying the highways between Dhaka and Chittagong.\nBangladesh's 110 million people have a per capita annual income of only $170, and the country is perennially buffeted by cyclones, tornadoes, floods and drought.\nBangladeshi officials appealed for $1.4 billion in aid to cope with the devastation. The second-ranking Foreign Ministry official, Riaz Rahman, said earlier that $735 million was needed, but officials now say the additional funds are needed for immediate and longer-term humanitarian aid, rehabilitation and reconstruction. 20 Countries Pledge Aid\nMr. Rahman said the Government had received pledges of cash, food and other assistance worth $200 million from 20 countries. About half the pledged funds come from Saudi Arabia, he added.\nHamed Essafi, a senior United Nations official, who arrived in Dhaka on Sunday, agreed that \"massive assistance from donors will be required in order to prevent further loss of life.\"\nMr. Essafi expressed disappointment at the breakdown in the Government's early warning system for disasters. \"I thought it was going to be a success story,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, in spite of that, there have been many casualties. So how can you be satisfied when you are doing your best and still the best is not good enough?\""}, {"text": "WORLDWIDE EFFORT TO AID BANGLADESH CALLED TOO LITTLE\n1991-05-08T05:00:00.000Z\nThe world has failed to mount an adequate relief effort to help survivors of last week's deadly cyclone in Bangladesh, international relief agency and United Nations officials said today.\nAt a meeting in Dhaka attended by representatives from the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization and the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, the World Bank and nongovernmental aid agencies, the Bangladeshi Government appealed for $1.4 billion for relief and reconstruction, of which $670 million would be for immediate relief and $740 million for help in rebuilding the country.\nSpeakers at the meeting said tighter organization of relief efforts was needed. Officials there said that the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization was expected to lead coordination with the Bangladeshi Government and that Hamed Essafi, director of the United Nations agency, had spent the last five days in Bangladesh and was drawing up a plan of action. Copters and Medicines Needed\nThe United Nations Disaster Relief Organization said on Sunday that Bangladesh urgently needs helicopters, 10 million water purification tablets, tents, plastic sheeting, emergency medical kits, drugs, particularly anti-diarrheal medications, and milk powder.\nOther urgently needed items, like rice, beans, shallow-draft boats, cooking oil and utensils, are available in Bangladesh, but the means to transport them to the affected areas are lacking, the report said.\nAlthough the official death toll in Bangladesh stands at just over 125,000, relief officials estimate that as many as 200,000 people have died and up to 10 million others remain homeless. Of the 10 million, 4 million are classified as \"in immediate risk,\" that is, in urgent need of food, medicine and clean water, said Philippe Boulle, the New York director of the United Nations Disaster Relief Organziation.\nUnited Nations and relief agency officials argue that without a large and immediate infusion of aid as well as helicopters to transport it to remote areas, another 100,000 or more Bangladeshis could die. Comparable to '70 Disaster\n\"This crisis compares closely with the 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh that claimed half a million lives,\" said John Hammock, executive director of Oxfam America. \"Recovery is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\"\nSaudi Arabia, the leading international donor, has given $100 million to the Bangladeshi Government for the relief effort. Other aid donors include the European Community, which has given $12 million; Britain, $7 million; India, $5 million; Pakistan, $4.3 million; Japan, $2.5 million, and Canada, $1.5 million.\nBut so far, the relief effort has been organized in a haphazard fashion. The United Nations has not had access to the funds and does not know how the Bangladeshi authorities will disburse the aid. United Nations officials emphasize that the relief effort requires extraordinary organization so that well-meaning donors do not send goods that may be available in the country.\nThe officials at the Dhaka meeting asserted that the problems in Bangladesh were far more serious than the refugee crisis in Iraq and appealed to governments in general to commit more funds to Bangladesh and to the United States in particular to divert some of the helicopters currently being used to help Iraqi Kurds. Worse Than Kurdish Situation\nBetween 20,000 and 30,000 Kurds have died, and an estimated two million Kurds are either refugees in Turkey and Iraq or displaced inside Iraq.\n\"The Kurdish crisis is just a blip on the screen compared to what we're facing in Bangladesh,\" said Tom Getman, director of government relations at World Vision, a private relief organization.\nIn Washington, the deputy State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, announced today that the Administration was authorizing an additional $5 million in grants to nongovernmental organizations for the Bangladesh relief effort and would reprogram $2 million in funds already in Bangladesh for the effort. The Administration has already authorized $2.1 million in grants, medical supplies and equipment and water purification equipment.\nThe Administration has allocated more than $200 million to help the estimated two million Kurdish refugees and displaced persons who have fled their homes and has asked Congress to approve another $150 million in supplemental aid. The Administration estimates that the Kurdish relief effort will cost the United States and its allies between $500 million and $700 million in the first six months.\nUnited Nations officials said today that the United States, as well as other governments they did not name, had thus far turned down their requests for helicopters, and that they lacked the funds to rent private helicopters. No Decision on Helicopters\nMr. Boucher said no decision had been made on sending American helicopters to Bangladesh. \"The substantial transportation assets do exist in the country,\" he said. \"There are boats that can be mobilized, and part of the $5 million that I announced will be available for logistic support to distribute the relief to the victims and disaster by truck and boat.\"\nBangladesh, which has been hit by 55 cyclones since 1900 and 8 of the world's 10 worst floods of the last decade, has enough food in warehouses inside the country to feed the survivors of last week's storm. But it is still raining in the areas where the homeless are located, and overland transporation is impossible.\nWhat complicates the Bangladesh relief effort is that tragedy struck on the heels of other emergency relief crises: that of the Iraqi Kurds and a worsening famine in the Sudan. \"If Bangladesh had happened at any other time, there would be a much more massive outpouring of support,\" said Lisa Mullins, program officer for foreign disaster assitance at Interaction, an umbrella group of more than 100 relief organizations. \"But then again, there's no geopolitical interest in Bangladesh.\"\nEven some private benefactors are reluctant to transfer to Bangladesh money intended for other causes. Sponsors of an international celebrity concert that will be staged Sunday on behalf of Kurdish refugees said there was no current intention to divert any of their receipts to Bangladesh."}, {"text": "Official Toll Reaches 92,000 in Bangladesh Cyclone\n1991-05-04T05:00:00.000Z\nFour days after a cyclone of unimaginable fury swung across the flat coastal plains of southeastern Bangladesh, swallowing up villages and sweeping away food crops, almost no emergency supplies have reached the newly destitute, relief officials and villagers said today.\nMore than 92,000 people have died in the storm, by official count. National newspapers say the toll may reach 200,000, and waterborne diseases and starvation are likely to kill thousands more.\nSqualls continue to lash grotesquely disordered and devastated coastal settlements like this one as well as offshore islands in the ravaged Bay of Bengal. Landscape of Suffering\nOfficials in Chittagong said the drownings in that city alone, Bangladesh's second-largest, could be as high as 90,000. Unless a huge international relief operation can be organized quickly, tens of thousands of people who survived the storm will die.\nThe crisis has gone far beyond anything Bangladesh can manage. Prime Minister Khaleda Zia appealed again today for foreign help to house and feed up to 10 million of the country's 115 million people.\nThe United States, Japan and Western Europe, overburdened by the Kurdish and African calamities, have pledged millions of dollars in aid, but the money is far short of the billions that Bangladesh says it needs. The first foreign aid flights began arriving today. Empty Hands, Sad Faces\nHere in Patenga, at the heart of the storm's path, the landscape is seared with suffering.\nTiny children with empty water pots and plastic bags were stationed along a bayside road, their distraught families busy elsewhere building shelters. The numbed and hollow-eyed children had been told to wait for relief supplies or handouts of any kind.\nNone came. Empty plastic bags and sad faces told the story.\nThousands of children are collapsing of dehydration, and diarrhea ravages neighborhoods of families trying to survive among the scraps of their former lives.\nBabies are the first to die. Everywhere -- on the muddy shoulders of roads, in the remains of bamboo houses, on empty windtorn patches that once were shelter -- there are weeping mothers and fathers clinging to infants too weak to hold up their heads, cradling their children in the desperate hope that love might save their lives. Hungry Children Sent Away\nJournalists who flew to Chittagong today on a Bangladesh Air Force plane loaded with rice, unrefined brown sugar, high-protein biscuits, potable water, matches, candles and cooking oil, watched as hungry Air Force enlisted men unloading the Antanov-24 transport planes broke into a few parcels of food and held an impromptu picnic. Children who had come to the airfield in the hope of a slender meal were shooed away.\n\"We had a biscuit and some rice yesterday,\" said 9-year-old Mizana Rahman as he clutched an empty shopping bag that he had hoped to fill with food for his six brothers and sisters. He left empty-handed.\nThe Bangladesh Air Force is trying to fly supplies -- including water-purification tablets from the United States -- into Chittagong Airport around the clock to supplement shipments trucked by several Government and private groups in an effort that apparently has not been coordinated. But the pilots are battling hunger, fatigue and violent weather that makes every takeoff and landing a daredevil stunt.\nToday, Vice Marshal Mumtaz Uddin Ahmed, the air force chief of staff, relieved an exhausted crew and piloted one of the flights himself. From Chittagong, parcels must be ferried by one of the helicopters to islands still partly submerged in an ugly, churning sea. The detritus of towns and of lives is tossed around on the waves, threatening small boats.\nDeliveries of supplies are difficult to track because all telephone lines are down in the Chittagong area and other means of communication are severely disrupted, a spokeswoman for the international relief agency CARE said tonight. CARE has been working around Chittagong and on Hatiya Island. Surrounded by Death\nSome lifesaving supplies are being inadvertently wasted. A helicopter swung out over offshore islands today with officials hoping to drop drinking water and other supplies on high ground. When the thin plastic containers of water landed, they exploded on impact.\nThe stench of death hovers over Patenga and drifts in and out on the winds that torment drenched people with no dry clothes to wear. The fields and beaches are littered with the decomposing bodies of cattle, goats, birds and people who were thrown violently against seawalls, buildings and trees.\nPeople came in buses today to see the bodies piling up, clutching hadkerchiefs to their noses and mouths to mask the smell. They gawked at the dredging barge the size of a city block that had come to rest astride the narrow road that once connected Chittagong Airport to the town.\nAt the airport, not far from the remains of this waterside settlement of Patenga, a fishing trawler is lodged between trees and smaller boats rest on the taxiways. About 40 F-6 training jets have been tossed around and deposited like models made of balsa. Brick walls have fallen; buildings have been swept up and thrown down elsewhere. Ships Docked in Fields\nOn the road that traverses Patenga, ships once moored in Chittagong Bay are crazily perched in fields, one still connected to several hundred yards of anchor ropes and a distant anchor.\nA woman named Sakina, who is 30, was helping to reassemble some family possessions today on the road that passed by the sodden, empty space where her house once stood. Her father and brother died on Tuesdaymorning when the water came. She stayed alive by clinging to a tree as the cyclone struck with winds of 140 miles per hour.\nSakina's story of why the family had not moved out of the path of this very destructive storm was a common one. They had no radio or television, she said, so they had not heard any warnings.\n\"But the way people talked, we assumed nothing much would happen,\" she said. They went to bed at dusk on Monday. \"The rain and wind started coming at about 10, and then the waves! The waves wouldn't go down.\" Waves on this coast surged to 20 feet or more, submerging the airport. Chittagong Harbor is still blocked with sunken ships. No Escape\nFor Bangladeshis, cyclones and floods are annual events. Many said today that they were not too concerned about the special ferocity of the storm until it was too late. Yet they had been warned for several days, and on Monday by Prime Minister Zia, who appeared on television to tell people to seek shelter on safer ground. For many, such warnings were pointless: they had nowhere to go to escape the flooding.\nIn Mizana Rahman's family, that call went unheeded because, the boy said, \"by then, the electricity had gone off and no one could see anything on television.\" The Government never ordered people to move.\nForced evacuations are uncommon in this part of the world, where temporary shelter is very difficult to find. Bangladesh does have some sophisticated cyclone shelters -- concrete buildings on three-story-high columns. But local people say that to go to them means leaving their homes, which many are loath to do.\nTajolislam Chowdhury, who works for the Air Force and speaks English, said that, like his neighbors, he had decided to stay home and see how bad the storm would be. By midnight on Monday, he said, he knew this was no ordinary cyclone. He sought shelter in a two-story airport building.\n\"But next door to me, in the house alongside, they all stayed,\" he said. \"All 10 of them are gone, all dead.\""}, {"text": "First U.S. Troops Arrive in Bangladesh to Begin Large-Scale Relief Effort\n1991-05-13T05:00:00.000Z\nA team of about 64 marines and Army Special Forces troops flew from Okinawa to Bangladesh today to begin preparing for a large-scale American relief effort in the cyclone-battered country.\nThe team is the vanguard of a disaster relief force of nearly 8,000 dispatched by the United States military on Saturday to aid survivors, ferry food and clothing by helicopter and set up water-purification centers.\nA total of 4,660 marines and 3,000 sailors are due off the coast of Bangladesh by Wednesday aboard eight ships of a Navy amphibious group headed by the assault vessel Tarawa, the military said. Among them are Navy construction teams, known as Seabees.\nThe amphibious force was on its way back to California from the Persian Gulf, where it had been dispatched in early December to take part in the war against Iraq. It was never ordered into combat, said Lieut. Col. Thomas J. Boyd of the Air Force, who is a spokesman of the Pacific Comnmand. Helicopters on the Way\nColonel Boyd said a C-5 Galaxy transport plane had taken off from Hawaii carrying five Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and 56 crew members and was due in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, on Monday. In addition, several four-member teams of Air Force air-traffic controllers have been sent to Dhaka and members of an Army engineer battalion already working on public works projects in Bangladesh will be incorporated in the operations.\nThe spokesman said the amphibious vessels carried four types of helicopters for carrying food and medical supplies to people isolated on islands in the Bay of Bengal by the huge tides unleashed during the cyclone on April 30. They range from the CH-53 Sea Stallions and CH-46 Sea Knights to smaller UH-1N Iroquois and AH-1T Cobras.\nAl Panico, director of international relief and development for the American Red Cross, said the effort represented a shift in United States Government disaster assistance policy. He said in an interview that in the past aid was usually confined to credits and funds provided to private relief agencies and occasionally included provision of air transport.\n\"Frankly, they didn't do it before,\" Mr. Pacino said. \"Relief consisted of credits, food supplies, funds and 10 to 20 advisers. Nothing this massive. What is now changing, in northern Iraq and Bangladesh, is sending the military to provide some relief directly. When the military gets a mission, it's awesome. They have orders, command, resources, planes. Others wouldn't do it as fast. I think that's great.\"\nTom Drahman, director for Asia of CARE in New York, who testified here last week before a House committee on Bangladesh's special need for helicopter transport ships, said of the military relief effort: \"We think this is very, very positive. These things can be used. This is a massive problem. It's not going to be solved overnight.\"\nCARE has distributed plastic sheeting for shelter, five days' supplies of rice and molasses, and water supplies together with decontamination tablets to a total of more than 200,000 people in Bangladesh, he said.\nBangladesh officials now estimate that 138,000 people have died as a result of the cyclone and its aftermath.\nMr. Drahman noted that because of the vulnerability of Bangladesh to cyclones, its Government, CARE and relief organizations had positioned emergency supplies \"with a very long shelf life\" as part of a disaster preparedness strategy at various sites around the country. The problem now, he said, was to move those supplies to people in need.\n\"Transport, communications and the awful weather -- those are the major problems,\" he said. \"I have been able to speak just twice to Bangladesh on the telephone.\" It is unclear how much the American military relief effort may cost. The United States has already contributed $7.2 million in assistance and is scheduled to redirect another $2 million already planned for Bangladesh for disaster aid. Officers Plan Campaign\nDHAKA, Bangladesh, May 12 (AP) -- A half-dozen American military officers plan to visit Chittagong on Monday to see whether the cyclone-shattered seaport can accommodate their fleet and to start figuring out how best to deploy their troops.\n\"We've got equipment here to make pure water out of salt water, out of contaminated water,\" said Maj. Dave Sebastian of the Marines. \"We can take almost mud and make it drinkable.\"\nMajor Sebastian, a 39-year-old engineer from Orlando, Fla., said the marines would probably set up several water-purification points close to food distribution centers established by foreign and local relief teams along the coutry's badly damaged southeastern coast.\nThe advance team that arrived today from Okinawa is under the command of Maj. Gen. Henry Stackpole of the Marines. He spent the day conferring with Bangladeshi Government leaders and American Embassy officials.\nAnother flight from Okinawa was expected to reach Dhaka tonight, carrying about 30 more engineers and communications personnel. Also on the flights were medics who will try to keep the task force from getting sick.\nThe area where the task force will be working is a nightmare of health hazards. The diarrhea ravaging flood survivors, especially babies and small children, can be fatal because of the rapid dehydration it induces.\nBangladeshi relief workers have already warned of the danger of a cholera epidemic. New Cyclone Is Feared\nDHAKA, Bangladesh, May 12 (Reuters) -- Weather officials reported the threat of a new cyclone today. They said a low depression in the Andaman Sea, 800 miles south of Chittagong, could turn into a new storm that might hit the country in the next two days.\n\"We don't want to take any chances,\" said Abdur Rub Khan, an official in Chittagong. \"We have told people to stay alert.\"\nFinance Minister Saifur Rahman said that the first cyclone cost Bangladesh $3 billion in economic losses and that nearly four million people had been made virtually destitute.\nThe Dhaka weather office said rivers all over the country were still rising."}, {"text": "The World; In a Cyclone's Swath Across Bangladesh, A Hard Life Revives\n1991-08-18T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE chars is the name for the flat islands in the delta where the Ganges meets the sea in Bangladesh. In a richer country, no one would live on hummocks of silt that rise only a few feet above the waters. In rainy years, the rivers flood; in unlucky ones, the ocean's waves ride cyclones inland for miles. But in a country the size of Wisconsin with 118 million residents, the poor have no choice but to put up huts and try to make a living fishing the Bay of Bengal or planting rice in the mud.\nOn the night of April 29, an awesome cyclone struck. Winds tore apart rickety homes, waves swept away whole families, and those they spared lost cows, boats, crops, sometimes everything. By an official estimate that no one can vouch for the accuracy of, 139,000 died.\nSlowly, people have been rebuilding. The government is helping. So, independently, are opposition parties seeking votes. About 7,500 American military personnel worked for two weeks.

Mr. Morarka said in an interview that an initial aid offer of $750,000, and the use of three helicopters, was based on earlier, incomplete information about the scale of the destruction.\n\"We can put together a substantial package,\" he said, \"but we have to be sure that it is what Bangladesh also wants.\" Little Hard Currency\nBut other officials in the Indian Government emphasized that precariously low foreign currency reserves would prevent them from making large grants.\n\"The financial crunch is a factor,\" said Aftab Seth, a spokesman for the External Affairs Ministry. \"We also have our own shortages. We won't be able to provide milk powder and oil because we're suffering from shortages ourselves in these items.\"\nIn January, India received $1.8 billion in emergency assistance from the International Monetary Fund to help it through its balance-of-payments problems. A series of economic setbacks, aggravated by a drop in foreign exchange remittances and a disruption of oil supplies caused by the Persian Gulf war have severely hurt the Indian economy. India is reportedly one of the largest debtor nations in the world, owing an estimated $70 billion.\nFinance Minister Yashwant Sinha has been in Washington this week negotiating with officials of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund officials for another major loan. That is estimated at $5 billion as a means of helping India reschedule its international debts and plan for the future.\nAnother senior official in the External Affairs Ministry said that political distractions were hampering the organization of assistance for Bangladesh. India's politicians and people continue to focus on general elections, which are 16 days away.\nAn Indian diplomat also pointed out that his Government had to tread cautiously, even with emergency aid. Bangladesh has long been suspicious of India's size, what it regards as its overbearing attitude, and disagreements over water management programs in the Ganges River basin.\nIndians assert that Bangladesh would still be part of Pakistan, had their country not intervened in civil strife there in 1971, resulting in Bangladesh's independence. There has been a feeling here, rarely expressed publicly, that Bangladesh has not been sufficiently grateful for India's central role in breaking Pakistan's hold. Insurgencies in Both Countries\nRelations between the two countries are further irritated by India's support of an insurgency in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh, while at least two anti-India insurgencies were based in Bangladesh until their leaders negotiated for peace with New Delhi in the 1980's.\nEvery year, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants into India flee the extreme poverty of Bangladesh, its overpopulation and its perilous, low-lying terrain. In the 1960's and 1970's, many aliens slipped into the lightly populated regions of Assam and Tripura in northeastern India. Bangladesh denies the exodus.\nAs local hostility to immigration has grown in the northeast, Indian intelligence officials say the migration has shifted to West Bengal state. The number of illegal aliens crossing into West Bengal was recently estimated by an Indian official at 200,000 a year. -------------------- Mother Teresa Arrives\nDHAKA, Bangladesh, May 4 (AP) -- Mother Teresa arrived today with sacks of milk powder and biscuits for victims of the deadly storm that has ravaged Bangladesh.\n\"I have come here to give my love and care to the suffering people. It's good to share the suffering with them,\" said the 80-year-old Roman Catholic nun.\nShe is scheduled to visit areas damaged by the cyclone on Sunday, possibly with the Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, a Foreign Ministry official said.\nMother Teresa arrived from Calcutta, just across the border, where she runs a worldwide organization of more than 400 homes for the orphaned, poor, sick or dying. She won the Nobel Peace prize in 1979.\nShe set up a branch of her Missionaries of Charity in Bangladesh in 1972 and last visited in 1988, after a flood that killed 1,400 people. More than 125,000 people are officially counted as dead in the storm that hit on Tuesday.\nMother Teresa turned down a Government offer to house her in a hotel and chose to stay in one of her organization's two missions in Dhaka. Her organization has six other missions in Bangladesh, but none in the areas affected by the storm.\nShe brought 1,630 pounds of powdered milk and biscuits, which she gave to Bangladesh relief officials, and said she would stay for two or three days.

But money is short, and so the next big cyclone will also kill tens of thousands of destitute villagers forced by population pressures to live in dangerous areas. Vulnerable to Any Storm\n\"I will stay here,\" said Abdulkarim, an 18-year-old man on Gomatali Island, which barely rises a few feet above the Bay of Bengal and is vulnerable to any storm.\nNobody needs to tell Mr. Abdulkarim that life on the island is dangerous. He lost both parents and all six of his brothers and sisters to the cyclone, which struck on April 30 with winds of 145 miles an hour. But like nearly every other islander interviewed, he said he had no alternative but to accept the risk.\n\"Where would I go?\" asked Aminsharif, a 27-year-old Gomatali resident who also lost his entire family to the cyclone. \"I have land here, and it's all I have. I have no choice but to stay.\"\nMr. Aminsharif, who like most rural Bangladeshis has just one name, fervently hopes that the Government or foreign aid donors will build a cyclone shelter on the island. And it seems probable that the devastation last week will lead to new shelters along the coast, though not enough of them.\nBut while such shelters offer good protection from cyclones, it is not clear that building new ones is the most efficient way of saving lives in a country so desperately poor.\nThe cyclone's toll -- put at 125,000 by the official, but not overly reliable, count -- has captured international attention and spurred an outpouring of aid. But each year, without attracting much notice, about 870,000 Bangladeshi children under the age of 5 die routinely, a third of them from diarrhea caused by impure water. The cyclone has merely added a large increment of anguish to a grief that is chronic.\nSmall amounts of aid, spread around efficiently, could save lives as effectively as storm shelters. United Nations officials say the aid would greatly enhance mundane projects like measles-vaccination campaigns or water purification systems.\nBut it is also clear that cyclone shelters save lives. The reason so many people died is that they lived in crude huts that offered little protection from the elements. Those who lived in concrete homes had a far greater chance of surviving.\nIn the Banskhali district, south of the port of Chittagong, virtually every hut within a few miles of the ocean was destroyed, and perhaps half the people in those houses died. One Structure Was Spared\nBut one remaining structure, battered but still looming over the bare mud flats once speckled with thatched-hut villages, is the two-floor concrete home of Abdulmobin, one of the most prosperous men in the area.\nMr. Abdulmobin said that 30 people took refuge in his home during the cyclone, and that all survived except one man who was swept away when he opened the door during the storm.\nDespite an effort to build a string of shelters after a cyclone in 1970 in which 300,000 to 500,000 people died, there are not nearly enough. The island of Sandwip, for instance, has just 10 cyclone shelters, providing protection to 15,000 people even though 300,000 people live there.\nIn all, Bangladesh has 302 cyclone shelters, while 5,000 to 10,000 are needed. But each shelter costs $50,000 to build, and Bangladesh already had a budget deficit before the cyclone. If more is spent on shelters, less must be spent on other forms of relief.\nThere has been some progress over the decades. The latest cyclone was more intense than the one in 1970, yet this time far fewer people seem to have been killed. The unreliability of the death toll makes it difficult to be precise, but cyclone shelters and an early-warning system probably saved many lives. Progress Is Slow\nStill, the pace of such progress is painfully slow.\nBari Talukdar, executive engineer of the Bangladesh Water Development Board, said that with enough money the death toll from severe cyclones could be reduced to the hundreds from the hundreds of thousands. The money would go toward building more cyclone shelters and higher embankments to protect the shoreline and the islands from storm tides.\n\"Now the time has come for rebuilding the embankment to protect against cyclones,\" Mr. Talukdar said. The old embankments, which were badly damaged by the wall of water that accompanied the cyclone, were intended to protect against high tides and modest squalls rather than cyclones. The old embankments were 12 to 15 feet high, but should be 18 to 25 feet to provide protection from major cyclones, he said.\nThe problem is that construction of such embankments, when fortified with concrete or boulders, would cost about $25,000 per 100 feet. Kutubdia Island, one of the worst hit by the cyclone, is more than 30 miles in circumference. It would cost tens of millions of dollars to build an adequate dike around the perimeter of just that one island.\nIn an ideal world, Kutubdia Island -- with an average elevation of only about five feet above sea level -- might simply be abandoned to the ocean. But population pressures in Bangladesh are such that people flock to any bit of land that peaks above the sea, for there is no room for them on the mainland.\nBangladesh has a population of 118,000 million, and is growing by 2.4 million each year. At that rate, it takes just two or three weeks for the population to make up for the loss of 125,000 cyclone victims. As the population soars, more and more peasants move to the coastal areas and the islands, searching for work and for some earth to cultivate, whatever the risks.\nThe American-financed project of the 1960's to reclaim agricultural land on Kutubdia by building protective embankments led to a big increase in the number of people living there. The result is that more people than ever are now at risk from cyclones.\nIn the longer term, low-lying Bangladesh faces a grave threat from a rising sea level. Higher sea levels resulting from global warming could be catastrophic for Bangladesh. In 1988, severe flooding left nearly two-thirds of the country briefly under water; rising sea levels could increase the frequency of inundation and the risks to islanders and coastal dwellers alike."}, {"text": "BANGLADESH REPORTS TOLL FROM STORM IS NEAR 40,000; SAYS IT MAY EXCEED 100,000\n1991-05-03T05:00:00.000Z\nPrime Minister Khaleda Zia said today that at least 100,000 people may have died in the devastating cyclone that pounded this low-lying country's densely populated coastal areas on Tuesday, leaving hunger, disease and homelessness in its wake.\nWith bodies washing ashore in the thousands and the Government pleading for international aid for millions of destitute survivors, the official death toll, based on reports from the hardest-hit regions, crept toward 40,000. But many of the victims were swept into the Bay of Bengal, and their bodies will probably never be recovered.\n\"It is a vast devastation, and the loss of human lives could exceed 100,000,\" Mrs. Zia said. \"The information is incomplete. We fear it could go up much more. I pray to Allah it's not true.\" Bodies Wash Ashore\nRelief workers and journalists who visited the stricken area in the southeast, dominated by ragged islands and river deltas, said the tides were bringing in thousands of bodies. Survivors searched for relatives among the corpses piled on beaches.\n\"I saw deaths, devastation, agony and misery of a magnitude I have never seen before,\" a photographer who went to the area told The Associated Press. The impoverished Government struggled to ferry food, water and medicine to the survivors, but vast areas hit by the cyclone were inaccessible. Helicopters dropped essentials to people huddled on the rooftops of marooned buildings.\n[ Already burdened by efforts to help Kurdish refugees and famine- stricken Africans, the United States and private relief agencies are beginning to assess how to provide aid to Bangladesh. Page A8. ]\nLutfar Rahman Khan, Minister of State for Relief and Rehabilitation, said this evening of the death count: \"I would not be surprised if the total exceeds 100,000.\" The death toll was the highest since 1970, the year before Bangladesh proclaimed its independence, when 500,000 people were killed by a cyclone that hit the same area.\nThe Government has appealed for international help to buy food, clothing, shelter and at least 20 large helicopters to deliver the relief supplies, the Minister said. About 10 million people out of a population of 115 million have been uprooted by the storm, which roared across the region with winds of 145 miles an hour.\nThe most devastated stretch of shoreline was around the seaside town of Cox's Bazar and on nearby islands, where 95 percent of the houses were destroyed. All along the southeast coast, brackish water has ruined drinking supplies. Roads have been severely damaged and telephone communications are cut off. Rice Crops Destroyed\nA tempestuous sea has destroyed thousands of acres of rice crops that were almost ready for harvest. Experts said that land flooded with salt water might be unworkable for two or three years, a severe blow to the predominantly agricultural economy.\nShrimp farms, salt pans and fishing fleets, all vital sources of employment, have been blown apart. Damage to fledgling industries, including an oil refinery, has not been assessed.\nIn the port of Chittagong, eight ships, at least one belonging to the small Bangladesh Navy, have sunk, blocking the only harbor that the country can use for berthing large vessels bringing in relief supplies. Mr. Rahman Khan said Bangladesh \"desperately\" needed foreign expertise in clearing the port.\nHe said hospitals and schools were destroyed, leaving no place to shelter and treat the homeless. More than 100,000 people have no cover at all, not even tents or lean-tos. Health hazards are considered potentially disastrous in this intensely hot, humid climate. 6 Functioning Helicopters\nThree C-130 cargo planes were expected to arrive in the capital with relief supplies from Saudi Arabia, a large donor of aid to predominantly Muslim Bangladesh. But this country has only six functioning helicopters, most of them too small to ferry much equipment to the neediest areas.\nTwo light fixed-wing planes have dropped some dry food and clothing -- 40,000 saris for women and 20,000 sarongs for men -- in plastic bags from low altitudes. No planes can land on the estuary islands, which are still knee- to chest-deep in water, officials say.\nRelief workers will try on Friday to use small boats to deliver food and water to offshore islands.\nHundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis have been living on relatively new silt islands in the estuaries of rivers in defiance of the law. They have fled there over the years in desperation, for land is in short supply in this extremely poor and densely populated country.\nMany Bangladeshis on the islands were tending the cattle or crops of landlords who live safely on the mainland. Although they were advised to leave 48 hours before the cyclone struck, many could not think of a place to go -- or chose not to abandon the herds or their own subsistence crops, local journalists say.\nOfficials listed coastal areas or islands where the devastation has exceeded that of any recent disaster: Moiscali, Chakori, Sandwip, Kutubdia, Hatiya, Manpura, Charfashion, Bhola, Banshkhali, Patharghata, Sitakundu, Cox's Bazar, Patenga and Urirchor.\nOn Moiscali Island, the local authorities said today, at least 11,000 people died. At Chakori, near Cox's Bazar, the official death toll was 10,000. On Sandwip Island, at least 5,022 people perished. The Leap in the Death Toll\nWhen the typhoon struck, there was immediate alarm that the death toll could soar into the tens of thousands. The Government initially put the official death toll at 1,000, and then at 3,000, as reports from stricken regions filtered in.\nAfter new reports from remote areas and ravaged provinces, the official toll leaped early today to 35,000. The Government put the number at 37,543 late in the day, but did not say how it had arrived at such a precise figure.\nThe cyclone is the first crisis for Mrs. Zia's Government, which came to power just weeks ago. Prime Minister Zia, the widow of an assassinated President, Ziaur Rahman, led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to victory in an election at the end of February.\nBangladesh's previous leader, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, abruptly resigned last December under pressure from democracy campaigners. Their unexpected success gave the country a huge psychological boost. President Ershad is under arrest on charges of corruption."}, {"text": "Voyage Across a Storm-Shattered Bangladesh\n1991-05-10T05:00:00.000Z\nThree-year-old Badshar survived when a cyclone sent a 20-foot storm tide into this village last week, but it is too early to say whether that makes him lucky. Lacking shelter, food and clean water, he is already ill, and it may be that he withstood the destruction only to face a slow death from hunger and diarrhea.\nNothing but a mud flat is left of Digipura, a village that was once home to 780 people just a mile from the sea on the southeastern coast of Bangladesh. The Government says 125,000 people were killed when the cyclone struck on the morning of April 30, and at least 240 of them were villagers here. Adequate relief has still not arrived to help Badshar and the tens of thousands like him.\nA three-day journey along the length of the coast, by car, by boat and on foot, found that for many survivors like Badshar, the ordeal is far from over. The initial horror of the storm has been replaced by the prolonged horror of hunger, homelessness and sickness. Hunger and Its Pangs\nEmergency food and other aid has reached most areas, but it is a tiny fraction of what is needed. Communications are almost non-existent, bridges have been swept away and roads have been washed out. Relief workers fear that people in remote villages and on flooded offshore islands may be quietly starving because no one knows of their plight. Even if no one is starving, nearly everyone is hungry.\nSome food has been delivered to Digipura, reachable only by hiking several miles along a muddy path and inching across some bamboo poles that have been put up to replace destroyed bridges. But it is only enough to feed people one meal of rice a day.\nThe cyclone survivors live in makeshift shelters of tin and plastic scavenged from the debris, and they have little protection from the driving rain that has fallen in the last few days. Some victims fear that conditions will get worse before they get better.\n\"It is getting worse each day,\" said Mirahmed, a 70-year-old villager who was surveying the remnants of his home in the Banskhali region, south of the port of Chittagong. \"We need food, medicine and water. Until we get them, life will get worse.\"\nTo travel along the coast is to view a kaleidoscope of misery. Refugees sleep in emergency shelters, in schools, in bits of plastic sheeting, even on the roads. They are invariably hungry, and they hold out their hands for food or money to anyone they see.\nA few bodies remain unburied, along with many bloated corpses of cattle and other animals. In the village of Khankhanabad, hard by a broken bridge of mud that was once an embankment keeping the sea off the farmland, survivors poked around their land today looking for anything salvageable, bypassing the body of a teen-age boy wedged in the sand. The people of Khankhanabad have their own problems: of 450 villagers, only 60 survived. Rice Prices Climbing\nThe cyclone leveled virtually everything, but the poorest and most miserable, those living in thatched huts on strips of lands no surer that sandbars, overwhelmingly suffered the most. Their huts were washed away, often with their loved ones inside.\nBut the concrete homes of wealthier people generally suffered little damage, at least if they were a mile or two from shore. Some well-stocked merchants have even profited: the price of rice has risen, and the price of building materials has soared. Nails cost 10 times more than they did two weeks ago.\nIt will take years for the coastal region to regain economic vibrancy, and even then only with large sums of foreign aid. Most people have lost not only family members, homes and possessions, but livelihoods as well.\n\"I used to work on fishing boats,\" said Badurrahman, a 35-year-old who like many Bangladeshis has a single name. \"But now most of the boats have been destroyed, so I don't know where I'll find work.\" Half a Village Swept Away\nMr. Badurrahman spoke in the village of Gomatali, where nearly half the population of 3,500 was killed, including Mr. Badurrahman's wife and three children. The stench of death hangs over the island, and Mr. Badurrahman cannot bear to look at the spot of mud where his hut once stood. He speaks bleakly, grimly, with no sign that he is happy to have survived by seizing a plank of wood and riding the floodwaters to the mainland, 2 miles away.\nHe returned to the island and is now sleeping in the hut of friends and eating a meal of rice a day, supplied by private relief organizations. Army medics have arrived and are treating local children for diarrhea, so no one on the island seems to be in danger of dying. But like Mr. Badurrahman, many seem to feel little reason to live.\nGomatali is a barren land of mud and hurried graves, and most of the people still seem in shock. Shadad Hossain, a 12-year-old boy who lost his parents and his brothers and sisters, stood barefoot with solemn eyes full of pain and seemed too numb to think of anything but the cyclone. It took him a while to decide, when asked, that he was hungry. For the last week, he said, he has had only a bit of rice each day.\nFarmers as well as fishermen have lost their means of earning an income. Their fields have been flooded with salt water, and in some areas the tide flows through broken dikes that once kept the ocean from the coastal farmland. The dikes, hugely important to local agriculture, were badly damaged all the way from Cox's Bazar, a resort farther south, to Chittagong, the main southeastern port, and the tides now deposit new salt on the land twice a day. Monsoon Season Looms\nTornadoes have struck the country for three days running, compounding the calamity and slowing relief efforts, and in a few weeks the monsoon rains will begin. Unless the embankments are repaired, the higher-than-normal spring tides will sweep across the coastal areas and islands each day. That is unlikely to carry people into the sea, but it will increase their misery and could make large regions uninhabitable. It will also drench more land with salt water and make farming those areas impossible.\nIf the dikes are rebuilt soon, the farmers in some areas will be able to plant a new crop in time to harvest their rice by November, if they are given seed, fertilizer and equipment, all free of charge. Even so, they would rely on handouts for food for half a year. In other areas, the salt-saturated land may not support crops for as long as two or three years. For now, outside assistance offers the people their only hope of a meal and the sole chance to get back on their feet.\n\"There was lots of food here, but it has all been washed away,\" said Shubal, a fisherman in the village of Jahanabad, north of Chittagong. \"Those were our fishing boats. We're waiting for relief, but it hasn't come and so we have almost nothing to eat.\"\nMr. Shubal said that three people in his village, on the edge of the disaster area, died in the cyclone, and that two others since then have died of the diarrhea afflicting most of the villagers. He said he hoped that the Government would give out fishing nets so that he and other fishermen could have some way of putting food on the table.\nSo far there has been no major epidemic of cholera or other disease, and even the diarrhea, while widespread, seems to have caused a small number of deaths. People in most villages said children were suffering from diarrhea but were not dying from it. Even in the worst-hit areas, deaths are the exception.\nBut medical workers say that a cholera outbreak is still a possibility, and that some of the cyclone victims are at the end of their strength and vulnerable to disease.\n\"The health situation is getting worse,\" Dr. Nazrulislam Chowdhury said as he bustled along a path through the mud to give first aid to villagers along the coast. But some medical workers said that the situation was improving and that a large number of deaths seemed unlikely for now.\nGovernment officials gave more optimistic assessments than private relief workers, but even the officials acknowledge that there are remote areas -- particularly on the islands -- that have not yet been reached.\nIn part this is because of communication difficulties and a lack of coordination among agencies, so that sometimes no one knows if a particular area has already been helped. Rough seas have also made it difficult to reach the seaward side of the islands, and then there are a myriad other problems and uncertainties that hamper relief work. Displaced Seek Out Cities\n\"Our women are very conservative,\" said Ansarul Karim, an ecologist who is helping run a private relief effort on the southern island of Maiskhal. \"If they lost their clothing in the cyclone, they won't come out of their huts. They might just starve in their huts.\"\nMr. Karim, like most relief workers interviewed in the field, said the emergency work was being carried out too slowly. He warned that growing numbers of displaced people might flock to the cities, possibly provoking social unrest.\nAlready, large numbers of refugees have found their way to Chittagong, where they stand outside government offices hoping for food.\nSometimes the mood is tense: a dispute during distribution of rice the other night led to a minor riot. Local people climbed onto a building and hurled bricks and stones at the police. After 20 minutes, order was restored, but the peace seems to be a sullen one."}, {"text": "A Roar, Then Blackness: 'I Have Lost Everything'\n1991-05-03T05:00:00.000Z\nMufizur Rahman said that before he blacked out, he saw waves \"as high as mountains\" sweep toward his village with a powerful roar.\nWhen he regained consciousness hours later, he said, his wife, son and three daughters had been swept away. There was little left of the small coastal village where his forefathers had settled. 'I Have Lost Everything'\n\"I have lost everything. I have lost everything. God, why has it happened to me?\" Mr. Rahman repeated over and over, sobbing helplessly.\nKutubdia Island was directly in the path of a savage cyclone, one of the worst to hit this impoverished country on the Bay of Bengal. The storm, with 145 mph winds, pounded the coast for eight hours on Tuesday.\nThe 55-year-old farmer, his clothes in tatters, said he had not believed warnings that the storm would strike his village, Vijandya. Even if he had, he said, there were few boats that could have survived the rough seas and taken villagers to safety. False Alarms\nJamaluddin Chowdhry, a rescue worker with the Bangladeshi Red Crescent Society, said many people refused to heed the storm warnings. The last 11 times that warnings had been issued, cyclones did not hit the area.\nThe Government put the overall death toll at more than 37,000. Unofficial estimates suggested that the total could surpass 100,000.\n\"At least 35,000 people have been killed in Kutubdia, and 15,000 in nearby Maheshkhali Island,\" said Jalal Ahmed, a lawmaker touring the area.\nWhen a reporter visited Kutubdia Island, bloated corpses were floating near the shore alongside dead cattle. Villagers frantically waved to an approaching speedboat, apparently seeking help. Trying to Save an Infant\nRabeya Begum said her husband was fatally bitten by a snake when he tried to grab a floating banana tree on which to perch his infant son. He died on the spot, and the baby drowned, she said.\nShafi Alam said he lost six members of his family, but saved one son by tying him to a coconut tree.\nFood supplies and cattle were washed away. The islanders were short of medicine, drinking water and fuel. Only a half dozen buildings were still standing, and thousands of huts were torn apart by the swirling seawater.\nCyclone shelters in several parts of the islands of Kutubdia and Maheshkhali were flooded by seven feet of water. From a boat, survivors could be seen jamming the upper floors of the two-story brick buildings.\nIn Moghnama, a coastal village on Maheshkhali, more than 3,500 people were crammed into a cyclone shelter built for 1,000. Almost all were women and children.\nIn Chittagong, Bangladesh's second-largest city and its main port, a food storage center collapsed in the gale and buried laborers, a journalist based there said.\nCorpses lay amid the debris of many ruined buildings, and electricity poles across the city were uprooted. Brick and cement structures proved more resistant to collapse.\nSona Mia, a worker in Chittagong, said that some steel-frame containers hit areas of the city like missiles, killing people and seriously damaging many houses.\nCommunications Minister Oli Ahmed estimated that 25,000 residents of Chittagong alone died in the eight-hour storm."}, {"text": "CHRONICLE\n1991-09-06T05:00:00.000Z\nMARILYN QUAYLE has been appointed by JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR, the United Nations Secretary General, to a new council that will try to reduce the loss of life, property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural disasters around the world.\nThe new group's members include TAKEO FUKUDA, a former Prime Minister of Japan; SUZANNE MUBARAK, wife of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, and LISBETH PALME, the widow of Olof Palme, the slain prime minister of Sweden.

But whoever wins the national elections now rescheduled for mid-June is also going to have to pay careful attention to India's relationships with its neighbors -- particularly Pakistan -- or New Delhi will only compound its domestic woes.\nIndia's turmoil at home is, in many ways, a reflection of the ethnic conflicts tearing at hopes for peace in this and other regions. If New Delhi doesn't mend its prickly relationships with many of its neighbors -- a result of overbearing behavior indulged in for decades -- the tensions could stand in the way of getting needed help from the developed world, and cooperation from its most powerful neighbor and adversary, Pakistan.\nOver the last two years, the most serious threat to India's domestic integrity has been posed by the secessionist movement that has exploded over the Kashmir Valley, a disputed territory populated mostly by Muslims that straddles the India-Pakistan border.\nAlarms have gone off in Washington more than once over this dispute, because India and Pakistan are not only perennially locked in confrontation but are also thought to be capable of turning their antagonism into nuclear war.\nSince 1947, the two nations have fought three wars, all of them to one degree or another involving Kashmir. And since the last war, in 1971, India has set off a nuclear explosion and has successfully tested several missile delivery systems. For its part, Pakistan is now barred from receiving American aid because President Bush cannot certify that Islamabad is not developing nuclear arms.\nIf the ethnic conflict in Kashmir is a threat to India's national integrity, it is also inextricably linked to tensions with Pakistan because Islamabad, almost without trying, has been able to fan the flames of revolt in the valley. No cause is more popular in Pakistan than \"free Kashmir,\" though Islamabad is silent on whether such freedom should also apply to its part of the territory.\nTo compound the problem India faces, New Delhi can no longer simply cut a deal with Pakistan over the territory without the involvement of the Kashmiris themselves; they are determined to bring this issue back to the United Nations, where resolutions calling for self-determination have been pending for more than 40 years. Members of the British Parliament from the Labor Party have now taken up the issue of Kashmiri rights. New Delhi, however, has never allowed a plebiscite.\nIn Kashmir, as in the Punjab, human rights violations by Indian military, paramilitary and police forces are beginning to draw the sustained attention of international human rights organizations, creating a new and less obliging environment in the West and Japan for \"the world's most populous democracy.\" A Reputation as a Bully\nAnd in such a world, less sympathetic to India, new light will inevitably be shed on India's years as South Asia's bully -- an issue that has been put into momentary eclipse by the turmoil at home.\nUnder the last two Prime Ministers of the Nehru dynasty -- Jawaharlal Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv -- New Delhi played havoc with the stability of its much smaller neighbors. Militants from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh were trained and armed here. The small Kingdom of Sikkim was undermined and destroyed by Indian agents. Nepal suffered a crippling economic boycott and Bhutan has had to put up with a large contingent of Indian troops, ostensibly in the country to train the minuscule Bhutanese army.\nFor decades after the British left in 1947-48, India made the regional rules. If a desperate Bangladesh wanted to convene an international conference on rivers and floods, for example, India said it was a bilateral matter. Now, international organizations and European nations, in particular France, have begun to ignore those limitations and have taken the plight of Bangladesh to the world over the heads of New Delhi's neo-imperialists.\nThe United States, on the other hand, has always seemed predisposed to allow India a free hand. Sri Lankans say they got a clear message that Washington was not prepared to challenge India's policies in the region, even when Indian aircraft violated Sri Lankan airspace with impunity to drop supplies in rebel areas.\nWhen a mercenary Sri Lankan Tamil band tried to invade the Indian Ocean nation of Maldives in 1988, India rushed in troops and was rewarded by a public pat on the back by Washington. A tremor went through Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.\nAll around the region, the interrupted elections soon to be completed in India are of immense importance. For about 18 months, with the Congress Party of Rajiv Gandhi in opposition or behind the scenes instead of in the halls of power, the region has enjoyed a breathing space -- except, perhaps, for Pakistan, which had its own internal turmoil to contend with, in addition to its worries about the course of the insurrection in Kashmir.\nBut one hope for a lessening of tensions in the region is that Pakistan now has a pragmatic Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, who is determined to go down in history as the man who modernized his country economically while allowing it to come to terms with its Islamic soul.\nMr. Sharif made his first official trip to India to attend Mr. Gandhi's funeral. He made the most of it, meeting the leader of every major Indian political party, and thus all the potential prime ministers of the country. Islamabad's challenge to India to end hostilities in Kashmir (while giving the people of Kashmir a fair deal) and join hands in developing two of the world's poorest countries is a new one.\nThis new proposal may flummox the hawks in India's foreign policy establishment. But it could also provide the first chance in decades to talk about something other than war."}, {"text": "In the Nation; Kuwait Still Burns\n1991-07-28T05:00:00.000Z\nThose oil wells in Kuwait are still burning -- more of them than at first reported, with unknown final effects, and probably for a longer period than officially projected.\nNot just \"about 500,\" as generally reported, but 732 Kuwaiti oil wells were set afire by retreating Iraqi forces last winter. A Senate subcommittee, chaired by Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, received that hard figure on July 11 from Kuwait's Ambassador to the U.S., Sheik Saud Nasir al-Sabah, and E. L. Shannon Jr., chairman of Santa Fe International, an oil drilling company owned by Kuwait.\nMr. Shannon testified that by July 8, \"some 199 wells had been extinguished or capped,\" which means that more than 500 still were burning four months after the desert war ended.\nIn fact, the overall problem may have gotten worse, owing to huge oil lakes being formed by wells that are still gushing but no longer afire. James George, a former Canadian Ambassador to Kuwait and an environmental scientist who led a Friends of the Earth inspection team to Kuwait in June, told the subcommittee that now these lakes are catching fire, causing more pollution than a well fire, and will be harder to extinguish.\nMr. Shannon said the Kuwaiti Government had set a goal of 500 wells \"secured\" by the end of the year, and all by March 1992. But Mr. George, in much more pessimistic testimony, said his F.O.E. team had concluded that the fires \"will not be controlled for years -- perhaps four or five years -- as Red Adair told the committee a month ago.\" Mr. Adair is one of the world's leading oil-well firefighters.\nBoth Mr. Shannon and Mr. George agreed that the work in Kuwait is being complicated by the hazard of unexploded allied and Iraqi munitions, some of them now submerged in the oil lakes.\nVarious scientific teams have reached differing conclusions as to the regional and global consequences of the fires. Most now believe that they will cause neither a widespread \"nuclear winter\" effect (falling temperatures as smoke blocks the sun's rays) nor a major increase in global warming (from the \"greenhouse effect\" of carbon dioxide emissions).\nBut within those extremes, there's much disagreement. Data are still scarce and there are no useful precedents; the largest previous oilfield blaze -- only five fires -- was in Libya in 1965. Some evidence indicates that the Kuwaiti fires could become a far-reaching environmental catastrophe.\nJohn Horgan of Scientific American has reported that levels of soot -- believed to be from Kuwait -- above the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii were five times higher in March than in the three previous Marches. The Environmental Protection Agency, for unexplained reasons, briefly suppressed this finding.\nBalloon observations at the University of Wyoming, Mr. Horgan reported, suggest that Kuwaiti smoke has passed over the continental U.S. Particle concentrations in the troposphere above Wyoming increased by a factor of 10 or more from early February to late March 1991.\nBy far the most apocalyptic speculation -- much disputed -- is that smoke from Kuwait may have worsened the gigantic typhoon that killed over 100,000 persons in Bangladesh on May 1. This theory holds that the smoke warmed the atmosphere and increased the customary monsoon rains. Tiruvalam Krishnamurti of Florida State University, a monsoon expert, told Mr. Horgan that floods in Bangladesh rose two feet higher than ever before recorded, and that rains after the storm were unusually severe.\nThe visible smoke plume from Kuwait would cover most of the coastal U.S. from New York to Florida. Kuwaiti soot has been detected in northern Japan. Soviet scientists already have measured unprecedented levels of acid rain in regions of the Soviet Union and similar fallout is expected in areas 2,000 kilometers from Kuwait, possibly as far away as China.\nTemperature drops of up to 10 degrees Celsius are predicted for a radius of hundreds of kilometers around Kuwait; drops of 1 or 2 degrees may be felt for 1,000 kilometers. Nearby Bahrain has just had its coolest May in 35 years. These effects could produce crop failures and famine; and soot falling on snowy regions -- already seen in the Himalayas -- may cause rapid melting, followed by flooding.\nIf the fires are extinguished on Kuwait's official schedule, such consequences may be brief and manageable. But suppose the fires burn for years? The cumulative effect would be disastrous."}, {"text": "U.S. Begins Relief Flights to Bangladesh\n1991-05-17T05:00:00.000Z\nThey came from the southeast, just as the cyclone had come: suddenly, noisily and with a tremendous wind that knocked children over and sent clothing flying in every direction.\nThey were helicopters -- giant American CH-53 Sea Stallions -- and they brought food, medicine and hope to Sandwip Island in the Bay of Bengal.\nThe American task force of nearly 8,000 troops began full-fledged operations today with relief flights to Sandwip and is expected to remain for two weeks or more to transport food and medicine to remote parts of the country still suffering from last month's devastating cyclone.\n\"It's good to see these helicopters,\" a relief worker on Sandwip said as he watched volunteers unload hundreds of sacks of rice and five-gallon water containers from a pair of Sea Stallions. \"Most people are eating only one meal a day.\" Among Worst-Hit Areas\nHe estimated that the first day's flight would provide 20 percent of the relief goods needed in the area.\nSandwip was one of the worst-hit areas of Bangladesh, and rough seas have made it difficult to carry supplies to help the hungry and sick survivors of the cyclone. It takes several hours by boat to reach Sandwip from the port of Chittagong, but the giant helicopters made the journey in less than half an hour and were then able to drop goods off at 10 depots in the interior of the island instead of simply along the shore.\nHuge crowds gathered at each of the helicopter landing sites on Sandwip, and Bangladesh soldiers were assigned to wield sticks to keep people away so the helicopters could land and take off safely. People appeared hungry rather than starving, and the atmosphere was one of jubilation. People learned, sometimes the hard way, that the saris and sarongs they wear fly up when the helicopters approach.\nThe helicopters carried 10,000 water containers to Sandwip, along with 10,000 food packages and other supplies such as plastic sheeting to build shelters from the monsoon rains. The American troops did not hand out the goods to individual Bangladeshis, but gave them to the Bangladesh Army and local relief organizations for distribution to the grass-roots level.\nThe main role of the task force appears to be as an efficient mover of goods, using about 30 helicopters and 4 Hovercraft. So far, it seems the two-week mission of the eight-ship task force will not include reconstruction of damaged embankments along the coast or related development work.\n\"We're coming to save lives and restore normalcy, rather than to rebuild,\" said Lieut. Kenneth B. Ross, a spokesman for the military headquarters in Chittagong. He said the task force was relying on the Bangladesh Army to determine which goods most need to be transported to which place.\nMost of the troops on the ships probably will not be involved and may never come ashore. The ships had been returning from the Persian Gulf to California, via the Philippines, when they were diverted to assist relief efforts after the April 30 cyclone.\nAmerican officers estimated that they would be transporting about 100 tons a day of food, medicine and equipment to remote areas, by helicopter and Hovercraft. The task force also expects to begin providing 30,000 gallons daily of drinkable water.\nFrom the brief glimpse afforded by a helicopter ride, Sandwip Island appears to be coming back to life.

The House is developing a more honest fix than the Senate.\nBills to authorize up to 20 additional weeks of benefits are moving quickly in both houses because (1) members want to go on vacation at the end of the week, and (2) the Democratic leadership wants to show concern for victims of the recession, even if they've been slow to do so.\nThe problem is how to pay. Under last year's budget agreement, new spending must be offset by new revenues or by cuts in other programs -- except for emergencies. If there is a genuine emergency, certified by the President, no offset is required. But it's not cricket to use emergency funding as a trick to skirt the pay-as-you-go agreement. The deficit is large enough.\nThe Senate Finance Committee's bill opts for the emergency route. Arguing that President Bush has declared three foreign emergencies this year -- for Operation Desert Storm, for Kurdish refugees and for flood victims in Bangladesh -- the Democrats say it's time he acknowledged an emergency at home. But the Administration says the recession doesn't qualify, especially since the recovery may have already begun.\nA more forthright approach is offered by Representatives Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Thomas Downey of Long Island. Their bill invites Mr. Bush to declare an emergency, but if he won't it lays out a valid alternative: increase the taxes employers pay into the unemployment insurance fund.\nThe insurance system needs more than either bill proposes. It is a smaller safety net than it used to be for several reasons, including stiffer standards adopted to avoid raising the tax. Also, the 1986 tax reforms made jobless benefits fully taxable as income, but made no provision for higher benefits. Alas, the time for fundamental improvements is when the economy is in good shape -- and Congress isn't interested."}, {"text": "CHAOS SLOWS AID TO BANGLADESHIS\n1991-05-15T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen nearly 8,000 American troops arrive in Bangladesh on Wednesday to assist victims of last month's cyclone, they will step into a relief effort hobbled by a lack of coordination and information that is as fundamental as the lack of food and medicine.\nAlong the shore of Chokoria subdistrict in southeastern Bangladesh, villagers wave desperately from the shore and wade out into the water to try to stop relief boats chugging by throughout the day. Villagers say that even though they are on a main channel no Government officials have visited, and that supply deliveries from private organizations have been sporadic and disorganized at best.\nThe troops will not be able to rely on any clear distribution system, nor is there any systematic overall record of which villages have been reached and which have not.\nIn Koraidia, a village in Chokoria, a boat finally dropped off one box of food on Monday -- the first that stranded villagers there had received in three days. Dozens of villagers fought over the food, thrashing each other with remnants of their thatched huts, destroyed by the cyclone.\nLocal relief officials say the flow of supplies, especially medicines, has improved significantly in recent days, partly because of improved weather along the coast. They say that coordination has also improved somewhat, but that distribution is still uneven and that there is no clear system for passing on supplies and information to all villages. Efforts to Rebuild\nMaj. Gen. Henry Stackpole, a Marine officer who is leading the advance military team, met today with President Shahabuddin Ahmed and key Government ministers. He briefed them on the operation, which will be conducted in cooperation with the Bangladeshi military.\nSeveral more American planes carrying supplies arrived today, and five UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters were scheduled to leave on Wednesday to carry advance teams of doctors, engineers and communications experts to some of the worst-hit areas. Seven ships carrying 7,000 troops are expected to arrive Wednesday afternoon off Chittagong, the country's major port, which is still clogged with dozens of sunken and crippled vessels.\nFor all the devastation of the April 30 cyclone, which by the latest official count killed 139,000 people, a two-day journey along the coast and islands found nearly as many signs of rebirth as of death. Fresh graves are common, but thousands of peasant families are already rebuilding their thatched huts and trying to get on with their lives.\nFishermen are out in the channels with their nets, and farmers say they hope to repair damaged dikes within a few weeks, so that they can plant their fields in time for the approaching monsoons. That would enable them to harvest a rice crop late in the year, especially if salt-resistant seeds and other materials can be made available. Waiting for Food\n\"We want to rebuild our houses,\" said Khurshed Alaam Kairbill, a farmer on Kutubdia Island who was asked to name his greatest need. \"We don't just want to wait here to be given relief.\"\nMr. Kairbill spoke in front of the government officeson Kutubdia as three senior officials on an inspection tour conducted a meeting inside. Mr. Kairbill was one of several hundred hungry and anxious peasants who had gathered at the office for assistance, and like others he complained that he was spending his time waiting for food instead of doing productive work.\nCivil authorities and private relief workers say that Government officials are often distributing aid not on the basis of need but along political and personal lines. The Government's aid effort has been modest in comparison with the assistance provided by foreign and local private organizations.\n\"It is a fact, and it is very sad, that they only want to use the aid to advance the interests of their own political party,\" a dismayed civil servant said of the Government effort. \"No one can trust the Government now.\"\nMohammed Ismael, a fisherman in Cox's Bazar whose boat has been hired by the Government to transport relief goods, added, \"Only the military is impartial and distributing the supplies properly.\"\nOpposition political leaders have called for an all-party committee to insure a more equitable distribution of supplies."}, {"text": "New York Bangladeshis Cry for a Battered Land\n1991-05-07T05:00:00.000Z\nMubashir Choudhury takes a break from his job at a Manhattan restaurant at least once a day to pray at the Madina Masjid, a small mosque on the corner of First Avenue and 11th Street. Usually, his thoughts focus on his love of God and his devotion to Islam.\nOn Sunday night, Mr. Choudhury prayed for Bangladesh.\nHe was joined by 15 or so other Bangladeshis, all whispering in Bengali, the language that links them to the millions of people whose lives have been devastated by the cyclone that struck their native country on April 29.\n\"God, help our people,\" Mr. Choudhury said, bowing his head and clasping his hands as he kneeled on the carpeted floor. A Sense of Utter Sadness\nThe cyclone has left many of the tens of thousands of Bangladeshis in the New York area with an almost unbearable sense of sadness. Of all countries, some said, their poor and troubled land could least handle such a calamity.\nIn restaurants in the East Village and on lower Lexington Avenue, in food stores in Jackson Heights, Queens, and in mosques in Brooklyn, Bangladeshis told stories of frantic but unsuccessful attempts to telephone their relatives to learn whether they were still alive.\nMore than a week after the disaster, few people have received news.\n\"I keep trying to call, but there just are no lines,\" said Zebu Nahar Husain, who in the fall left Cox's Bazar, a resort town and one of the places hit hardest by the storm, for New York. She works at Kalustyan's Orient Expert Trading, a store on lower Lexington Avenue that sells Asian and Middle East food.\nMs. Husain, 23 years old, said she feared that her family was suffering or dead. \"I think about them all the time,\" she said. \"I just can't sleep. I stay up every night and I have difficulty working.\" The Next Dangers\nAbsar Chowdhury, 35, who also works at Kalustyan's, said: \"We are all scared because nobody knows who died and who survived. It's getting worse now as the days go on because there will be more casualties from famine and lack of medicine.\"\nMr. Chowdhury's relatives are from Chittagong, the nation's second-largest city, where as many as 90,000 people may have drowned.\nIn Jackson Heights, many Bangladeshis have sought news at the Ganges travel agency, which specializes in booking flights to the Indian subcontinent. But Inayet Rahim, an agent there, has had little to tell them.\n\"We were not prepared for this,\" he said. \"The last time it happened to this extent was so long ago. We felt shocked. A lot of people are trying to go back to the country, but they are not getting any seats because there are so few flights going there.\"\nThe cyclone, in which at least 125,000 people have died, by official count, has led many Bangladeshis, Indians and Pakistanis to band together and send money to survivors.\nOn Sunday, a number of local groups met at the United Nations to form a disaster relief committee that hopes to raise $100,000. Jamshed R. Khan, an officer of Bangladesh Shangshad, a social service group, estimated that more than 50,000 Bangladeshis live in the New York area, many of them recent arrivals.\n\"We just want to help them in any way we can,\" said Mr. Khan, a marketing executive at Mobil Oil. \"We need money and medical supplies. Everybody is very concerned. We see pictures on television, but nobody knows about their families. Even though I have been here for 27 years, my heart is there.\"\nOn Friday, the Muslim sabbath, thousands of Bangladeshis packed into mosques in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. Prayers were offered for those affected by the storm. Some dug into their savings to help.\nBut many Bangladeshi immigrants have low-paying jobs and little money to spare. More than 300 attended prayers on Friday at the Bangladesh Muslim Center at 1013 Church Avenue in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, and $146 was raised.\nFor some, the storm prompted harrowing memories of the destruction wrought by cyclones they had lived through before they left the country.\n\"Even if people live, they live in miserable conditions,\" said Gulam Kibriya, a 46-year-old accountant who came to New York in 1983, after services on Sunday night at the Madina Masjid. \"Everything is scarce. They are helpless. They have no financial or technical resources.\"\nIqbal Hossain, 31, who left Bangladesh in 1989, said he could not help thinking about how his country has been plagued by misfortune for so long.\n\"We just passed a stage where we got rid of a dictator,\" he said, referring to the country's deposed military leader, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad.\n\"We are now a democracy, and then this terrible tragedy happened. We fought so much; we should have time to get ourselves together. But now, everything has been washed away. Now, we have nothing.\""}, {"text": "U.S. Cyclone Relief Forces Reach Bangladesh Port\n1991-05-16T05:00:00.000Z\nEight American ships carrying 7,500 troops arrived off the port of Chittagong today and prepared to use their helicopters and Hovercraft to bolster relief efforts for hundreds of thousands of victims of last month's devastating cyclone.\nAs the operation begins, it appears that the troops will provide an important increment to an already immense relief effort, but will not take charge or make a sudden and overwhelming difference in the way food and medicine are distributed. The troops did not go ashore, and for now the task force's main mission is expected to be as movers for food, medicine and other relief materials to remote areas, like offshore islands, where survivors of the April 30 cyclone have little to eat and often lack shelter and safe water. A few relief flights began today, by helicopters that arrived earlier, but most of the work is scheduled to begin Thursday and to last two weeks.\n\"By and large, what we're going to be doing is moving goods that the Government has identified for us to move,\" said Lieut. Col. James L. Vance, a spokesman for the task force. But he noted that plans were still being refined and adjusted.\n\"We're not taking over this operation,\" he said. \"We're simply augmenting the Government of Bangladesh.\"\nIn addition to the helicopter and Hovercraft crews, medical and engineering specialists will go ashore to assist the relief efforts. But Colonel Vance said the troops would probably transport supplies to local depots rather than hand them out to individual villages. He said it was possible that the majority of the 7,550 marines and sailors on the ships -- those not part of helicopter or Hovercraft crews -- would not even set foot on Bangladesh soil.\nThe ships' 31 helicopters and four air-cushion landing craft, which hover above the ground and can travel over mud flats as well as water, will provide important help to the Government's efforts to reach offshore islands. The Bangladesh Government has only 12 helicopters, although India, Pakistan and other countries have lent additional aircraft, enabling the authorities to launch a total of 326 sorties since the cyclone hit the coast.\n\"We went to Kuwait in the name of liberty, and we've come to Bangladesh in the name of humanity,\" Maj. Gen. Henry Stackpole, leader of the task force, said at a news conference today in Chittagong. He said American advance teams that have visited Kutubdia, Sandwip and other offshore islands have found that people and livestock are dying of diseases caused by a combination of malnutrition and contaminated water.\nThe first priority of the task force will be to deliver food, water and medicine to such hard-hit areas, General Stackpole said.\nOn the mainland, and on parts of offshore islands that are easily accessible by boat, the American task force is likely to have a less noticable effect than on the remote islands. Hundreds of private organizations and tens of thousands of Bangladeshi relief workers are already involved in distributing food and medicine, and trucks and boats are seen everywhere along the roads and water channels of the affected areas.\nThe plight of the cyclone survivors appears to be easing somewhat, and most are getting food and medical help."}, {"text": "BANGLADESH ASKS MORE AID COPTERS\n1991-05-09T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Government appealed to foreign countries again today for more helicopters to augment its efforts to get food, medicine and clothing to survivors of last week's cyclone.\n\"We have at the moment 13 helicopters, and these are going to far-flung areas,\" Information Secretary Manzur-e-Moula said at a news conference.\nHe said Bangladeshi Air Force helicopters, along with three copters from India and two from Pakistan, made a total of 19 relief flights today to southern and southeastern Bangladesh, where more than 125,000 people perished in the cyclone.\n\"We need more helicopters,\" he said. \"Any offer made by any friendly country would be of help to us.\"\nHow much difference 10, 20 or even 100 additional helicopters would make is uncertain. 10 Million Affected\nAs many as 10 million people live in the cyclone-affected region, according to the Government, which says it is still trying to assess how many people need help and of what kind.\nBangladesh, with 115 million people, is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita income of about $170 a year. Communications in most of the country are tentative in the best of times. After cyclones, the task of assessing needs and reaching victims is even more difficult.\nSome foreign aid donors question how much a few more helicopters -- or even a few more squadrons -- would help.\n\"Supplying helicopters is an option that we are working on urgently, but our main objective is to make the most constructive contribution that we can,\" Richard Boucher, a State Department deputy spokesman, said in Washington.\nMr. Moula, the Information Secretary, said he could not say how many people were reached by Wednesday's relief efforts, which included truck convoys as well as helicopters.\nBut he said the helicopters had distributed 50 tons of material, including rice, molasses, bread and drinking water.\nMany cyclone victims are stranded on islands surrounded by salt water in the Bay of Bengal or on land where the only water is dirty with mud and polluted by decaying bodies of people and animals. British Sending Help\nLONDON, May 8 (Reuters) -- Britain said today that it was sending two helicopters and a naval supply ship to Bangladesh to help cyclone relief operations, and it announced an additional $3.5 million in aid.\nLynda Chalker, the Overseas Development Minister, said in a statement to Parliament that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Fort Grange, which helped supply the allied fleet during the Persian Gulf war, and two Sea King helicopters would join relief efforts.

H. M. Ershad in a popular uprising on Dec. 6, will elect a Parliament of330 members. About 96 parties have been registered, fielding 2,774 candidates.\nBut after the voting, there are many political and institutional uncertainties in a nation of 114 million people whose historical progression The New Nation newspaper described today as \"wading through a river of blood.\"\nThe leaders of the two major contending parties are women, Sheik Hasina Wazed of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh National Party. Both of them -- like Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, Indira Gandhi of India and Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka -- are the political heirs ofpowerful men who led their countries.\nThe party in third place is thought to be the Jamaat-e-Islami, which would like to tighten Islamic religious practice in this culturally colorful and relaxed Bengali nation.\nSheik Hasina's father was Sheik Mujibur Rahman, the country's first Prime Minister, brought to power in 1971 by the Indian Army.\nMrs. Zia -- or Begum Zia, as she is known in South Asia -- is the widow of Gen. Ziaur Rahman, President of Bangladesh until his assassination in 1981.\nThe Awami League is favored to win the election, for which only 298 seats are actually being contested onWednesday. Two constituencies will be polled later because candidates have died; 30 seats in this Muslim-majority nation are reserved for women, nominated later by the winners.\nBecause Sheik Hasina and Begum Zia, who lead alliances supported by splinter parties, have to a large extent been trying to burnish the images of their assassinated predecessors, the campaign has been preoccupied with the past, not the future of one of the world's poorest countries.\nIn speeches marked by personal insults and mud-slinging, Sheik Hasina has portrayed President Zia and President Ershad as all unbroken military rule. Begum Zia has dwelt on corruption and the autocratic use of power, both hallmarks of the Sheik Mujib era."}, {"text": "No Sovereignty For Suffering\n1991-05-12T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen U.S. forces vio lated Iraqi sovereignty crossing a border without permission -- to care for the suffering Kurds, Washington committed a constructive act with tremendous and unforeseeable consequences. \nThis bold deed, arising from a powerful humanitarian impulse, expresses \"the right to interfere,\" a principle advanced by medical relief organizations for years. We believe this intervention will have greater historical importance than the coalition's war against Iraq.\nThe right to interfere, as defined by Doctors of the World, the French humanitarian group, means that a request from those who are suffering is sufficient to justify crossing a boundary without authorization from a nation's leaders; the humanitarian imperative takes precedence over noninterference and sovereignty. \nThis universal approach originated in 1968 in the Nigerian civil war. French medical volunteers with the International Committee of the Red Cross in the breakaway region of Biafra were so repelled by the atrocities against civilians that they violated their contract with the Red Cross and spoke out publicly. In this confrontation of state vs. humanitarian interests, the philosophy and practice of relief groups of French doctors were born. \nIn the past 20 years, organizations like Doctors of the World, Doctors Without Borders and International Medical Aid have helped all over the world, including in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Cambodia, El Salvador, Romania and South Africa, with or without official permission. In Ethiopia, the authorities ejected medical volunteers, who then returned clandestinely to continue their work.\nThe impossibility of ignoring the Kurds' desperation led the U.S. to commit an extraordinary act. While humanitarian motives have often been used to clothe political and military objectives, the U.S. action was not planned; rather, an ungovernable flood of compassion in response to scenes of human suffering gave Washington no option but to respond, despite Iraqi protests, Turkish hesitation and U.N. uncertainty. \nThe world may now be ready to recognize a need and a right to intervene on humanitarian grounds across all borders, as in the Sudan, where millions are in danger of starving but where officials have obstructed relief, or in Bangladesh, where the Government has been overwhelmed by the devastation of natural disaster.\nInterdependence in economics, politics and health is stimulating new thinking about global \"order\" and the responsibility of individuals, nations and the U.N. Meanwhile, in Kurdistan and around the world, the courageous work of humanitarian organizations is pushing forward the ethics and logic of the right to intervene -- to help and to bear witness -- as new connections among peoples and nations are being forged."}, {"text": "Bangladeshis Keep the Hard Edge Off Islam\n1991-03-06T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen a fundamentalist Islamic party won enough seats in elections for Parliament recently to be courted as a governing coalition partner, many Bangladeshis began to think again about the relationship between their Bengali culture and their religion.\nAmong Muslims, Bangladesh occupies a special place, somewhere between the Arab world and the Muslims of the equatorial Malay archipelago and Indonesia. Though part of Pakistan from 1947 until 1971, Bangladesh, where 85 percent of the people are Muslim, feels little kinship for the harsher, more uncompromising, frontier brand of Islam found there, in Afghanistan and Iran.\nThe cultural links that are most important to many Bangladeshis are those with the Indian state of West Bengal, where music and poetry flourish. Rabindranath Tagore, an Indian writer and educator known throughout the world, is a cultural hero.\nThe kinship stops at culture, however. Though the Indian Army intervened to give Bangladesh independence in 1971, there is no love lost on India among most people here, who see their neighbor as a big, dominating, interfering bully.\n\"We were grateful to the Indians for what they did in 1971,\" said Jahanara Iman, author of a personal account of the Bangladesh independence movement, \"Of Blood and Fire.\" A Dialect of Their Own\n\"But we do not like them to play the part of big brother,\" she said. Mrs. Iman, who lost a husband and son in 1971, also said Bangla, which is what Bangladeshis call their version of the Bengali language, is drifting away from the Bengali of Calcutta, in some of the same ways that British and American English have diverged.On the whole, Bengali culture and Bengalis are indomitable, Mrs. Iman said. The color and spirit of Bengali arts and Bengali life are striking. The beginning of this new Islamic year, for instance, is given over to prayer and fireworks.\n\"We are Bengalis first, and Muslims after,\" a social worker said as women lined up for birth-control advice in a poor neighborhood of the capital. When women are mistreated or neglected, a doctor added, the causes are more likely to be found in South Asian social attitudes, not religion.\n\"I would have thought that this would be the last country in the world to become fundamentalist,\" said Shahidul Alam, a leading photographer who often tours the country, taking pictures of Bangladeshi life for exhibitions in Dhaka.He ranks himself among those concerned at the intrusion of Islam into politics, symbolized by the growth of Jamaat-e-Islami, a party whose campaign posters promised to bring the people back to Islamic teaching and Muslim law.\nAs he searches the countryside for subjects, Mr. Alam says, he is seeing more women covering their heads. Sectarian Relations Still Good\n\"People are more bold in telling women how to dress, or how not to go out alone in a rickshaw,\" he said.\nMuslim fundamentalism, helped by a 1988 law making Islam the state religion, has so far not seriously disturbed relations with the large Hindu minority, or with the much smaller group of Christians.\nIn a rural town in the forest highlands north of Dhaka, Subodh Chandra Sarkar, a community leader and a Hindu, said his family had been living peacefully among Muslims for generations. Only recently, he said, were there a few disturbances, prompted by reports of Indian Hindus attacking the Babri mosque in the sacred city of Ayodhya.\nThe most serious area of tension in Bangladesh is in the Chittagong Hills, where people, most of whom are Buddhists, are being pushed off land by Muslims from the lowlands.\nBangladesh, with perhaps 114 million people, is one of the world's most densely populated countries, and the movement into the hills has a certain inevitability. Militant Islamic groups based in the city of Chittagong are vexing the situation, many Bangladeshis say."}, {"text": "Cyclone in Bangladesh Tests the Fragile New Democracy\n1991-05-19T05:00:00.000Z\nThe destitute victims of last month's cyclone may lack food, water and shelter, but they have one asset that is often wanting in developing countries: the vote.\nBut while Bangladesh now enjoys a democratic government, elected in February after a decade of autocratic military rule, the fragile new leadership has to confront not only the normal challenges of transition to democracy but also the immense task of reconstruction.\nThere has been some criticism of the Government's handling of disaster relief, and a number of Bangladeshis and foreign diplomats see a risk that the public might eventually go further and blame not only the ruling party but also democracy itself. 1970 Cyclone Recalled\n\"This democracy is in its infancy,\" said Qazi Faruque Ahmed, executive director of Proshika, a Bangladeshi development organization. \"This has to be understood, so that criticisms are not destructive of the democratic process itself.\"\nThere is a precedent for a cyclone destroying governments as well as towns. After the 1970 cyclone, which killed 300,000 to 500,000 people, there was widespread indignation at the failure of the Pakistani Government, which then ruled Bangladesh, to provide much assistance. This indignation was one factor in the war for independence a year later.\nThese days, there still seems to be a tremendous support for democracy, and enthusiasm for Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, a woman who in the 1980's came to symbolize opposition to autocratic military rule. While few people will absolutely exclude the possibility of a military coup, most believe it is unlikely any time soon.\nYet Mrs. Zia's mandate, while considerable, may rest in part on unreasonable expectations that a democracy will bring immediate economic fruits. After Bangladesh was formed in 1971, the leadership also began with a tremendous amount of legitimacy and support, but this quickly degenerated because of disorder and economic difficulties. 'They Want Bread and Butter!'\n\"She has received a very big challenge,\" said A. R. Shams-ud Doha, a former Foreign Minister and the editor of a weekly newspaper, referring to the cyclone. \"Her reputation, and that of her government, are at stake based on how she manages the damage control.\"\n\"The people on the streets are rumbling,\" Mr. Doha added, in an appraisal that was more pessimistic than some others. \"You think they wanted just democratic elections? They want bread and butter! And so far they don't see anything outstanding as a result of the democratic process.\"\nIn interviews along the southeast coast, many villagers criticized the Government's relief efforts and said the mood was running against Mrs. Zia. But those are a tiny fraction of the entire nation's voters, and it is possible that in other areas, citizens are impressed by what they see on television of Mrs. Zia's tours of the disaster areas.\nA Western diplomat said that it was too soon to judge the impact of the cyclone on the political process, and that critics might forget their initial annoyance if in the end the relief work was carried out efficiently. An Exuberant Democracy\nFor all the challenges, what is sometimes most striking about Bangladesh's democracy is not its fragility but its exuberance. Although only a quarter of the population is literate, Bangladesh has 79 daily newspapers that support competing political parties and points of view. And even remote villagers who have no home or education often seem to have strong political views.\nBecause of illiteracy, the parties are best-known by their symbols: a boat, a candle, a rickshaw, even an umbrella. These symbols are painted everywhere, and the opposition parties have been mounting their own relief efforts.\nFor example, Akhtaruzzaman Chowdhury, an opposition member of Parliament from the port of Chittagong, said that in his constituency he had spent seven times as much as the central government on relief."}, {"text": "Former Bangladeshi President's Trial Delayed\n1991-02-17T05:00:00.000Z\nThe trial of the ousted President, H.

The judge said Mr. Ershad must be brought to court on Wednesday.\nJudge Habibullah granted the delay after Sidtho Barua, a policeman guarding the former President, told the tribunal, \"Ershad is not in a position to move out of his confinement because of his sickness.\n\"The former President is suffering from asthma, hypertension and high blood pressure. Doctors are yet to examine him.\"\nMr. Ershad's lawyer, Kazi Shahadat Hossain, told the court, \"The former President is totally shattered and suffering from nervousness.\"\nMr. Hossain sought a week's delay in the tribunal's proceedings.\nThe police said they had found eight unlicensed weapons at Mr. Ershad's presidential residence after his arrest on Dec. 12, six days after he resigned from office.\nThe Government contends that at least two revolvers found are of such high caliber that even presidents cannot hold them without a license.\nIf convicted of the weapons charges, Mr. Ershad could be sentenced to life imprisonment."}, {"text": "Asians, Short of Labor, Ease Migration Curbs\n1991-10-30T05:00:00.000Z\nEast Asian countries, finding that economic growth is being constricted by serious labor shortages, are easing curbs on foreign workers.\nMalaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore have announced measures to allow employers to recruit more workers, mainly from Asian nations with large labor surpluses, such as Indonesia, China, the Philippines, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.\nTrade and investment links between the countries of East Asia have expanded rapidly in past five years.

Even so, there is also a growing shortage of technical workers and professionals, such as engineers and managers.\nHowever, opposition from labor unions and government fears of importing social problems are likely to limit the liberalization of foreign labor laws.\nOfficials in a number of countries are concerned that importing low-cost labor will slow the development of advanced technology by preserving outdated, labor-intensive industries.\nIn Singapore - where there are about 300,000 foreign workers in a labor force of 1.3 million - the government has said it will allow companies short of workers to bring in more foreigners, but only if they pay a per capita levy to the state that is substantially higher than the existing fee.\nWarning that dependence on foreign workers will not be allowed to increase indefinitely, Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore's minister for trade and industry, said companies relying heavily on imported labor \"must feel pressure to look for alternatives,\" either by automating or moving part of their operations to countries with lower labor costs.\nSanjoy Chowdhury, senior regional economist in the Singapore office of Merrill Lynch, said that the rapid growth of intra-Asian trade and investment had been induced primarily by market forces.\nHowever, \"cross-border labor flows involve more sensitive political and social issues, and thus probably have to be managed more closely\" by governments, he added.\nWhen Malaysia announced a substantial easing of restraints on foreign labor in the plantation, construction and manufacturing sectors this month, Ghafar Baba, the deputy prime minister, said the aim was to legalize all foreign workers in the country to monitor their movements and ensure they received the same pay as Malaysians.\nThere are already 134,000 registered foreign laborers in Malaysia.\nWhile Malaysian employers complain of an acute labor shortage in almost all sectors of the economy, Malaysian union leaders assert that an uncontrolled flood of cheap Indonesian labor is perpetuating low wage levels.\nVethamuthu David, secretary-general of the Malaysian Trades Union Congress, said there were about 1 million Indonesians working illegally in Malaysia, which has a population of 18 million.\nHowever, Megat Junid Megat Ayob, the Malaysian deputy home affairs minister, said there were only about 60,000 illegal workers from Indonesia and a similar number from South Asia.\nIllegal Indonesian immigrants are widely blamed in Malaysia for a rising crime rate.\nPresident Roh Tae Woo of South Korea recently issued an order allowing companies to employ foreign workers openly for the first time. His action followed complaints from business leaders that labor shortages were undermining the competitiveness of exports.\nSeoul officials said that companies would be able to increase the number of foreigners they hire to as much as 6 percent of their total work force. In most cases, foreigners in South Korea are employed legally only as trainees.\nGovernment figures show that about 20,000 foreigners, mostly from Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Philippines, are illegally hired in South Korea.\nIn Taiwan, there are estimated to be a similar number of illegal workers. Earlier this year, about 30,000 foreigners, mainly from Southeast Asian countries, were deported for working illegally in Taiwan.\nRecently, however, the Taipei government said that to ease a labor shortage it was ending a long-standing ban on foreign workers."}, {"text": "Disaster Relief Proposal Worries Third World\n1991-11-13T05:00:00.000Z\nA Western proposal that the United Nations appoint a senior official, with $50 million in ready cash at his disposal, to coordinate the world's response in floods, famines and other natural disasters is provoking debate at this year's General Assembly, where developing countries fear it could give foreigners a pretext for meddling in their internal political affairs.\nThe plan for a disaster relief coordinator was first proposed by the European Community this year and endorsed by the United States and Canada in July at the summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies.\nIt reflects a widespread view among these countries, which provide most of the world's disaster aid, that United Nations and other relief agencies preformed poorly during the Kurdish crisis in Iraq and in recent emergencies in Bangladesh and the Horn of Africa.\nOver the last 20 years more than three million people have been killed by natural disasters and some 800 million made homeless, more than 90 percent of them in the world's poorest countries.\nIn a new study of existing arrangements for dealing with emergencies, Sir Brian Urquhart and Erskine Childers, former senior United Nations officials, drew a picture of a capricious, rivalry-torn mechanism that they described as \"less the product of logic than historical accumulation.\"\n\"Far too often, thousands who are starving and uprooted in one part of the world receive the bare minimum of relief and succor, while aid pours forth for those who are suffering at a focus of international power politics and media attention,\" they concluded.\nA single high-level aid coordinator could be expected to reduce this disparity and would also be well placed to prevent the kind of political abuse of emergency relief that has occurred in many developing countries in recent years.\nThe Governments of war-torn Ethiopia, the Sudan and Iraq have all sought to use foreign aid as a weapon, withholding supplies from those they consider disloyal but lavishing them on friends.\nThe idea that the world should put a single official in charge of all disaster relief operations has drawn support from many sources.\nIn a report to this year's General Assembly, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar supported the proposal, and both houses of the United States Congress also backed the idea in the foreign aid bills they adopted this year.\nBut in two days of General Assembly debate here recently, the response of the third world was lukewarm at best and shot through with suspicion and sometimes outright hostility.\nSpeaker after speaker welcomed the $50 million fund Western countries want to establish for quick relief. But they cautioned the General Assembly against giving relief agencies any automatic right to intervene in disaster areas that would place them beyond local control, insisting they may operate in a country only at the invitation of its government.\nSpeaking for the Group of 77, as the developing countries call themselves, Ghana's representative, Kofi N. Awoonor, warned that \"respect for sovereignty is not an idle stipulation which can be rejected outright in the name of even the most noble gestures.\"\nHe added, \"The United Nations must not be commandeered into forming an assistance brigade that will deliver its gifts by coercion.\"\nMost Western countries want such a right of humanitarian intervention, but they know the developing world would block any attempt to write it into international law through a resolution of the General Assembly.\nIn 1988 the General Assembly adopted a resolution saying affected governments had the \"primary role\" in organizing disaster relief but urging them to cooperate with international relief agencies.\nLast year it went a step further by telling governments for the first time that they should also organize \"relief corridors\" so that food and medicine can be distributed easily and safely to endangered civilians, especially when they are caught up in civil wars."}, {"text": "In Japan, Bias Is an Obstacle Even for the Ethnic Japanese\n1991-11-13T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen Japan opened its shores last year to a flood of immigrants from Brazil and Peru, few adjustment problems were expected. After all, the newcomers were Japanese, or at least descendants of Japanese who had sought opportunities in South America earlier this century.\nNow Japanese have discovered that while the immigrants may look familiar, they act like foreigners. They talk more noisily than native-born Japanese do, and greet each other with laughter and embraces. They have trouble with the language. And they complain about their problems. The Samba in Tokyo\n\"The people of Japan do not respect us,\" said Roberto Ishizuka, a 26-year-old former automobile worker in Sao Paulo who works six long days a week making car seats at a factory here in the region west of Tokyo. \"The Japanese treat us like some kind of an inferior race.\"\nIn Japan these days, Portuguese-language radio programs and newspapers have multiplied, offering news and music from Brazil and advice on problems in Japan. There was even a recent Brazilian street festival flavored with samba and salsa in Tokyo.\nAt the Tia Maria restaurant here, a couple of dozen Brazilians of Japanese descent were enjoying steaming bowls of feijoada, drinking Brazilian beer and reading newspapers in Portuguese. A sign on the wall warned people to disperse in the late evenings, as requested by the police.\nDespite sometimes back-breaking work in foundries, factories and construction sites, life on the whole has been good for the newcomers, who can make $2,000 a month and send half of it home. Often they live in company-owned dormitories and are bused to their 14-hour-a-day jobs.\nBut the immigrants say they suffer discrimination in stores and restaurants, citing a story of one department store near here that once had a loudspeaker announcement that a group of them had entered and the clerks should be on guard.\nAnother major problem, workers and Government officials say, is that employers usually pay no health or welfare benefits, leaving workers helpless when injured by molten metal or a sharp blade on the job.\nUnscrupulous recruiting agents siphon off their wages, they say, and make sweeping promises about jobs that prove false.\n\"The people over here think Brazilians are living in Brazil like wild Indians,\" said Miyako Clemente, who works at an auto-parts company. \"Sometimes I can feel my roots here, and I want to learn and write Japanese. But sometimes it makes me desperate, and I feel like I want to get out.\" Immigrants Total 150,000\nIn a turbulent world where millions flee oppression and starvation and migrate to other countries, the 150,000 people of Japanese descent looking for work in their ancestral land may seem like a trickle. But it marks a break with decades of Japanese refusal to let in unskilled foreigners.\nNot that the need has not been great. Employers universally complain that younger Japanese in a newly affluent society no longer want to do dirty, difficult or dangerous work, and factories, restaurants and shops often seem desperate to fill jobs.\nIn recent years, many of those jobs have gone to Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Thais and other Asians who come to Japan on tourist visas and remain illegally while the immigration authorities look the other way. Estimates are that more than 100,000 illegal Asian immigrants work in Japan.\nBut Parliament, worried that the country might become like France or Germany, flooded by foreigners with customs looked on as strange by the native-born majority, enacted tough new curbs on immigration of unskilled people two years ago, and the police began expelling the Asians. Law Changed for Descendants\nThen Japan seemed to discover another pool of workers, descendants of its own people. Last year laws were changed to allow in any foreigner with parents or grandparents in Japan, and the number of workers fleeing the troubled economies of Brazil and Peru rose sharply.\nCritics say those policies reflect the latent racism of Japan, which they accuse of turning its back on millions of people desperate for work on their own continent.\n\"Japan feels it has to do something about its labor shortage,\" said Kyoko Yotsuya, a volunteer with the Seirei Social Welfare Community, a Christian group here. \"But they're afraid that if they open the doors to anyone, there'll be chaos. So they only want certain kinds of people.\"\nThe reactions of native-born Japanese to the Brazilians seem to involve class considerations as much as racial ones. Americans of Japanese descent, for instance, say they are not looked down on, perhaps because most of them are not here to do factory work. Dress and Act Differently\nThe Brazilians, when they arrive and often long afterward, usually speak no Japanese. And they say the native Japanese can often tell they are Brazilians just from the way they dress or act, even before they open their mouths.\nIndeed, anyone living in Japan is so aware of the polite and aloof way that Japanese deal with each other in public that it was often startling to see people in Hamamatsu embracing each other noisily in public, until one realized that they were Brazilian and not Japanese.\nThe first Japanese emigrated to Latin America in the first decade of this century, finding work at coffee and cotton plantations. Later waves worked in factories and raised children who achieved success and prominence, like President Alberto Fujimori of Peru.\nBut the last couple of years have been troubled ones for the economies of Latin America, and now a large percentage of Japanese descendants, the overwhelming majority from Brazil, have come here for work. When they get into trouble, it is the Brazilian Embassy, not the Japanese authorities, that they turn to. 'Expected to Be Japanese'\n\"Somehow, Japan expected them to be Japanese,\" a Brazilian Embassy official in Tokyo said. \"It's been a kind of shock, not only for Japan but for our people. It's harder on them than it is on the rest of us foreigners because there are different expectations for them.\"\nJapanese officials maintain that the immigrants were not brought in to fill jobs, per se, but only to visit their families.\n\"There is a demand for foreign workers, but we did not change the law for that,\" said Kei Ogiso, an official at the immigration bureau of the Justice Ministry.\nThe Government, meanwhile, has tried to accommodate the new immigrants, establishing a dozen centers in central Japan to assist foreign laborers and tell them of their rights. Brazil plans to open two consulates in areas populated by the immigrants.\n\"We are developing necessary protections for them,\" said Kouhei Nagashima, assistant director of the consular and migration policy division at the Foreign Ministry. \"Of course, it is not yet sufficient. But the problem has grown so quickly, we cannot be expected to solve it right away.\""}, {"text": "The Wettest Place on Earth\n1991-04-21T05:00:00.000Z\nCHASING THE MONSOON \nBy Alexander Frater.273 pp. New York:Alfred A. Knopf. $21.\nEvery year on the first of June the monsoon is expected to hit the far southwestern corner of India. In 1987 it was a day late. As the rains came swirling onto the beach at Cochin, Alexander Frater witnessed an extraordinary sight. A group of men in business suits and ladies in silk saris and high heels rushed to meet it with outstretched arms. They were executives from a mysterious organization called the Spices Board. Soaked and laughing, they clutched one another against the buffeting wind and waves, and one woman shouted to him: \"Paradise will be like this!\"\n\"Chasing the Monsoon\" is packed with such bizarre encounters and adventures as this. But even though Mr. Frater's journey across India is a cathartic one, a rediscovery, he was not a child of the British raj (he was born in 1937 on an island in the South Pacific). Nor do \nyou \nhave to be a child of the raj to enjoy this delightful, witty and unusual travel book, full of humorous perceptions about modern India and its inescapable links with the past, which, in the case of Cochin, include the landing of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in the 16th century and the first arrival, in A.D. 52, of the Jews (whose few descendants still live there). \nMr. Frater, a columnist for The Observer in London, was brought up with great rains. Paama, the island where he was born, had its share of hurricanes, and thus his father, the only doctor within a 1,000-mile radius, became an enthusiast for weather, just as his grandfather, an eccentric missionary on another island, had become an expert on volcanoes. Hanging above the boy's bed was a lurid Edwardian print of tigers and Pygmy hunters in sheeting rain, titled \"Cherrapunji, Assam: The Wettest Place on Earth.\" It had been given to Mr. Frater's parents as a wedding present by one Wapshot, a Glaswegian missionary who lived in Cherrapunji, the mountainous spot that is beset regularly by the eastern arm of the monsoon crossing the Bay of Bengal and thus has been drenched by as much 264 inches of rain in a single month. The memory of this picture was the impulse for Mr. Frater's chase, with Cherrapunji as his final destination. \nFor travelers, English as a common language is a useful legacy from the British. Just as the British took and adapted many Indian words and phrases (which were jokingly known as Hobson-Jobson), bringing amusement to some Indians, so the English that Indians speak occasionally has nuances that seem odd or even comic to us. Mr. Frater has a wonderful ear for these and he presents them in a deadpan way that is never in the least patronizing. \nBureaucracy is another legacy from the British, though not so welcome to travelers. Indians have become the bureaucrats of the bureaucrats. In Mr. Frater's case the frustrations centered on getting an entry permit for Cherrapunji, which was an area threatened by terrorist attacks from people opposing Bangladeshi immigration. Mr. Frater also had to get used to planes leaving hours or a day late, or even before the scheduled time. This news would be nonchalantly conveyed to him by a bored clerk who might offer him a cup of tea as consolation. India, Mr. Frater says, taught him a passive acceptance of the inevitable, and that made him feel \"faintly uneasy.\"\nTraveling along the Malabar Coast from Trivandrum to Bombay, he met people who regarded the monsoon as heralding a period of rejoicing and renewal and those who believed it to have healing and aphrodisiac qualities. Goa was a great place for monsoon parties. Hostesses known as water nymphs were imported from Bombay. \"Get wet in Goa!\" ran the ads. Visitors had to wear garlands, drink coconut wine and the juice of mangoes, \"the classic fruit of the monsoon.\" Power failures and flooded roads were all part of the fun. Rich Arabs came to Bombay to sit in the rain for a week. Sometimes there were anxieties about monsoons being late. Then ragas had to be sung and astrologers and rainmakers consulted. In one place, to appease the rain god, there were weddings of donkeys, dressed in bridal attire. In another there were dark rumors of child sacrifices. Mr. Frater was even offered a glass of fresh cow's urine to help restore his energy. He declined.\nMr. Frater discovered, however, that even in a country so utterly dependent on rain -- where no rain would mean famine -- the advent of the rains could also mean misery to the poor living without shelter or in shacks in huge cities like Bombay and Calcutta. Yet, like so many visitors to Calcutta, Mr. Frater found a weird sort of gaiety there, as though the inhabitants were expecting the apocalypse and determined to get the best out of every passing day. As a pedestrian one had to beware of manholes in Calcutta during monsoons, when their covers were removed. As a clerk at Calcutta's Dum Dum Airport said, there were still people missing after the freak monsoon of 1986: \"Plop! Gone, swept down into the sewers. To this day their numbers are not known.\"\nThe red tape Mr. Frater encountered in Delhi when he tried to get a permit to travel in Cherrapunji was so appalling that he had to fly back briefly to London for help. At last the permit arrived, but it was good for only three days, and he had to spend one of them marooned in Calcutta. Even then, when Mr. Frater arrived in Assam, he was nearly imprisoned as an illegal immigrant. And Cherrapunji turned out to be a dismal place, with rusted corrugated roofs, hostile inhabitants and a British cemetery with graves of young men marked \"Died by his own hand.\" But he had finally completed a personal pilgrimage, one that his long dead father had also yearned to make.\nThroughout the book there are flashbacks to the author's South Pacific days, with marvelous stories about his old grandfather who believed in the Great Flood and who gave film stars' names -- Greta Garbo, Betty Grable, Carmen Miranda -- to local volcanoes. Mr. Frater also tells of a seedy Indian hotel that reminded him of another hotel in Denmark where he was telephoned about the death of his mother, who had wanted to go once more to Paama before she died. Thus, on leaving Cherrapunji the author suddenly realized the real point of his journey. Following the monsoon had taken him backward as well as forward in time. The death of a second parent inevitably places one in the firing line. \"It is the moment when we finally grow up,\" he writes. \"The rains had helped me with that. I felt younger, stronger, better, curiously at peace. . . . I had been rewarded in the way that traditionally [the monsoon] was supposed to reward everyone.\"\nHe left Assam in a plane shuddering and tossing in the storm. Even the stewardess cried out. A slightly chastening but appropriate end to a brilliantly amusing book."}, {"text": "Political Memo; Democrats Find Issue: Helping the Unemployed\n1991-07-31T05:00:00.000Z\nAfter months of agonizing, the Democrats have found a way of translating their talk about helping the middle class into a serious legislative proposal: to provide more unemployment benefits for people who have been out of work more than half a year.\nThey are rushing to send a bill to President Bush before they go on vacation this weekend, but may still fail at that. Senate Republicans, who could thwart them, are uncertain how obstructive to be because they recognize the issue could put their party and President Bush at a disadvantage.\nFor the Democrats, this is not only an issue that helps burnish their own image as the party that cares about people. It also provides a rare opportunity for them to approach a domestic problem in a way intended to dent President Bush's greatest strength: his handling of foreign affairs. A 'Dire Emergency'\nTheir most telling argument, made today as the House Ways and Means Committee approved the $6.4 billion bill on a near party-line vote, was that helping unemployed Americans was a \"dire emergency.\" .\nUrging the committee to approve the bill, Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Suffolk, said the plight of Americans who had exhausted the regular 26 weeks of benefits was \"every bit the emergency that the flood in Bangladesh was,\" adding, \"It is every bit the emergency that the Kurds in the mountains of Turkey were.\"\nDespite an unusually high degree of coordination between Senate and House leaders, the Democrats may fail in their effort to get both chambers to agree on a bill and send it to President Bush before going on vacation this weekend.\nThat depends on how hard Senate Republicans are prepared to fight the measure and risk the reputation of having stalled aid for more than a million unemployed workers. (No one has a close guess on just how many would be helped.) Some Senate Republicans would just as soon put Mr. Bush on the spot, and veto the measure if he wants, rather than take the heat themselves.\nSenator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, has made it clear he will delay any votes until after the release of July unemployment totals on Friday, at the earliest. Today he exchanged threats with the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, about how long, if it seemed necessary, each could keep the Senate in session past the planned weekend adjournment.\nBut Mr. Dole's position is undercut by the fact that nine Senate Republicans have already announced their support for the bill before the Senate, proposed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat. The measure would pay for extended benefits by declaring the situation a budget emergency. Appeal to Lawmakers\nTheir reasoning is simple. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi said today that although the unemployment level in his state is 10 percent, it does not qualify for extended benefits under current law. A spokesman for Senator John Seymour of California said state officials had told him that the bill would provide benefits for 550,000 Californians.\nOne reason this issue appeals to Democrats and concerns Republicans is that, as Mr. Downey put it today, unemployment compensation is a \"middle-class entitlement program.\"\nAbout 40 percent of the unemployed are eligible for benefits, but they are the ones who have generally stable employment records. Isaac Shapiro, a senior research analyst at the Center for Budget and Priorities, a research organization here, said recent studies have shown that few of the long-term unemployed were below the poverty line before they lost their jobs, and that three-fifths of them come from families with incomes from $15,000 to $50,000.\nDemocrats have talked and talked about how they must identify with the middle class to reclaim voters lost to the Republicans on pocketbook issues and their hopes of legislation on income taxes and health insurance follow that desire.\nUnder current law, extended benefits are available in only three states, Alaska, Maine and Rhode Island, and in Puerto Rico. Half of the cost of the benefits is paid by the states and half by the Federal Government.\nBoth Senate and House bills would have the Federal Government pay the whole bill and change the standard of measurement for determining when extended benefits are paid.\nWorkers in every state would be eligible for some additional benefits, a device that gives every lawmaker some reason to support a bill.\nBenefits now average $160 per week nationally and vary greatly from state to state. The highest state average last year was $217 a week in Massachusetts. The lowest was $79 a week in Louisiana.\nThe House bill is permanent legislation; the Senate's is temporary, and costs slightly less at $5.8 billion.\nEach would pay the bill by declaring an emergency and increasing the deficit.\nUntil today, the House bill would have given Mr. Bush the option of choosing deficit financing or imposing higher payroll taxes on employers. But House Democrats, afraid to be caught voting for any kind of tax, backed off that option and amended the bill on a voice vote in committee so that the bill, like the Senate bill, now relies on deficit financing.\nTo Democratic contentions that the plight of the unemployed was a real emergency, Representative Bill Gradison, Republican of Ohio, insisted their approach showed, \"We're not serious about deficit reduction.\" He said the bill would \"punch a 6-billion-dollar hole in the budget agreement.\"\nBut only one Democrat, Representative Don J. Pease of Ohio, voted with Mr. Gradison. Two Republicans, Representatives Raymond J. McGrath of New York and Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut, voted for the bill. The vote was 24 to 12.\nThe House is expected to vote on the bill and pass it by a large margin on Thursday. Bush May Play Role\nThat will leave final passage up to Senate Republicans. Friday's unemployment numbers, and whether they go up or down from the June 7.0 percent total will matter to them. It would also be surprising if they did not ask President Bush, who will return from the Soviet Union on Thursday night, to play a role.\nUntil now, only only Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Lynn Martin, the Secretary of Labor, were raising the argument about the deficit and talking about the likelihood that recovery would make more benefits unnecessary.\nSome Republicans who were deeply involved in last year's budget negotiations take those arguments seriously -- especially Mr. Gradison, Mr. Dole and Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, ranking minority member of the Budget Committee.\nBut others, like Eddie Mahe, a prominent Republican consultant, consider those arguments politically foolish. he said it was not only political, but also proper, to help the unemployed. But if Mr. Bush opposed the measure, he said, it would perpetuate the image of \"Republicans acting like Scrooge, Democrats caring about people.\"\nAnd Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina had a succinct piece of advice for his party on how to handle the Bentsen bill.\n\"Punt,\" he said."}, {"text": "Heir to Tragedy; India Confronts Gandhi's Death And Flawed Legacy\n1991-05-26T05:00:00.000Z\nWHEN Rajiv Gandhi reached out to meet the people on a tropical night last week in southern India, and was instead killed by a bomb, he was nearing the end of an intense political campaign built on the theme of stability. Only the Congress Party, he had said over and over again, could bring the country unity and peace.\nKashmir in revolt, Punjab in distress, an economy in peril, violence in the streets -- all these, Mr. Gandhi told election rallies from the Himalayas to the Kerala shore, had been caused by non-Congress Governments in just the 18 months since the voters turned him out of the Prime Minister's office.\nWhen the history of the Rajiv Gandhi years is written, the story may well be very different. Half a century of politics dominated by a dynasty founded by Motilal Nehru, a revolutionary whose son Jawaharlal became India's first Prime Minister, has left India with a troubling agenda for the future. Whoever comes to power this year will face problems that go beyond even the violence Mr. Gandhi pointed to. These have been building like monsoon clouds through four decades of essentially one-party, one-family rule. Since 1947, there have been only four years in which the Government was not held by the Congress Party, and only five brief periods when someone outside the Nehru-Gandhi family ran India. Inefficiency and Mistrust\nThe dynasty has left a political culture shaped to its own requirements. The nation is over-centralized; there is an urgent need to restore fiscal and administrative responsibilties to the states if further separatism is to be avoided. What Indians call \"the Congress culture\" has also meant corruption and criminality in politics. Both lowly clerks and members of Parliament are bought and sold with the help of money from industrial houses seeking privileges and immunities. Public confidence in the democratic system is absent, as are accountability and a modicum of ethical standards among public officials.\nIndia also needs a comprehensive review of its economy and clear guidelines for development. Years of trying to balance the need for economic liberalization with traditional state planning and protectionism have created monsters of inefficiency in public and private sectors. Mr. Gandhi and his successor as Prime Minister, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, began the review process, but much more needs to be done if India is to sell to the world -- or communicate well with it.\nNew Delhi still clings to a vaguely defined nonalignment that now teeters on the edge of extinction. It awaits a foreign policy review that will take into account the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the emergence of a new power alignment led by the United States, Japan and Europe.\nAnd the world's second most populous nation is still growing too fast for its resources. Half of its 844 million people barely survive, condemned to inadequate housing, illiteracy and malnutrition. The rising aspirations of the lower castes and outcastes cry out to be addressed. So do the tensions created by a resurgent Hinduism. In an interview minutes before he died, Mr. Gandhi spoke of the urgent need to improve the quality of life in India, the source of so much political frustration and violence.\nMr. Gandhi came to power in 1984, hours after the assassination of his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In the election that followed, a wave of sympathy swept him into office in his own right. He promised change, modernization, new ideas in education for the disadvantaged, and no more political power brokers. Critics and supporters alike credit him with good instincts about what India needed, but they add that he often lacked the will to see the changes through.\nMeanwhile, rural development and alleviating urban poverty moved from high-priority tasks to matters of crisis. Since Mr. Gandhi took office in 1984, more than 100 million new Indians have been born, and most live near or below subsistence.\nMr. Gandhi's \"general initiatives were good,\" said Nikhil Chakravarty, editor of the left-wing journal Mainstream, in an interview. \"But he did not have the tenacity of a great political leader. He started without having any great interest in politics. Later, he developed a flamboyant way of looking at problems superficially, suggesting solutions that were not followed through.\"\nThe roots of the present standoff in Kashmir can be found in decisions by Mrs. Gandhi in 1983 and by her son in 1987 to tamper with state politics for the short-term advantage of the Congress Party. A rigged election in 1987 drove flocks of young people into the arms of separatism, and the discontent in Kashmir is now the most serious threat to India's national integrity. Missteps Abroad\nIn international affairs, the 1980's were also years of missed opportunities or missteps. Indians have come to be considered the gringos of South Asia, a reputation that has outlived even the promises by Mr. Gandhi's successor as Prime Minister, Mr. Singh, that there will be no more dirty tricks. Mr. Chakravarty said Mr. Gandhi went wrong in deciding to send an Indian peace-keeping force to Sri Lanka in 1987 to disarm a Tamil separatist army, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. That group was put high on the list of suspects in Mr. Gandhi's assassination.\nIndia's initial support for the Tamil guerrillas, an intelligence operation begun by Indira Gandhi, still rankles in Colombo. Bangladesh got the brushoff over attempts to organize an international meeting on flooding of the Himalayan rivers, Nepal was bludgeoned by a trade embargo, andIndian troops landed in the little nation of Maldives to put down a coup without involving or in some cases informing their regional neighbors.\nOn the other hand, Ramesh Chandran, foreign editor of The Times of India, said an achievement often overlooked was Mr. Gandhi's rapproachment with China, which set in motion a series of meetings between the two nations. \"With the United States, there has been all this talk about how he got along with George Bush, but the U.S. is still a problem area for us,\" Mr. Chandran said.\nA bright spot in the legacy of Rajiv Gandhi, for many Indians, is that he created an impulse to look outward from a nation that had always found it hard to shake the myths of its romantic and mystical past. Not ashamed to wear jeans and drive a fast car, he appealed to the imagination of a new generation of Indians impatient with the asceticism, puritanism and zealous self-reliance enshrined in the legacy of Mohandas K. Gandhi.\nToday, with Rajiv Gahdi's death, this new evolving urban middle class has its own forebodings. \"On that field in Tamil Nadu,\" says Rajiv Desai, the American-educated head of a public affairs company, \"the dream of a generation that was open to the world died. With him gone, I see a black hole. The rest are so inward looking that I'm afraid India is going to become another Burma.\""}, {"text": "U.N. Rebukes Burma Military For Refusing to Yield Power\n1991-11-30T05:00:00.000Z\nThe United Nations unanimously rebuked the military Government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, today for its persistent refusal to surrender political power to a democratically elected Parliament.\nThe impetus for the rare criticism of a third world country was Myanmar's continued detention of this year's Nobel Peace Prize winner, the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\nAfter blocking a Swedish-led attempt to condemn Myanmar at last year's General Assembly, India and Myanmar's other Asian neighbors dropped their opposition to a resolution that expressed concern at continued military rule and the suppression of fundamental democratic freedoms.\nThe consensus text, approved without a vote by the General Assembly committee on social, humanitarian and cultural matters, is intended to put the weight of the world's moral disapproval on Myanmar's military. The military has ruled since a 1962 coup by Gen. Ne Win, who was forced out in 1988 but continues to wield considerable power behind the scenes.\nThe hope is that the resolution will persuade the military powers, nominally led by Gen. Saw Maung, to surrender power to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. Her party won 80 percent of the seats in elections in May 1990, but was never permitted to assume control of the government. Unanimous Action on First Try\nToday's action also marked the first time that a resolution criticizing a member country by name for fundamental human rights abuses was unanimously adopted by a committee on its first presentation.\nA handful of resolutions critical of abuses in El Salvador and Afghanistan have won unanimous support, but only after years of debate during which they were diluted.\nThe cautiously worded text welcomes the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose father was the leader of the Burmese independence movement and founder of the National League for Democracy. Her father was assassinated in 1947 on the eve of independence from Britain.\nMrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house arrest in the capital, Yangon, formerly Rangoon, since her sweeping victory in the elections, and many of her followers have been thrown into jail.\nThe resolution notes that Myanmar's military rulers are already officially committed to \"take firm steps toward the establishment of a democratic state\" and calls for \"early implementation of this commitment.\"\nIt expresses concern at the \"grave human rights situation\" in the country and calls on the Burmese authorities to \"allow all citizens to participate freely in the political process in accordance with the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\" The resolution commits the General Assembly to review conditions in Myanmar again next year.\nIn a last-minute concession to secure general third world support, Sweden withdrew a sentence expessing concern at \"the continued deprivation of liberty of a number of democratically elected political leaders.\" China and Cuba Go Along\nEven China and Cuba, who traditionally view any criticism of a country's human rights record as unacceptable interference in its domestic affairs, went along with the consensus. Because of their support, and since India was a co-sponsor, diplomats saw today's events as a signal of a possible watershed in encouraging respect for basic human rights in Asia.\nWith the ending of the Cold War, debates over human rights at the United Nations are increasingly becoming a polarized struggle, with the industrialized northern countries accusing some poorer southern Governments of abusing their citizens' rights.\nBut today's vote showed that once other Asian countries indicated they were prepared to see Myanmar isolated and criticized, other developing countries acceded as well.\nIn other human rights votes today, the committee attacked Iraq for extra-judicial killings, torture and arbitrary executions. It also accused Iraq of serious human rights abuses during its occupation of Kuwait, though it said nothing about mistreatment of Palestinians after Iraq's forces had been driven out. Haiti Resolution Delayed\nA proposed resolution on the overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti has been delayed by Cuba, which wants to include criticism of America's efforts to deport boat people fleeing Haiti. The committee agreed not to debate human rights in Iran after the Government said it would allow a United Nations inspector to visit the country next year.\nDiplomats here say the awarding of the Nobel Prize made it particularly difficult for other Asian countries to block the Swedish resolution, which was never put to a vote last year. But their decision not to shield Myanmar from international criticism any longer also reflects a growing dissatisfaction with developments in the country, experts say.\nIn addition to the Government's continued refusal to practice the democracy it says it favors, Myanmar has annoyed its neighbors by becoming the world's leading exporter of heroin. Refugees Flood Neighbors\nContinued instability inside the country, often associated with the Government's long war against the tribes who control the opium business, is sending waves of Burmese refugees into Thailand, China, Bangladesh and India.\nAfter pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988, Myanmar's military suspended political rights and set up the State Law and Order Restoration Council, which is led by General Saw Maung. As a result, the United Nations Human Rights Commission, based in Geneva, sent an inspector in 1990 to make a confidential report on human rights there. But the inspector was unable to gain access to political prisoners.\nAfter the military Government refused to accept the election results last year, the commission sent its inspector back in October, but he was denied access to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and her imprisoned supporters. NOBEL WINNER CAN GET MAIL NOW\nBANGKOK, Thailand, Nov. 29 (AP) -- Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been held under house arrest in Myanmar, will be allowed to receive letters from her family, a Thai official said today.\nHer British husband, Michael Aris, made the request for correspondence privileges through the Thai Prime Minister, Anand Panyarachun. Thai diplomats relayed the request to Burmese military leaders, an official at the Thai Foreign Ministry said.\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Burmese had insisted that the letters must be sent unsealed.\nThe Burmese leaders also told Thai diplomats that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is healthy and safe, Thai newspapers quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Sakthip Krairiksh, as saying.\nMr. Aris, a visiting professor at Harvard University, has had no contact with his wife since he received a letter from her on July 17, 1990. He last saw her at Christmas 1989. He and the couple's two sons plan to accept the Nobel Peace Prize for her in Oslo on Dec. 10."}, {"text": "U.S. and Private Agencies Assess Aid Needs\n1991-05-03T05:00:00.000Z\nAlready burdened by efforts to help Kurdish refugees and famine-stricken Africans, the United States and private relief agencies are beginning to assess ways to provide aid to Bangladesh, where tens of thousands died in a cyclone, officials said today.\nThe United States has so far given $125,000 in immediate aid, but Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said that was only a temporary measure until a further assessment by two teams from the embassy in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, is completed. After that, the Bush Administration will determine how much of an aid package will be directed to Bangladesh.\nMary Little, acting director of the Asia division of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, said the two teams were completing an initial report of what aid was appropriate and what areas needed it most. The report would be ready by Friday, she said.\n\"This is the assessment phase and it's moving pretty rapidly,\" Ms. Little said. The three main priorities, she said, are safe water supplies, restoring communications and delivering uncontaminated food to affected areas. Embassy Gave Funds for Supplies\nShe said the embassy provided an immediate $25,000 to the Bangladeshi Government on Wednesday and today authorized an additional $100,000 to private relief agencies which will be used mainly to buy emergenc shelters, chemicals to purify water and rehydration salts to prevent and treat outbreaks of life-threatening diarrhea among children from cholera and other diseases.\nLisa Mullins, program director for disaster response and resources at Interaction, a Washington-based coalition of 132 relief agencies like Care and Save the Children, said those wishing to help should send money to any agency accepting it for the Bangladesh situation.\nShe said that typically in responding to a disaster halfway around the world, it was most efficient to donate money so that supplies could be purchased closer to the affected areas. For example, she said, rather than send tents, it was better to purchase tents from manufacturers in Pakistan, where they are widely available.\nBangladesh has issued a preliminary appeal to the United States, Britain and Japan for $1.4 billion.\nBritain today promised $2.2 million, The Associated Press reported. India has donated three helicopters and $790,000, the state-owned television in New Delhi reported. The European Community will give Bangladesh $12 million in emergency food aid and medical supplies, a spokesman in Brussells said today, .\nA London spokesman for Oxfam said that workers from that agency who are stationed in Bangladesh were already spreading throughout the countryside, handing out water purification tablets and equipment.

The predictions are that as many as 300,000 people may die from starvation, exposure and disease.\nMeanwhile, a cholera epidemic is spreading across Peru and other South American countries and earthquakes have recently struck Costa Rica and Soviet Georgia.\nAnd 27 million people in six countries in north Africa face death from starvation and civil war in what the relief agency Save the Children has called \"the worst famine in Africa in living memory.\"\nThe task of ministering to a world ravaged by disaster has overwhelmed private humanitarian organizations, the United Nations and donor governments. Traditional donors, battered by so many appeals, are weary of pouring money into crises that never seem to go away. The result is a discouragingly contagious compassion fatigue. Even though many relief agencies report that donations have only dipped slightly despite the global recession, they say that the scope of the crisis requires a massive infusion of money and attention from new sources.\n\"Those of us who have been in the battle for years are tired and battered,\" said Tom Getman, director of government relations at World Vision, a private relief organization. \"It's time for a whole new cadre of donors to emerge from around the world.\" To educate and encourage potential donors in the United States, Interaction, an umbrella group representing more than 100 relief organizations, will introduce a 900 telephone line next week.\nWhile the world responded, albeit somewhat belatedly, to the Kurdish crisis, it has been more difficult to drum up enthusiasm for Bangladesh, whose history has been cursed by natural disasters. The United States, for example, has given $7 million for cyclone relief and 67,000 tons of food, and has received approval for additional food aid and funds. Bangladesh has pleaded for military helicopters to ferry food and medical supplies that are sitting in warehouses waiting for a delivery system, with little response.\nThe refugee relief effort in northern Iraq, by contrast, will cost the United States and its allies between $500 million and $700 million for the first six months of its operation.\nThe response to an evolving, seemingly endless crisis like the famine in the Sudan, a byproduct both of war and the government's refusal to heed the warning signals of famine, is even less enthusiastic.\nHelping the victims of African famine was in vogue in the mid-1980's, and there is a reluctance to believe that the problem not only remains unsolved, but will be much worse this time."}, {"text": "ASSASSINATION IN INDIA; Gandhi's Widow Named Head of Party\n1991-05-23T05:00:00.000Z\nSeeking a large sympathy vote, officials of the Congress Party stunned India today by choosing the Italian-born widow of their slain leader, Rajiv Gandhi, to succeed him as party president.\nLess than a day after Mr. Gandhi was assassinated by a bomb while campaigning in the south, party leaders voted unanimously to put Sonia Gandhi, the 43-year-old widow from Turin, at the head of the party, which has dominated Indian political life since independence in 1947.\nThe effort to sustain the Gandhi dynasty came before many regional party officials had even arrived in the capital to mourn Mr. Gandhi, the slain son of India's fabled political family. There was no indication that Mrs. Gandhi had any hand in the decision, and she has yet to comment. She spent the day grieving for her husband among well-wishers at the Peen Murti House, an early prime minister's residence that is now a museum. Premiership Not Definite\nBut a Congress Party spokesman, Pranab Mukherjee, said the move by the party's 18-member decision-making arm was binding. \"The question of acceptance does not arise,\" he said.\nIn announcing the choice, the party leadership made it clear that Mrs. Gandhi, who became an Indian citizen only eight years ago, would not necessarily be named Prime Minister if the party won the elections.\nThere is ample precedent for women assuming the political mantle of men in southern Asia. Indira Gandhi, the mother of Rajiv, herself eventually inherited the legacy of her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. But the notion that a European woman and a non-Hindu could have a sustained role as the leader of 850 million Indians still verged on the inconceivable. Leading Contestants\nMr. Gandhi and the Congress Party had been battling the Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party, led by Lal Kishan Advani, and the National Front alliance of former Prime Minister V. P. Singh, who succeeded Mr. Gandhi in 1989. Those three parties are the leading contestants in the Indian election.\nViolence broke out in several Indian cities today as news spread of Mr. Gandhi's death, in a bomb attack in the town of Sriperumbudur, about 25 miles from Madras in the state of Tamil Nadu. Amid grief and anger, train service was canceled and airline schedules were curtailed.\nNine people died, property was destroyed and cars and buses burned by mobs seeking revenge in Calcutta and Madras and other cities in the south, and the Indian Army was called out in half a dozen states. New Delhi was peaceful, but offices and shops were closed to avert violence of the kind seen after Indira Gandhi was killed in 1984.\nWith Mr. Gandhi's funeral planned for Friday, there were few critical opinions voiced today about the naming of Mr. Gandhi's widow. But a spokesman for Mr. Advani's party was quoted by Reuters as saying that the move reflected \"the utter bankruptcy of the party.\"\nThe nationwide voting, which began on Monday, was to have ended on Sunday. Because of the killing, the last phases of the election have been postponed until mid-June. The results of the first part will stand, but are to be kept secret until all the voting is complete. Identity Still Unknown\nMr. Gandhi's torn body was flown to this solemn, shaken capital today and borne to the sprawling compound where Nehru lived and where Mr. Gandhi and his younger brother, Sanjay, grew up. The authorities said the identity of the assailant or assailants was still unknown.\nThe body, swathed in a white sheet, was placed on a wooden platform bedecked with marigolds and aromatic with incense, the scent of which wafted through a crush of weeping mourners. Mrs. Gandhi, wearing a white sari symbolic of mourning and sunglasses to cover her tear-swollen eyes, sat silently with a few friends.\nAmong the mourners were India's President, Ramaswamy Venkataraman, and its caretaker Prime Minister, Chandra Shekhar. \"He was no ordinary man and this is no ordinary death,\" Mr. Shekhar said.\nA large color portrait of a smiling Mr. Gandhi was placed at the head of the platform on which he lay. Rajesh Khanna, a movie star and popular politician who is contesting the New Delhi seat for the Congress Party, tried to usher visitors past the body, but surges of people often flooded the room, exhausting the patience of harried security officers.\nThe explosion that killed Mr. Gandhi was specifically aimed at him -- whether in a bouquet of flowers, a garland of marigolds or the folds of a sari worn by an unidentified woman who was seen approaching him seconds before the blast. She was one of the 15 people killed in the blast, which occurred as Mr. Gandhi waded into a crowd at a campaign stop. Suicide Assassin Theory\nThe Press Trust of India today quoted investigators as saying that the nature of Mr. Gandhi's injuries supported the theory that the bomb was strapped to the body of a suicide assassin. The investigators said they had discovered wires, a spring and a battery at the scence.\nInitial reports suggested that Mr. Gandhi's body was destroyed in the explosion. But photographs from the scene showed a torso that was mutilated but apparently indentifiable as that of the slain candidate.\nNo group has asserted responsibility for Mr. Gandhi's death, although investigators in Tamil Nadu suspect that a Tamil nationalist suicide squad, possibly guerrillas of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Sri Lankan group, could have been involved. This separatist group -- reportedly trained by Indian intelligence agencies under Indira Gandhi -- is fighting the Sri Lankan Government from a steadily weakening position. Sri Lankan officials say the guerrillas were recently trying to re-establish ties with the Congress Party and the Indian Government.\nNo public accusations have been leveled, and the Liberation Tigers issued a statement today denying responsibility for the attack.\nMr. Gandhi's killing is the third time since independence that the nation's most conspicuous political figure has been assassinated. His death, along with that of his mother and of Mohandas K. Gandhi, the spiritual leader of Indian independence, who was cut down in 1948, have left Indian political leaders poignantly aware of their vulnerability. Coalitions in Parliament\nPolitical parties are convening emergency meetings to discuss the assassination and to consider ways to limit its effect on the political process. The current Indian Parliament is dominated by the Congress Party and includes coalitions of Socialists, Communists and others.\nThe choice of Mrs. Gandhi as head of the party will not be accepted universally by Congress Party members, some of whom say there are many more experienced politicians serving the party. It also highlights the degree to which decisions affecting the party nationwide are made by a clique in New Delhi. The Congress Party has not had an often-promised leadership election among its ranks for more than two decades.\n\"It is a crucial moment in the history of the Congress,\" said a senior party leader, P. V. Narasimha Rao, a close friend of the Gandhi family. \"We have taken a decision and we will abide by it,\" he said.\nThe decision could not immediately be conveyed to Mrs. Gandhi \"because she is in grief,\" said Janardhan Reddy, the Chief Minister of the state of Andhra Pradesh and a senior Congress Party leader. A Cautious Reaction\nIndian officials are reacting cautiously in apportioning blame for the killing out of fear that naming a scapegoat would lead to a sharp increase in violence. The elections have so far been Indian's most violent, with hundreds of deaths reported during the polling.\nThe mention of the Tamil Tigers stems from Mr. Gandhi's decision to send troops to Sri Lanka in 1987 to keep the Tamils and the island's Sinhalese ethnic majority apart. Indian troops and Tamil rebels quickly became adversaries. The Indians ultimately withdrew after 30 months.\nIn January, Mr. Gandhi engineered the consitutionally questionable ouster of Tamil Nadu's elected state government under Chief Minister Muthivel Karunanidhi, a political rival. Mr. Karunanidhi was accused of supporting the Tigers and offering them safe haven in Tamil Nadu state.\nSonia Gandhi, who was born in Italy but is now an Indian citizen, will lead the party through the postponed final phases of the national election on June 12 and 15. But the party left open the question of who would head its Parliament group or become Prime Minister if it wins a majority. Mrs. Gandhi is not a candidate for Parliament. Ballots to Be Stored\nThe original schedule for elections to the lower house of the Indian Parliament called for three days of voting, May 20, 23 and 26. The voting on May 20 was completed before Mr. Gandhi's death, and those ballots will be stored to await counting on June 16. In any case, new polling will have to take place in a number of those constituencies because of violence and intimidation on election day.\nWhile the Congress Party is aiming for a large sympathy vote in June, political analysts point out that many of the constituencies in which the leading rival of Congress, the right-wing Bharatiya Janata, hoped to score its biggest gains, have already voted.\nMrs. Gandhi is fluent in Hindi, the main language of northern India, and traveled extensively in India and abroad with her husband.\nIf she accepts the leadership, Mrs. Gandhi would follow the example of a growing list of women in southern Asia -- Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, Prime Minister Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh and Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, among them -- who have at some point carried on the political legacy of a slain relative."}, {"text": "Calamity's Lessons\n1991-05-17T05:00:00.000Z\nThe world's human tragedies suddenly seem too much for the heart to bear or the mind to comprehend. A million Iraqi Kurds flee to the mountains, prompting a desperate multinational aid effort. A cyclone lashes the Bay of Bengal, killing as many as 200,000 and leaving millions homeless. All the while war and famine stalk the Horn of Africa, imperiling 20 million in Ethiopia, Somalia and the Sudan.\nHave all these calamities exceeded the resources available for aid? What are American priorities? And what can be done to make remote corners of the world less vulnerable to misfortune and misrule?\nFortunately, emergency food stocks are available; distribution is the more critical challenge. Governments and voluntary groups have responded with energy and imagination. But long-term amelioration demands more than Live Aid concerts or airdrops. It requires ending wars, securing human rights, abating population growth and preparing in advance for predictable disasters.\nThe plight of the Kurds has priority, since their exodus directly resulted from an American-led war against Iraq. Emergency food and tent cities were feasible because allied military forces were already deployed nearby. But these are interim steps. If Kurds are granted autonomy within Iraq, if Baghdad accepts a U.N. police presence and if a legal basis can be found for it -- three big if's -- then an enduring precedent may yet be achieved.\nIn Bangladesh, where huge waves swept over rice and wheat crops, simply getting food to the starving is a feat. Washington has compensated for a token financial contribution of $6.9 million by sending thousands of marines with helicopters to help relief operations.\nBlunders added to the tragedy. Dhaka's previous authoritarian leaders failed to provide shelters in areas repeatedly battered by storms. A new, inexperienced democratic Government failed to relocate thousands despite early warnings. In the longer term, aggressive family planning -- with more generous U.S. help -- will be required to stabilize Bangladesh's dense population.\nThe Horn of Africa suffers mainly from endless war. Rival armies gobble up food intended for starving peasants in Ethiopia, Somalia and the Sudan. Famine relief can only be justified if coupled with a widespread diplomatic effort to end conflicts fired by now-dated cold war rivalries.\nLives are threatened more by indigenous folly and violence than by any lack of international compassion. Governments and voluntary agencies could provide adequate relief if shooting stopped.\nIt is neither heartless nor irresponsible for donors to spell out harsh truths while making every reasonable effort to prevent mass starvation."}, {"text": "String of Crisis Overwhelms Relief Agencies and Donors\n1991-05-04T05:00:00.000Z\nOfficials of private relief agencies said today that the string of refugee crises and natural calamities across the globe had depleted outside donations as well as their own energies.\n\"It's a remarkable confluence of natural disasters,\" said Lisa Mullins, program director for disaster response and resources at Interaction, a Washington-based coalition of 132 relief agencies, including CARE and Oxfam America.\n\"We have a major famine shaping up in Africa, especially the Sudan, the largest refugee crisis in 40 years among the Kurds, a series of earthquakes in the Soviet Union, a cholera epidemic that started in Peru and now this,\" she said, referring to the disastrous cyclone in Bangladesh.\nAl Panico, the director of international relief for the American Red Cross, said he was worried that so many tragedies at once would result in \"donor fatigue.\" Ms. Mullins said the belief that charitable donations have dwindled is widely accepted among private organizations, although there are few figures to confirm it. 'A Sense of Futility'\nRichard Walden, president of Operation U.S.A., a relief agency based in Los Angeles with ties to the entertainment industry, said that in recent months donations have been down an average of 30 percent.\n\"It's been very rough for all the relief agencies because of so many things happening at once,\" he said. \"Recently people have been on overload. They have a sense of futility about these disasters.\"\nWhile some groups like the Red Cross say donations are discouragingly low, others like World Vision, one of the largest private agencies, say they are receiving normal levels of donations, but are struggling because there is no surge in response to specific calamities, as there has been in the past.\nAt the State Department, where officials are trying to assess the needs of Bangladesh, Margaret Tutwiler, the spokeswoman, said United States resources have been stretched by other humanitarian demands, especially the Kurdish refugee crisis.\nShe said it would be difficult to comply with a request from the Bangladesh Government for helicopters to be used to distribute food, medicine and chemicals for purifying water.\nAsked about the difficulty in supplying helicopters, she said: \"It's a legitimate problem that we have and other countries also have in light of everything else that we are doing. We're looking for ways to address this request, but, yes, we are stretched right now, as a government, on helicopters.\" Confused Donors Turning Off\nMr. Panico of the Red Cross said Americans \"just get tired of seeing starving people on television\" and added, \"The needs are overwhelming and people who would ordinarily donate just get confused as to where to give money.\"\nHe said, \"They end up just turning the television off.\"\nMr. Panico said that the victims of the recent earthquake and aftershocks in Soviet Georgia are getting relatively little help because of priorities elsewhere in a kind of institutional triage.\nMr. Panico said, for example, that Red Cross workers who have experience in dealing with earthquakes are tied up aiding refugees on the Turkish and Iranian borders.\nTom Getman, director of government relations for World Vision, said that, unlike past calamities, the Kurdish crisis and the African famine were not generating any special response.\n\"People seem to be paralyzed or just giving up,\" he said. \"They seem to be saying to themselves, 'With so much going on, there's little one person can do.' \" He said that donors should select a charity they trust and designate their gift for a specific need. News Coverage Has Impact\nJohn Hammock, the executive director of Oxfam America, based in Boston, said, \"Never before have our resources been stretched so thin.\" Mr. Hammock said that his organization preferred to support long-term solutions to problems like hunger, but that its resources were being used rapidly just to help with emergencies across the world.\n\"We've never had this situation where we've had to divert so much money from our long-term development projects,\" he said.\nMiss Tutwiler said the State Department has so far given $2.1 million for relief from the Bangladesh cyclone.\nThe Bush Administration will decide how much money to allocate to Bangladesh after two teams in the field complete their assessments. William B. Milam, the American Ambassador to Bangladesh, has been in the countryside leading one team.\nRudy von Bernuth, chief operating officer of CARE, said that while donations had been flat for most of last year, his group was experiencing a surge after intensive news coverage of the plight of the Kurds.\nEmphasizing the influence of news coverage, he said that the famine in Africa, particularly the Sudan, is worse than the Kurdish situation. But because it is not heavily covered in the news, he said, there is no surge in donations to counter the famine.

But its walls are intended to keep out people, not commodities.\nA flood of people fleeing poverty and political unrest in parts of Eastern Europe, in Africa and in South Asia has combined with years of high unemployment in Europe to inflame social and political tensions not only in European Community countries but in Austria and Switzerland as well.\nA total of 500,000 people applied for asylum in Western Europe as a whole last year, according to the British Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker. And as unemployment levels have risen in every major European economy this year, popular resentment at the influx has nurtured right-wing political movements in Belgium, Switzerland, France and Germany, among others. Heaviest Influx in Germany\nTime-consuming asylum procedures, including an obligation to house and feed applicants while their cases are being decided, are also imposing a drain on governments already hard pressed to meet welfare demands, and raising questions about how European countries that have never thought of themselves as ethnic melting pots can preserve their national identities.\nThe influx has been heaviest in Germany, which because of its past is the European country most inhibited from just sending the refugees packing. As the richest European nation and with a population just over 79 million, it already has its hands full coping with the estimated 2.5 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe who have taken up citizenship over the last three years, a right the 1949 Constitution automatically guaranteed to Germans everywhere.\nWhile 500,000 applications for asylum does not seem a lot in a continent of more than 300 million people, there are hundreds of thousands more illegal immigrants in most of the principal countries. Until 1985, the number of applications for asylum in Europe and North America combined had never exceeded 250,000.\nNot since the collapse of colonialism after World War II have the countries of Europe faced influxes of people on such a scale. Then, the immigration of hundreds of thousands of Indians and Pakistanis helped change the face of Britain, as the flow of North and Central Africans changed the faces of France and Belgium.\nNow the process is repeating itself in countries that had no overseas empires, challenging Germans, for instance, to re-examine their long-held aversion to immigration by other ethnic groups. While the Europeans are only groping for answers, they seem more intent this time on keeping as many of these people out as they can, if only they can find a way.\nLast summer, Italy sent entire boatloads of would-be asylum-seekers from Albania back across the Adriatic Sea, much as the United States has been barring Haitians from coming across the Caribbean. Spian Public Attitudes Largely Tolerant\nEuropean approaches to the problem vary greatly from country to country. In Spain, which has tolerated large-scale illegal immigration from Morocco for years, public attitudes so far are relatively tolerant.\nAbdalia Aziz Dukuly, a 27-year-old refugee from the civil war in Liberia, discovered that life in Spain would not be easy after he arrived in the Canary Islands on a freighter from Mauretania on Oct. 29. \"I lost my family, so I had nothing to lose,\" he said one recent morning at the Spanish Red Cross headquarters in Madrid, waiting in a corridor with a score of other refugees, most of them new arrivals from Africa.\n\"My mother was killed in the fighting,\" he said, \"and I made up my mind to come and hide in Europe. They told me in Las Palmas that Spain couldn't accept me unless I went to the capital, so here I am.\"\nIt is not easy to establish grounds to stay in any European country as a refugee. Under the terms of the 1951 United Nations Convention that all European Community countries, as well as the United States, are pledged to observe, asylum can be granted only to someone who can prove a \"well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\"\nOnly seven percent of applications for refugee or asylum status in Spain are approved, a figure roughly typical for the whole of the European Community, and for a basic reason: Most \"refugees\" coming to Europe actually want to build a better life for themselves, either here or, eventually, back home, and perhaps therefore are better described as immigrants.\nSince few European countries permit much immigration at all, the only way to get a foot in the door is to sneak into countries like Spain, which until recently did not even require visas of people coming over from Morocco, or to fly into an airport and ask for asylum, then taking advantage of the time it takes to determine qualification to settle down and take root anyway.\nBut gradually, the new arrivals are beginning to change the face of the country in unexpected ways, even in Spain, where the numbers -- about 5,000 a year -- are relatively small in a total population of more than 39 million. A surprising number of Spaniards had never laid eyes on a black person before Africans began arriving, for instance.\n\"King Balthazar was the only black most people here had ever been familiar with,\" said Felix Barrena, director of the Spanish Red Cross Center for Assistance to Foreigners, referring to one of the Three Magi.\nReferring to the difficulties asylum-seekers have in being integrated in Spanish society, he said: \"It's a social problem, not a racial problem, in my experience. People see refugees sleeping in the parks, and last summer some of them were caught selling drugs on the Plaza de Espana, and they make stereotypical judgments.\"\nSo far Spain has been spared the kind of organized campaigns against foreigners that have seen gangs of skinheads demonstrate against and attack Vietnamese and other refugees in some of the hardest-hit industrial towns in eastern Germany, where unemployment after the collapse of the Communist economy has soared to around 50 percent of the work force. Germany Both Acceptance And Resistance\nThe integration of foreigners, whether they are immigrants or refugees, has come a long way in Germany, which has had substantial populations of Yugoslavs, Turks and Italians since the 1960's, when they were invited in as \"guest workers.\"\nIn Berlin, for example, 312,374 foreigners now make up 11 percent of the population, and 136,302 of them are Turks. In 1960, there were only 22,065 non-German people in the city.\nThe civil war in Yugoslavia has sent more Yugoslavs fleeing into Germany in recent months, and they have displaced Romanians as the largest single group seeking asylum there.\nMany Germans have been as shocked as the rest of the world by the beatings and firebomb attacks on refugee centers. As Barbara John, the Berlin city official in charge of helping foreigners, sees it, the public image of Germany as a country where neo-Nazi thugs terrorize anybody who does not look German distorts the true picture.\n\"That has happened mainly in the East, and it's a sign of the collapse of the old system and of the order that held it up,\" she said.\nRacism in a mostly homogeneous, white society like Germany can hide better than it does in a country like Britain or Belgium that had to accept a large number of immigrants from former colonies.\nAnd Mrs. John was optimistic. \"We know many Germans don't object to foreigners being here,\" she said. Hundreds of thousands of them took to the streets in November to protest the harassment of foreigners and to demand that the authorities do more to stop it.\nThe reason Germany attracts almost two-thirds of the total number of asylum-seekers in the European Community, according to many officials, is that the German Constitution gives them a better chance of getting one foot in the door. It allows anyone a chance to make a claim and obliges the state to look after them while officials painstakingly examine it.\nChancellor Helmut Kohl tried this year to get the Constitution changed to allow a speedup in the examination procedure, which might discourage some \"refugees\" from coming, but he was blocked by the opposition Social Democrats.\nFailing that, he tried at the meeting of European leaders in Maastricht, the Netherlands, to get the others to agree to a common asylum and immigration policy to be decided by majority vote. Instead, they agreed to coordinate them as closely as possible by the end of 1993, in effect putting off an attempt to find a solution.\n\"Politicians show a helplessness that confuses and disturbs voters,\" Mrs. John said. One way out, she suggested, might be for countries like Germany to give up the pretense that they do not allow immigration -- since most of the asylum seekers who stay on are not expelled even if they are rejected -- and instead to set limits on numbers of immigrants.\nWith civil war in Yugoslavia and economic chaos in the territory of the old Soviet Union, German newspapers and magazines often speak of the threat of millions of refugees flooding in unless something is done to bar the door. But so far, the main group that has come are the descendants of ethnic Germans imported into Russia in the 18th century by Catherine the Great. And according to the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel, only 50,000 non-Germans have been granted German citizenship in the last 10 years. France New Citizens And Illegal Aliens\nIn France, by contrast, the census of 1990 showed that 1.77 million people who had acquired their French citizenship were living in the country at the end of the year, representing 3.13 percent of the total population of more than 56 million.\nEstimates of the number of foreigners living illegally in France range to the hundreds of thousands. Many of them work in the construction industry in big cities like Paris, Lyon or Marseille, according to Michel Devacht, a caseworker with the French Democratic Confederation of Labor.\n\"Any economist will tell you these people are necessary for the economy,\" Mr. Devacht said, because they do dirty or disagreeable work that French workers no longer want to do. \"But there are three million unemployed, so they are a scapegoat.\"\nLast month, the ultra-right National Front party of Jean-Marie Le Pen proposed an anti-immigration platform that would ship out unwanted aliens by boat, and put those awaiting expulsion into guarded camps.\nIt is not competition for jobs, but skin color that often defines the true nature of the antagonism, according to many experts.\n\"What worries the French is not the number of people who are legally foreigners, but the number of non-European immigrants and their children,\" Robert Sole wrote last month in the daily Le Monde.\nMr. Devacht said, \"Eastern Europeans are invisible.\" Black Africans and people from the formerly French territories of North Africa stood out and were resented, even though statistics show that the North Africans are 80 percent more likely to lose their jobs in hard times than \"native\" French workers are, according to Mr. Sole. Britain New Rules Due On Asylum-Seekers\nNowhere is the racist aspect of the new European anxiety about immigrants more open than in Britain, where there were fewer than 20,000 nonwhite residents before the collapse of the empire.\nToday the nonwhite population is about 2.6 million, 4.7 percent of the population of about 56 million and more than half of them of Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin, according to official statistics, and about one-fifth of West Indian origin. Yet it is still possible for a well-dressed black man to walk into a barbershop, as one did near Victoria Station the other day, and cause all three Italian barbers to stop snipping. Asked what he wanted, the man answered, \"A haircut.\" Apologetically but firmly, the chief barber answered, \"We don't know how to cut your kind of hair.\"\nBritish immigration from former colonies has been largely stopped, and only about 50,000 people a year are accepted here for settlement every year, many of them from Canada or Australia. The thought that more are seeking entry, most of them from Asia or Africa, raises fears among some Britons that their country might soon become ethnically unrecognizable.\nApplications for asylum in Britain have risen from 5,000 in 1988 to an estimated 50,000 this year, according to Home Secretary Baker.\nThe British are enacting new legislation so the authorities can determine whether asylum-seekers qualify within 90 days, instead of years as before. Refugees would have only two days to appeal refusals, in writing, to immigration officials who could decide, without a hearing, within five days whether an \"arguable\" case exists.\n\"I do not think the problem is a question of numbers, though numbers make it worse,\" wrote Charles Moore in The Spectator Magazine, known for its conservatism, earlier this fall.\n\"It is a question of race,\" he went on. \"You can be British without speaking English or being Christian or being white, but nevertheless Britain is basically English-speaking, Christian and white, and if one starts to think that it might become basically Urdu-speaking and Muslim and brown, one gets frightened and angry.\"\nSo the reaction has led, as it has in other European countries, to pressure to crack down and keep more such people out. At the beginning of November, Britain doubled the fine on foreign airlines that fly in foreigners without proper entry documents, from $:1,000 to $:2,000, or $3,600, per person.\nThe problem, as Amnesty International and other organizations that look after the rights of asylum-seekers and refugees have pointed out, is that most people who do qualify for asylum are likely as not to arrive without passports or visas because asking for them in the countries from which they fled could have been dangerous.\nIncreasingly, the London-based human rights organization said in a report at the end of November, all governments in Europe, not just Britain's, are taking a restrictive approach toward asylum-seekers. And increasingly, they are playing with people's lives.\nLast March, in an example Amnesty International cited in its report, 17 Tamils from Sri Lanka, which has been torn by civil strife for the last several years, arrived at Schwechat Airport in Vienna and claimed asylum. The Austrian authorities turned them back to Rome, through which they had passed in transit on their way to Vienna, saying that because they had first arrived on Italian soil, Italy should consider their claim first.\n\"In Vienna, they were held in the transit lounge and denied access to a U.N. representative,\" Amnesty International reported. Upon their return to Italy, they were sent back to Sri Lanka as \"deportees in transit\" from Austria.\nUnited Nations officials said later that at least some of the Tamils had presented \"clear grounds for asylum\" to the Austrian airport authorities, according to Amnesty. The Outlook Restrictions Seem Most Likely\nSmall wonder, perhaps, that at Maastricht, the European Community countries agreed to leave asylum policies in the hands of national governments, for the most part, instead of agreeing to common policies.\n\"That would have lost us our ability to control our own borders,\" said a British official close to Prime Minister John Major. \"The long-term solution is to strengthen everybody's external frontiers.\"\nThe outlook, as Eastern Europe and the lands of the former Soviet Union continue to be wracked by upheavals, is for a restrictive policy that, in most countries, favors whites from Eastern Europe who can speak the language of the country they seek to settle in and have, in the eyes of the authorities, a reasonable chance of economic success.\n\"Either we continue with a very restrictive immigration policy,\" Mr. Moore wrote in The Spectator, \"or we develop a more liberal one which is more 'racist.' \"\nWith nationalist parties feeding off the discontent with the present trend in Belgium, Germany, Austria, and France, many outsiders fear that he may be right."}, {"text": "Black Britons Speak of a Motherland That Looks Upon Them as Outcasts\n1991-03-31T05:00:00.000Z\nWorld War II was raging when Allan Wilmot set sail for England from his native Jamaica to serve, in his words, \"the mother country.\"\nLike blacks in Britain's other West Indian colonies, Mr. Wilmot was taught in school that his island had been colonized by the world's greatest civilization. He patriotically sang \"Rule Britannia\" and waved the Union Jack. When recruitment posters for the Royal Air Force flooded Mr. Wilmot's hometown, Kingston, there was no question that he would sign up.\nBut Mr. Wilmot said he and thousands of other West Indian volunteers arrived in England to find that Britons \"weren't expecting us.\" 'They Knew Nothing About Us'\n\"We had learned so much about the people, geography, the economy of England,\" said Mr. Wilmot, who was 18 years old when he came here. \"But they knew nothing about us. They believed that colored people had tails but that we cut them off to come to Europe. When we danced with English girls at dance halls, we could feel their hands going down and down and down, feeling for the stumps of the tails.\"\nAfter the war, Mr. Wilmot settled in Britain, married and raised a family. Now 65 years old and a retired telephone-company employee, he said he had \"never felt 100 percent\" in Britain.\n\"Sometimes it feels like they still aren't expecting us,\" said Mr. Wilmot, who is vice president of the West Indian Ex-Servicemen Association, based in London. \"It feels like they keep black people waiting, waiting, waiting in the wings.\"\nIt has been more than 40 years since West Indians began the modern migration of ethnic minority groups to Britain. About 495,000 people of West Indian origin now live here and they represent the overwhelming majority of blacks in the nation. Yet they make up about 1 percent of Britain's 55 million people, a tiny minority by United States standards, and they seem to be a people visible and invisible. Idea of a Black Briton\nSixty percent of all West Indians in Britain live in London. Their concentration here has produced disproportionate visibility in several areas. Some neighborhoods, although predominantly white, are shot through with a distinctly West Indian rhythm. Melodic Caribbean accents waft through streets punctuated with grocers' displays of plantains, goat meat and other staples of Caribbean cuisine. West Indian social and business clubs and restaurants stand alongside the ethnic group's fast-growing Pentecostal churches.\nReggae is a major influence in Britain's cultural scene. The annual Notting Hill Carnival, inspired by Trinidadians who migrated to the Notting Hill area in western London after World War II, has grown from a small outdoor party into what is widely regarded as the largest street festival in Europe.\nBut along other avenues, West Indians, Africans and other blacks are rarely seen. Race relations experts, social scientists and others say that there are virtually no blacks in the top echelons of the British Government, judiciary, police, press or civil service. Three blacks and one Asian are in the 650-member House of Commons, all members of the opposition Labor Party.\nSeveral studies show that West Indian and other blacks are more likely than whites to be unemployed, jailed, homeless and poorly educated. And although 53 percent of people of West Indian descent living in Britain were born here, many among them say that the society has yet to feel comfortable with the idea of the black Briton in the way that the United States accepts the concept of the black American. Patterns of Prejudice\nBlacks and others say the situation is linked to deep patterns of prejudice. For more than 25 years, Britain has had laws aimed at combating racial discrimination, but it has never tackled \"the fact that the culture regards black people as inferior and not deserving of equal treatment,\" said Colin Brown, a former senior research fellow at the Policy Studies Institute based in London.\nIndeed, even as Britain was passing laws intended to tackle racial discrimination, it was enacting statutes to stem the flow of blacks and other racial minorities into the country. A law passed in 1962 limited entry of Commonwealth immigrants to people who had been given work permits and a law in 1968 restricted the entry of Kenyan Asians who held British passports. An act passed in 1971 restricted admission of blacks into Britain to those who were coming for particular employment for a limited time period.\nCertainly, study after study shows that disadvantages experienced by West Indians and other blacks also cloud the lives of Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and other groups among Britain's 2.6 million ethnic minorities. But some people suggest that West Indians may have been among those least expecting to face discrimination when they arrived. According to that view, they came as almost ready-made British citizens. They spoke English, were educated in schools styled after those here, prayed in Christian churches and worshipped cricket as a second religion.\n\"Britishness was deeply instilled in them without their knowing what Britishness was really about,\" said Winsome Pinnock, a playwright whose parents immigrated to Britain from the West Indies in the late 1950's. \"They believed they were coming to a great empire and that they could share in its riches because they were part of that empire.\" The History The 'Color Bar' And Manual Labor\nBlacks have a long history in Britain. Africans were here in the Third Century as soldiers in the Roman Army. Centuries later, some of the Africans sold into slavery ended up here. Black seamen and their families started communities in British ports in the 1800's and West Indians came during World War II.\nNonetheless, Britain was virtually a homogeneous society until the 1950's. Its primary experience with nonwhites had been as their colonial master in the vast British empire. But in the 1950's, a postwar labor shortage, a damaged economy and a weakening grip on its territories forced Britain to encourage people from the Caribbean, the Indian subcontinent and Africa to come here to fill manual jobs. About 125,000 West Indians came between 1948 and 1958, many of them to man buses and subways and to work in hospitals, hotels and restaurants.\nUnder a 1948 law, people from the colonies were British citizens with the right to live here permanently. But historians and blacks who lived through the 1950's say that nonwhites were soon shunned as aliens. Amid an economic downturn, growing unemployment and strong winds of xenophobia, whites began to accuse nonwhites of stealing their jobs. The immigrants were also victims of Britain's class system, which labeled them second-class citizens and stifled their social progress. Underpinning all of this was a sentimental longing for Britain's imperial past, some Britons say. No 'Legacy of Guilt'\nWest Indians and other blacks found themselves faced with a so-called \"color bar,\" a practice encouraged by white American soldiers who brought their policies of racial discrimination and segregation to England with them in World War II. Blacks were barred from jobs and housing and from hotels, pubs and other public services.\n\"White people in Britain don't have the legacy of guilt about the past as there is in America about the period of slavery, even though there is plenty to be guilty about,\" said Anthony Lester, a white lawyer who helped to draft Britain's equal-opportunity law. \"Nor is the English dream like the American dream of equality. If you asked the average Briton what he was striving for, I don't think equality would be the first thing to come to mind.\" Anti-Bias Laws Code of Protection 'Has No Gums'\nIn 1965, Britain introduced its first law aimed at fighting racial discrimination. Two other acts have followed but race relations experts, blacks and others say that discrimination against minority groups remains pervasive.\nThe current equal-opportunity law, the Race Relations Act of 1976, set up the Commission for Racial Equality to combat discrimination in employment, housing, education and other areas. But the act, like its predecessors, is widely viewed as having weak legal remedies. It has no provisions for class-action suits or contract compliance measures to motivate employers to hire minorities. The commission can help individuals pursue discrimination complaints through a so-called industrial tribunal, which can award compensation of up to about $17,000.\n\"The law not only has no teeth,\" said A. Sivanandan, director of the Institute of Race Relations, an independent research organization, \"it has no gums. It makes racism respectable by default. Black people remain unprotected in every area of society.\"\nSurveys support Mr. Sivanandan's assertion. One study by the Policy Studies Institute showed that one-third of all employers would hire whites over equally qualified blacks without even giving the black applicants an interview. Another study found that black workers were more than twice as likely as whites with similar qualifications to end up in manual jobs. Lack of Political Will\nIn the criminal justice area, a report by the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders said young blacks were likely to receive harsher treatment than whites in the criminal justice system. In housing, a study by the Commission for Racial Equality showed that one in five real-estate agencies discriminated against ethnic minorities.\nOfficials at the Commission for Racial Equality say they are not satisfied with progress made under the 1976 law but that the situation would be far worse without it. They say that they have been pressing the Government for years to introduce legislation on the British mainland that is similar to a tough law put into effect last year in Northern Ireland aimed at fighting religious discrimination against the Roman Catholic minority.\nThat law includes contract compliance and compulsory monitoring of a workforce's religious composition. Concerns that discriminate can be fined up to $60,000. A spokesman in Britain's Home Office said there were no plans to equip the Race Relations Act with similar provisions.\nMany advocates of racial equality say the Government has never had the political will to fight discrimination. To assertions that it ignored race relations, the Government of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher responded that its economic policies had brought increased employment, higher incomes and a higher percentage of home ownerships to minorities. Prime Minister John Major has said he wants Britain to have \"no artificial barrier of background, religion or race.\"\nIn a written policy statement, the Government says it is \"wholly committed to a racially fair and just society.\" It says it vigorously enforces the Race Relations Act, monitors the civil service's employment practices and scrutinizes legislative and policy proposals to see that they contain the spirit of racial and sex equality. It also points to several Government programs aimed at benefiting minority groups, including one intended to regenerate inner cities, where many blacks and Asians live.\nMore radical measures to ease discrimination appear some way off, race relations experts say, because the cause of race relations remains widely unpopular in Britain. Blacks and the Police Hostile Encounters, Accounts of Abuse\nFor a nation accustomed to viewing itself as tolerant and fair, the ongoing debate over the troubled relationship between the police and blacks is particularly unsettling.\nAn opinion poll in 1989 found that 68 percent of blacks agreed with the statement that \"most police are prejudiced against colored people,\" compared with 22 percent of the total population.\nMany blacks say that their belief is supported by many personal encounters in which the police are hostile or abusive. In one widely publicized incident, Linford Christie, a popular Olympic sprinter, was wrongfully arrested on a charge of stealing a car that he had in fact rented. Mr. Christie quoted the arresting police officer as saying, \"What's a nigger like you doing in an England track suit?\"\nCarl Thompson-Ellis says that he, too, has been the target of police harassment. Mr. Thompson-Ellis is one of the Metropolitican Police's 475 nonwhite officers, who make up less than 1.7 percent of the 28,329-member force. He says that he has found \"niggers out\" and other racial epithets scrawled in his desk diary and on walls at work. White officers, he said, call blacks \"nigger, coon and jungle bunny so often that they're not conscious of it because it's the norm.\"\nMr. Thompson-Ellis, a 48-year-old detective, said white officers target young black men for abuse. He said one practice involves beating up black suspects before taking them to the police station and, in order to explain the suspects' wounds, accusing them of assault or resisting arrest. A police department spokesman insisted that such incidents \"do not happen.\" The spokesman said police officials recognized that what some white officers called \"harmless banter\" about nonwhites had elements of racism and that training programs had been started to try to stamp out such behavior.\nThe spokesman said the police force was working to improve relations with minorities and had an ongoing drive to recruit more nonwhite policemen. Under the force's grievance procedures, he said, policemen can lodge formal complaints against fellow officers who commit racially motivated offenses. Policemen found guilty of such offenses can be dismissed.\nBut Mr. Thompson-Ellis said many nonwhite policemen declined to complain about racist behavior within the force because \"we don't know who we are complaining to.\"\n\"The moment you take a stand,\" Mr. Thompson-Ellis said, \"you're put down as a troublemaker, someone who can't be trusted. We have to work with those guys. One of the things you don't want is to be in trouble on the street on some dark night, to radio for assistance and have no one answer you. What happens is they hear you and ignore you. So you keep quiet.\" The Future Rage Among Fruit of the First Wave\nChildren and grandchildren of the first generation of West Indians in Britain speak of a simmering rage at what they view as this society's rejection of them. They say the anger could boil over as it did in riots -- some blacks call them uprisings -- in 1981 and 1985. In those years, blazing gasoline bombs illuminated the shortage of hope in desolate pockets of the nation's cities.\nSome blacks hope that the rage will translate into greater political and economic independence in their community. The National Black Caucus, a national civil-rights body of sorts, was formed several years ago in an attempt to begin to make that happen.\nThe caucus and a network of black professionals -- including lawyers, probation officers and social workers -- have begun meeting informally to try to coordinate strategies to put the needs of blacks on the nation's agenda.\nBlacks employed in London's subways -- where about one-third of the workforce is black -- have also come together to make demands and have won an agreement from management to try to insure equal opportunity in the workplace.\n\"We've given up on changing attitudes,\" said Peter Herbert, vice chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers. \"Whites just don't realize that our disadvantage is their disadvantage. Unless there is a civil disturbance, they don't see how the underrepresentation of blacks in business, politics, education, housing and every other area impacts on them. What we can do is try to change behavior and outcome. If that doesn't happen, you only have to look at the ghettos in the United States to see what the future holds for Britain.\""}, {"text": "Travel Advisory; Bhutan Trims Package Rates\n1991-03-31T05:00:00.000Z\nPrice reductions for tourists' accommodations and meals in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan have been announced by the Government. The tiny country between India and China is also admitting more visitors. It was once among the most expensive and exclusive of tourist destinations. All-inclusive rates that ran as high as $250 a day or more per person for accommodations, food, guides and transportation have dropped to $220 in the peak months of April and October for visitors staying in hotels. Lodges now cost about $150 a day and campsites $120 to $130. In March, May, July, August, September and November, rates range from $175 for hotels to $100 to $120 for campers. Low-season rates for January, February, June and December will be $130 for hotels and $80 to $90 for campsites, with lodges only slightly higher.\nWhile most monasteries will remain closed to foreigners, tourists may be admitted to certain festivals held in monastic-fortress compounds called dzongs.

Isolated cases have been reported in Chile and the United States, but perhaps the greatest concern is for Brazil, Latin America's most populous nation.\n\"It's gigantic,\" said Myron M. Levine, an American epidemiologist who has studied cholera epidemics in Asia and Africa over the last 20 years. \"It's really a big epidemic.\"\nIn the first major outbreak in the Americas in this century, cholera has found in South America a population that has little natural resistance and is highly vulnerable because of a widespread lack of clean drinking water and proper sewage disposal.\nThe results can be seen in the crowded cholera wards of the state-run Dos de Mayo Hospital in Lima, the Peruvian capital. Earlier this month, cholera admissions hit 162 a day, going off the upper edge of a blackboard chart maintained by the hospital director. A Fateful Cup of Tea\n\"I bought a cup of herbal tea from a street vendor, and an hour later I was throwing up,\" said Oscar Clemente Paredes Rosales, interviewed in his hospital bed as an overhead serum bottle dripped dextrose solution into his right arm. Mr. Paredes, a 33-year-old truck driver, lay in a former women's ward recently relabeled \"Cholera II\" by a hurried staff member.\nHis wife, Maria Elena, said, \"Two people on our block died of cholera.\" Residents of their shantytown neighborhood draw water from a communal well.\nDisease control experts are largely at a loss to explain why cholera has returned to South America in the first epidemic since 1895. In the 1970's, the disease spread from West Africa down to Angola, a former Portuguese colony. Epidemiologists expected it to jump across the South Atlantic to Portuguese-speaking Brazil, but the South American epidemic never happened.\nSpread largely by contact with human feces, the cholera bacillus can kill a person in 10 hours. Through vomiting and diarrhea, infected people can lose 10 percent of their weight in one night. The disease is easily treated with rehydration salts and intravenous solutions, but in remote areas many Peruvians are 10 hours from an adequately supplied health clinic.\nThe speed and destructiveness of the disease in Peru is a reflection of the explosion of the urban poor there. From a city of one million people in the 1950's, Lima has grown to seven million people, about one third of Peru's population.\nWith terrorism, hyperinflation and foreign debt obligations causing the economy to shrink in recent years, the city government can barely maintain existing water and sewer systems, much less expand the network of pipes to half of the city that now does without.\nCholera bacteria spread in February to neighboring Ecuador. With the disease now present in half of Ecuador's 21 provinces, health officials there say that 3,500 people have fallen ill with cholera and 18 have died. The Ecuadorean Medical Federation, a private group, says the real toll is 5,000 ill and over 100 dead.\nIn March, the epidemic moved up the Pacific coast to Colombia, reaching two ports, then jumped 450 miles inland to the Amazon territory of Guaviare. So far, 113 Colombians have fallen ill, and 2 have died.\nThis week, one confirmed case was reported in Santiago, Chile. In the United States, one confirmed case of cholera and two suspected cases have been linked the Peru outbreak.\nEpidemiologists interviewed here said they saw no reason why the disease should not continue to spread, hitting Brazil and Central America. Disease's Route Is 'Guesswork'\n\"There is no mechanism to avoid that it goes to other countries,\" said Carlos M. Cuneo, an Argentine sanitation expert who represents the Pan American Health Organization here.\nDr. Levine, who works for the University of Maryland School of Medicine, cautioned, \"It's pure guesswork as to where it is going.\"\nToday, Brazilians' fears materialized after Brazil's Health Ministry reported one confirmed case and three suspected cases in Tabatinga and Benjamin Constant, Amazon border towns that trade heavily with Colombia and Peru.\nThe nightmare for Brazilian doctors, who have flocked to Lima recently on study missions, is that the epidemic will spread through the Amazon to the slums of Brazil's overcrowded coastal cities. Many health authorities fear that in the warm, unsanitary slums of Brazil and Peru, cholera could become endemic, recurring year after year as it does in India and Bangladesh.\nAbout 20 percent of cholera victims need hospitalization. With the Health Ministry in Lima reporting 147,980 cases, 600,000 additional Peruvians are, or have been, \"healthy carriers\" -- people who are infected but show no symptoms. With many hospital workers on strike in April, cases are believed to be underreported by as much as 10 percent.\nIn general, experts praise Peru's doctors for keeping the death rate at under 1 percent, well below the 8 percent average for cholera epidemics in Bangladesh. On the other hand, the experts have criticized Peru's political leadership for seeking to minimize the epidemic to reduce its impact on Peru's food and tourism industries.\n\"The public information campaign was a disaster,\" said Uriel Garcia Caceres, a medical doctor who served as Peru's Health Minister in the early 1980's.\nEvidently under pressure from Peru's powerful fishing industry, President Alberto K. Fujimori, his wife, Susana, and his ministers of fisheries and of agriculture went on television eating ceviche, a dish prepared by marinating raw fish in lemon juice. Trying to revive tourism, the President also played host to 20 foreign correspondents for a lunch of ceviche and sashimi at a beachfront restaurant.\nWithin days, hospital admissions for cholera soared. One patient reportedly was the Fisheries Minister, Felix Canal, who spent a week in a military hospital. Through a spokesman, the minister denied that he had fallen ill with cholera, saying he had a bad case of laryngitis. 'Ceviche War' Breaks Out\nIn what became known as the \"ceviche war,\" Health Minister Carlos Vidal Layseca resigned in mid-March, charging, \"There is one ceviche for the rich, and another ceviche for the poor.\"\nWith confusing messages coming from the authorities, the epidemic took on a second life during the Easter Week holiday here, when people traditionally eat fish and travel through the country visiting relatives.\nIn March the epidemic took root in the central Andes, and in April it started to descend into Peru's Amazon. In Iquitos, the largest Amazon city, there have been 418 cases and 18 deaths. U.S. Case Linked to Peru\nIn the United States, one case of cholera has been traced to the epidemic in Peru, the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said. An American physician visiting Lima contracted the disease this month after eating undercooked crabmeat and drinking contaminated water. Two cases of severe diarrhea in Miami among people who recently visited South America are being investigated by the centers, but cholera has not been confirmed.\n\"I would not be surprised to see a number of cases of cholera in Americans traveling to South America, but I don't expect really large numbers,\" said Dr. Paul Blake, an epidemiologist at the centers.\nHe said travelers should not drink untreated water and should eat cooked foods while they are still hot. Ice cubes should also be avoided.\n\"It is very unlikely that cholera will reach epidemic proportions in the United States,\" Dr. Blake said, \"because although our water and sewer systems are not perfect, they are good enough to make us unreceptive to mass transmission of the disease.\""}, {"text": "AFTER THE WAR: The Hardships; Those 8-Hour Food Lines in Kuwait City: 'There Is No System'\n1991-03-14T05:00:00.000Z\nMukaram Mustafa, a mother of five, says she has spent eight hours each day this week standing in line for food.\nIt took her an entire day to receive a container of cooking oil, another day in line for a bag of rice, and now she hopes that along with the more than 1,000 other men and women scrambling to enter a food distribution area in Kuwait City, she will receive two frozen chickens.\n\"My children have not eaten meat or chicken in four months,\" said Mrs. Mustafa, who is 33 years old. \"They need milk. There is no gas to cook with. I burn wood now.\"\nThe chaos and complaints outside are muted in the store, where behind dark and empty aisles only hands are visible as they grab the chickens in a shopping cart and get their ration cards stamped. The voices have become murmurs. 7,000 Chickens Distributed\nAs a woman in a veil received her ration of two small frozen chickens, she tucked them into a plastic bag, whispering: \"Praise to Allah. Thank you, God.\"\nThe cooperative, in the Palestinian neighborhood of Hawali, is distributing 7,000 chickens today, the manager, Ibrahim Sultan, said.\nFor more than a week now, food has been distributed free of charge throughout the city by the Kuwaiti Government, in 40 buildings that were once cooperative supermarkets. Now anger and frustration are rising after hours of standing in line for a single item of food that is quickly out of stock. Complaints about favoritism abound, in particular against the armed guards that patrol the lines and will openly slip food to friends and relatives who come by.\nIn some richer neighborhoods, Kuwaitis say the food is being delivered directly to private homes by volunteers who work at the cooperative supermarkets. Many of those standing in line say they do not have enough food to feed their families. 'There Is No System'\n\"During the occupation, I got more food than I'm getting now,\" Zahara Mutawa, 30, said. A Kuwaiti, assigned because of her residence to a Palestinian cooperative, she argued with the guard, demanding that Kuwaitis be allowed to form a separate line.\n\"The problem is that there is no system,\" said Rami Mustafa, a product line manager for a Kuwaiti company, who had been in line for six hours and had still about 300 people in front of him. \"I have to stand in line for rice and then another line for sugar. It will take me a week to get what I need to eat.\"\nFood and water, provided free of charge by the Kuwaiti Government as well as by the United States, are trucked in from Saudi Arabia and delivered to a central warehouse area in Kuwait City. Every day, about 30 trucks deliver, said Maj. Robert Johanson, 43, of the 432d Civil Affairs Company.\nThe food distribution network, which relies on a distribution system set up before the Iraqi invasion, is far from simple. Even before the food reaches Kuwait, there are bureaucratic snags. An American food convoy was stopped at the Saudi border two days ago and delayed for three and a half hours when the border guard demanded photocopies of the travel orders. The closest place to make photocopies is at least an hour from the border area. Food Ration Cards\nAt the staging area in Kuwait City, cooperative supermarket managers present lists of what they need. But the trucks can usually deliver only one or two items a day. And although truckloads of fresh vegetables and fruits were delivered for the first time two days ago, poorer neighborhoods in the Palestinian areas have still seen nothing but staples.\nPeople can receive food only at their neighborhood cooperatives, and must present a food ration card issued before the invasion on Aug. 2. There is no system set up to issue new cards. Many foreign workers, like Filipinos and Bangladeshis, do not hold such cards and have therefore been unable to obtain food that way.\nThe cooperative system was instituted in 1961, and Kuwaitis say it is one of the few truly democratic institutions in their country. In Kuwait before the invasion, each neighborhood was built around a food cooperative, where residents, whether rich or poor, could buy at a controlled price things like rice, lentils, oil and tomato paste by presenting a ration card.\nThe cooperative functioned like a community board. Its members were elected and it worked as a political force on social issues like better schooling. Most of the cooperatives stopped functioning during the seven-month Iraqi occupation. Disputes on Long Lines\nNow the food is free, but Kuwaitis say the system has gone awry. No one seems to know what item of food will be distributed from day to day. The frustration is voiced in arguments and fights in line.\n\"From morning till afternoon, I am in line,\" Bedriya Abdul Aziz, a 24-year-old kindergarten teacher, said, wiping away her tears as she spoke. \"I am tired. I was here for seven months with the Iraqis. There was more food then. We have no water, no electricity. Let our Government come and see us on line.\""}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1991-05-12T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational 3-14\nMarines were sent to Bangladesh along with dozens of helicopters as part of an amphibious task force to bolster relief operations, the White House and Pentagon said.

Not as long as Saddam Hussein continues to flout the U.N. cease-fire resolution that requires him to disclose all details of Iraq's secret nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs.\nTo accept human suffering as a diplomatic lever is tormenting -- but preferable to leaving the Persian Gulf allies with no credible way to compel Iraqi compliance except resuming military attacks.\nThere are other ways to address Iraq's emergency humanitarian needs. With the July 25 allied deadline for full Iraqi nuclear disclosure now at hand, it's exactly the wrong time to be hinting at partial lifting of the oil embargo.\nMaking Baghdad come clean on nuclear supplies won't be easy. The embargo was originally designed for the less ambitious task of containing Iraq's arms buildup. Rolling back existing programs requires greater pressure.\nNor is the alternative of renewed air strikes fully satisfactory. The massive, unopposed air raids of the gulf war apparently failed to destroy Baghdad's nuclear hoard. With allied force levels now reduced, new air raids could involve far greater risk to pilots, with no more success.\nThe best available course is to maintain maximum economic and political pressure on Baghdad while holding the threat of renewed military action in reserve.\nThe human suffering Baghdad cites in seeking permission to resume oil sales is real and wrenching. Yet Saddam Hussein's regime showed scant concern for the suffering it caused its own people through eight grueling years of aggressive war against Iran and the devastating defeat in Kuwait.\nHonorable arguments can be made for easing the oil embargo. Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the U.N. official in charge of monitoring Iraq's humanitarian needs, argues that precious international relief funds needed for Africa and Bangladesh should not be diverted to help oil-rich Iraq.\nU.N. diplomats also point out that for Kuwait to receive the reparations it is entitled to, Iraq needs some way to raise funds. And a long series of U.N. resolutions anticipated humanitarian exceptions to the embargo. Limited relief now could help prevent a total erosion of sanctions later on.\nThe Bush Administration, which long resisted any easing of sanctions, seems to be shifting. The President, declaring that innocent women and children should not suffer, hinted yesterday at possible approval for a U.N. move to allow limited oil sales.\nWe, too, were once moved by these arguments, but this is the wrong time to relax the embargo. Once Iraqi oil is allowed back on the international market, even if the revenues remain under U.N. control, it will be difficult to make distinctions. How can the immediate needs of food and medicine be distinguished from the longer-term rebuilding of distribution networks and power plants that serve humanitarian needs and the Iraqi economy?\nEasing the embargo now would give Baghdad a psychological lift, possibly reinforcing its defiance. A more straightforward way to provide humanitarian relief is to do just that, through an internationally financed effort limited to milk, food and medicine. A bill for the assistance could be presented to Iraq for later payment from oil revenues.\nEasing sanctions prematurely could one day leave no choice except winking at Saddam Hussein's defiance or going back to war.

He was 55 years old.\nHe died of AIDS, said a friend, Ron Smith.\nMr. Polito, whose business was known as Bill Polito Design Consultant, was born in Brooklyn and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in interior design at Syracuse University.\nWorking in 1959 as a product designer for the industrial designer Raymond Loewy, Mr. Polito designed department stores, banks and restaurants in Dhaka in Bangladesh, Manila and Kuwait. While with the Loewy firm, Mr. Polito also worked on department store interiors for Macy's, Burdine's and Bloomingdale's. And he worked on the interior of President John F. Kennedy's airplane, Air Force One.\nIn 1969, Mr. Polito established his own firm for graphic and interior design. Over the years, he maintained a long-standing relationship with Liz Claiborne Inc., one of the largest women's wear manufacturers in the country. He designed many of the company's showrooms and offices as well as its corporate trademark and stationery. For Ms. Claiborne, he designed furniture and interiors for her New York apartment and her Saltaire, L.I., beach houses. The trademark for Bonjour jeans as well as its print advertisements were also his work.\nMr. Polito's style was minimal and understated. His sparse, often monochromatic interiors usually included built-in furniture of his own design, pieces that were elegantly executed and meant to fit unobtrusively into the overall picture.\nIn 1974, Mr. Polito completed the design of the David Daines Hair Salon at 833 Madison Avenue between 69th and 70th Streets in Manhattan. The peach-hued interior with its terrazzo floors, circular mirrors eight feet in diameter and marble facade still looks up-to-date.\nAround 1970, Mr. Polito was commissioned by the Ivey family of Charlotte, N.C., to create one of the largest murals in the United States. The geometric work in acrylic paint stretched to a height of three stories across the width of a blocklong office building in Charlotte.\nMr. Polito continued to work after he learned he had AIDS in 1989. He became blind in January 1990 after contracting meningitis. Mr. Polito then joined a mobility training course at the Lighthouse for the Blind and learned to use a dictating machine that converted his voice to print. He also became active in many New York City-based agencies that help people to care for patients with AIDS who are visually impaired.\nMr. Polito is survived by his mother, Rose Polito, of Valley Stream, L.I., and two brothers, Thomas, of Brooklyn, and Robert, of Stony Brook, L.I."}, {"text": "In a Mix of Cultures, An Olio of Plantings\n1991-08-15T05:00:00.000Z\nJUAN GUERRERO grows tomatillos on a scrap of land that used to be a chop shop for stolen cars in the South Bronx.

It's about reclaiming scarred land from drug dealers. And planting a few vegetables and flowers that remind you of the roots you tore up to get here.\nMany urban gardeners till city-owned lots leased to them for $1 a year by Operation Green Thumb, the city's gardening program, which leases more than 1,000 lots to 550 community groups. Others just take over garbage-strewn land.\nOn Saturday, hundreds of these gardeners will exhibit their prize crops (the record sunflower is 43 inches around) at the City Gardeners' Harvest Fair, from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. The fair is sponsored by the Gateway National Recreation Area, the Cornell University Cooperative Extension, the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, and Operation Green Thumb. It isn't so easy in New York to get a pot of fresh collard greens and smoked pork simmering on your stove. Bronx Green-Up, an arm of the New York Botanical Garden, has provided the Garden of Happiness with everything from elephant manure to moral support as gardeners resolved racial tensions and got a lease from Operation Green Thumb.\n\"Gardening takes you back to your roots,\" said Karen Washington, 37, who took a pickax and shovel to the debris three years ago and now heads the community garden. \"My grandparents farmed in North Carolina. If you gave them some store-bought collard greens, they'd look at you like you were crazy.\"\nMr. Garcia led the way down a dark, narrow alley off Prospect Avenue that opened into light -- and a jungle of tomatoes. \"Seventy-two plants,\" he said, waving a hand over a once-abandoned piece of earth.\n\"Every night I come home and work in the garden, breathe the fresh air,\" he said, gesturing toward an old car seat set on four paint cans. \"Sometimes I fall asleep out here.

Now he runs his own place, Taj, on East Sixth Street and Second Avenue.\nAs a boy, Mr. Ahmed helped his father grow rice in a river valley flanked by mountains, on fertile land the size of a city block.\n\"Bangladesh is a poor country, so everybody knows how to grow rice and make flour out of vegetables,\" said Mr. Ahmed, sitting down on a little bench in the Liz Christy Bowery-Houston Garden.\nThe garden, named in memory of its founder, was the first project of the Green Guerrillas, who for 20 years have helped turn hundreds of vacant lots into gardens.\nThis is where Mr. Ahmed grows leafy greens like what he calls cala-loo and jute; taro, a root with a turnip taste; coriander, so basic to curry, so good for the stomach; and hot things, like Chinese mustard and a hot chili pepper called nagamoris.\nSo how hot is it?\n\"Ooooh . . . .\" Mr. Ahmed's voice rises about 10 degrees.\nOn Coney Island, on the corner of Surf Avenue and West 31st Street, where ocean breezes blow over the high-rises, a band of Southerners grows okra, white sweet corn, sweet potatoes, watermelons, even tobacco, on half an acre leased by Operation Green Thumb.\n\"It came out good, had a real tobacco smell to it,\" said Joseph Ferguson, a trucker from Phoenix, Va., who lives around the corner. \"It reminds me of being a kid, coming along.

And it is clearly no coincidence that the countries most menaced by famine this season are those that have been mired in long civil wars. Impoverished, warring nations have the worst food problems: peasants cannot plant or harvest during war, armies and rebels confiscate food for themselves, including in some cases well-intentioned Western supplies.\nAs Western nations gear up yet again to save the starving peoples of Africa they find themselves caught between their humanitarian obligation to feed the hungry and their growing conviction that donated food, far from solving the problem, may in some cases be aggravating rather than alleviating the hunger. In case after case, these officials believe, food from outside helps to subsidize the habits of civil war.\nThis time, too, the relief effort is overshadowed by the immediate needs of people elsewhere -- the Kurds in Iraq, the cyclone-devastated Bangladheshis -- whose disasters came in swift blows.\nThe United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization says as many as 35 million people are at risk in the six African countries most threatened by famine: the Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Liberia, Mozambique and Angola. These countries have one common thread: civil war. In Angola a peace accord has just been concluded, a positive sign; but because of the intensity of the war and the still-hot suspicions, food supplies for those in need will probably not immediately improve, officials say.\nIn Ethiopia and the Sudan, where drought as well as drawn-out war have contributed to crop failures, the end of conflict would make it much easier to deliver relief food. In eastern Ethiopia, a relief truck hit a mine last month; in southern Sudan, food convoys are regularly shot at by Taposa tribesmen armed by the Government. In Kopeata, a town under the control of the Sudan People's Liberation Army for more than two years, the marketplace remains barren because the few peasants who might have food to sell are fearful of moving from their villages.\n\"If peace prevailed there would be no problem in dealing with the shortages -- the commercial systems would work better and so would the relief systems,\" said Willard J. Pearson, director of the United States Agency for International Development office in Ethiopia. Falling Short of the Need\nBut there are shortages, most of all shortages of aid. In the Sudan, where Save the Children says 10 million people are in danger of starving, the United Nations has said that 1.2 million tons of food are needed in 1991. But a Save the Children report said so far only about 72,000 tons have been delivered. The United States has pledged about 300,000 tons of food, and Government figures show spending of $82 million for the Sudan and $53 million for Ethiopia between October 1990 and March. The European Community has pledged $167 million, or 400,000 tons of food, to African nations, but has not yet decided how to raise the money.\nAs officials of Western governments reassess their past unquestioning efforts to provide relief, they are not, they say, sending less food to places of need. It is not feasible, these officials say, to impose strict \"you make peace or we won't give you food\" conditions on food aid.\n\"If you condition the food aid on a certain event such as negotiations taking place and play a game of hardball to see how many people die, the humanitarian providers are going to blink first,\" said an American official organizing food aid to Africa.\nOn both humanitarian grounds and for domestic political reasons it would be unacceptable to allow mass deaths by starvation. Americans, even if a little weary of hearing about what seems like constant famine in Africa, do not like seeing starving Africans on their television screens if they believe something can be done to stop the suffering. But, said one official, \"we need to organize a strategy in a more hard-minded way.\"\nHumanitarian policies of donating millions of tons of food to warring governments and rebels have helped prop up combatants who care little for the civilians they purport to represent. With the food needs of the starving entirely taken care of by outsiders, the warring parties sometimes partake of the donated food themselves or find themselves left with more resources than they might otherwise have.\nLast year, for example, the International Monetary Fund found that the Sudanese Government had sold large stocks of pre-drought grain abroad. Much of the foreign exchange earned by the sales is believed to have been spent on weaponry from China to continue the civil war against the southern part of the country, now in its 20th year.\nNow, with the Sudanese Government's reserve food stocks sold, the United States and European donors find themselves struggling to deliver hundreds of thousands of tons of grain to stave off starvation among the Sudanese, against what have been almost insuperable barriers placed by the regime.\nIn Ethiopia it has been common practice for local government militia members to receive as a form of payment bags of food sent for famine relief. Now, Western donors are trying to weave through war zones to deliver food to hungry Ethiopian civilians as well as Sudanese and Somalian refugees who have sought sanctuary in Ethiopia from their own civil wars.\nIn southern Sudan, where the Sudan People's Liberation Army controls almost all the territory, Western donors say the leaders behave as though it were the international community's duty to feed the civilians while the rebel forces fight.\nDuring a visit to Kopeata, the French Minister for Humanitarian Action, Bernard Kouchner, told representatives of the rebel group that sympathy in the West for African people perpetually at war was wearing thin.\n\"The international community is tired of the mix of war, politics and drought,\" Mr. Kouchner told representatives of the rebel army and of the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association, its civilian wing.\nMr. Kouchner's anger was sparked in part by the hopeless and virtually unchanged conditions in Kopeata, which the rebel army has controlled for more than two years and to which much aid has been sent. \"There is a new hospital ward but that is not good enough,\" said Mr. Kouchner. \"They are asking for white people to pay for everything.\"\nA more hard-minded policy toward food deliveries would involve, among other things, more monitoring of where relief food goes, American officials said. More of an effort has to be made, they said, to insure that food designated for civilians does not end up in the hands of either government or rebel armies.\nOn the rebel sides of both the Ethiopian and Sudanese conflicts, for example, large quantities of food are provided by Western donors with no precise knowledge of where it goes. For the last several years, the United States has quietly provided food to the relief organizations of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front and the Tigrean People's Liberation Front, rebel groups that appear to be on the verge of defeating the Ethiopian Government. The food is moved from Port Sudan across the Sudanese border but is not accompanied by outside monitors. During their recent successful offensives, the Ethiopian rebels captured the best food-producing areas in Ethiopia -- the provinces of Gojjam and Gondar -- presenting another reason, some Washington officials suggest, for slowing the unmonitored food across the Sudanese border.\nSimilarly, the United States has been sending food through Kenya to rebel-held southern Sudan. In southern Sudan, there are fewer aid officials from outside agencies than ever before. This is in part because of the increasingly hostile attitude of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army and the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association toward Western relief officials.\nSome United Nations food monitors have been expelled by the rebel army in the last year because, according to United Nations officials, they asked too many questions.\nAnd when Mr. Kouchner left southern Sudan he took with him a French volunteer doctor who had been thrown in a pit -- a form of jail -- by the rebels after taking a photograph of a water pump. The doctor, Jean Michel Bouvard of the organization Aide Medicale Internationale, said the rebel group also denied him use of the United Nations radio to contact the outside world.\nMr. Kouchner asked the rebels to allow the doctor to use the radio but when they refused, the doctor cut his stay short and left.

I mean real money, something like thirty or forty dollars.\nIn my reverie, I would go straight down to Macy's book department, whose stock I knew by heart from hours of wandering cashless along the shelves.\nThere I would spend my dream money, selecting Poe and O'Neill in the satisfyingly hefty Modern Library Giants edition, that three-volume Shakespeare for $4.95, or a book of India travels for a dollar, careful not to go over my lavish budget, enjoying every moment while I strolled, enjoying it even in retrospect when I shook myself into reality and got off at the City College subway stop.\nNow, somewhat older, I daydream in larger terms, about what I would do if the Government showed up at my office one day and asked me how to spend bigger money -- say $2.5 billion for foreign aid, or even $150 billion.\nWe are told that the United States must lend at least $2.5 billion to the Soviet Union this year for agricultural products -- $1 billion already provided and an additional $1.5 billion the Bush Administration seems determined to give to Moscow. Various governments and economists say it would cost the West about $30 billion a year for at least five years to bolster the Soviet economy, and they tell us it is a bargain.\nI don't know about that. Loans guaranteed by the U.S. -- low rate, long term and non-collateralized -- to a bankrupt country with hidden assets are tax-paid foreign aid. So part of that money is mine and yours, which should concentrate our minds on how it is spent. Let's start small, with a dream stake of that $2.5 billion in agricultural credits.\nNobody wants Soviet citizens to go hungry. But if hunger-relief is the goal, the Soviet Union does not seem in worse condition than Ethiopia, the Sudan or Bangladesh.\nIf the goal is economic assistance to shore up countries emerging from the disaster of Communism I would pick from the shelf those that have already emerged. How about more for Poland? The Poles are not only jumping fully into the rough currents of free enterprise but were the victims of the Soviet Union, where Mr. Gorbachev still has not dipped a toe into the water. And though the Soviet Parliament passed a law allowing free emigration, it won't take effect until 1993.\nIf the goal is to help countries that have overthrown dictatorship, here's an idea. How about Haiti, Nicaragua and Panama? It would certainly be nice if for once the U.S. devoted enough money and continuous attention to making economic showcases out of impoverished neighbors who fought for political freedom.\nThe heart of the issue, of course, is whether money spent now for Mr. Gorbachev's Government will solve or perpetuate the Soviet crisis. The problem is that Mr. Gorbachev's Government cannot get food from the Soviet field to the Soviet stomach any better than could Stalin's. It is not just money credit but political credit Mr. Gorbachev wants -- economic help now against economic change tomorrow.\nSenator Bill Bradley of New Jersey has asked the President to look into the realities of the Soviet system that cause the problem. How much is lost to waste, corruption, and policies that make the black markets and shortages inevitable? Is the centralized system being used to coerce the republics, by holding back food from certain maverick regions? (Yes.) Here's a question from Soviet dissidents: How many officials and ex-officials of the Communist bureaucracy are selling contracts to the West and battening on food profits?\nAnd what about collateral? If the Gorbachev Government needs food supplies, it has plenty of resources it could put up -- billions in gold bullion and diamonds, for instance. It could avoid need for credits if it just stopped spending billions for arms to the Afghan Government and for Castro-propping.\nAnswers received, Americans can decide on the urgency of additional Soviet agricultural credits.\nBut after that we should wait until Mr. Gorbachev or his successor make fundamental changes in the Soviet economic system, which of course would make it totally un-Soviet. Until then, we should take that $150 billion in hand and spend a little time strolling in our minds, dreaming of how it could be spent, and for whom."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1991-05-08T05:00:00.000Z\nINTERNATIONAL A3-16\nThe Bangladesh relief effort is not adequate to help the survivors of the deadly cyclone, relief agency and United Nations officials said.

Now, for the first time, he says he is feeling optimistic.\nIt is not that disasters are being prevented. \"There are more and more because we hear more about them,\" he said. \"The volcano in the Philippines, an earthquake in Georgia, the aftermath of Kurdistan and Bangladesh, famine in the Horn of Africa. Just that!\"\nAs co-founder of the French group Doctors Without Borders, he has argued that repressive governments have no right to keep aid away from the needy. And during the Kurdish refugee crisis, the principle of \"humanitarian intervention\" was accepted by the United Nations.\n\"I think a universal conscience is taking shape,\" he said in a recent interview. \"It's beginning to demand a minimal respect for human rights. It is an important advance that people recognize that suffering belongs to everyone, that it is not affected by borders.\"\nA 51-year-old gastro-enterologistturned-politician, Dr. Kouchner can share credit for this change because, as the top French official for humanitarian affairs, a sub-Cabinet position, he helped bring the plight of the Kurdish refugees to the attention of the Security Council after the gulf war.\nOn April 5, the Council approved a resolution demanding that Iraq give access to Kurdistan to international aid groups and instructed the Secretary General to mobilize United Nations agencies to help the refugees.\nThe resolution fell short of creating \"a right of humanitarian intervention,\" but Dr. Kouchner believes it took a step in that direction. \"The United Nations has already approved a right to assistance requiring governments to provide access corridors for humanitarian aid,\" he said. \"Now we must codify the right to intervene.\"\n\"It may take 20 years, but it's a beginning. At Auschwitz, most people didn't know and nothing was done. In Biafra 25 years ago, people knew, they saw what was happening and they did nothing. Now in Kurdistan, people knew, they saw and they did something.\"\nWhen humanitarian intervention should be allowed is more complicated, he acknowledged. \"We can't start by saying, after 703 victims, we will intervene. And people will ask, why this country and not that country? But we can start by conditioning aid to human rights -- and that's intervention.\"\nBut he also said that the famine in war zones of the Sudan and the Horn of Africa cannot await debate. This year, he led a truck convoy with 850 tons of food into the southern Sudan.\nDr. Kouchner sees his job as one of drawing public attention to imminent or existing disasters. For this reason, he said, the press is his most important ally.\nThe so-called \"French doctors\" -- as Doctors Without Borders and Doctors of the World are known -- are invariably found at the scene of catastrophes. The paradox is that Dr. Kouchner, who co-founded Doctors of the World after breaking with Doctors Without Borders in 1981, is not on speaking terms with either group.\nThey accuse him of being preoccupied with self-promotion. \"They reproach me for having succeeded, which is very French,\" he said."}, {"text": "Stark Data On Women: 100 Million Are Missing\n1991-11-05T05:00:00.000Z\nLITTLE girls in China no longer have their feet crushed by foot-binding, and widows in India are no longer supposed to be roasted alive on the funeral pyres of their husbands. But a stark statistic testifies to women's continuing unequal status: at least 60 million females in Asia are missing and feared dead, victims of nothing more than their sex. Worldwide, research suggests, the number of missing females may top 100 million.\nIf sex discrimination in the West means office harassment or fewer good jobs for women, in the third world it often means death. A traditional preference for boys translates quickly -- in China, India and many other developing countries -- into neglect and death for girls. While the discrimination is widely seen as a relic of outdated attitudes, in fact the problem appears to be getting worse in Asia. Recently released census data in China and India show that in both countries the sex ratio of the population became more skewed over the course of the last decade.\nThe tens of millions of missing include females of all ages who are aborted or killed at birth or who die because they are given less food than males, or because family members view a daughter with diarrhea as a nuisance but a son with diarrhea as a medical crisis requiring a doctor.\n\"If a boy gets sick, the parents may send him to the hospital at once,\" acknowledged Li Honggui, an official in China's State Family Planning Commission. \"But if a girl gets sick, the parents may say to themselves, 'Well, we'll see how she is tomorrow.' \" A Shadow on Census Data\nRemarkably little research has been conducted on the plight of the missing women, and even their disappearance is discernible merely as a shadow on the census data and mortality statistics.\n\"It's shocking that so little is known,\" said Amartya Sen, a Harvard economist who has tried to call attention to the issue. Professor Sen estimates that considerably more than 100 million females are missing around the world, and he asserts that the reason the shortfall is getting worse in some areas is that girls are not allowed to benefit as much as boys from the improvements in health care and nutrition that are lowering death rates in developing countries.\nAny investigation into the case of the missing women begins with one fact: 5 or 6 percent more boys are born than girls, but in normal circumstances males die at higher rates at every age thereafter. Typically in the West, where female infanticide is not considered an issue, children are disproportionately male, the number of men and women evens out by the time people are in their 20's or 30's and the elderly are disproportionately female. In relatively advanced countries like the United States, Britain and Poland, there are about 105 females for every 100 males. In India, however, a census this year found only 92.9 females for every 100 males, down from 93.4 in the 1981 census and 93.0 in the 1971 census. And in China, the 1990 census found just 93.8 females for every 100 males, compared with 94.1 at the time of the 1982 census. By a conservative calculation there are 30 million females missing in China, about 5 percent of the national total and more than are missing in any other country. A United Nations report this summer, \"The World's Women,\" found that other countries with very low ratios of females include Afghanistan, with 94.5 for every 100 males; Bangladesh, 94.1; Bhutan, 93.3; Nepal, 94.8; Pakistan, 92.1; Papua New Guinea, 92.8, and Turkey, 94.8.\n\"Millions of women have died because they're women,\" said Sharon Capeling-Alakija, director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, adding that mothers as well as fathers are responsible. \"In most societies, women are the bearers of tradition, and if decisions are made between boy children and girl children, women were involved in making those decisions.\" While the countries with shortages of women are all quite poor, it is not inevitable that poor countries will mistreat and kill their females. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, poverty and disease make life perhaps more grim than on any other continent, yet there are 102 females for every 100 males. In Latin America and the Caribbean, for all the influence of machismo, there are equal numbers of males and females. Even within India, there are huge differences. The southern state of Kerala, which is among the most educated, has a ratio of 104 females for every 100 males, almost the same as the United States and Europe. Despite the immense number of missing females, it is virtually impossible to find human faces to match the statistics. Strolling around Chinese villages, it is easy to find out about girls who died of pneumonia or some other disease but difficult to prove that they were victims of their sex. Statistical Challenge\nIt is only in the overall statistics that the shortfall becomes clear. A study published early this year by a Swedish expert, Sten Johansson, suggested that in countries without strong patterns of discrimination about 130 infant boys die for every 100 infant girls. In China, however, only about 112 boys die for every 100 girls -- presumably because boys are favored.\nThe Swedish study calculated that these data point to 44,000 female deaths each year that are the result of unequal treatment, just among infants less than 1 year old.\nLikewise, two studies in India reportedly found that for most of the first year of life, girls had lower mortality rates than boys, but that later in infancy boys did better than girls. This may be because early in life the infants were fed from the breast, which was gender blind, but that parents later favored their sons over their daughters in allocating food and medical treatment.\nPerhaps the most challenging problem statistically is to determine the number of missing females around the world. The difficulty is to derive the sex ratio that would exist in a population if males and females were treated equally.\nThe ratios in Western countries are perhaps inapplicable to developing countries because of the difference in age structures. A population with a lower average age should have a higher proportion of males, because children are disproportionately male. Thus a country with a short life expectancy or with a rapidly growing population -- both reasons for a low average age -- would have relatively fewer females than Western nations. A Reporting Problem\nEven so, the 2 percent surplus of females in sub-Saharan Africa and the 4 percent surplus of females in Kerala may suggest that those ratios are benchmarks for the third world if it were gender-blind. If one picks a ratio, such as 103 females to 100 males, as the one that would prevail in an equitable developing country, that would indicate that more than 100 million females are missing around the world.\nAnsley J. Coale, a Princeton University demographer, outlines a much more sophisticated method in a forthcoming article in Population and Development Review, the journal of the Population Council in New York. Professor Coale calculates a hypothetical sex ratio that might be expected to exist in each of a half-dozen countries, based on their fertility and mortality rates. For example, he calculates that China should have 101 males to 100 females, and that India should have 102 males for each 100 females.\nThose ratios suggest that 30 million Chinese females are missing, along with 22.8 million Indian females, 3.1 million Pakistanis, 1.6 million Bangladeshis, 600,000 Egyptians and 200,000 Nepalese. In these countries alone, nearly 60 million females are unaccounted for by this method -- a figure Mr. Coale notes is lower than other estimates but one he calls \"still distressing.\"\nUsing Professor Coase's method, 5.2 percent of females are unaccounted for in China, along with 5.6 percent of females in India, 7.8 percent in Pakistan, 3.8 percent in Bangladesh and smaller proportions in other countries.\nHuang Baoshan, a spokesman for China's State Family Planning Commission, suggests that at least in China a significant number of the missing females are very much alive but have eluded census takers because peasants officially limited to one or two children are reluctant to report the birth of a daughter.\nStill, before the \"one child policy\" was introduced a dozen years ago, there was no obvious reason to under-report girls. Yet even then, millions of girls were missing. The 1953 census found 107.6 males per 100 females -- a ratio even more skewed than today's, presumably largely because of female infanticide and discrimination against young girls in the first half of the century. The Ultrasound Option\nThe killing of newborn girls was banned in India in 1870, and was denounced and outlawed by the Communists after they imposed order on the Chinese countryside after the 1949 revolution.\nNevertheless, female infanticide has deep roots in rural China -- partly because infants were not always regarded as full persons until they had lived for a year or grown their teeth. An old fable recounts approvingly how a couple buried their daughter alive so they would have more food to give to the man's mother. In burying their child, the couple found a treasure and were thus rewarded for their filial piety.\nEach year in China, about 600,000 fewer girl births are reported to the authorities than there should be, based on the number of boy births and the ratio that should exist between them. A large number appear to be surreptitiously given up for adoption, and many others are simply raised quietly by their parents or relatives without registering the birth. Some are also drowned at birth by a midwife who keeps a bucket by the mother's side, in case the infant proves to be an unwanted girl, but it is impossible to know how often this happens.\nThese days, technology has presented parents with a tidier option than infanticide: ultrasound tests that determine whether the sex of a fetus.\n\"Everyone wants a son, so they get an ultrasound test and if it's a girl they have an abortion,\" said a businessman from a rural area in Fujian Province. Though the practice is illegal in China, the man said: \"There's no law for the doctors. It's all money and connections.\"\nIn India, amniocentesis is sometimes used in the cities to determine the sex of a fetus so that it can be aborted if it is female.\nThe United Nations report cited 8,000 abortions in Bombay after the parents learned of the sex of the fetus, only one of which involved a male. Professor Sen believes that the practice is not widespread enough throughout India to account for a significant proportion of the millions of missing females. In China, however, anecdotal evidence suggests that selective abortion may be having an impact on the statistics.\nChinese law prohibits doctors from telling prospective parents the sex of the fetus, but the prohibition simply raises the cost of the bribe to extricate the information from the ultrasound operator. Even official reports acknowledge the practice.\n\"Ultrasound has brought great joy to peasants who still carry old ideas,\" Science and Technology Daily reported earlier this year. It quoted a peasant as saying: \"Ultrasound is really worthwhile, even though my wife had to go through four abortions to get a son.\""}, {"text": "PLAN WOULD LET BAGHDAD SELL OIL\n1991-07-23T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Bush Administration is drawing up a plan to allow the Security Council to remove some sanctions against Iraq to allow Baghdad to sell petroleum, senior Administration officials said today. The profits would be used to pay for food and medicine, war reparations and the destruction of weapons.\nThe plan, which was drafted by the State Department, is being circulated for review within the department and at the Pentagon, the White House and the Central Intelligence Agency. Officials said that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was expected to approve it. It would also need President Bush's approval before it could be presented to the United Nations Security Council as the basis for a resolution.\nIf the Bush Administration puts the plan forward, as many officials expect, it will represent a major shift in policy. Currently, Iraq is not allowed to sell its oil because of stringent United Nations sanctions imposed after the invasion of Kuwait, and until now the Administration has argued that Iraq had hidden assets in its Central Bank as well as gold reserves that should be used to buy food and medicine, which are not covered by sanctions.\nAdministration officials said the examination of a new approach reflects a growing realization that the postwar economic strangulation was hurting the Iraqi people rather than weakening President Saddam Hussein's grip on power. The plan is a response to reports by independent medical teams, United Nations officials and the news media of widespread malnutrition and disease in Iraq, as well as an attempt to counter calls for a more sweeping removal of economic sanctions on humanitarian grounds, the officials said.\n\"We don't want to see more reports about massive starvation and disease in Iraq,\" said one senior Administration official who is working on the plan. \"We know we will eventually have to go this way. We're not there yet, but we'll have to get there.\" Another senior official described the plan as \"a good way to maintain the bulk of sanctions and not be on the wrong side of a potentially emotional issue.\"\nThe sanctions review comes at an uncomfortable time for the Administration, which charged again today that Iraq has not disclosed all the details of its secret nuclear program. \"We are still very skeptical about their disclosures and believe they have more to tell us,\" the State Department's deputy spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said at the State Department briefing today.\nSeveral days ago the five permanent Security Council members -- the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China -- gave Iraq until July 25 to declare a final inventory of its nuclear sites. But one senior Administration official today described the date as \"an artificial deadline, not necessarily a turning point.\" The United States had threatened to resume bombing if Iraq did not comply. 'Absurd and Indefensible'\nThe move to ease sanctions against Iraq was pressed at the United Nations today by Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the head of a United Nations Commission that is assessing Iraq's humanitarian needs. The Prince told the Security Council's sanctions committee about a worsening crisis for Iraq's civilian population and suggested that the country be allowed to sell oil to import food, medicine, and some agricultural and industrial materials.\nPrince Sadruddin later told reporters that it was \"absurd and indefensible\" for the United Nations to pay for Iraq's humanitarian needs, \"when numerous other urgent crises and disasters, from Bangladesh to the Horn of Africa, cry out for our attention.\" He added, \"Iraq has considerable oil reserves and should pay to meet these needs herself.\"\nThe United States has found itself increasingly isolated in the Security Council as other members and officials have made a two-pronged argument: first, that the only way to force Iraq to pay for war reparations and for the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction, both mandated by Security Council resolutions,is with its own oil revenues; and second, that the Security Council should force Iraq to buy much-needed food and medicine with oil profits that could be monitored or even disbursed inside the country through the United Nations. Special Account Suggested\nThe first hint of a change in United States policy came in testimony last Thursday by John R. Bolton, the assistant Secretary of State for Interational Organizations, before a House foreign affairs subcommittee. Mr. Bolton described a new mechanism to provide humanitarian assistance \"under a regime of tight controls and strict monitoring.\" He said that the United States was consulting with members of the Security Council and its coaltion partners \"on the appropriate operational ways to do this.\"\nOne likely scenario would be for the United Nations to control Iraq's oil revenues through a special account or accounts. Thirty percent of the revenues would pay for reparations for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last August, a formula worked out by the Security Council's sanctions committee, and the rest would pay other bills.\nAdministration officials stressed that oil sales would go forward only if strict conditions were met, and that the details of the plan still have to be worked out and discussed with coalition partners. Because an international body would control the funds, the officials argued that the plan does not reflect a weakening of international sanctions or of the Administration's resolve to continue to exert maximum pressure on Baghdad. Policy About-Face\nBut the plan is a significant departure from public statements by Mr. Bush and some senior officials in recent months that Mr. Hussein had to be punished. On May 7, Robert M. Gates, the deputy national security adviser and the nominee for Director for Central Intelligence, said in a speech that \"Iraqis will pay the price while he is in power.\" Mr. Gates added: \"All possible sanctions will be maintained until he is gone.\" On May 20, Mr. Bush acknowledged to reporters that while there are some instances in which Iraq must sell its oil to comply with United Nations resolutions, \"my view is we don't want to lift these sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.\"\nBut Administration officials have said, albeit quietly and reluctantly, that Mr. Hussein has successfully consolidated power since the end of the Persian Gulf war and may remain President of Iraq for years."}, {"text": "Harrison Plans Tour Backed by Clapton and Band\n1991-07-24T05:00:00.000Z\nGeorge Harrison, ending a long absence from the road, plans to tour Japan in December with Eric Clapton. Roger Forrester, Mr. Clapton's manager, said yesterday that the performances would feature Mr. Harrison as the headliner, with Mr. Clapton and his touring band as his backing group.\nMr. Forrester said that if the Japanese tour went well, Mr. Harrison and Mr. Clapton might also tour the United States and Europe together.\nThe Japan tour, which includes 13 concerts between Dec. 1 and Dec. 18, is to be Mr. Harrison's first since 1974, and Mr. Clapton's first public appearances since his 4-year-old son, Conor, died in a fall from a window in Manhattan in March. Neither Mr. Clapton nor Mr. Harrison could be reached for comment. Mr. Forrester said they were both traveling.\nThe repertory for the tour is to be drawn from the songs Mr. Harrison, who is 48 years old, wrote during his years as lead guitarist of the Beatles, as well as from his nine solo albums and his work with the Traveling Wilburys, a whimsical all-star recording band Mr. Harrison formed in 1988 with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison (who died that December), Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne.\nNone of the other Wilburys or former Beatles are expected to join the ensemble, which includes, besides the 46-year-old Mr. Clapton, Nathan East, bassist; Greg Phillinganes, keyboardist; Ray Cooper and Steve Ferrone, percussionists and Tessa Niles and Katie Kissoon, vocalists. Mr. Forrester said another guitarist and keyboardist would be added to the group.\nOf the other former Beatles, Ringo Starr toured the United States in 1989, and Paul McCartney has undertaken several world tours, the latest in 1990. But although Mr. Harrison's recording career came out of a decadelong slump with the release of \"Cloud Nine\" in 1987 and the first Traveling Wilburys record in 1988, he has resisted the lure of the road until now.\nMr. Harrison's only post-Beatles outing, a 46-concert tour of North America in 1974, was generally regarded as disastrous: during the tour rehearsals, Mr. Harrison strained his voice badly and remained hoarse through the entire tour.\nMr. Harrison has, however, made numerous individual concert appearances over the last two decades. He staged two shows at Madison Square Garden to raise money for food relief in Bangladesh in August 1971, also with Mr. Clapton at his side, and he has played briefly at other charity concerts, including a concert for a Birmingham hospital in 1986 and the Prince's Trust gala in London in 1987.\nHe also turned up at a Deep Purple concert in Australia in 1984, and last year he performed at one of Mr. Clapton's concerts in Los Angeles. His most recent cameo appearance was in Blackpool, England, in March, at a convention honoring the 1940's British music hall star George Formby. At the convention, Mr. Harrison sang several Formby songs, accompanying himself on the ukulele."}, {"text": "Group Efforts Back Neediest Cases Fund\n1991-02-20T05:00:00.000Z\nAfter Thomas F. Liotti gave $200 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, he sent letters to the 200 other offices in the building where he works, urging them to contribute to the fund.\nThere is no way to track how many may have done so, but Mr. Liotti, a lawyer in Garden City, L.I., recently vowed to make the same plea next year and already has plans to expand his mailing list.\nThe gift \"is, without question, among the most important actions that I take during the year,\" Mr. Liotti wrote. \"Its impact is real, direct and immediate. The fund is so worthwhile that I wish you would keep it going all year. Imagine the good that our combined resources could bring to the poor.\"\nMore than 13,000 people and organizations have donated to the 1990-91 appeal for the Neediest Cases, and many of the gifts were the result of group efforts involving families, school classes, businesses and clubs. Often, the gifts came after conversations among business colleagues, talks between parents and children or discussions between teachers and their classes. 'I Really Care About People'\nPerry Fleisig-Green, 7 years old, gave $15 of her holiday money to the Neediest Cases. She said that her parents had told her about the fund. They promised that they would match any gift that she sent.\n\"I decided that I wanted to give, and it feels good,\" she said. In her letter to the fund, she wrote: \"I really care about people not having a home or having a home and not having enough to eat. It makes me very sad to see someone begging for money.\"\nIt was a series of well-orchestrated conversations that led to the gift of $100,322.80 from hundreds of employees at Wall Street investment banking firms. The Financial Analysts Seminar Committee, a professional group, mobilized a network of employees at 16 firms to talk with their colleagues and solicit donations. Checks came from employees at Bankers Trust, Bear Stearns, Blackstone Group, Dillon Read, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, First Boston, Goldman Sachs, Kidder Peabody, Lazard Freres, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Oppenheimer, Paine Webber, Prudential-Bache and Salomon Brothers.\nFor 79 years, the Neediest Cases has provided food, shelter and clothing to thousands of poor people. But the fund also has had another more intangible goal -- to allow donors to experienc the satisfaction of helping others who are less fortunate. Contributions From Students\nProceeds from the Neediest Cases are given to seven charities to help the sick and the poor. The New York Times pays for the fund's overhead. The 1990-91 campaign, which opened in November, closes in nine days.\nA number of contributions came from students in the New York City schools. Three second-grade classes at P.S. 346 in Brooklyn sent $281.62 -- the proceeds from a cake sale and a used toy sale. A $50 gift came from the Indo-Pakistani-Bangladeshi Club at John F. Kennedy High School in the Bronx.\nAnd the 26 students in Eleanor Comins's third-grade class at P.S. 255 in Brooklyn raised $75 for the fund. \"The children would like to share their good fortune with those less fortunate,\" Ms. Comins wrote.

There is no spontaneity or joy here, however. The men and a few dozen listless women are mercenaries of a sort, trucked in from the neighboring state of Haryana on the promise of a few rupees or a free trip to town to provide a sea of faces and applause. The portable crowd belongs to Devi Lal, Haryana's political godfather and the Deputy Prime Minister of India. He's sitting in a shaded pavilion, surrounded by a dozen fawning politicians who are preparing to kick off their campaigns for national elections this week. They are served mango juice.\nOn the ground, Devi Lal's people, dusty and thirsty and stuck there until the boss speaks, grow restless as speaker after speaker drones on. A few get up and shout for Devi Lal. They want the main event, but they are polite. Men with sticks tell them to sit down.\nFinally, Devi Lal himself -- a tall, imposing 77-year-old man with snowy hair, dressed as always in crisp white, from his starched kurta shirt to the pointed toes of his Ali Baba slippers -- finally moves to the microphone, three hours behind schedule. The crowd springs to life, applauds appreciatively and cheers lustily at the conclusion. Their job done, Devi Lal's people walk out on the next speaker, the country's Prime Minister, Chandra Shekhar.\nDevi Lal -- who fills his coffers with gold coronets and walking sticks of solid silver pressed upon him by constituents, and whose notorious son, Om Prakash Chautala, doesn't hesitate to send out goon squads to intimidate rival candidates -- is a symbol to many Indians of much that is wrong in a democracy that was once hailed as a model for the third world.\nNo political party or institution is free of the taint of nepotism, criminality and violence, says a retired police official, S. K. Ghosh, in \"The Indian Mafia,\" a provocative new book about organized crime and politics. \"In return for a ring of security, our politicians have surrendered their powers to gangsters,\" says Ghosh, who served under both British and Indian administrations and is now director of the independent Law Research Institute of Calcutta. \"As our rulers increasingly fail to redress fundamental economic and social problems, they have to take greater recourse to muscle power to keep the disenchanted masses in line.\"\nThe idealistic country of Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru is fast passing into history. A deeply troubled India is approaching this week's national election in a mood of cynicism and foreboding. Myths are being exposed and new problems are piling up for the world's most populous democracy, with 844 million people and more than half a billion eligible voters.\nFifty years ago, Nehru argued convincingly for a secular, socialist and democratic state. After independence in 1947, he constructed a foreign policy based on \"a special relationship\" with Moscow and leadership of the nonaligned nations. Now these pillars of modern India are crumbling.\nIn several respects, India's descent into confusion and despair mirrors that of its former superpower sponsor, the Soviet Union. Having relied heavily on Soviet experts and socialist theories of development, India now finds itself burdened with outdated technology and uncompetitive industries. The economy is strangled by inefficiency and corruption and saddled with high foreign debts, mounting budget deficits and inflation that soared to 17 percent last year.\nA nation of diverse ethnic and religious groups cobbled together by British colonialism, India now seems on the verge of being ripped apart by separatist movements and religious violence. Scores are killed daily in clashes between dissidents and security forces. To maintain order, the Government has been forced to rule three strategic border states virtually by martial law. But the harsh measures only breed stronger resistance.\nIndian democracy is being strained as never before by gangsterism and corruption, some of it tawdry. For example, a Supreme Court Justice is the subject of impeachment proceedings for, among other things, taking furniture from an official residence.\nUnlike the Soviet Union, India has yet to repudiate unequivocally its past policies, many of which stemmed from an anti-Western, anti-imperialist ideology that stressed development without dependence on multinational corporations or lending institutions. Even after the Soviet turn to the West, Indians still broadly support rules that tightly proscribe foreign investment.\nThe future is not entirely bleak. Food production, one of India's greatest successes, remains strong, and famine is not even an issue (although malnutrition is). Efforts to privatize and decentralize the economy in the 1980's, while piecemeal, did contribute to a burst of growth, and the country has a considerable number of highly educated professional and technical workers. Finally, despite the strains, India remains a functioning democracy that is at least discussing the issues that, for now, paralyze it.\nMany people insist that the country, which has weathered crisis after crisis since its birth in 1947, will overcome these new tribulations in time. \"The idea that this country is falling apart should not be taken seriously,\" says K. Natwar Singh, a former diplomat and parliamentary candidate of the Congress Party, now led by Nehru's grandson, Rajiv Gandhi.\n\"It has serious problems, but we have the mechanisms, the institutions, the wisdom, the resilience,\" Singh continues. \"The Indian national train won't derail. It might meet with an accident here and there, but it will come out of it.\"\nBut some are less optimistic. \"In terms of catastrophe theory, you can have a whole series of negative trends, and they can continue for some time in a stable body politic,\" says Prem Shankar Jha, an economist and adviser to Vishwanath Pratap Singh, the leader of the Janata Dal Party. \"But then suddenly you come to a precipice, and you go over. That's the way things are developing in India just now.\"\nJ. D. Sethi, an economist and former Government planner, wrote recently that \"there is a view that India is one of those societies whose history is coming to an end.\" While not necessarily accepting so dim a view, he concluded: \"Indian society is indeed being pushed into chaos from all directions. Above all, the norms of state behavior and societal values are collapsing.\"\nIT IS TWILIGHT IN Calcutta on a winter evening. In a park called the Maidan, the electric company has switched on an extravagant display of lights and water called the Fountain of Joy, and everybody wants to have a look. The traffic jam starts a mile away. Cars creep along a road winding through the park, circling the Victoria Memorial Plaza, engulfed by an ocean of humanity.\nStop the car for a moment, and tiny hands reach up to beg; little barefoot bodies with bright eyes, who barely reach the window. An open taxi door invites a crowd of petitioners: the handicapped, slender mothers in dirty saris clutching bony babies with vacant stares, hustlers with myriad gadgets and services to sell.\nSomewhere in the background, the fountains play. But they are obscured by a tangle of carts and stalls, heaped with food and drink. Underfoot, the grass has turned to a slippery sea of mud and trampled garbage. The noise is as unremitting as it is deafening, from car horns to the spiels of the food hawkers to the cries of children.\nA park, a temple, a market, a city street, a bus stop -- there are few places in urban India where lives do not collide, few places to find privacy or silence. In India's largest city, Bombay, up to 5 million of the metropolitan area's 12 million people are living as squatters in overcrowded apartments, in condemned buildings, on pavements, along the shoulders of roads and on scraps of open land that have somehow escaped development, says Sharad Pawar, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra state.\nIngenuity is squandered on survival. Outside the Taj Mahal Hotel, near the Gateway of India arch in Bombay's historic old harbor, children drag an exhausted, flea-bitten dog from the shade of a parked car and order it to stand on a pyramid of tin cans. Nearby, a woman holds an infant aloft on a pole, signaling to horrified visitors in the air-conditioned rooms above that they should throw money.\nIn a country where, in 1988, 612 people were packed into each square mile (compared with 66 in the United States), dwindling natural resources must sustain a population growing by 18 million a year. But forests are disappearing as illegal logging goes on with the connivance of corrupt officials, and as millions of poor villagers cut millions of trees for fuel and cremation pyres.\nOn the drive from the plains of West Bengal to the old British hill station of Darjeeling, the winding road that hugs the mountainside is showered with falling rocks, harbingers of landslides on slopes stripped of vegetation. Women trudge along, bent under heavy bundles of twigs and branches. Every year, they say, they walk farther for fuel. In Darjeeling, which once offered refuge from a pestilential climate, population growth has outstripped supplies of drinking water, and women with water pots hike miles up and down steep hills to distant streams and springs.\nThe World Resources Institute, a Washington research group, lists India among the world's top five producers of greenhouse gases, which scientists believe are responsible for global warming. In addition to chlorofluorocarbons, India produces large amounts of methane, from solid-waste dumps, livestock and wet-rice cultivation, and carbon dioxide, from fossil fuels and deforestation.\nInternational experts estimate that no more than 10 percent of India can any longer be described as forested. In parts of some states, environmentalists report losses of up to 98 percent of old woodlands, some razed for plantation monocrops, often eucalyptus trees, which consume enormous quantities of water and soil nutrients. Silt from balding, eroding hillsides in the Himalayas is slowly filling in huge river basins, leading to catastrophic flash floods, particularly downriver in Bangladesh.\nCities and industrial sites use rivers as sewers; excess fertilizer and pesticides from farms leach into canals and streams. Maneka Gandhi, Minister of State for the Environment and Forests in the last two Governments, says some of India's greatest rivers, among them the sacred Ganges and the Jamuna, are biologically dead and chemically lethal. To practically nobody's surprise, a plan to clean the waterways, launched with great fanfare in 1986, is falling behind schedule.\nAccording to a confidential report done for a foreign-aid organization, three-quarters of India's water supply is polluted, mostly by chemicals or bacteria. Air quality in big Indian cities now ranks among the worst in the world.\nIndian social scientists are concerned at the correlation of corruption, political violence and overpopulation with poor health and education as well as illiteracy -- especially among women -- in one group of backward northern states. In this explosive region -- from Rajasthan to Bihar, taking in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and part of Haryana -- almost every social indicator is a warning.\nThe region, with more than 41 percent of the national population, has annual population-growth rates generally higher than the Indian average of 2.1 percent, according to the 1991 census. Literacy rates are considerably lower than the national average of about 52 percent. Only 38 percent of the people in Rajasthan and Bihar can read and write. Literacy rates among women are worse: 20 percent in Rajasthan and 23 percent in Bihar. In rural areas, the literacy rate among women routinely drops below 10 percent; in remote areas of Rajasthan, female literacy falls below 2 percent. Demographers say that high female illiteracy is one factor in the failure of family planning.\nWhile calling itself an industrial and technological nation, India has become the world's largest producer of illiterates and child laborers. With a population likely to overtake China's early in the next century, India has no effective national family-planning program. And, no matter what the law putatively requires, there is no compulsory education, even at the primary level, except in a few enlightened areas. A third of its children are born with irreversible malnutrition.\n\"We are breeding a nation of morons,\" an Indian development expert said with a mixture of horror and grief.\nTHE COUNTRY HAS no shortage of experts eager to tackle its social, environmental and economic problems. But they are consistently stymied by a legendary bureaucracy that, in addition to stifling initiative, often seems more concerned with presenting a picture of a working society than with actually building one. Bunker Roy, whose model rural community at Tilonia, in Rajasthan, became the inspiration for many villages in the semiarid region around it, wrote in The Times of India recently that \"simply put, the politician, planner and bureaucrat are lying to the nation.\"\nThousands of villages that are listed as having drinking water are in reality dry, Roy says, forcing villagers to walk miles for water. Wells may have been dug and pumps installed, he says, but once something breaks down, it's finished. The Government doesn't follow up and the people just walk away.\n\"Primary-school teachers' quarters are constructed that are never occupied,\" Roy continues. Doctors who, on paper, are posted in primary health centers in rural areas are more than likely running private clinics in the neighborhood with Government equipment and medicines and collecting a Government salary to boot, he says.\n\"Roads are constructed that are not supposed to last more than a year, so that they can be constructed every year and shown on the record as new roads,\" Roy says. \"Villages fully electrified on paper have to make do with kerosene lamps.\"\nPrime Minister Shekhar, the head of the caretaker Government leading India into elections, draws attention to India's rural hospitals. \"Most of the people are dying because of infection,\" he said. \"In 500, 600 district hospitals, at least you could make one recovery room and one operating theater air-conditioned. Was it not possible in 40 years to do it if there was a will?\"\nLakshmi Chand Jain, 65, a follower of Mohandas Gandhi who holds Asia's highest prize for public service, the Ramon Magsaysay Award, recently told a New Delhi audience that 44 years of overly centralized Government have \"stifled, if not almost snuffed out, the very breath of freedom.\"\n\"We have handicapped millions of people without shooting them, without sending them to the gallows,\" he said. \"The only skill considered necessary for them is the ability to stamp the ballot paper.\"\nIn an interview in his closet-size office, where he directs a small business consulting company, Jain talks about the roots of this human crisis. He finds them in the administration of Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first Prime Minister.\n\"The first error he made was to assume that the next phase of India's emancipation after the British left could be managed without first mobilizing the people and their resources and their energies and their imagination,\" Jain says. \"On the landscape of India, Nehru mounted dams, power plants, steel mills, heavy industry -- all kinds of things that are a credit from a certain viewpoint. But he completely forgot that, apart from the land, there were the people also. The people's own participation -- that never came. Community development became an extension of the bureaucracy. As many of us pointed out at that time, there was probably some development in it, but there was very little community.\" Strong local government, the bedrock of American democracy, has never been cultivated in most of India.\n\"In a society where people are in abundance, and the diversity is enormous from village to village, household to household, the mobilization of those people -- their local knowledge, their own resources -- has to be the first step,\" Jain argues. \"In the present scheme it's not even the last step. So we have made our task, which was already very difficult by all reckoning, much more difficult than necessary.\"\nThe drift away from the federal spirit of India's Constitution during 40 years of Congress Party rule, particularly under the regime of the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, not only stifled regional growth but also helped to precipitate the separatist movements that India now faces in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and the northeastern state of Assam. Disaffected minority groups, which might have been pacified by greater autonomy, turned in their rage to revolution. \"I've never known a time when the integrity of India was so much under strain,\" says Soli Sorabjee, a constitutional lawyer and former Attorney General of India.\n\"Kashmir is now beyond solution,\" says Bharat Wariavwalla, a political and strategic analyst. \"We might keep it by force, but mentally it is not a part of India.\" In prosperous and productive Punjab some disaffected Sikhs talk of returning to Pakistan, reversing the migrations of the 1947 partition, or even of creating a nation they would call Khalistan.\nFinally, suffocating central controls have dragged down an economy that was once the envy of much of the developing world. Slow growth and rising joblessness, in turn, are feeding much of the cynicism, unrest and separatism that threaten the nation today.\n\"You're getting more desperate young men opting for everything from autonomy to secession in more and more parts of the country because they can't get jobs,\" says Prem Shankar Jha, the economist and political columnist. \"They are unable even to get married. They haven't got homes to take their families to. They have no social relevance.\"\nJha says corruption has been a natural outgrowth of a overcentralized economy, where business generally has to pay \"commissions\" to politicians and bureaucrats to smooth and speed the process. \"Industrialists flock like bees to the honey pot,\" Jha says. \"And the honey pot is Delhi.\"\nRahul Singh, a columnist and former newspaper editor, thinks that official corruption has undermined the democratic system itself. \"Democracy is in danger when the people become so disillusioned with their money-grabbing, cynical political leaders that any other system, even military rule, seems better,\" he wrote in The Indian Express. \"We are close to that moment of peril.\"\nBut when it comes to economic reform, India is caught in a snare of its own making. Many people advocate a loosening of central controls and the introduction of modern technology and management. But many other Indians remain suspicious of \"imperialist\" exploitation. And they cling to the myths, heroes and ideas that contributed to the glorious victory over colonialism.\n\"The revisionist school of history is now in operation: dump Gandhi, dump Nehru,\" says K. Natwar Singh, the Congress Party candidate for Parliament, capturing a common sentiment. \"They won't succeed,\" he insists. \"You can't dethrone Gandhi. You can't take away Nehru's colossal achievement. He held this country together for 17 years.\"\nIN LATE MARCH, JUST as India was beginning to gear up for its 10th national election, disturbing reports of a lynching were emerging from a small farming town called Mehrana, about halfway between New Delhi, the national capital, and the city of Agra, home of the Taj Mahal. It was a grisly story, shocking in what it revealed about the brutality of village life and the persistence of violence and discrimination based on caste. The incident at Mehrana spoke to the torment that millions of Indians face daily because of their birth. It illustrates why many of them are for the first time in this election walking long miles under a searing sun, with a few chappatis -- flat Indian breads -- in a knotted cloth for nourishment, to sit attentively at rallies by politicians who promise a social revolution. These are not rent-a-crowd crowds.\nIn Mehrana on March 27, sometime between midnight and dawn, three young people were hanged on a village tree by their relatives and neighbors, who then threw their bodies on a common funeral pyre. The victims were Roshini, a girl of 16, Brijendra, her 18-year-old lover, and Ram Kishen, 22, a friend who had tried to help them elope.\nThe charge was not promiscuity, however, but breaking the taboo of caste. Roshini was a Jat, the dominant caste in the area -- and the caste of Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, a factor in the publicity this story has received. The two young men were Jatavs, a community of outcastes, or Harijans, \"children of God\" to Mahatma Gandhi. A Jat-dominated village council sentenced them all to death after Roshini vowed to remain with her outcaste partner.\n\"A Jat girl marry a Harijan?\" Roshini's mother told a reporter for the news magazine India Today, when asked whether it would not have been better that her daughter live as a pariah than die. \"This may happen in towns, but not here.\"\nThere are many such stories in rural India, particularly in the north. A reporter hears them everywhere: accounts of outcastes pulled off bicycles and beaten because they are required to walk through high-caste neighborhoods, or assaulted for entering Brahmin temples or killed for defying any number of discriminatory rules. A civil rights group in Andhra Pradesh recently found that roadside tea stalls were still routinely setting aside separate glasses for outcastes. All of this is against the law.\nThe Hindu caste system is enormously complex, with thousands of subcastes grouped into four major divisions called varnas. At the top are Brahmins and Kshatriyas, the learned and warrior castes, respectively. They are followed by Vaisyas, the traders and merchants, and Sudras, laborers, servants and others who have low social status but are still in the system.\nUnder them all are the outcastes, people considered impure and therefore untouchable, who do the lowliest jobs. Among them are the more than 600,000 Indian families who still make their livings emptying latrines and chamber pots, carrying away excrement in buckets on their heads. Another subcaste catches rats. Although the national census does not record caste, social scientists estimate that up to three-quarters of India's people are Sudras or outcastes.\nCaste affects everyone, including Indians who are not Hindus -- many of whom tried to escape the system by converting to Islam, Buddhism or Christianity -- and foreigners. On several occasions, I have been subtly but unmistakably served from separate dishes in Brahmin homes.\nEvery political analyst calculates and writes about \"the caste factor\" in election campaigns. Groups like the Jats or the Yadavs, also a northern rural subcaste on the rise, function now as ethnic voting blocs do in American politics, giving a voice to previously powerless groups. The growing political influence of Devi Lal's rural Jat community is the most visible example.\nThis year, the pervasiveness of caste discrimination has been dragged out of the shadows and made an issue by two politicians. One is the former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh, a high-caste Rajput who is campaigning on the theme of social revolution -- achieved primarily through affirmative action in Government hiring -- as a prerequisite to development.\nThe other, Kanshi Ram, is an outcaste who says he is tired of knocking at the door of power and waiting for handouts from parties led by Brahmins. Ram's hero and his party's spiritual leader is the late Bhimrao Ambedkar, an outcaste who was educated in law at Columbia University, under the patronage of an enlightened maharaja, and who was chosen by Nehru to head the committee that wrote India's constitution.\nRam's party won its first three seats in Parliament in 1989. This year he has been courted by almost all the major political organizations, which are eager to share his potentially huge reservoir of votes through an electoral alliance. Ram's party has already cut deeply into the traditional lower caste and outcaste \"vote banks\" of Gandhi's Congress Party.\nMany upper-caste Indians excoriate V. P. Singh as a traitor to his own high-caste heritage. That's no great surprise, say Indians in a position to know, considering that comments passed around Brahmin gatherings (\"Would you want one of their surgeons to operate on you?\") are often crudely derogatory. N. Ram, a leading Indian editor and writer, said that attacks on affirmative action in India could best be described as \"racist\" in the American sense. And so far, he adds, no one has mentioned affirmative action in the private sector, where company hiring policies are never scrutinized.\n\"What I am sure of,\" Singh told an audience in April, \"is that our independence, won after a century of struggle, will remain hollow if the power and authority of the state is not deployed in the pursuit of equity.\"\nTHE NARROW LANES THAT lead to what is momentarily India's most famous religious monument are festooned with barbed wire and policed by zealots. The town is Ayodhya, sacred to Hindus as the birthplace of the god-king Rama, the central character of the epic \"Ramayana.\" The building, however, is clearly a mosque, the Babri Masjid.\nSentries stare menacingly at a visitor who is demonstrably not a Hindu. Off with the leather sandals, bag and the watch strap, they say. This may be a Muslim mosque, but the rules are orthodox Hindu. They have been since 1986, when the disputed building, sealed since 1949 after a similar religious confrontation, was ordered reopened by a local court during the administration of the Congress Party leader, Rajiv Gandhi.\nAlthough Rama is almost certainly a mythical character, Hindu militants claim that the pretty little 16th-century mosque was built on the exact site of his birth. Moreover, the militants have drawn up plans for a temple that could be constructed only if the Babri Masjid was demolished or moved, and they have a long list of other mosques they would like to see destroyed.\nAs a result, the issue has taken on enormous symbolic weight, and Hinduism, the religion of more than 80 percent of Indians, has become a campaign issue for the first time since independence in 1947. The principal beneficiary of the Hindu revival, and the dark horse in this week's election, is the conservative Bharatiya Janata Party, led by the articulate parliamentarian, Lal Kishen Advani.\nElectoral support for the Bharatiya Janata Party is drawn in surprising degree from the middle class, now more than 100 million strong and heretofore looked upon as a modernizing influence. But while the new middle class is the source of progressive movements to protect consumers, the environment and civil and human rights, it is also proving to be a recruiting ground for Hindu militancy.\nIn small towns across north India, shopkeepers fly the Bharatiya Janata Party flag. In cities, affluent women are drawn into revivalist movements. Hindu fundamentalism's best-known firebrand is a woman, Uma Bharati. Her provocative speeches are best sellers on audio- and videocassettes.\n\"There are many problems the middle class faces,\" says Prof. Romila Thapar, a historian at Jawaharlal Nehru University, in Delhi. \"First of all, theirs was a reasonably quick rise. You get artisans moving up the social scale because they have picked up professions that have become lucrative. They are trying to improve their social status.\" One of the ways they do this, Thapar says, is to imitate the devout Hinduism of the upper castes.\n\"The issue of the Babri Masjid will bring up past passions,\" said Sorabjee, the former Attorney General, recalling the carnage of Hindu-Muslim violence in 1947. \"The horror of it all is that I have heard people who should know better say that Muslims have had it too good for such a long time. This trend of intolerance is so unlike the India which we knew.\"\nWITH THIS ELECTION, INDIA BEGINS the torturous task of redefining itself, laying the foundation of a post-Nehruvian, post-cold-war future. The major question is whether that future will be forged through religious confrontation, caste war and civil strife or through the ballot and Parliament. As India begins its odyssey, the world can neither look away nor assume that the eternal, otherworldly \"India of the Imagination,\" as K. Natwar Singh put it recently, can survive endless assaults on its down-to-earth institutions. \"The real India needs remedial measures,\" he says."}, {"text": "Ethiopians Have New Rulers, But Famine's Specter Lingers\n1991-06-14T05:00:00.000Z\n\"A good mother feeds her children milk and meat,\" said Amina Abdi Ali, a 22-year-old mother of two children, as a tear rolled down her cheek. \"I wish I could be a good mother.\"\nMrs. Amina wrapped her bony arms around her 4-year-old daughter Ferdowsa, who is so weak she needs to be fed by a refugee camp nurse by a tube through her nose and into her stomach. Then Mrs. Amina lovingly brushed the flies off her daughter's legs.\n\"I am afraid my children will die,\" she sighed.\nYears of failed Government farm policies, civil war, banditry and drought have conspired to rob Mrs. Amina and her family of a decent life. Today, an uneasy transition from the Communist Government that collapsed last month to an interim government led by guerrillas with no administrative experience -- and resented by much of the population -- makes the Amina family's future all the more precarious.\nLooting by Somali thieves and ambushes by the remnants of the old Ethiopian Army interrupted the shipment of food and water to the Kebri Beyah camp in remote eastern Harar province for several days in recent weeks.\nRelief officials said the halt in aid raised the death rate at the camp from 10 to 15 a day. The camp is inhabited by more than 50,000 Ethiopians who recently evacuated Somalia due to civil strife there.\nThe suffering of Mrs. Amina and her two children began seven years ago when her husband, Mohammed, insisted that they flee their coffee farm outside the town of Deder so he could escape being drafted into the army of President Mengistu Haile Mariam. Fear of the Army\n\"We left our clothes, our animals and our food behind because we were afraid soldiers would discover we were trying to escape,\" she said.\nFor the next six years, Mrs. Amina and her husband lived in Somali refugee camps hoping to return to Ethiopia whenever Colonel Mengistu's Marxist Government was overthrown. Mrs. Amina gave birth to a boy and a girl, and she was five months pregnant when her husband, Mohammed, was killed by bandits in February.\nFearful of the growing violence in Somalia, she brought her family to the Kebri Beyah camp, hoping the Mengistu Government would resettle her and her children. But with its forces collapsing in the war against three guerrilla armies, the Government was slow to either resettle the refugees or offer them relief assistance.\nAs her daughter withered and her 6-year-old son Muktar developed scurvy, Mrs. Amina became anemic herself and suffered a miscarriage in the seventh month of her pregnancy. Today her family and her fellow refugees are forced to dress in rags and live in tiny round huts of twigs, plastic and animal skins, without shade, privacy or hope of leaving any time soon. Nation in Turmoil\nThe new interim Government, dominated by former rebels from the northern Tigre province, now appears to be gaining control of the region but its ability to consoldiate its political position remains in doubt. The country is bankrupt, and its two major ports, from which international relief supplies enter, are in the hands of Eritrean separatist rebels who only entered a loose alliance with the Tigreans to defeat the Mengistu Government.\nInternational relief officials say up to 7 million Ethiopians, or 15 percent of the population, may need emergency food assistance if substantial rains do not begin in the next four weeks or if the new provisional government is unable to establish order. More than 5,000 people have died of hunger in the last four months, aid officials say.\nIt does not appear that the current crisis will be as devastating as the 1984-1985 famine, which took an estimated 300,000 Ethiopian lives. But diplomats and relief officials say their efforts have been complicated by competition with better publicized disasters such as the Kurdish refugee crisis and the recent cyclone in Bangladesh.\nThe crisis has been made worse by the influx of more than a half million Sudanese and Somalis fleeing war and famine in their countries. 'Facing a Major Catastrophe'\n\"We feel like we are left out in the cold,\" said George Labor, an official of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees involved in providing assistance to the hungry in Ethiopia and Somalia. \"We could be facing a major catastrophe.\"\nSo far, United Nations officials said they have received donations of only 800,000 tons of food aid for Ethiopia this year, far below the 1.4 million tons they say they need. They said medicines are also in short supply.\n\"We don't know how many people will die,\" said John Wiater, the local director of Catholic Relief Services. Referring to the ruling coalition dominated by the Tigreans, he added, \"It's one thing for the E.P.R.D.F. to occupy the towns and another to defend the roads.\"\nThe United Nations hopes to send its first major food convoy deep into the Ogaden region over the weekend, but aid officials said it could take months to undo what damage has already been done to children who went without food and water for days at a time. Grass and Cactus\nBut even in villages where security is not a problem and food arrives irregularly, hunger is an ever-present reality. In the area around the town of Babile, where thousands of villagers depend on monthly CARE shipments of wheat and cooking oil, boiled grass and raw cactus have become part of the daily diet.\n\"Our corn has already failed, even if we get rain,\" said Abdi Yuyu, a 29-year-old peanut farmer who lives in the village of Towfik. \"Our sorghum crop has been eaten by the monkeys. We'll survive as long as CARE brings us seeds. Without CARE, all we have is God.\"\nMr. Abdi and other Towfik villagers said they were not happy about their dependence on CARE, but they blamed their misfortunes on past Government policies. Towfik, a village of 1,800 people, was created by the Mengistu Government as part of its \"villagization program.\"\nThe peasants were forced, in 1985, to leave their small plots of land and gather in neat rows of huts that the Government said would ease provision of public services such as education. But no school was ever built, and the promised potable water and electricity were never delivered.\nSeparated from their plots, the peasant farmers wasted hours every day hiking between their crops and their new homes. Most chose to keep their cattle and other animals near their homes, depriving their crops of fertilizers produced from animal wastes. Productivity plummeted.\nMeles Zenawi, the acting president, pledged to foreign diplomats recently that the old government agricultural policies would be discontinued and free market policies would take their place. But several officials in his movement, particularly those in the military wing, are believed to retain the Marxist beliefs that dominated the movement's ideology for more than 15 years."}, {"text": "JACQUES OF ALL TRADES\n1991-10-13T05:00:00.000Z\nFRAMED ON THE podium by his former boss, President Francois Mitterrand of France, and Prime Minister John Major of Britain, Jacques Attali recites his acceptance speech impatiently, each cluster of words following too swiftly upon the echo of its predecessor. On this dreary spring day in London, the newly elected president of the equally new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (or BERD, in the French acronym) gives, delivery aside, a typically high-flying performance. With the flags of 39 nations as a backdrop, he tells his listeners that the bank, born in Attali's fertile brain a mere two years ago to guide the transition of the Soviet Union and the rest of Eastern Europe to capitalism and democracy, will be \"the first institution of the post-cold-war period . . . the first institution of a united Europe . . . the first institution of the new world order.\"\nThe heads of state and finance ministers from the BERD's member countries strain in vain to keep up with the soaring rhetoric. Attali, whose owlish face turns handsome when animated, spews out references to Spinoza, Tolstoy, Hobbes, Voltaire, Goethe, Kafka and Sakharov. He ends with a prayer that the bank will one day help \"700 million Europeans unite in a single ideal of peace, tolerance and light.\"\nLater, in an interview, Attali reflects on the symbolism of his creation. \"It's important,\" he says, \"that the first organization to gather all the European nations [ along with the United States, Japan, Canada and a smattering of smaller states ] is a bank .\" The BERD does neatly underscore the ascendancy, throughout Europe, of the idea of market economy, and, it is hoped, the idea of democracy. Atop the symbol, though, rests a delicious irony: the man tapped to teach Eastern Europe the joys of capitalism is the very same fellow who, as Mitterrand's chief adviser, helped lead the charge to nationalize France's economy in the early 80's. In Attali, the West is banking on a Socialist to bail out Eastern Europe.\nAttali's political past, his tendency to infuriate staid international bureaucrats with visionary discourse and his utter lack of banking experience have made the BERD's beginnings volatile. The European press lampoons him as a pretentious, autocratic intellectual who sees the bank as his personal fief. Many diplomats denounce him, off the record, as an \"outrageous\" choice to head Europe's largest international institution.\nAt the same time, the BERD is struggling to take flight in increasingly difficult conditions. Conceived amid the general euphoria over the collapse of the Berlin wall, the bank begins life just as the reality of Eastern Europe's economic predicament sinks in with Western leaders. \"There's a fear,\" says a high-ranking United States Treasury Department official, \"that the BERD will turn out to be an impotent bureaucracy led by a loose cannon.\" Or, as The Economist put it in one of its many stinging critiques of \"Mr. Attali's bank\": \"If the [ BERD ] did not exist, it would not need inventing.\"\nSuch aggressive skepticism does not appear to give Attali pause. The very fact of chaos in Eastern Europe should allow his institution to thrive. Indeed, after the aborted Soviet coup, the question of economic aid to the East has become the focus of debate in the West. \"It's concentrated the minds of policy makers on the need to help stabilize democracy in the Soviet Union and throughout the East,\" Attali says. The BERD -- the sole international financial institution to which all the Eastern European nations except Albania belong -- has a lead role to play in defining the sum and substance of Western assistance. As a result, and not for the first time, the bank's effervescent president finds himself center stage in what promises to be a compelling and long-running drama.\nALONG WITH A KNACK FOR ATTRACTING unfriendly fire, Jacques Attali (pronounced ah-ta-lee) has an uncanny ability to turn talk into fact, and such a distressingly wide range of activities and interests that he cannot be pigeonholed. His undeniable brilliance and almost frightening energy lead even naysayers to concede that Attali could make the BERD an effective force for progress in Eastern Europe.\nBorn in Algeria in 1943, Attali moved to Paris at age 12 when his father, a prosperous perfume merchant, concluded that the anti-colonial sentiment in the country had all the makings of a bloodbath. Attali's parents were determined that he and his twin brother, Bernard -- who now presides over Air France -- should succeed. The Attalis were the kind of parents who, when the children complained of boredom, responded, \"Don't you have anything to read?\"\nArmed with six languages and degrees from four of France's top universities, Attali joined Mitterrand's team in 1974 and quickly became the Socialist leader's eminence brun . A skilled teacher, he bolstered Mitterrand's presidential credibility by making an overly literary politician economically literate. When Mitterrand won the presidency in 1981, he installed Attali in an office next to his own; visitors, including the Prime Minister, had to pass through Attali's office to get to Mitterrand's. When not feeding Mitterrand ideas -- \"for every 10, I use one,\" the President once said -- Attali churned out books, some 16 to date. These he continues to write from 4 to 7 every morning. Among his subjects: the history of time; changing conceptions of property rights and the relationship of music to the political culture. He is also the author of two best-selling novels: one will soon become a television mini-series and the other has been bought for the movies. Married to a former model, Elisabeth Allain, and the father of two sons, Attali often appears at several social functions an evening -- unless it's Friday. A religious Jew, he occasionally stops his relentless charge through life to observe the Sabbath.\nUntil Attali left the Elysee Palace in April, Mitterrand was the prime beneficiary of his aide's facile conversation and erudition. \"In the course of a two-page memo on a transportation strike, Jacques would somehow bring in French Surrealist literature and cybernetics,\" an admiring former colleague says. President and adviser met daily and played golf together weekly. Mitterrand had Attali attend Cabinet meetings and entrusted him with being his \"sherpa\" at the major international economic and political summits.\nDuring his decade at the Elysee, Attali had so many ideas that one commentator called his mind \"not simply fecund, but incontinent.\" When thousands were left dead by flooding in Bangladesh in 1988, Attali urged the building of a multibillion-dollar system of dams and canals, to be overseen by satellite. He championed the Eureka project, a high-technology alliance of European countries. Sensitive to Mitterrand's edifice complex, Attali talked up the idea of a new national library for Paris, which will be the world's largest book repository. And it was Attali who thought to link the 1989 Paris economic summit with the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution, providing the President with a term's worth of dramatic photo opportunities.\nCritics charge that Attali excels mostly at appropriating the clever thoughts of others. \"He fancies himself a man of ideas. Unfortunately, they are rarely his own,\" one journalist, Franz-Olivier Giesbert, wrote about Attali in \"Le President,\" his generally authoritative account of the Mitterrand reign. Giesbert's chapter on Attali, an unambiguous hatchet job, still feeds dinner-party talk in Paris. He portrays the \"special counselor\" as an emotionally erratic, possessive figure, fawningly obsessed with his boss's comings and goings. Giesbert accuses Attali of taking up golf solely to be able to tee off with the President. When Attali, who had in fact persuaded Mitterrand to learn the game, complained about Giesbert's book to his boss, Mitterrand is said to have answered with a sigh, \"You, Jacques, are only one chapter. I am the entire volume.\"\nFORCED TO CHOOSE among his many pursuits, Attali describes himself as \"a writer first and foremost.\" Considering the odd hours he is able to devote to his craft, he has been remarkably successful. Most of his books are best sellers and receive laudatory reviews. His first novel, \"Eternal Life\" (1989), a sort of allegorical history of the world, sold more than 100,000 copies in France and evoked blurbs of which publishers dream. Bernard Pivot, the television personality who has been the principal arbiter of French literary taste for the past 15 years, admires Attali's body of work. \"It's not that he's a great stylist,\" Pivot says. \"He's a compelling author because you sense in the amazing range of his writing the passion of a man for his century.\" And for other centuries: his latest best seller is a history of the year 1492.\nNot all of Attali's prose is so praiseworthy. His economic essays can be plagued by jargon -- rich on formulas, poor on specifics. Michel Rocard, the former Prime Minister now favored to succeed Mitterrand in 1995, found \"The Word and the Tool\" (1975) \"difficult to read . . . to such an extent that doubt sets in.\"\nThen there was the scandal that arose in 1982 over \"Histories of Time.\" A number of well-read reviewers noted that Attali had reproduced passages from other writers' works without quotation marks. Attali's explanation has been that he goes through \"about 40 drafts of each book, and on the 30th revision of that one, the citations in question accidentally got dropped.\" The critics were unmerciful. \"Let's try to imagine what the author's pre-dawn writing sessions are like,\" wrote Daniel Rondeau in the daily Liberation. \"In the still of the night, the noise of his scissors is no doubt more audible than the quill of his pen.\"\nAttali's most recent essay, \"Millennium,\" is a good and provocative read. In the book, he warns that the United States, faced with declines in manufacturing, infrastructure, health care and education on top of increasing crime, drugs and homelessness, risks becoming a junior partner to Japan in economic competition with a unified Europe. Some readers have scoffed at this thesis, seeing in the gulf war victory a reaffirmation of American prowess. Attali stands by the argument, insisting that his essay is not wishful thinking but a warning, \"It's a bit like the Bible where there are two kinds of prophets -- those who say what they want to see happen, and those who say what they don't want to see happen so people will react to prevent it,\" he told me. \"I'm trying to get people concerned about the increasing fragility of the American industrial system, which is in no one's interest.\"\nTO GOVERN, BUT to leave big capital, the No. 1 enemy of Socialism, intact, would be absurd,\" Mitterrand wrote just prior to his 1981 election. In the first months of the new administration, Attali urged his boss to pursue the Socialist economic platform that elected him. The Government promptly nationalized five industrial groups, the 36 largest banks and two major financial holding companies. Half-measures were not acceptable: instead of taking 51 percent participations in the target companies, as some moderate Socialists advocated, Mitterrand, guided by Attali, had the state claim 100 percent stakes. Taking into account equity and interest payments, the French Government would be contractually obligated over the next 15 years to set aside about one-third of its annual budget to fund the buying spree.\nLess than two years later, with unemployment swelling, the franc anemic and the economy sputtering, Mitterrand tossed Socialist dogma by the wayside. The Government instituted a draconian austerity program, pushed through a tax cut, devalued the franc and switched its \"profit is evil\" rhetoric to something approximating \"greed is good.\" At the President's side throughout this radical break with Socialist economics, whispering in his ear, was none other than Jacques Attali.\nToday, Attali -- who calls himself a \"social democrat,\" not a \"socialist\" -- insists that there was no flip-flop in 1983, that he and Mitterrand remained true to their principles. \"When we came to power, we undertook a major structural and social reform: abolition of the death penalty, decentralization, retirement at 60, the 39-hour work week, the nationalizations. No one has called these reforms into question, and we never retreated from them. The austerity program was not a structural reform, it was the politics of conjuncture.\"\nTo listen to Attali, the nationalizations were less an ideological imperative than a clever ploy to transform France from a nation of passive landowners to one of aggressive investors. \"We were faced with a situation very particular to France, which was that people invested in real estate, not in stocks. There were no private investors to put money into industry. If the state hadn't become a shareholder, we would have been obliged to sell our companies, bit by bit, to foreigners.\" The former owners of the nationalized companies, pockets bulging with billions of the Government's francs, moved quickly into the stock market. \"France has finally developed a modern economy and real financial markets, so it would be unnecessary to go the nationalization route today,\" Attali says. \"What we did was not a question of ideology, but of necessity at that time.\"\nIN 1985, ATTALI RAISED eyebrows by publishing a flattering portrait of Sir Siegmund Warburg, one of the century's great capitalists, and thus a curious object of praise from a left-leaning intellectual. Titled \"A Man of Influence,\" the biography almost obsequiously traces the career of a personality whose most notable contribution to the world of banking was the hostile takeover. \"The British Aluminum takeover that Warburg masterminded happened in the mid-1950's in London, not the 1980's in New York,\" Attali explains. \"It was an incredibly reactionary and closed-off environment, and Warburg shook things up. He was an instrument of economic democracy, saying that business doesn't belong to the managers, but to the shareholders. In the 1980's, people used a technique he invented for very different ends.\"\nAttali seems especially fascinated by Warburg's ability to influence events without holding elective office. \"He managed to blend political power, financial innovation, creativity and morality,\" Attali says. Indeed, he concludes in the book that \"over the last two centuries, the individual with the most clear-cut influence is the financier.\" Little wonder, then, that the one job compelling enough to draw Attali away from his privileged position next to Mitterrand was the presidency of a bank with the potential to help shape the economic and political future of Europe.\nAs he readily admits, Attali is no banker. While \"A Man of Influence\" succeeds admirably as a history of merchant banking, it also reveals its author's modest comfort level with the nuts and bolts of finance. In his new job, Attali vows to surround himself with technocrats and to concentrate on issues of \"macro\" policy. That declaration, however, has something of the ring of a George Steinbrenner promise to leave the managing to his managers.\n\"WHEN YOU'RE THE adviser to a President, you don't have ideas, the President does,\" Attali responds when asked the genesis of the BERD. In fact, French Treasury Department officials acknowledge that the bank was Attali's concept. In early November 1989, he told Treasury Director Jean-Claude Trichet to flesh out the structure for an organization that would rebuild the economies of Eastern Europe. A month later, Mitterrand submitted his Treasury's quickly drawn plan to the 11 other members of the European Community, and they gave France the authority to convene a conference to negotiate the details.\nFrom the start, American officials were skeptical of the need for a new development bank, particularly one in which the Soviet Union would be a shareholder. France, however, was able to capitalize on the general desire in the West to help the nascent democracies of the East, and became the first country to make a concrete proposal. \"The French were the only players on the field,\" says an aide to Theo Waigel, the German Finance Minister. \"There were no competing proposals.\"\nBy securing support from the European Community first, and then inviting the Americans to the negotiating conference, the French cleverly presented Washington with a fait accompli: the bank was going to happen with or without American participation. \"We wanted America to play an important role,\" Attali says. \"But it's like throwing a dinner party -- if one of the guests can't make it, you don't cancel the dinner.\"\nAfter six months of negotiations, the participating countries agreed on the bank's basic structure and mission. They also made London the headquarters for the bank, and Attali the president-designate. While the United States is the largest single contributor-shareholder with a 10 percent stake, the countries of the European Community, together with the European Commission and the European Investment Bank, control 51 percent of the shares. Even the Eastern European borrowing countries, including the Soviet Union, had to put up some money -- in return for 13.5 percent of the shares. Just how the Soviet shares and voting power will be apportioned within the disintegrating union is a question with which bank officials are now grappling.\nThe BERD has tremendous flexibility in deciding how to use its $13 billion in capital, of which $3 billion has already been paid in: it may lend money to public or private companies, take equity positions in new ventures, underwrite securities issues and provide training and technical assistance. At Washington's insistence, at least 60 percent of its resources must be devoted to the private sector, or sectors \"in the process\" of being privatized. Finally and uniquely, the bank has an expressly political mandate. To be eligible for investment or assistance, a country must be \"committed to the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics.\" Yugoslovia and some of the soon-to-be-independent, but authoritarian-minded, Soviet republics may prove interesting test cases for these requirements. In short, the BERD is a hybrid investment-development bank with a hefty political stick -- in Attali's words, \"one-third Lazard, one-third World Bank and one-third European Community.\"\nDuring the negotiating sessions, American officials grew alarmed when the Attali-drafted bylaws placed excessive power in the presidency: there would be no second-in-command, and the president would decide all major issues of policy, hiring and firing. With the bank a reality, the Bush Administration began to throw its weight around, insisting on establishing a resident, 23-member board of directors with power of approval over each bank project. Washington also demanded that the BERD hire an American as second-in-command -- a post accepted in June by a Salomon Brothers managing director, Ronald M. Freeman.\nAttali goes out of his way to insist that relations between the United States and the BERD are just peachy. But American officials privately complain that the bank's president has an unfortunate tendency to put his foot in Washington's mouth. Upon taking office, Attali announced that the bank would soon begin to \"privatize Moscow.\" This is just the sort of grandiose proclamation cautious American diplomats abhor. \"The problem with Jacques,\" a State Department official says, \"is that you just can't take your eyes off him.\"\nIndeed, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's remarks at the BERD's opening sounded very much like a warning that Washington planned to keep its sights trained on its unpredictable friend. \"The board of directors should be fully involved and informed,\" Brady said. \"We do not view the activity of the board as advisory, but as a critical element of the bank's operations.\" Although Attali claims to delight in a powerful board (\"Why shouldn't I,\" he says. \"I'm its chairman\"), it's hard to imagine how a cumbersome decision-making process can benefit a bank that fancies itself \"one-third Lazard.\" Besides, the petty flaps over power obscure a much more important issue: in the shambles of Eastern Europe, can this bank make a real difference?\nCARSTEN GERLACH is the pizza delivery king of Germany. Educated in America, he learned firsthand there is money to be made bringing fast food to people's doors. In 1988, he opened his first delivery outlet, in Hamburg; today, he runs an 19-store franchise, and boasts the highest sales revenues in what used to be West Germany. But Gerlach has given up for the time being his attempts to bring pizza to East German homes. A market analysis last year revealed that only about 10 percent of East Germans have telephones. \"Even if they wanted to order our pizza,\" Gerlach says, \"they could not.\"\nFrom telephones and highways to capital markets and legal codes, Eastern Europe lacks the basic infrastructures necessary for capitalist seed to take. Estimates of the cost to build or refurbish these nations' physical plants and to clean up their environments are staggering; most experts talk in the hundreds of billions, and even trillions, of dollars. Reforms like defining property and ownership rights -- prerequisites to foreign investment -- will demand lots of two other commodities: time and will.\nMeanwhile, the dislocations provoked by fundamental restructuring, whether political or economic, make for an uninviting investment climate. In what remains of the Soviet Union, Western entrepreneurs do not know with whom to deal -- the central government, the republics, municipalities, private companies -- or whether their interlocutors of today will be around tomorrow. Restructuring also soaks up resources that otherwise could be used for productive investment. In 1990, Bonn invested $26 billion in eastern Germany solely for unemployment benefits; this year, the projected outlay for this safety net is $34 billion.\nThe disintegration of the old Comecon trading system sorely aggravates Eastern Europe's dire straits. The Soviet Union had been the most important trading partner for its former satellites; its present difficulties have effectively decimated bilateral trade. Hungarian exports to the Soviet Union are down 85 percent from one year ago, Poland's have slipped 80 percent. Given the shoddy quality of goods produced in Eastern Europe, Western markets won't be taking up the slack any time soon.\nThe BERD, with its $13 billion in capital, is not the panacea for Eastern Europe's ills. To be sure, Attali and his lieutenants understand this. In taking small, 10 to 15 percent participations in many projects, they aim to make the bank a catalyst to private sector and Western development bank activity, thereby generating about 10 times its capital in investments. They also intend to emphasize training and technical assistance in the early going, and to devote bank resources to building basic infrastructures like transportation and telecommunications.\nLonger term, Attali maintains, the bank's relatively limited funds -- to be fortified by borrowing on the capital markets -- will not prove a handicap. Because of a paucity of consumer goods, most Eastern European countries have substantial internal savings. The BERD's mission is to help them, together with other Western investors, find or create productive outlets for their money. \"We should be less an institution of finance than of influence,\" Attali says.\nOne important area where the BERD could wield influence without having to write a check is market access. A General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade report in April took the European Community to task for blocking foreign imports in an effort to protect its markets. The report underscored the deleterious impact such barriers have on Eastern Europe's economies. For example, the very areas the European Community tries most to insulate -- agriculture, steel and textiles -- represent 50 percent of Poland's exports to the E.C. \"We can't help these countries with one hand,\" Attali says, \"and then stop them from exporting to our markets with the other.\"\nStill, the region's problems are vast, and the BERD small. Rather than feeding a new bureaucracy, it is argued, the West's money could be better spent on existing institutions like the I.M.F., the World Bank or its affiliate, the International Finance Corporation. The BERD's officers have grown accustomed to this criticism, parrying it with a litany of reasons why their institution is unique. They note that most Eastern European countries do not belong to the other organizations, that no other bank requires beneficiaries to meet political criteria, that the BERD's investment-development bank structure allows for greater flexibility and that the I.M.F. and World Bank were designed to help the third world, which has not, up to now, included Eastern Europe.\nTypically, Attali emphasizes a somewhat grander, and more abstract, raison d'etre for the bank. The BERD -- which he insists on calling \"the European Bank\" -- is \"first and foremost a political response to a new situation in Europe. We needed to create an organization where all the nations of Europe could meet. Just as the European Coal and Steel Community in the 1950's served as the embryo for the Common Market, the European Bank signals a continent-wide raising of consciousness to build a peaceful political future.\"\nIt's a lofty, admirable goal, but one that makes Attali's American and European partners nervous. Where they see a bank, he sees the blueprint for a \"greater Europe.\" The world needs visionaries who dare to imagine the future, and even more those who, like Attali, can begin to deliver on their dreams. The BERD is a reality. Its first president must now take care that in guiding his creation, he does not blind himself with his own, brilliant light."}, {"text": "The Talk of Hollywood; The Rich and Famous Clamor to Experience A Taste of Poverty\n1991-11-11T05:00:00.000Z\nIn all probability, Mel Gibson and Dustin Hoffman will soon sit down on a straw mat and eat a dinner of rice and water, just as the impoverished people of Bangladesh and Ethiopia do. So will Whoopi Goldberg and Daryl Hannah and Cybill Shepherd and Danny Glover and Jackson Browne.\nAt the moment, the hottest ticket in town involves, of all things, the Hollywood Hunger Banquet.\nStars and producers are planning to troop onto a specially designed soundstage at Sony Pictures Studios (formerly Columbia Studios) on Nov. 21, and, with the help of a lighting expert and a caterer, participate in a dinner to dramatize the needs of the poor. Even by Hollywood's often excessive standards, the banquet to benefit Oxfam America has stirred considerable dismay within the entertainment industry. A full-page advertisement in Daily Variety on Friday promoted the event.\nUnder current plans, the celebrities will draw lots to determine where they will sit and what they will eat. A total of 15 percent will represent high-income countries, 25 percent will represent middle-income countries and 60 percent will represent the impoverished, who make up a majority of the people in the world.\n\"Instead of a normal black-tie event, this will give people the actual experience of being poor and hungry,\" said Ruth Hedges, the head of Ruth Hedges Culinary Productions, which is catering the banquet. \"Let me tell you, when you leave, you'll be extremely affected by the experience.\"\n\"About 75 people will be served by waiters, have a three-course meal, stuffed breast of chicken, sun-dried tomatoes and radicchio, salad with shrimp, and a wonderful dessert and wine, all these guests sitting on nice chairs with cloth napkins and linen and crystal,\" she said. \"The middle percentage will sit on benches at wooden tables; they'll have paper plates with rice and beans and tortillas. And then the rest, the majority, will sit on the floor on a mat and have rice and water, no silverware, and that's it. Just like the majority of people in the world.\"\nShe added: \"What we're doing is bringing across to the philanthropic crowd that the capitalist system doesn't work, that there's totally unequal distribution of food in the world.\" The crowd is expected to include David Byrne, Taj Mahal, Susan Sarandon, Ruben Blades, Holly Hunter, Archbishop Desmond S. Tutu, Lou Diamond Phillips and Graham Nash.\nIs the banquet a gimmick? \"I don't think so,\" Ms. Hedges. \"Last year we had 18 or 20 kids from Cambodia and El Salvador, kids who lived through the most incredible experiences. We put these kids at the elite table because they never had a meal like that. We obviously wouldn't put them on the floor to eat the rice.\"\nDiana Fried, press director of Oxfam America in Boston, said the event would raise $100,000 for the world's hungry. Hollywood's first hunger banquet last year \"was a very powerful, moving experience in which people had no choice about the kind of meal they were getting,\" Ms. Fried said. She added, \"It was a powerful way of experiencing what billions of people around the world are experiencing every day.\"\nBut several Hollywood liberals, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the effort, while well-intentioned, was misguided -- not because the participants were insincere, but largely because life styles in Hollywood remained so lavish. The Hollywood establishment donates generously to many causes, but the way it does is sometimes open to question. \"People in this town have no lens on themselves,\" one film executive said. \"It's a play world. Everything is theater.\"\nAnother Hollywood executive said: \"This is the way society works in L.A. It's like a mating ritual. People have to come up with new and different ways to make money. In a given week I get 15 invitations to events, which I don't even open. You have to find new ways of getting people's attention.\"\nOxfam America has staged similar fund-raising events in church basements and schools across the nation, but nothing quite on the scale of Hollywood's.\n\"What better place to do it?\" Ms. Hedges said. \"It wouldn't have the same effect in some small hokey pokey town where people haven't heard of the kind of opulent food we have here. I mean, the effect of eating poorly is an everyday existence in middle America, too.\" Political Parties\nSuddenly, Presidential politics is alive and well in town -- at least, on the Democratic side. (The G.O.P. side is secure with Arnold Schwarzenegger, arguably the No. 1 star in town).\nThe unexpected triumph of Harris Wofford, the Democrat, over former United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in the Pennsylvania Senate race, coupled with news accounts of voter unrest over the Administration's domestic and economic policies, has given a jump start to liberals after months of torpor. In the next few weeks, Democratic candidates will be surging here to pay obeisance to money-makers in the entertainment industry, whose pockets seem deep and recession-proof.\nA Presidential contender, Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, has already had lunch with Michael S. Ovitz, Ron Meyer and about a dozen other agents at the Creative Artists Agency, the most powerful in town. (Mr. Kerrey has also visited C.A.A.'s chief rival, International Creative Management). Also planning a pilgrimage to C.A.A.'s sleek offices designed by I. M. Pei are two other Democratic contenders, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.\nBarry Diller, the chairman and chief executive of Fox Inc., planning a $500- to $1,000-a-person cocktail party on Nov. 20 at his estate in Beverly Hills to raise money for Senator Kerrey. Co-sponsors are to include others, Jeff Berg and Jim Wiatt, chairman and president, respectively, of I.C.M.; the actress Sally Field; David Geffen, the record mogul and businessman, and producers like Sherry Lansing and Rosalie Swedlin. (\"For that money, at least they could give you dinner,\" complained one producer who said he planned to show up anyway).\nShortly after, Dawn Steel, the producer who formerly ran Columbia Pictures, and her husband, the producer Charles Roven, are having a major fund-raising party at their home for Governor Clinton. Supporters of the Governor include Mike Medavoy, chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason, producers of the television sitcom \"Designing Women.\"\nDespite the prolonged ambivalence of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York about entering the Democratic race, a Hollywood friend of his, the producer and director Irwin Winkler, said, \"I've gotten a tremendous amount of phone calls, unsolicited, from people in the community who want to support him.\"\nNumerous film makers said the political tempo had accelerated only in recent weeks.\n\"People in Hollywood feel they can make a difference for the first time because George Bush is vulnerable,\" Ms. Steel said. For many people in the entertainment industry, she said, the time has come to play a role in politics. \"You raise money; you raise consciousness,\" she said. \"People are at that level where they can be heard. Our children are grown; our careers are on track. It's time to get involved.\"\nHoward Rosenman, a producer, said: \"Politics is going to be more intense now than ever before in the history of Hollywood. The motion picture industry is in chaos and turbulent. The inability of studio heads to guess what's viable and salable is creating a tremendous insecurity, which relates to the economy. A lot of people with cushy $200,000-a-year jobs will be out of work. People are scared. They're freaking out. And people are coming to their bottom line. And, somehow, it's manifesting itself in support of their political beliefs, whatever they are.\"\nMarge Tabankin, director of the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, a liberal fund-raising and lobbying group, observed that Democrats had been crippled for more than a year because of various defeats last year, including an environmental referendum and Dianne Feinstein's loss to Pete Wilson in the California gubernatorial race. \"There was tremendous disappointment, cynicism, almost paralysis in the Hollywood community,\" she said. \"People took a hiatus. Now it's time to go back to work.\"\nPrivately, Democratic Presidential candidates in recent years, including Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis, disliked the trek to Hollywood, largely because there they were virtually grilled about their views and forced to swallow what their aides viewed as a bit of lecturing over issues to earn hefty donations.\nIn the book \"The Power and the Glitter\" (Pantheon, 1991), about the Hollywood-Washington connection, Ronald Brownstein writes that Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, heard a series of pointed questions from a Hollywood audience. Finally, he asked a question of his own. How many in the audience had been to Indiana? Only a handful raised their hands. How many had been to Nicaragua? \"Instantly,\" Mr. Brownstein wrote, \"he faced a forest of upraised palms.\" The Power List\nWhat began two years ago as a witty attempt by Premiere magazine to define power in Hollywood has turned very serious, largely because power here is hardly a lighthearted matter. Typically, because people here often don't wish one another well, the magazine's editors are receiving some odd phone calls. Not only are big-time agents, executives and producers applying not-too-gentle pressure to be included -- as high as possible -- on the annual list, which is to appear in the May issue, but they are also telling the magazine that their rivals should be excluded.\n\"There are subtle and not-so-subtle efforts to be included or moved up on the list,\" said Susan Lyne, the magazine's editor. \"We're now getting offers to help compile the list, asking us if we would like their input. People are organizing letter-writing campaigns saying so-and-so belongs on this list. Conversely we're getting calls saying so-and-so doesn't belong on the list.\"\nPowerful people seem to be falling all over themselves to appear. \"People are starting to be incredibly helpful again: 'What do you need? Can I take you to lunch? How can I help the magazine more?' \" Ms. Lyne said. The last two lists have been dominated by the usual suspects of Hollywood's elite, among them Mr. Ovitz, Mr. Diller and Michael Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company. This year's list is being worked on amid secrecy, although those three names will probably certainly remain close to the top.\nWhy does Hollywood take the list so seriously? \"I think everyone looks for validation in their work,\" Ms. Lyne said. \"This is one way of getting that. Nobody knows how long they'll be in a job. Studio chiefs are replaced with great speed. This is one way of saying, 'For the next year, I'm safe.' \""}, {"text": "In Queens 'Mosaic,' Proof of the Melting Is in the Eating\n1991-10-16T05:00:00.000Z\nIT may no longer be fashionable to talk about New York as a melting pot. Mosaic is the word officials use when they talk about ethnic diversity.\nBut just go to Queens.\nAnyone who has ever had a doubt about the existence of a melting pot (or has been curious to reach down with a spoon and sample it) need only wander around the section of Queens known as Elmhurst.\nWith immigrants from 114 different nations, Elmhurst is the city's most ethnically diverse neighborhood, according to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service. \"You name it, and they're there,\" said Frank Vardy, a demographer for the city's Department of City Planning.\nTo walk around Elmhurst and visit its Chinese food markets, Indian spice shops, Korean barbecue restaurants, Argentine butcher shops, Hong Kong bakeries and Colombian coffeehouses is to be immersed in one of the world's most diverse culinary cauldrons.\n\"This is the mixing bowl of America,\" said Louie Antonio, who operates Singa's Famous, a pizza restaurant on Broadway, the commercial spine of Elmhurst, a neighborhood of low apartment buildings and well-kept single-family houses. Mr. Antonio, who is originally from northern Greece, has discovered that his thin-crusted, heavily cheesed pan pizza is particularly popular with neighborhood Indians. The other day, a woman in a sari stood at the counter and in broken English asked for a slice.\n\"To stay?\" Mr. Antonio asked. Unable to reply, the woman shyly pointed out the window. Mr. Antonio nodded. \"To go,\" he said.\nTo walk down Broadway is to witness countless moments like this one, brief and seemingly inconsequential exchanges that nevertheless add up to the subtle but powerful osmosis by which newcomers are transformed into Americans.\nNot surprisingly many of these experiences have to do with food. Food is its own currency in Elmhurst. It is a means to learn English, a way to feel at home, a chance to experiment, a bridge between vastly different cultures. The other day, for example, Elizabeth Esguerra, who came to this country four years ago from the Philippines, was shopping at the Topline Supermarket, an Oriental food shop at Broadway and Britton Avenue.\nMs. Esguerra was at the checkout counter with a sack of rice when she noticed a woman dressed exotically in an embroidered top and trousers carrying some egg roll wrappers. \"Don't get that kind,\" Ms. Esguerra said to the woman. She said that particular brand of wrapper fell apart when used for spring rolls. The woman, who was from Bombay, was appreciative. Although she was going to use the wrappers for samosas, a deep-fried Indian specialty, she went back to the refrigerator to pick up the other kind of wrapper.\nAlong the half-mile of Broadway that stretches from Roosevelt Avenue to Queens Boulevard, one finds an East Asian food store next to a Pakistani grocery, a Thai seafood restaurant next to a Hong Kong noodle shop, a Colombian coffeeshop next to a pizza parlor.\nAt 83-19 Broadway, for example, is a shop one could imagine seeing in Bangladesh. Ibrahim Khalil, 71 years old, is baking nan, an Indian bread, in a clay oven as customers down bowls of stewed goat with lentils. At No. 82-39, King's Supermarket, an Oriental market, tilapia swim in a tank in the window. At No. 82-80, the Anna Bhandar shop, there are more than 100 varieties of Indian pickles, 30 varieties of beans and, for the harried, frozen Indian dinners including matar paneer (cheese and peas) and aloo baigan (potato and eggplant stew). At No. 86-32, the Tsoung Shing Chinese Restaurant and Coffee Shop, there is a staggering array of Shanghai-style noodles, dumplings, rice cakes and soups that could easily be on a side street in Hong Kong. At the corner of Broadway and 74th Street, the Chung Ki Wa Restaurant, with its miniature barbecue on every table, could have been plucked off the streets of Seoul. At No. 82-78, there is a vegetarian Indian restaurant, Jhupdi, with the sensually spiced foods of Gujarat.\nThe list goes on.\n\"Big one more,\" Estevez Ricardo, a 46-year-old immigrant from Cuba, was saying the other day, holding up an avocado at Pak Fruit and Grocery at 82-33 Broadway. He and Kichan Kim, a 21-year-old immigrant from Korea, were haggling over the price of an avocado. Mr. Kim wanted $1.99. Mr. Ricardo wanted to pay $1.29. There were discussions about size and texture. \"O.K.,\" Mr. Kim finally said in a combination of English and Spanish, no small feat for someone newly arrived from Asia. \"Uno cincuenta nueve.\" Mr. Ricardo handed over the $1.59.\nSome of the immigrants along Broadway have only recently arrived. Alamgir Hossain, 21, for example, came to this country three years ago and now works for his brother in their three-month-old store, Shapla Groceries, at 81-10A Broadway. The store carries Indian staples like ghee, turmeric powder and chapati flour. But the Wong family, who run the Shanghai-style Tsoung Shing restaurant at 86-32 Broadway, have worked in Elmhurst for 12 years. They have learned the ropes. Tina Wong, 44, for example, buys her Oriental groceries in Chinatown because she can get them there wholesale. She heads to a Jewish-style pickle place on the Lower East Side for her cucumbers.\nIncongruities in Elmhurst abound, all a part of the rich ethnic stew that makes up this stretch of immigrant America. Take the El Molino Panaderia Argentino Confiteria, an Argentine-style bakery at 86-47 Broadway. It sells a wide variety of faturas (flaky breakfast confections filled with custard), special Argentine sandwiches with the crusts removed, and all kinds of Argentine pastries filled with caramel. But the shop is owned by Sung Hong, a 57-year-old Korean, and his son, Paul, 28. Brenda Lopresti, 27, who is from Uruguay, helps out behind the counter as well. But for some reason, what El Molino is really known for around the neighborhood is its bagels and croissants.\n\"I don't know why,\" said Paul Hong. \"But my father learned everything he knows at a Jewish bakery.\"\nMauricio Junca, 25, moved here from Mexico six years ago and has worked for the last month at David's pizza at 81-13 Broadway. He used to work next door in a Thai restaurant.\n\"Everything is here,\" said John Angelo, who is a customer service representative in the neighborhood for New York Telephone. He was having lunch the other day on Broadway at Papaya Queen, which one might assume would be a copy of the many New York papaya-and-hot-dog places. In fact, it is an eclectic coffee shop where shrimp rolls sit next to the Caribbean beef stew in a display case (to make it easy to point), and where it is as easy to order a taco as it is to have bacon and eggs.\nArriving in a foreign land, not knowing the language or the customs, has never been easy for new immigrants. Anyone eager to sample the experience would do well to travel to Elmhurst. There are intriguing opportunities for surprise in wandering from shop to shop where English is a foreign language and where pointing is one of the best means of communication.\nA visitor to Elmhurst the other day, for example, wandered into Sancocho, a Colombian coffee shop at 76-09 Broadway, where bunuelos ( a kind of fried dough) and sancocho (a lusty stew) are the specialties. She asked for a menu, but was told there was none. In broken Spanish, she explained that she had already had lunch but wanted to sample a batido, a kind of fruit milkshake. When asked what flavor she wanted she said she did not know and was directed to several sketches on the wall, each with the name of a fruit in Spanish, none of which the visitor recognized. Having no idea what it was, she nevertheless chose maracuya and some minutes later was presented with a sweet, frothy, delicious concoction that tasted of mangoes.\nHere in Elmhurst the curious can find not only adventure and exotic fare, but also concrete proof that the city's great melting pot happily bubbles on. ELMHURST OR BUST\nGoing to Elmhurst? It's a quick subway ride (less than 20 minutes) from midtown Manhattan. Take the No. 7 train to 74th Street and Broadway, or take the E, F or R train to Roosevelt Avenue. From Brooklyn, take the G train to Roosevelt Avenue. By car, take Queens Boulevard west from the Long Island Expressway to Broadway. No passport required."}, {"text": "WAR IN THE GULF: Kuwait; For a Jubilant Crowd in Kuwait City, It's Victory Signs, Tears and Kisses\n1991-02-28T05:00:00.000Z\nAlthough the inky smoke from burning oilfields formed a pall overhead, the people of Kuwait City lined their streets in jubilation today waving Kuwaiti flags, flashing victory signs, crying and often kissing those they took to be members of the allied force that captured the city in the last 24 hours.\nAlong the three-lane main highway into the city, women in long black veils hugged each other and laughed while their husbands climbed atop the cement dividers to fire off their automatic weapons. The black, green, white and red Kuwaiti flag, which had vanished from public display during Iraq's occupation, suddenly appeared everywhere, draped on cars, buildings and even peoples clothing.\nOne man, standing through the sunroof of his car, waved an American flag he had made out of old pajamas and refused to heed a Kuwaiti military man's advice to stop blocking traffic when he stopped to talk to a reporter. 'All the Allies'\n\"We give special thanks to Mr. Bush and all the allies: The British, the French, the Egyptians, CNN,\" he said before adding, \"We are very sorry any American soldiers were killed.\"\nFor several hours at least, the martial-law regulations limiting civilian movement that had been put into effect the day before were put on hold as the celebrations took over.\nGas stations were open today for the first time in weeks and the roads were full of cars, many of them weaving in and out of the lanes with horns blaring. The joyous din was only occasionally punctuated by sporadic automatic-weapons and tank fire from the airport, where skirmishes still continued. There was also a sense of danger conveyed in the radio announcements advising people to look for mines and booby traps.\nBut for people who had lived through seven months of Iraqi occupation, fear had finally ended and the grins seen everywhere were gleeful and infectious. 'You Are Great People'\n\"Welcome, welcome to Kuwait,\" they yelled at a convoy of passing cars. \"You are great people, we like Americans, we like Americans,\" said a man flashing a victory sign, an enormous Kuwaiti flag and a video camera.\nIn the Yarmook School, which like most schools have been used to quarter Iraqi troops, the Kuwaiti resistance kept guard over 102 Iraqi soldiers.\nThe men sat quietly in a smoke-filled room, surrounded by empty water bottles. In the classrooms were looted goods from homes and stores, including television sets and car parts.\nIn front of the gutted remains of the Meridien Hotel, some 30 hotel workers from Bangladesh, who were living the hotel's underground garage, waved Kuwait flags. Hotel Set Afire\n\"The Iraqi soldiers came in on the evening of the 23d and said we had five minutes to get out because the American planes were coming to bomb the hotel,\" said Rafiquel Islam. \"Then they set the hotel on fire and shot at it with a tank.\"\nThe war has transformed the country into a pitted and gouged moonscape. Spent rocket and cluster bomb casings litter the long flat scrub-covered desert that line the main highway.\nDalal al Quenaee, 14, and her parents were searching through a truck abandoned by fleeing Iraqi soldiers.\nThey were piling goods into their car, including two Soviet-made rocket-propelled-grenade launchers. Her mother held an Iraqi helmet in her hand. 'Some Interesting Things'\n\"We have been inside our homes for a week,\" the girl said. \"We thought we might find some interesting things in here, some good souvenirs.\"\nThe hulks of incinerated Iraqi tanks lay along the main roadway. At one point, a missile had apparently blown a tank turret off the vehicle's main body, depositing it several feet away, completely charred.\nAt another point one of the Allied soldiers had evidently placed his mark on a destroyed Iraqi armored personnel carrier, scrawling, \"Kuwait. Love or Leave It.\" The power lines along the road had all been cut, leaving Kuwait City without electricity. Boats and Bottles\nThe road was also littered with the more private debris of flight: Suitcases, bottles, a tea kettle and a blue fiberglass fishing boat.\nThe most hellish sights were those of six burning oil wells, whose orange flames gave an eerie cast to the sky while the acrid smell of the smoke clung to everything.\nMany of those interviewed testified to having seen the most brutal crimes, including murder, kidnapping and rape, committed by the Iraqis. Most recently, many said, the Iraqis had taken thousands of Kuwaiti men hostage into Iraq, to Baghdad and to Basra to use as human shields.\n\"We couldn't sleep at night because we were afraid,\" said Entessar Mohammed al-Azimi, a 17-year-old English major at a local girl's high school here. \"There was no food, no water. Any woman that was pretty, they took her. We couldn't walk in the streets after 9 P.M.\" Father Is Ransomed\nShe said her 12-year-old brother was recently shot and wounded by Iraqi soldiers for yelling \"Free Kuwait! Saddam Hussein is not our president!\" and explained that when her father was recently arrested, the family managed to free him by bribing Iraqi soldiers and then arranging his escape to Saudi Arabia.\nKuther Sadoon celebrated today by riding with other women friends looking for a restaurant to eat out. She is an Iraqi but is married to a Kuwaiti man. Several weeks ago Iraqi soldiers took her husband prisoner and brought him to Basra, where she was allowed to visit him once. She said they had not allowed him to eat or to wash.\nHer anger, like that of all the Kuwaitis interviewed, was directed at Mr. Hussein. \"I say Iraqi people are not responsible for all this,\" she said. \"It is just one man who has made them do it: Saddam Hussein.\"\nOver and over again the people on the streets referred to Mr. Hussein as an \"animal.\"\nAt nightfall, as the skies turned orange from the burning wells, a convoy of Military Police, Central Command Joint Information Bureau personnel and reporters circled their vehicles like covered wagons around the grounds of the Equestrian Club, near the airport, which had been the scene of heavy fighting less than 24 hours earlier.\nTwo scrawny horses roamed the yard. One of the buildings had been turned into a hospital by the Iraqi forces. Needles and gauze were on the floor, while on a table were plates with half eaten portions of food left by the Iraqis who seemingly had their dinner interrupted 24 hours earlier."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1991-03-06T05:00:00.000Z\nAfter the War A14-17\nIraq voided the annexation of Kuwait and agreed to return seized Kuwaiti assets, the Baghdad radio said, while the nation's most populous section seethed with revolt.

On that day of referendum, at least two out of three Ukrainians are likely to vote to assert their country's national sovereignty. On that day, the Soviet \"union\" will die.\nThe courageous early move of the Baltic states was the key to disunion, but the departure of Ukraine is the sledgehammer blow. Imagine the United States without its southeastern quadrant; subtract the old Confederacy from our map to get an idea of what an impact on Russian colonialism the separation of Ukraine's 52 million people and productive capacity will have.\nOn the overnight train from Moscow to Kiev, the visitor gets a notion of the potential richness of the land. Black loam, intensive cultivation and a friendly climate add up to food production and economic power as soon as frustrated farmers are given transportation and the incentives of private property and personal gain. This is potentially France, not Bangladesh.\nWe should shake free of our old questions (What will independence do to the Soviet Union? How will Russia survive without its breadbasket?) and address the new: What sort of nation will Ukraine be?\nStrongly nationalistic, for openers. The word \"Ukraine\" means \"borderland\"; its Catholic west faces Europe, its Greek Orthodox east faces Asia. To win the coming referendum, the Ukrainians in the west have been actively selling the Russian-speaking population in the east (including those in the Crimea, a Black Sea gift to Ukraine from Khrushchev) on the glories of nationhood.\nOpportunistic, too. The candidate leading the race for the presidency is Leonid Kravchuk, a longtime Communist subservient to the Kremlin and silent during the coup who has undergone a miraculous conversion to independence. He has stolen the Rukh opposition's platform, and if he gets away with the flip-flop, it will be a measure of the populace's desire for freedom from Moscow without too much change at home.\nAnd Ukraine may spell trouble. American policy makers worry about plans announced in Kiev for a 400,000-man army, but that is a third of the Red Army troops now stationed here and may be a device for shipping the Russians home while keeping Ukrainian troops employed. The real trouble will be in enticing the new nation into giving up its nuclear weapons.\nEven with milk in Kiev still suspect after the Chernobyl metldown, Ukrainian politicians, are not eager to give up the Soviet nuclear missiles located on their territory. Privately, some Kievans say that these weapons are bargaining chips for Russian cooperation on oil-for-grain trade and for Western help.\nThe center, as the poet Yeats predicted, cannot hold. We should stop supporting Moscow center and stop lecturing the Ukrainians on the need to ship the missiles to responsible Russia. That simplistic Bush-Gorbachev approach, typical of the offensive \"chicken Kiev\" speech, won't work.\nInstead, as Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, hints, Washington should negotiate through the center's paper union with Russia, Ukraine and the other nuclear republics to dismantle land-based ICBM's until a level is reached at which the only missiles remaining happen to be on the Russian republic's soil. The criterion need not be insultingly geographic to bring about that stabilizing result.\nComplex? You bet. But with Ukraine as a player, Washington will have to stop wishing for the good old days of union dictatorship."}, {"text": "Washington Talk; Question on Jobless Bill: Can It Survive a Veto?\n1991-09-24T05:00:00.000Z\nSometime in the next week or so, Congress will almost certainly send President Bush a Democratic bill that would spend about $6 billion to help 3 million people who have been out of work for at least half a year.\nBefore then, Republicans will denounce the bill as a \"budget buster,\" as President Bush did in killing a similar measure last month. They will say, as Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said Friday that the Democrats are more interested in an issue than in helping the unemployed with as many as 20 more weeks of jobless benefits.\nThe Democrats will say that opposition to this bill shows that Republicans care more about Kurds or Bangladeshis, for whom Mr. Bush has approved deficit-busting spending, than about Americans.\nThe issue will probably come down to whether Congress can override a Bush veto for the first time. The votes seem to be there in the House. In the Senate, Mr. Dole predicts that Mr. Bush can be upheld. But he is supposed to say that, and the question will be just how many Republicans facing re-election in suffering states vote to override.\nIf Mr. Dole is wrong, the long-term jobless will get the benefits. If he is correct, the Democrats will have an issue. Indeed, one lawmaker deeply involved with the bill said he hoped Mr. Bush signed it so the unemployed would be sure to get the money, but if that did not happen, \"I wouldn't mind having the issue.\"\nThis partisan tangle raises several questions about the way Congress and the White House do business.\nThe Republicans raise one of them: If this is an \"emergency,\" as the Democrats insist, why did they wait to force the issue until more than a year after the recession began?\nRepublicans criticize the Democrats for waiting this long, and Richard G. Darman, Mr. Bush's budget director, insists the extra benefits are unnecessary because the recession is over. Put forth by the Republicans, that is just a debating point; they would have opposed the bill with as much energy in April as now.\nIn late April, House Democrats were ready to try to pass a bill, even if it let Republicans label them as big spenders. But so tentative was their commitment that when the April unemployment totals dipped, they backed off --although the decline was recognized as a statistical quirk and although some 300,000 people a month continued to exhaust their benefits.\nThat fear of a \"tax and spend\" label caused most Democrats' refusal, last week, to vote to offer Mr. Bush a choice between a higher deficit now or higher employers' taxes in 1993.\nDemocrats did bring the issue to the floor in mid-summer, fearing to look especially foolish if they went on vacation without doing anything. But they sent Mr. Bush a bill he killed with minimum risk, because he could sign it to assert his sympathy for the jobless and then refuse to declare the emergency required to increase the deficit under the 1990 budget act. That declaration was required to release the money. The same approach is in the Senate bill this time, but it is expected to be dropped in conference with the House, so that Mr. Bush would be sent a bill that specifically waives the budget act and which he must sign or veto.\nAn equally serious question is why neither side is trying to reach a compromise. Mr. Dole, who thinks being against the unemployed is bad politics, has an alternative -- a bill that would help fewer jobless for shorter periods of time. It would cost much less, and it would be paid for, not by raising the deficit, but by auctioning off unused radio frequencies and tightening student loan repayments. Mr. Bush said today that he wanted the Dole bill. But there are too many Democrats for it to have a chance.\nYet if both sides wanted to, they could cut a deal. For the Democrats, dealing now would impose two high costs. One would be that they would give up their best chance yet of overriding a Bush veto. And the consequence would be giving the unemployed less than they have promised.\nFor the Republicans and Mr. Bush, dealing now might invite other attempts to bypass the budget agreement for domestic spending. For the President, even the Dole bill is a step away from insisting that there was no real economic problem out there."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1991-05-15T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational A3-17\nWinnie Mandela was sentenced to six years in prison for her involvement in the kidnapping and assault of four young men in late 1988.

Foley pushed today for Congressional action to extend unemployment benefits, saying he wanted the House Ways and Means Committee to address the problem.\nHis statement came three days after a proposal by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to declare an emergency, as provided by last year's budget law, and to lengthen the benefit period, relying on the $8 billion Federal unemployment trust fund. The benefits now exceed 26 weeks in Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico.\nWith leading Democrats in the House and the Senate now moving to extend benefits, Congressional action could come in September. Mr. Foley, Mr. Bentsen and others have argued that even if the recession was coming to an end, unemployment was still at 7 percent in June and would remain high for several more months.\nThey say that the Government should move against a domestic disaster like unemployment under budget emergency provisions, just as it helped distressed people overseas like the Kurds and Bangladeshis. Selective on Emergencies?\nAt a breakfast meeting with reporters, Mr. Foley commented that to President Bush, \"everything outside the country is an emergency.\" But when it comes to the \"problems of American workers,\" he said, \"those are never emergencies.\"\nThe Speaker, a Democrat from Washington, said he would prefer an approach like that of Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island. Mr. Downey's measure would change the unemployment compensation system, making it harder for states to deny benefits to unemployed workers, and paying for those changes with higher taxes on employers.\nBut if there were not enough votes to support a plan including a tax increase, he said, he would support an approach like Senator Bentsen's, under which benefits could be provided for a year without raising taxes.\nMr. Foley's remarks were apparently directed at Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The remarks were seen as a mild prod to act on the issue. The two leaders had discussed the matter earlier this week.\nMr. Downey introduced his proposal in March. Mr. Rostenkowski has been unwilling to bring it up in committee without being sure that he has the votes to pass it. Nor has it been clear that there was sufficient support for the measure in the full House even if he could get it out of committee.\nSome Democrats have contended that this issue is important enough as a symbol of the party's commitment to disadvantaged workers that it should be pressed, even if it faces defeat. But Mr. Rostenkowski is known for keeping bills off the floor until he is sure they can pass.\nIn an interview today, Mr. Downey conceded there was not enough support in the panel or in the full House to enact his initial proposal because it included a tax increase.\nHe said a vote by the committee for an approach like Mr. Bentsen's was likely before the end of this month. Such a short-term approach was the only one with a chance of passage, he said, \"given the fact that no one wants to pay for this, in either chamber.\" A Problem Demanding Urgency\nMr. Bentsen also deplored the lack of willingness to raise taxes for unemployment benefits. \"I'd rather do pay-as-you-go and do permanent reform,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"But it will take time to do that, and we need to deal with the suffering now.\"\nMr. Bentsen said he was not sure when he would seek action from the Finance Committee, but he conceded, \"it will be damn tough to get it done.\"\nUnder current law, unemployment benefits for as many as 26 weeks are paid through state taxes on employers. Extended benefits, for an additional 13 weeks, can be paid through a program financed equally by Federal and state unemployment taxes.\nA state becomes eligible for that program when at least 5 percent of its workers covered by unemployment insurance apply for benefits, and the rate of unemployed insured workers exceeds the average of the last two years by at least one-fifth. If the rate is at least 6 percent, a state can choose to pay extended benefits without regard to the last two years.\nMr. Bentsen's proposal would finance extended benefits entirely from the Federal trust fund. The fund includes $8 billion and is growing despite the recession because few states are now eligible to use it.\nHis program would be in effect until June 30, 1992.\nThe program would offer four levels of extended benefits.\nIf the jobless rate was 8 percent or higher, an additional 20 weeks could be provided. If a state's unemployment rate was 7 percent, it could provide 13 weeks of benefits. If the rate was 6 percent, it could provide seven weeks of extended benefits.\nAll other states would be allowed to provide four more weeks of benefits."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1991-03-03T05:00:00.000Z\nAfter the War 16-19\nIraq's second city is engulfed in chaos as thousands of Iraqi troops have poured in.

Fishermen bring coolers and buckets overflowing with freshly caught trout and salmon and chunks of ocean tuna. In season, they bring pails of fresh bluefish and Connecticut River shad. Hunters come with venison, pheasant, ducks, geese and wild turkeys. Farmers deliver hogs, chickens, turkeys and beef to the spotless white processing plant.\nCustom smoking now accounts for only a small part of the business at Nodine's, which grossed $2.5 million last year. But when Ron and Johanne Nodine opened their first smokehouse 20 years ago, custom smoking was the whole business.\n\"Ron was an unemployed computer engineer, and I worked at the post office and as a cream tester for cows,\" recalled Mrs. Nodine. \"For $200 we bought an old wooden smokehouse from a fellow in Burrville who did custom smoking in the winter. He was going to teach us everything. But that weekend he had a heart attack and died. My husband had one day of instruction from a UConn ag professor, and we were in business.\"\nThe Nodines set up the smokehouse on their 11-acre farm in Goshen. Then they reluctantly expanded into retailing with ham and bacon.\nMrs. Nodine said: \"People would say: 'Remember the pig I raised last year? I need a ham for Easter.' We had no intention of entering retail, but people asked for it.\"\nThe couple then brought their nitrite-free bacon to Balducci's and Zabar's, the specialty markets in Manhattan. The business was off and running -- until they had to cope with a tidal wave of fat.\nTiny Goshen had no sewers, and the Nodines' land could not support a complex septic system. Their 12-room house had already given up six rooms to the business, which threatened to take over every inch of remaining space. So three years ago the Nodines decided to move into an old knitting mill in nearby Torrington.\nThe conversion took a year and began with ripping out five miles of concrete floor to install grease traps. Today more than 85 percent of the fat is captured in barrels in the cellar and sold for use in cosmetics.\nTorrington is happy to have the Nodines, said Mayor Delia Donne, adding, \"Their mail-order business is making us well known all over the country.\"\nMrs. Nodine said: \"We moved here, and I would say our sales dropped to where they had been two years earlier. It was not the time to move. However, I don't think you would find a bank today that would be willing to lend the money to put in the plant. We're talking a million and a half dollars, unless you happen to have a million dollars already.\"\nThe smokehouse is redolent of barbecue spices. Barrels of chicken breasts, slabs of bacon and racks of spareribs await smoking, curing in a mixture of salt, water, sugar, spices and preservatives. A fine-flake combination of South Carolina hickory and New England sugar maple smolders on metal trays, and the smoke is forced into the smokers, large steel boxes.\nThis combination of wood produces a flavor that is lighter \"than stuff smoked over corn cobs and mesquite,\" explained the sales manager at Nodine's, Khoury Mubarek.\nTrout takes four hours of smoking and 25 minutes of cooking, he said. Turkeys weighing 22 to 24 pounds are reduced to 18 pounds by 12 to 14 hours of cooking and smoking. Smoked meat is fully cooked and does not require any further cooking.\nThese delicacies are expensive. But amid the smoked salmon and Finnish Gruyere are several barrels of mundane ground turkey destined for Connecticut's prisons.\n\"Many prisoners don't eat pork,\" explained Mr. Mubarek. \"Every month we supply a half-ton of smoked turkey kielbasa for a private-label company that sells to the state prison system.\"\nMuch of Nodine's product is marketed by six glossy catalogue companies and in Manhattan specialty stores and restaurants. Nodine's issues a small folder listing its own products as well. Gourmet-style smoked food is returning to popularity, Mr. Mubarek said, although only three other smokehouses remain in New England, fewer than 100 nationally.\nA small retail shop in Goshen, behind the Nodines' home, offers smoked ham, turkey, quail and goose. The shop's freezer holds venison steak and buffalo stew, smoked kielbasa, Cornish game hens and Idaho trout. Smoked pepper jack cheese, Gruyere, Swiss and provolone crowd the delicatessen case. The shop also offers Moroccan oil, ginger jelly, pickled fiddleheads, apple ketchup and canned elk.\n\"We've smoked every fish that swims in the ocean,\" Mr. Mubarek said. One Manhattan restaurant wanted smoked tomatoes and smoked onions for a special menu, he said.\nNodine's imports rattlesnake from California, venison from New Zealand farms, scallops from Iceland and shrimp from Bangladesh for smoking. The only Connecticut product the business purchases is pheasant from Glastonbury, Mr. Mubarek said. All the fish it sells is farm raised, except bluefish, tuna and Pacific swordfish.\n\"I never buy swordfish from the East Coast,\" he said. \"I worry about mercury contamination.\" Health concerns about nitrites do not seem to have affected Nodine's sales, although the company now offers nitrite-free bacon, turkey and chicken breast, pheasant and quail.\n\"The nitrite scare has passed,\" said Mrs. Nodine. \"Some customers say, 'Why can't we use old-fashioned saltpeter?' Of course, I tell them that's the same thing.\"\nAlthough each week Nodine's sells up to three tons of chicken breast, its most popular item, \"the bad economy hurts us, because restaurants are the largest single failing business in the country now,\" Mr. Mubarek said. To compensate for the weakened New England economy, the business is expanding its market into Michigan, Florida and Georgia, he said.\nThe Federal Department of Agriculture occupies an office on the premises and has the right to inspect the meat at any time. The department's officer, who rotates through Nodine's and three other nearby plants, is responsible for checking sanitation, product quality, the formula of the curing liquid and the label information for new products. Recipes for those new products are adjusted through a taste-testing process, Mrs. Nodine said.\nHer husband \"usually makes a product and says, 'I want everyone's opinion,' \" she said. \"We went out to a friend's house for Sunday dinner with three sausage samples. He said, 'All right, what do you like?' Everyone said: 'Forget the second sausage, the first was spicy, and the third was bland. What do you need the middle one for?' \"\nThe smokehouse began as \"a business my husband and I could work at together,\" said Mrs. Nodine. They still work together -- along with 31 employees. With a weak economy and unpredictable consumer taste, she said, the business is changing rapidly.\nMrs. Nodine added: \"I had a group of high school kids come in the other day, and I told them: 'If you go into business, don't think you're going to stay in that same business. You have to change.' I didn't want to get any bigger. But a business is like a baby: it grows or it dies.\""}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1991-05-07T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational A3-17\nControl of the Russian coal industry was transferred from the Kremlin to the Russian republic.

The police said he was stabbed several times on Thursday night and left in the hallway outside his office at Tsukuba University.\nIt is the second time this month that someone involved with the production of the novel by Mr. Rushdie, the Indian-born author condemned to death by the Iranian authorities two years ago, has been assaulted. On July 3, Ettore Capriolo, 61, the Italian translator of \"The Satanic Verses,\" was stabbed in his apartment in Milan. He survived the attack with what were described as superficial wounds. Rushdie Urges Death Order's End\nThe Milan police have made no arrests and offered no theory on the attacker. But the authorities said without elaboration that the assailant told Mr. Capriolo that he had a \"connection\" to the Iranian Embassy in Rome. A man reached at the embassy late today said no officials were available for comment.\nThe police reported that a janitor had found the body of Mr. Igarashi near an elevator on the seventh floor of the building with slash wounds on his neck, face and hands. They said an autopsy showed that he died between 10 P.M. on Thursday and 2 A.M. today.\nIn addition to translating \"The Satanic Verses,\" Mr. Igarashi wrote books on Islam, including \"The Islamic Renaissance\" and \"Medicine and Wisdom of the East.\"\nMr. Rushdie went into hiding in 1989 after his novel's publication in Britain brought a call by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran for Muslims to kill the author. Ayatollah Khomeini, who said the book was blasphemous and anti-Islamic, died in June 1989, but the assassination order has been reaffirmed by the Iranian authorities.\nIn the last year, Mr. Rushdie, a British citizen and Muslim who was born in Bombay, has started to give interviews, make some public appearances and issue statements construed as an apology for his book, saying he never intended to defame Islam.\nBut the Iranian Government refused to withdraw its assassination order, although it appeared until these recent incidents that the immediate threat to Mr. Rushdie might have subsided with the passage of time.\nReuters reported from London that Mr. Rushdie said in a written statement today, \"I am extremely distressed by the news of the murder of Mr. Hitoshi Igarashi and I offer my condolences and deepest sympathy to his family.\" He appealed to the British, Italian and Japanese Governments and other world leaders \"to make urgent representations to the Government of Iran\" to have the death order set aside. Outcry Against the Novel\nNo person or group in Japan asserted responsibility for the killing of Mr. Igarashi, which came to light late this afternoon, and the police said they had no specific evidence that it was carried out because of the novel.\nBut news organizations reported that the publisher of the novel had received death threats from Islamic militants and that Mr. Igarashi had for a time been given bodyguards. Family members of Mr. Igarashi said on television tonight that he had not received any death threats that they knew of.\nIt did not appear that Mr. Igarashi had any security guards at the time of his death. The police said he seemed to have been killed after some students left him about 7 P.M. on Thursday, and that perhaps the incident occurred as he was heading out the door of his office at Tsukuba University, about 40 miles northeast of Tokyo.\nIn 1989, the Islamic Center in Japan requested publishers, newspapers, magazines and broadcast stations not to translate or reproduce the novel, which it called an \"anti-Islamic\" work that \"contains filthy remarks and ridicules fundamental beliefs of Islam.\" 'We Cannot Forgive the Novel'\nThere are few native Japanese Muslims, but there is a large community of Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and others who worship at the Islamic Center in the Akasaka district of Tokyo. News reports said the center had about 30,000 members.\nLast year as well, a leader of a Japanese association of Pakistanis joined the condemnations of Mr. Rushdie, saying he deserved to die because of the book.\n\"We cannot forgive the novel because it is insulting our prophet indecently and making God's words Devil's words,\" the spokesman said at the time.\nNevertheless, the publisher, Shinseisha, a medium-sized house, went ahead, drawing demonstrators outside its offices in 1990. At a news conference in early 1990, a Pakistani was arrested after disrupting the scene and trying to assault a promoter of the book. A Success but Not a Best Seller\nJapanese news organizations reported that \"The Satanic Verses\" had sold about 60,000 or 70,000 copies in Japan, making it a success but not a best seller by Japanese standards.\nDespite the threats to the publishers, the Japan Book Publishing Association said in 1990 that it supported the publishers and promoters of the book, saying, \"We will make as much cooperation as possible with those organizations on this issue as we obey the basic legal rules.\"\nBut some bookstores were more cautious, hesitating to sell the novel or at least to display it. A spokesman for Maruzen books, a leading bookstore chain, told The Japan Times in 1990 that \"it is difficult for us to put the book on counters because of possible confusions.\""}, {"text": "AFTER THE WAR: KUWAIT; A SHATTERED CITY STRUGGLES FOR LIFE\n1991-03-01T05:00:00.000Z\nBehind the newly fluttering flags and the cheers of its residents, this once-thriving city of wide avenues, opulent residences, modern high-rise buildings and massive mosques appeared today as a maimed victim of war whose spine has been hurt and whose nerves and circulation were shattered.\nStreet after street of stores, banks and restaurants had their shutters drawn. Scarcely any food was available. The city's desalting plant was in ruins, so there was no drinking water. The power plant was not functioning and the only people who had electricity were those with generators and the fuel to run them. Some Kuwaitis said they had sold furniture and television sets to buy food.\nMany of the hotels that had once catered to international businessmen, stood like desolate hulks, charred from shellfire aimed at them by the Iraqi forces in the last week of their occupation. The National Assembly Building had been set ablaze. Threat of Amphibious Attack\nThe winding palm-lined boulevard along the seaside, which had given the city the aspect of a Mediterranean resort, had been turned into a fortified barricade by the Iraqi troops as they evidently prepared to counter an amphibious landing by American-led troops that never came. The beach was covered with razor-sharp concertina wire, bunkers and artillery pieces pointing out to sea,\nIn marked contrast to the scenes of destruction, the United States Embassy apparently emerged from the occupation in good shape. The American flag that had been left flying when the last United States diplomats left the besieged complex last December, was still flying today when the American military repossessed the buildings.\nIn a scene that appeared to be a mirror image of the helicopter evacuation of the United States Embassy in Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War, a helicopter hovered over the embassy here and dropped Special Forces troops onto the roof. The men then searched the buildings and grounds, looking for booby traps and securing the installation in preparation for the return tomorrow of the United States Ambassador. U.S. Troops Welcomed\nAmerican troops were posted in a security perimeter outside the high white walls of the embassy. They were often affectionately mobbed by Kuwaitis who either shook or kissed their hands. When the helicopters arrived with the Special Forces, the crowd outside went wild. Some threw candy at the soldiers, some beat drums and the women joined in a ululating chant.\n\"I'm sure this equals what our parents saw in World War II,\" said Capt. Doug Wisnioski, an Army officer stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C. \"It makes the waiting and anticipation worth it.\"\nElsewhere in the city, Qatari troops paraded their armored personnel carriers down the main roads, firing off automatic weapons.\nLess jubilant barrages of small-arms fire were also reported in sections of the city populated by Palestinians. Young Kuwaitis belonging to the Mukhawa, a group that had mainatained an underground struggle against the Iarqis, were conducting patrols in search of Iraqi stragglers or collaborators. A Dark Afternoon\nClouds and the smoke from oil-well fires blocked the sun so that at 2 P.M. cars had to turn on their headlights.\nFor most Kuwaitis, the day still had to be spent in struggle, although with the retaking of the city the main goal was to secure the essentials in life: warmth, food, and gasoline for transport and generators. Gasoline was being distributed without cost but only at two or three pumps in the city, which had to be operated manually. At these pumps, operated and controlled by the young armed men from the Mukhawa group, cars were lined up for blocks. The first priority went to ambulances and police cars.\nHospitals are admitting only emergency cases. At Mubarak al-Kabir Hospital, the largest in the city, the doctors said the Iraqis had removed their most basic equipment, including many ambulances. Accounts of Torture\nThe doctors also confirmed some of the accounts of torture by the Iraqis that have been surfacing over the last seven months. Dr. Badr al-Otaibi, an internist, said the hospital had received on average three to four young people every week who had been beaten, shot in the head, or had their fingernails pulled out.\nA surgeon, Dr. Abdel Sabboubeh, said that the hospital had admitted many patients sufferring from psychological trauma. Another doctor, Dr. Abdul Rida Abbas, in charge of the ambulance corps, said that his unit had received two or three calls a day during the last month to pick up corpses from police stations, then being used by Iraqi security forces. The bodies were often riddled with bullets, he said, and often shot through the face.\nIn the hospital's orthopedic ward, 34 Iraqi soldiers, many of whom were captured as they attempted to walk to Basra in Iraq, huddled in their beds. One of them, Col. Rajef al-Azami, 40 years old, said that a day before he had been shot twice by a member of the Kuwaiti irregular force. He insisted he did not know that Iraqi soldiers had killed civilians in Kuwait and kept repeating that he was only a soldier and had obeyed orders. Iraqi Soldier's Account\nBut Iraqi infantry soldiers in the hospital gave more extensive testimony to their experience under fire. Muhta Khodayer, a Bedouin reservist from western Iraq who was a veteran of his country's eight-year war with Iran, was shot and wounded at Wafra on the Saudi border on Feb. 26. He spoke of endurring the terrible bombardments by allied troops and he volunteered a despairing view of Iraq's role in the war: \"We came to the wrong place. This is an Arab country. They are our family. In Iran it was all Arab nations, even America standing with us. But in Kuwait everyone is against us,\" he said.\nIn a bed near him, 21-year-old Dakhil el-Abbas, lay with broken legs and tubes through his stomach. He said he had been shot by his own officers when he refused to walk to Iraq from the Saudi border the previous week. Of his two brothers who had been with him in the trenches, he said that one had deserted to Saudi Arabia and the other was killed for trying to desert. He said the last three days before the ground war began, the soldiers had cowered in their trenches, terrified by the intense bombing.\nThree days after allied troops had entered their city, a trickle of people began returning to work. At the Kuwaiti International Hotel, darkened hallways were filled with hundreds of journalists and and military personnel. Some of the reporters struggled under flashlights to coax expensive satellite phones into operation.\nAmong those arriving for work were some Bangladeshi employees who had stayed put since the beginning of the war. Among these people was Mahmud A. Qatanani, who at dawn turned up to resume his duties as a security guard at the United States Embassy across the street from the hotel.\nBut in addition to the cheers of triumph and the wails of the vanquished, some Kuwaitis again enjoyed small and ordinary pastimes. For the first time in seven months, Dr. Iman Mokaddas, a 29-year-old pathologist, took her 3-year-old daughter, Radya, for a walk on the long, meandering promenade that overlooks the harbor here. Rolls of barbed wire and Iraqi tanks had made it off-limits before the city was retaken.\n\"Little by little, we will try to get our lives back to normal,\" said Dr. Mokaddas."}, {"text": "WAR IN THE GULF: Saudi Arabia; G.I.'s Bristle but Pay Nonetheless as Saudi Stores Double Their Prices on a Desert Road\n1991-02-11T05:00:00.000Z\nSaudi shopkeepers along the main northern highway have doubled and tripled prices as United States troops have poured into the northern desert and come to rely on local stores for the small amenities like snack food and kerosene heaters that the Army does not provide.\nThe jump in prices has angered many soldiers, especially since the brief trips they make from their desert encampments to buy supplies are usually the only contact they have with the Saudi population.\n\"They have no morals to do this to us,\" said Pvt. Elizabeth A. Sandels as she stood next to a vendor selling small teapots and cookie pans in the tiny town of Sadwi. \"We put ourselves on the line and they don't care. All they can think about is making money.\"\nSoldiers, driving from their northern desert positions, descend to the paved highway that runs from the Persian Gulf in the east to Jordan in the west. The highway, which has been labeled Dodge Road, is the only paved surface that runs parallel to the border with Kuwait and Iraq. New Supplies Shipped In\nAt various spots along the road, usually congregated around a gas station, are collections of small tin-roofed shacks that sell canned food and basic household items. The merchandise is typically covered with a thin layer of dust and is stacked in haphazard piles both inside and outside the stores.\nStore owners are suddenly besieged by hundreds of new buyers who pay the prices they are asked, an unusual phenomenon in the Middle East. They have been busy shipping in stacks of the supplies now most in demand, like foam mattresses, kerosene stoves and heaters, cases of soda, plastic siphon pumps, cigarettes and cooking supplies.\n\"The only thing they don't have now is Copenhagen,\" said Sgt. Darryl J. Washington, referring to the chewing tobacco that is popular with many soldiers.\nSoldiers complain that on each new trip they are paying more and more for the same items.\n\"We bought one of these four days ago from this same place,\" said Sgt. Bobby C. Sampson as he stood next to a stack of Korean-made kerosene heaters. \"It cost $40. Today, he wants $70.\" From $3 to $12\nThin foam mattresses that sold for $3 a month ago now sell for $10 to $12. A carton of cigarettes has jumped from $6 to $15 and a box of 24 Snickers bars has climbed from $6 to $15.\n\"I had to quit smoking,\" said Pvt. Dennis J. Barnett from Billings, Mont. \"I just can't afford to pay this much for cigarettes.\"\nThe store owners are unapologetic about the decision to raise prices, citing the long haul needed to bring supplies from the capital, Riyadh, and the risk involved in working in a war zone.\n\"We stay here in this dangerous area,\" said one store owner, Khamel al Anzy. \"We do not have gas masks or these chemical uniforms. Why else would we risk our lives unless it was for money?\"\nSpecialist Julian F. Edwards, who comes from the Bronx, said: \"These places are just ripping us off. I hate every one of these people. We come here to help out and all they want is our money.\"\nSgt. Ellis Jones from Montgomery, Ala., said, \"We are all up front and we come back to the rear, these people are slicing open our pockets.\" Few Stores, Many Soldiers\nThe dearth of stores means that large numbers of soldiers, often with long lists that must be filled for those left behind, converge on the few hole-in-the-wall shops along the highway. As the numbers have grown, the wheeling and dealing has become more frenetic.\nIn a tiny, poorly lit restaurant a young man behind the counter was selling chicken and rice wrapped in tinfoil.\nIn a matter of minutes the price, swung from $3 to $5 for a portion.\nIn another shop, a soldier was sold three bags of potato chips for four rials, the Saudi currency, and the next in line was sold two bags for two rials.\nIn another shop, a merchant was busy selling pirated tapes of American music, most of which he had copied from cassettes obtained from American soldiers.\n\"You got any gospel?\" Sgt. Rockie G. Williams said slowly to the baffled merchant, who proceeded to hand him a tape marked \"Disco Hits.\"\n\"I doubt they have any gospel here,\" the sergeant mused, \"what with their religious background.\" Bargaining Ends\nThe attendants are often young men from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Iraq. Most of those from the latter country fled during the war with Iran to escape the draft.\nThe prices of goods are not marked and the Americans have little idea of the local value.\n\"In the beginning we could bargain,\" said Sergeant Jones, \"but not now. They stick to the prices and the only place they go is up. This is the only spot on the road for us G.I.'s to go and they know it.\"\nThe soldiers can pay for their goods in dollars, but the store owners refuse to honor the official exchange rate of 3.7 rials to the dollar. The shopkeepers take dollars at a rate of three rials to the dollar.\n\"Do you see any banks here?\" said one attendant, Massoud Barvez. \"We do this as a favor.\" Reporter Is Detained\nDHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, Monday, Feb. 11 (Special to The New York Times) -- Military officials detained a correspondent for The New York Times for six hours on Sunday afternoon and took away his press credentials for conducting what they called unauthorized interviews.\nThe reporter, Chris Hedges, had been interviewing shopkeepers and some American soldiers making purchases along a Saudi road about 50 miles from the Kuwaiti border.\nMr. Hedges said he was told by Capt. Archie L. Davis 3d, a United States Army public affairs officer, that he was not allowed to be in a \"front-line\" area without an escort.\n\"It was not a military story,\" Mr. Hedges said. \"Yet they felt I had no right to be there and no right to do the story.\"\nMr. Hedges said that Captain Davis told him he had personally confiscated the credentials of a dozen journalists.\nAbout 700 foreign journalists are covering the war from Saudi Arabia. Pentagon guidelines require that all journalists reporting from \"front-line\" areas do so in an accredited pool and be accompanied by a public affairs officer.\nMr. Hedges said he would request today that his credentials be returned."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1991-05-13T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational A3-9\nPresident Assad of Syria rejected Secretary of State Baker's compromise proposals for convening a peace conference, raising doubts that the United States will be able to organize Arab-Israeli talks.

Many suddenly faced choices of resistance, collaboration or something in between.\n\"All of a sudden our entire world collapsed,\" said Luwa al-Iwayed, a 30-year-old administrator in a travel agency, \"We found ourselves waiting for anything to happen to us at any time. Life was not natural.\"\nAs pieced together from scores of interviews conducted in the days since the Iraqis fled, the occupation was characterized by an increasing harshness on the part of the Iraqis as they gravitated from policies of trying to win over the Kuwaitis to ones that tried to brutalize them into submission.\nAnd coinciding with this process, a home-grown underground apparently stiffened and spread.\nFor the first few weeks of the occupation, Kuwaitis were for the most part allowed to go on with their lives and businesses -- unhindered except for the confiscation of some of their cars.\nKuwaitis interviewed said that for the first week they could make international phone calls, and for some weeks they were able to travel freely to Baghdad. The Iraqi secret police, which arrived with the first troops, kept in the background for the first month.\nAt the same time, as posters of a smiling Saddam Hussein were being erected on residential and office buildings, the Iraqis, with great fanfare, made available free food and gasoline.\nOther attempts to gain sympathy included the importing of Kurdish workers from Iraq to take the place of the suddenly departed Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis on garbage trucks. But soon the Kurds quit as well.\nAnother campaign intended to arouse friendly feelings involved the arrival of President Hussein's son, Uday, who as chief of Iraq's Olympic Committee, came to recruit Kuwaiti soccer stars for the Iraqi national team. He flew the young men to Baghdad, where televised reports of the visit were beamed back to Kuwait. In the end, the athletes spurned the offer.\nIn the first days, television showed scenes of what announcers described as a revolutionary government composed of Kuwaitis. But none of those interviewed later could say what happened to these people. They soon disappeared from public view, giving way to police, army and Baath Party officials from Baghdad.\nIn that initial period, as the Iraqis were hoping to legitimize their annexation of Kuwait, they sought to exploit the leadership vacuum that resulted when the Emir, Kuwait's ruler, and other prominent members of the ruling Sabah family fled to Saudi Arabia.\nThe Iraqis tried to solicit support among those who had criticized what they regarded as the Emir's autocratic rule, particularly those who opposed his 1986 decision to disband Parliament. Little Love for Fleeing Royalty\nSome of these critics, nearly all young and Western-educated, recalled feelings akin to shame when they learned how the royal family had fled and the Kuwaiti Army had melted in the face of the Iraqi onslaught.\n\"We felt embarrassed and deceived when all our ministers left,\" said Abdul Aziz al-Mulah, a 29 year-old investment banker.\nBut the Kuwaitis' resolve hardened as the Iraqi occupiers tried to capitalize on these feelings by running newspaper articles that attacked the Sabah family for corruption and showed photographs of such people drinking and dancing in discotheques.\n\"All of us in the opposition realized when the Iraqis came in that we had to devote our energy to getting them out,\" said Ahmed Othman, one of the underground leaders who emerged from the group that had advocated greater democracy. \"Our internal political struggles would have to come later.\"\nWithin days of the takeover, reports of some organized opposition activity began to circulate here and abroad. There were a few, largely symbolic, acts of defiance, like the hanging of a Kuwaiti flag or the scrawling of graffiti ridiculing Saddam Hussein. Some young Kuwaitis helped hide foreign residents at a time when the Iraqis were seeking to take them to Baghdad. Passive Resistance Employed\nThen a pattern of passive but more widespread resistance developed. Kuwaitis refused to go to work, and their children stopped attending schools. Only the hospitals kept operating.\n\"When Iraq realized that it could not win us over, they turned to repression,\" said Saidi Othman, a banker, adding, \"and to a certain extent it worked.\"\nBy September, the secret police made their presence increasingly felt. There were reports of people being shot to death, and many Kuwaitis said they knew of neighbors being detained and beaten.\nThe Iraqi police installed themselves in Kuwaiti police stations and in many private houses, as well. They began searching for those suspected of hiding foreigners or forming underground networks, like the one that began producing a clandestine newspaper. Other targets of the Iraqi police were those suspected of black-market operations, or financing the growing opposition.\nMichael Kand, an importer of perfume and a member of an underground group, said these Iraqi suspicions were justified.\n\"We had one million dinars a week coming through my house,\" he said, explaining an intricate arrangement in which a group of businessmen were able to turn over money to the underground. As Mr. Kand explained it somewhat cryptically, those involved in the operation supplied whatever receipts were necessary after the Iraqis moved to invalidate Kuwaiti currency and replace it with Iraqi dinars. Apparently, with these receipts, Iraqi money, used in all transactions, was not hard to obtain.\n\"The Iraqi currency was filthy and you could smell it from across the room,\" Mr. Kand said, adding that it was nonetheless becoming plentiful. \"We finally had to get a counting machine just to keep up,\" he said.\nA 75-year-old Kuwaiti businessman worked out an ingenious way to move the money. According to members of his family, the man, who was eventually arrested and is believed to still be in Iraq, used canning equipment in his factory to package money, distributing the cans to underground groups.\nThe money went to buy arms from Iraqi soldiers, bribe Iraqi officials to look the other way, release or visit those detained, and stockpile food and medicine in private homes. An AK-47 assault rifle could be bought from Iraqi troops for the equivalent of $100, Kuwaiti underground leaders said. Some Flee With Permission\nIn October, when Iraq announced that it would open its borders for those who wanted to leave, the numbers of refugees, both Kuwaitis and foreigners, surged, draining Kuwait City, the capital, of many of its people. Thise movement also weakened the opposition movement.\n\"It was a good tactic and it hurt,\" Saidi Othman said.\nThe departure of thousands of Kuwaitis, many to luxury hotels around the gulf, still rankles those who remain behind.\n\"My uncle left, although he and his family had no problems,\" said an opposition leader who asked to remain unidentified. \"Our whole family feels he abandoned us and his country. We are very angry.\"\nAfter October, the conflict and its cost became markedly heavier for both occupiers and their Kuwaiti opponents. The looting by the Iraqis became bolder. Where they had originally confined themesleves to stealing from vacant houses and stores, they were now driving up to occupied dwellings, emptying them of furniture and belongings at gunpoint. Lethal Tactics\nMore and more young men suspected of assisting the underground began to disappear. Their bodies were sometimes left in front of their houses several days later.\nFor its part, the opposition was also better supplied and better organized. It succeeded in setting off car bombs and began to ambush individual Iraqi soldiers.\nBusinessmen who once drove Mercedes-Benzes to work began to build homemade bombs and placed them in bus depots where Iraqi troops gathered. Or they booby-trapped videocassette recorders and television sets that they knew would be taken by Iraqi soldiers.\n\"We learned how to make homemade bombs from Iraqi television,\" Mohammed Jabi, one of those involved, said. \"They broadcast instructions for Iraqis so they could attack the allied forces. These instructions abruptly went off the air after there was an increase in the bombings in Kuwait City.\"\nSome people presumably involved in the opposition said the Iraqis moved quickly to clean up the carnage left by the car bombs and never allowed news of the attacks to be made public. They also ordered swift reprisals against the attackers. Learning to Bribe Soldiers\n\"After each bombing, they would round up a few Kuwaitis, usually men who had nothing to do with the attack, and shoot them,\" said Abdullah Balushi, who said he helped make and plant car bombs.\n\"We were often able to buy our safety with food,\" said Miss Iwayed, the travel-agency administrator.\nOther Kuwaitis told of how they befriended Iraqi soldiers assigned to their neighborhoods, giving them food and other supplies in exchange for their protection from other troops who would ride through the neighborhoods looking for places to ransack.\nBy November, many said, it had become unsafe, especially for young men and women, to go outside even in daylight. Several women told of being molested by Iraqi soldiers.\n\"They used to take women behind the Holiday Inn and rape them there,\" according to a woman who said she had been among the victims.\nSeveral people described living virtually as prisoners in their own houses.\n\"We rarely left,\" one woman said. Others paid tribute to their foreign servants and to some of their Palestinian neighbors for coming to their aid.\n\"I survived because of my Indian servant,\" said Mohammed al-Thuwaini, a wealthy horse breeder, who saw more than 100 of his 500 champion horses shipped to Iraq, and whose opulent mansion and fleet of Rolls-Royces were stolen by the Iraqis.\n\"I never went out, and relied on him to get what I needed,\" he said.\nFood became scarce, and many items like vegetables were available only at high prices and with payment in foreign currencies. Some recalled that they had to trade television sets for beets and turnips.\nIn this regard, the last 10 days before the Iraqi retreat were reportedly the most difficult. Many Kuwaitis saw their stocks of canned food dwindle, and the only water available was what they could gather in buckets. The Bad Becomes Desperate\nIt was then that the Iraqis undertook the systematic destruction of the city, apparently in preparation for withdrawal. Such electricity as there had been stopped. Gasoline stations no longer provided fuel for cars or generators. Piped water, which had been trickling in after the allied bombing began in January, halted altogether.\nFires set by Iraqi soldiers burned out parts of downtown Kuwait City. Public buildings and hotels were blown apart by Iraqi tanks and rocket fire. Looting became almost indiscriminate as Iraqis stripped everything from hospital equipment to baby clothes.\n\"In the end, it was just a free-for-all,\" Mr. Jabi said. \"We stood by and watched these armed Iraqis do whatever they wanted to us. Every night, we would stand on our roofs to see the American planes bomb. We prayed that the American soldiers would come tomorrow and save what was left of our country.\"\nMany, however, mentioned how the period of deprivation forced Kuwaitis to rely less on their wealth and more on each other.\n\"We are a small country,\" Miss Iwayed said. \"We all know each other. If it wasn't our neighbor who needed help, it was our neighbor's uncle.\"\nSome of the foreign workers who stayed in Kuwait after the August invasion noticed the difference in the behavior of the employers.\n\"Maybe some good can come out of this,\" a 29-year-old Philippine secretary said. \"Before the invasion, the Kuwaitis treated those of us who work here like garbage. Many of us enjoyed watching the Kuwaitis humiliated, although we came to hate the Iraqis. The Kuwaitis could no longer treat us badly. Now we hope they will remember what it was like to live under an oppressive ruler.\"\nKuwaitis, too, are summing up their experiences of the last seven months. Mr. Kand, the perfume dealer, says he hopes that pains will be taken to keep what happened to Kuwait clear to all.\n\"We should not destroy all these pictures of Saddam Hussein,\" he said. \"We should put them in a museum, like the Jews did with the pictures of Hitler, and tell our children over and over that they must never forget.\""}, {"text": "Senate Votes $5.8 Billion For Extended Jobless Pay\n1991-08-02T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Senate tonight passed a $5.8 billion program to extend unemployment benefits to people who have been out of work more than half a year.\nAfter a week of delaying actions by Republicans in both houses, passage came swiftly tonight on a voice vote with no opposition heard.\nThe House is expected to adopt the measure Friday, but what President Bush will do when it goes to him is uncertain. All week long his senior aides have been saying they would advise him to veto the bill.\nSince last week Democrats have seized on jobless benefits as an effective political issue, contending that Mr. Bush was ready to declare emergencies to help the Kurds or the Bangladeshis. They made that argument again tonight. \"The Bush Administration has an economic program for every country in the world except this one,\" said Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan. \"Tonight we're stepping up to help the American people.\"\nSenator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that about three million people would be eligible for benefits before the temporary program expires next July. Bush Declaration Needed\nThe bill would declare a \"dire emergency\" under last year's budget act, a declaration necessary to allow adoption of measures that would increase the Federal deficit.\nBut as the Senate bill was drafted, the benefits would only flow if Mr. Bush not only signed the bill but also issued a declaration that an emergency existed.\nTonight Republicans sought to make it clear, as Senator Bob Dole said, that \"no one disputes the pain and hardship of many of the unemployed.\" But he argued that it was unwise to add to the deficit and said it was untimely because the recession was ending. He proposed a smaller program, costing $3.2 billion, and proposed raising the money through various methods.\nAnother measure Mr. Dole obtained as political cover for his party was an agreement that there would be no roll-call votes, so Republicans would not be put in the position of either voting against the Administration or against the unemployed.\nSenator Bentsen concentrated on the domestic argument, saying, \"Today we have an opportunity to help families pay their rent; to help them buy gas for the car so they can get out and look for a job; to help them keep food on the table and kids in school.\" Tapping a Trust Fund\nMr. Bentsen said his bill was spending money that had already been raised by taxes for a trust fund intended to pay for extended benefits. He said the bill was necessary because the standards of existing law made it too hard to qualify for benefits, and $8 billion had piled up in the fund.\nUnder current law, benefits can be extended beyond the regular 26 weeks in a state when joblessness among those covered by unemployment insurance reaches 6 percent in that state, or when the insured jobless level exceeds by one fifth the average levels in that state over the past two years. In only Alaska, Maine and Rhode Island and in Puerto Rico are the long-term unemployed now eligible for extended benefits, which are now paid half from state and half from Federal funds.\nThe bill, whose entire cost would be paid by the Federal Government, would shift the standard from the insured unemployed rate to the total unemployed rate in a state, on the ground that if total unemployment is very high, then it is very hard to find a job, regardless of insured status.\nIn states with 8 percent unemployment, averaged over the last six months, an additional 20 weeks of benefits could be paid. In states where the level was at least 7 percent, 13 weeks could be paid. In states with 6 percent or more, 7 weeks of benefits could be paid. In all other states, four extra weeks of benefits could be paid.\nFinally, military veterans, who now have to wait four weeks to collect any benefits and can then collect them for only 13 weeks, would be eligible like civilians for 26 weeks of regular benefits, after only a one-week wait. A Temporary Measure\nThe bill would be effective from Sept. 1 through next July 4. After that the old standards will apply.\nA key to tonight's agreement, after Democrats in both bodies had denounced the Republicans for delay, was accepting the Senate version of the bill, rather than the similar House measure.\nOne reason was that the Senate bill is temporary, while the House bill was permanent.\nBut even more important was the fact the President could thwart the extended benefits under the Senate bill. Under the House bill, if the bill was passed over his veto, it would go into effect anyway, thus contradicting the principle of the budget act that both the legislative and executive branches had to agree before an emergency could be declared.\nA final reason for the agreement, which contemplates that the House will pass the bill around midday Friday, was that fact that Congress has scheduled a five-week vacation period to begin this weekend. The Democratic leaders of both houses had insisted they would keep Congress in session this weekend to get the bill passed if the Republicans kept delaying.\nReferring to the anxious desire ofmany of his colleagues to leave on vacation, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, observed, \"those jet engines are beginning to whine.\" Fewer Jobless Seeking Benefits\nWASHINGTON, Aug. 1 (Reuters) -- The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell nearly 5 percent in mid-July, the Government said today, signaling possibly brighter job prospects.\nNew applications for unemployment insurance fell to a seasonally adjusted 404,000 in the week ended July 20, a drop of 21,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said.\n\"This is indicating that the job situation is improving somewhat,\" said Jean Sundrla, an economist with Evans Economics Inc. in Washington, a private economic forecaster. \"It's in line with other indicators that say the economy is continuing to improve very slowly.\"\nAmong those indicators was a new report from the National Association of Purchasing Management that showed its index of manufacturing activity in more than 300 companies at 51.8 percent on July 31, its highest since April April 30, 1989, when it reached 52.1 percent.\nAlso, the nation's gross national product, which measures the total output of goods and services, grew at a 0.4 percent annual rate between April and June. Although the gain was slight, it was the first sign of revival after two quarters of contraction.\nThe Labor Department will release its report on national unemployment in July on Friday."}, {"text": "AFTER THE WAR; A Terrible Exodus, in Record Time\n1991-04-22T05:00:00.000Z\nIn terms of numbers, the Iraqi refugee crisis is dwarfed by the Afghans who migrated to Pakistan and Iran in the 1980's. In terms of hunger, the starving millions in Africa certainly have had it worse. In terms of broken bodies, the Cambodians who staggered into Thailand during the 1970's were in more dire physical shape. In terms of death, few groups suffered more than the hundreds of thousands of Armenians who were killed or allowed to die as they were deported from Turkey in 1915.\nBut many disaster relief specialists say the huge exodus of Kurds and other minority groups from northern Iraq qualifies as the most dismal refugee crisis of a fading century that groans under the ordeal of the displaced.\nThe Iraqis, experts say, have not only endured most of the usual horrors experienced by refugees but they have also done so in record time.\n\"The combination is unique,\" said Alfredo Witschi-Cestari, a senior official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. \"What makes this unprecedented is the combination of so many negative factors -- huge numbers, a short time frame, terrible conditions on such an enormous level and having so many of them arriving at the border destitute and exhausted.\" 1.5 Million at Borders\nThe speed of the buildup at the Turkish and Iranian frontiers -- an estimated 1.5 million people in a matter of days -- continues to astound international agencies nearly three weeks after the crisis began. Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said several days ago, \"Never in the 40-year history of the U.N.H.C.R. has a refugee situation developed so rapidly.\"\nThe Iraqis' migration dwarfs that of any other group across international borders in the last several years, a period of intense and diverse movement that may be without parallel since at least World War II.\nIn one celebrated instance two years ago that also happened to affect Turkey, 315,000 Muslims fled Bulgaria to escape a program of forced assimilation imposed by the Communists who then ruled. At the time, the numbers were startling and were said to make up the largest flow of people in Europe since 1945.\nBut that flight into Turkey took place over three months, and eventually tens of thousands of the migrants returned home. Also, nearly all of them were ethnic Turks, which meant that many had relatives in Turkey to help them, along with a Government more inclined to provide assistance for its brethren than it is now with the Kurds. Long Emergency Predicted\nTwo years later, a Bulgarian exodus that had once raised many eyebrows seems paltry in comparison to the new crisis. So, too, for that matter, does the evacuation of more than 800,000 Bangladashis, Pakistanis, Egyptians and others who captured world attention when they ran from Iraq and Kuwait only eight months ago.\n\"We're going to be in a state of emergency for a very long time,\" Mr. Witschi-Cestari, who had helped direct rescue operations during the Persian Gulf crisis, said in a telephone interview.\nThe United Nations and other international agencies have found themselves criticized for reacting too slowly to ease the Iraqis' pain, but officials working in Turkey say they were simply caught off-guard by the sudden human influx -- as was everyone else, they add.\nOriginal United Nations plans for the gulf war were to set up camps in Turkey, Iran, Syria and Jordan, with each country able to feed and shelter 100,000 refugees. When those numbers did not develop, the program was scaled back. Turkey, for example, had its allocation cut from $7 million to $4.4 million, which was to pay for enough food, water, blankets, tents and sanitation equipment for 20,000 people.\nEven then, no more than 10,000 or so refugees strayed into Turkey from Iraq during the war, including army defectors, most of them Kurds, Turkish-speaking Turkomans and Iraqi Christians from the north.\n\"That was before the apocalypse,\" a United Nations official said this week in Turkey. Agencies Told to Spend\nNow, the United Nations is working with a \"planning figure\" of 1.5 million Iraqi refugees for both Turkey and Iran, and the various agencies involved are reportedly being told to spend what they need and to worry later about how to pay for it. Before the start of the United States-led rescue operation in northern Iraq, the overall cost of tending to the Iraqis for three months had been put at about $400 million.\n\"We have put into the pipeline whatever is available from our stocks,\" Mr. Witschi-Cestari said. Priorities are starting to change, he added, with principal needs shifting from basic items like blankets and tents to medical supplies. Other officials have warned about a possibly catastrophic outbreak of measles, especially among children, unless the refugees are inoculated soon.\nSomewhat complicating matters is the fact that there are large numbers of engineers, lawyers, physicians and teachers among the Kurds -- basically city people who are unaccustomed to the harsh vagaries of the mountainous border where they have taken refuge.\n\"Normally, mass movements affect rural people, and they are generally tougher and used to harsh conditions,\" Mr. Witschi-Cestari said. \"Urban people are less used to it, and they also come with many more belongings, and that creates problems as well.\""}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1991-05-09T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational A3-15\nPresident Bush praised the successes of President Gorbachev and said he was inclined to satisfy his request for aid.

Instead, they found squalor and fear of epidemic. In the overwhelmed port of Brindisi, it took the Government days to mobilize the forces to provide food, shelter and showers. The official Italian line was clear, and it was intended to be heard by tens of thousands of other Albanians looking to escape Eastern Europe's last Communist bastion: You are not political refugees, and if you come here you risk indifferent treatment and possible repatriation.\nSimilar barriers are being raised, along with expressions of concern, across Western Europe and elsewhere as the world faces enormous waves of migration that have had no parallel since at least World War II.\nOver the last two or three years, millions have been displaced -- lured by hoped-for jobs in richer lands or evicted by hostile regimes, impelled to flee because of the devastation of war or oppressive rule, or suddenly free to roam thanks to liberating events like Communism's collapse in Eastern Europe. A Flow of Humanity\nTheir movements have been as diverse as humanity itself:\nAbout 310,000 ethnic Turks abandoned Bulgaria in 1989 in the face of forced assimilation imposed by the then-Communist regime. A year earlier, 60,000 Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkey saying they had been attacked with chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein's troops.\nSome 150,000 Soviet Jews moved in 1990 to Israel, a near record number that will continue to grow and that has already triggered alarm in neighboring Arab countries. Soviet Jews aside, more than a million Poles, Yugoslavs, Albanians, ethnic Hungarians and Germans and other Eastern Europeans are estimated to have sought asylum and opportunity in the West last year.\nFrom Honduras, about 50,000 Nicaraguans have moved back home now that the Sandinistas are out of power. Perhaps 2 million Mexicans cross illegally into the United States every year looking for work. Countless tens of thousands of North Africans sailed into southern Europe last year for similar reasons, and more than 70,000 Vietnamese migrants are known to have gone in 1990 to the United States, Canada and Australia. Tens of thousands of Pakistanis and Filipinos entered Japan both legally and otherwise.\nNone of this includes the 850,000 or more Egyptians, Bangladeshis, Indians, Sri Lankans and others who found themselves uprooted with virtually no warning by the Persian Gulf crisis. These were workers in Kuwait and Iraq, whose departure last summer and fall created sudden hardships both for themselves and their native countries.\nFor example, some 450,000 Egyptian workers are believed to have returned home, creating an emergency for more than 1.5 million people, according to officials in Cairo. Estimates of the overall costs -- in terms of lost remittances, forfeited tax revenues, property abandoned in Iraq and Kuwait and spending for those coming home -- run into the billions of dollars. That for a country where the per capita gross national product comes to $550 a year.\nThese new migrations come on top of earlier movements, some going back decades, that have made more or less permanent residents of people like the 1.6 million Turks in Germany, or the Palestinians who make up at least half of Jordan's 3 million people, or the many thousands of Cambodians who have spent more than a decade in refugee camps along the Thai-Cambodian border.\nIt is often tempting to describe these displaced souls as refugees. In fact, few qualify for that designation and the exemptions it often brings from routine demands for entry visas, work permits, invitations and proof of hard currency. Under the 1951 Geneva Convention, a refugee is someone with \"a well-founded fear of being persecuted in his country of origin for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\" Simply running away from hard times back home is not good enough. Nor is escaping from a war or an environmental catastrophe like the burning oilfields of Kuwait. The United Nations counts 16 million as refugees, but millions more are in similar circumstances. No Welcome Mat\nAs a result, many emigres, especially those from the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, find themselves trapped by a form of Catch-22. When they could easily claim they were political refugees from Communism, they could not get out. Now that they can move with relative ease, few can claim to be refugees. As the Albanians discovered in Brindisi, they have fewer recourses when one industrialized country after another says that there is neither room nor jobs for them.\nSoviet Jews insist they still qualify as refugees because of pervasive anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union. But the United States, for one, is not so convinced, and it has set a ceiling of 50,000 Soviet migrants this year. Those limitations partly explain why so many Soviet Jews are turning to Israel, increasing political pressures in the explosive region.\nWith economic imperatives lying behind so much of the worldwide migration, affluent nations have been feeling they must stem the flow to protect their own interests.\nUnited States immigration officials say that each year they apprehend up to a million Mexicans trying to enter the country illegally; they also acknowledge, however, that perhaps twice as many slip through the net. In Japan, never known for taking kindly to strangers, there are periodic sweeps against illegal migrants, usually from southern Asia, and sometimes also against companies that hire them.\nBut the most explosive changes have occurred in the last two years in Europe, where the prosperous West, after having encouraged change in the East for so long, is now scrambling to keep its poor Eastern cousins from flocking its way. Western Europeans are conspicuously worried about the Soviet Union, where a new migration law is being prepared that would codify people's rights to walk out the front door.\nAccording to some estimates, as many as 30 million Soviet citizens are prepared to move. The Soviet delegate to a conference on European migration held in Vienna in January insisted that a more probable figure was 1.5 million to 2 million. In any event, \"the Soviet Union's emigration potential is in theory immense,\" a French social demographer, Jean-Claude Chesnais, warned at a similar conference in Rome this month. \"Political, economic, religious and cultural factors all combine to make an increasing number of people want to leave the country.\"\nThe West's hope is to keep them where they are. One solution is to provide emergency assistance and long-term investment so that staying home will seem more attractive. Another idea is to discourage Eastern Europeans from believing that the West is a land of milk and honey. The International Organization for Migration, a Geneva-based group, advises the West to tell would-be immigrants about true job prospects, especially in countries like Greece, Spain and Italy, where unemployment rates are already high.\nEven before the new influx from the East, the 12 members of the European Community were showing increasing impatience and hostility toward immigrants, especially from the third world. There has been a general tightening of immigration laws, rooted in a concern that any migrant managing to enter any one community country will be free to circulate throughout the other 11.\nRacial incidents occur these days with depressing regularity even in countries like Italy, which has long prided itself on tolerance. Across Europe, North Africans and Turks who account for much of the migration are often regarded as threats to ethnic and cultural unity. Sometimes they are accused of taking jobs from natives, even though in many cases they fill low-paid jobs that the locals no longer will accept.\nDemographers now worry that the new east-to-west migration may eclipse the more traditional movement from south to north by shrinking job opportunities for third-world immigrants. And unemployment pressures in so-called lesser developed countries are not about to disappear as populations soar. One migration expert at the Rome conference, Prof. Reginald T. Appleyard of the University of Western Australia, reported that in 20 years those poor countries alone will have to generate more new jobs than now exist in the entire developed world.\nInevitably, many of those people will be forced to look elsewhere for work. In the face of such needs, specialists caution that simply shutting the West's front door will not be a useful solution."}, {"text": "Harlem's Healers: A Hospital in Distress A special report.; For the Sickest Patients, an Ailing Hospital\n1991-04-07T05:00:00.000Z\nA veteran nurse who spends long hours sorting through the ailing bodies, wounded spirits and disordered lives that seek healing at the Harlem Hospital Center carries a card in her wallet with this message: Do Not Take Me to Harlem Hospital in an Emergency.\nA prominent businessman who proudly calls Harlem \"my hospital\" chose to be treated there a few years ago despite many inconveniences, including a lack of linen. Because of financial difficulties, the hospital had only paper towels and disposable sheets. So the businessman bought linen for himself and other patients on his floor and arranged to have it laundered.\nThe nurse's loss of faith is becoming more common and the businessman's patience rarer these days, as Harlem Hospital struggles to serve one of the nation's most medically deprived areas. That Harlem is in trouble is nothing new, but there is a new sense of urgency. A series of inspections have turned up conditions that could jeopardize the hospital's future. Fearful that the medical center providing many of central Harlem's people with their only access to a doctor could be lost, community leaders, labor officials and many doctors and nurses have begun clamoring for a drastic overhaul.\n\"Harlem is on a respirator,\" said Jim Butler, president of a union local that represents 1,000 hospital workers. \"But Harlem must remain alive.\"\nManaged jointly by New York City and Columbia University, Harlem is one of 11 municipal hospitals in the city, all of them battling fiscal uncertainties, staff shortages and growing demand from an increasingly poor and sick populace. But while it faces many problems common to all hospitals, Harlem is different.\nIt has long commanded a special status among blacks, forged in the years when it was the primary public hospital in the area rapidly becoming the capital of black America, and when black doctors were barred from most of the nation's hospitals, including those operated by New York City. Harlem Hospital became a battleground, and for more than 50 years, until well into the 1960's, it was a national symbol of a people's desire for decent medical care and equal opportunity in the professional ranks. It was -- and is -- considered more than a hospital.\nWith a work force of about 3,500, it is the largest employer in Harlem. Its auditorium is the site of many community events. Its waiting rooms are a refuge for the homeless and a meeting place for the elderly. And, though their presence is sometimes viewed as a mixed blessing, the community's politicians and civic leaders are \"very involved in the life of the hospital, more so than I have experienced in other communities,\" said Dr. J. Emilio Carrillo, president of the city Health and Hospitals Corporation.\nSome of Harlem's doctors are leaders in their fields, and the hospital receives high marks in several areas. It is widely known for its work with babies born addicted to crack or infected with the AIDS virus, its art and safe-playground programs to keep children out of harm's way and the countless miracles its surgeons routinely perform as they bring gunfire and stabbing victims back from the brink. Health Care Like Russian Roulette\nYet many residents of central Harlem have come to think of their hospital as a filthy place where the staff is notoriously rude, the waiting is excruciatingly long, the patients and their visitors are unruly and medical care is like Russian roulette: Even if you are fortunate enough to be treated by one of its best doctors, you might be done in by the haphazard follow-up of hospital aides or the shortage of medicine and working equipment.\nCompounding this are unsubstantiated but persistent rumors of drug dealing on the premises and suspicions that, as was undeniably true at least until the early 1980's, many hospital workers have jobs because of political connections rather than competence.\nProblems include perennial budget shortfalls: Scores of workers have been laid off, and to help close the current gap, doctors and technicians were recently ordered to take nine days off without pay, a move that could cripple services. The hospital also has the worst administrative track record in the city system: there have been 17 executive directors in 24 years, 4 in the last year alone. The institution is now waiting to learn who its new chief executive will be, a decision Dr. Carrillo expects to announce within days.\nLater this year the hospital faces a crucial inspection by an accreditation agency. Harlem is now on probation because of nurses' medication errors, inadequate oversight, poor record-keeping, safety violations and filth in places like the operating and delivery rooms. The inspection could determine whether the hospital will continue to qualify for Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements, its most important sources of revenue.\n\"More than at any other time, I have a feeling of the system collapsing on us,\" said a staff doctor who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nPeople knowledgeable about Harlem Hospital are usually in one of two camps: the one for whom loyalty demands that they keep silent about its shortcomings and the one for whom loyalty demands that they speak up.\nInto the latter falls Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat whose district includes most of Harlem and who closely monitors the hospital and often criticizes it.\n\"It should not be the politicians demonstrating and scaring the heck out of the patients who are held hostage in the hospital and who have nowhere else to go,\" Mr. Rangel said. \"It should be the professionals who say, 'I cannot perform under these conditions.' \" 'A Cesspool'\nMarshall England, a health-care advocate who has served on the hospital's community advisory board for more than 20 years, is another frequent critic.\n\"The reason I'm so critical of Harlem Hospital is that the hospital that I use and the hospital that the people that I represent use must be the best,\" Mr. England said. \"And if not the best, then I have to continue to challenge it to try to be that way.\"\nAt nearby Abyssinian Baptist Church, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d has become so exasperated that he denounces the hospital as \"a cesspool,\" and advocates an unlikely solution: takeover by the Federal Government.\n\"It needs to come in and say, 'This is a medical disaster. We are declaring martial law on Harlem Hospital,' \" he said. \"Unless the Federal Government does, it will remain a cesspool and we just can't have that.\" The Patients Perhaps Sickest In the Nation\nWhile central Harlem boasts fading memories and fragile landmarks that bear witness to its place as a black cultural capital, it is also a slum. Many of its 100,000 residents are poorly educated and more than a third live below the poverty line.\nMany of them are dying at alarming rates from treatable conditions: cancer, heart disease, alcoholism, pneumonia and diabetes. According to city health records, they are dying from AIDS at 20 times the national rate, from homicide at 7 times the national rate. A study by two Harlem Hospital doctors revealed that the life expectancy for black men in central Harlem was less than that of men in Bangladesh. Infant mortality, too, is among the highest in the nation.\n\"These are the sickest people in New York,\" said Dr. Harold P. Freeman, the hospital's director of surgery and co-author of the study. \"They may be among the sickest people in the nation.\"\nIn this part of Harlem there are only four private doctors with broad general practices, according to a study by the Community Service Society, a nonprofit agency. These are doctors under age 65 who have regular office hours and are accessible after hours, who have admitting privileges at area hospitals and who accept Medicaid or Medicare.\nHarlem Hospital operates clinics, but many require appointments. So more often than not, residents, like poor people all over New York, turn to the emergency room for everything from colds to cancer. There were more than 83,000 visits to Harlem's emergency room in the last fiscal year.\n\"The emergency room is the gateway to this hospital,\" said Dr. Reynold L. Trowers, Harlem's director of emergency medicine. Three-fourths of the nearly 21,000 patients admitted to the hospital in the last fiscal year started out in the emergency room.\n\"They have a tendency to wait until it's really kind of critical before they come,\" an emergency room nurse who identified herself only as A. Chambers said the other day.\nDoctors say that many patients give false addresses and phone numbers and that most never go to the clinics for follow-up visits. So the doctors and the nurses wait for them to return, inevitably, to the emergency room. Coughing Blood for a Week and a Half\nOn a recent day, Miss Chambers saw Howard Reid, a maintenance worker with a badly burned left hand, which had become infected. He had burned it three days before while working in the boiler room of an apartment building. Why had he waited?\n\"I had other things to do,\" he said. He explained that he was covering for his brother, who was away on vacation. \"I had to be there in case of any emergency.\"\nLater, a 32-year-old woman came in, clutching her abdomen and moving unsteadily. She said she had been coughing up blood for a week and a half. Miss Chambers questioned her closely after noticing that behind sunglasses, the woman's left eye was badly bruised. She had been beaten up two weeks before, she told Miss Chambers. Why hadn't she come in earlier? \"Well, I thought it would go away,\" she replied with a shrug. \"It was worse than this.\"\nWhen they do come to emergency, they know it is likely to be an all-day affair. They grumble about waiting. They complain about the attitudes of the nurses, about the musty smell of the waiting room and the filthy restrooms, about the homeless men who, often at night, smoke and drink and befoul the air. But they often say it is better than hospitals like North General in East Harlem.\nBy the end of the day nerves are frayed and tempers are short. But Miss Chambers, who has worked at Harlem for 31 years, the last two in emergency, remains calm.\n\"I realize the type of patient that we have,\" she said. \"They can't go to other hospitals. They won't get the kind of time we give them, or the care.\" Then she added, \"Sometimes it gets depressing.\" The Hospital Same Problems Again and Again\nNo matter who orders the inspection -- the City Comptroller, the State Health Department or the industry's accrediting agency -- certain conditions always turn up at Harlem Hospital: a severe shortage of nurses, which jeopardizes patient care; poor housekeeping; incomplete patient records, and safety violations.\nLast spring, Federal officials threatened to cut off Medicare financing after the state's inspection turned up those problems. City officials reacted quickly, sending in administrators and even maintenance workers from other hospitals to help Harlem prepare for a follow-up inspection.\n\"They did everything they had to do and got everything up to snuff,\" said Enid B. McCoy, the local director of the state's hospital surveillance program, which conducted the inspection. \"The thing is that after that, all of these people went back to the other institutions to work, leaving Harlem in the same situation it was in: no staff and the same limited resources. And so they declined again.\"\nThat has been the saga of Harlem Hospital for decades, though Dr. Carrillo insists that it is changing. When the inspectors from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, a national organization, came last fall, they found all the usual problems, though they did point out that some areas were showing slight improvements since Dr. Carrillo sent in the clean-up team from other hospitals earlier in the year. Clean-Up Deadline: This Fall\nStill, in January, the commission gave the hospital only provisional accreditation, which means that it must correct all deficiencies by the fall or it could lose its Medicaid and Medicare revenue.\n\"The bottom line,\" said Bernard Rose, the acting executive director since December, \"is we've got to get through this joint commission survey and that's the most important thing that the hospital faces right now.\"\nRepresentative Rangel is among those who lay much of the blame for Harlem's problems at the feet of Columbia University, whose College of Physicians and Surgeons is receiving more than $45 million from the city this year to provide doctors and medical technicians to the hospital. The city, which is responsible for providing nurses, administrative support, building maintenance, equipment and supplies, usually fails to provide all that it is supposed to, but the medical team is required to monitor the quality of services. This \"quality assurance\" was one of the things found lacking in inspections last year.\n\"Whenever I hear of life being endangered or health care being substandard, or filth and dirt and inadequate staff, hell, of course I go to the Health and Hospitals Corporation,\" Mr. Rangel said. \"But they haven't taken any special oath like the doctors. Really, they don't have as much to lose as our big brother Columbia.\nThere is a common refrain: Columbia is not as vigilant in monitoring health care at Harlem, a municipal hospital, as it is at Presbyterian, a private one with which it has been affiliated since 1911.\n\"There has always been the perception that the favorite affiliation of the college on the hill is Presbyterian, and its bastard child is Harlem,\" Mr. England said.\nColumbia officials deny this, though William A. Polf, a deputy vice president, says he understands the criticism. \"They know that the situation has so much need and so many problems, and they say, 'Who could be doing more?' And they look at who they see out there, and we are an obvious target to be told we could be doing more.\"\nDr. Henrik H. Bendixen, a senior associate vice president and former dean of the medical school, said Columbia has done \"remarkably well\" in recruiting doctors for Harlem, but has \"no influence\" over recruiting nurses, repairing elevators, cleaning floors or purchasing supplies. 'It Is an Embarrassment'\nBut critics of Columbia, including some Harlem staff doctors and nurses, say the university could do more. For them Exhibit A is two departments that have been allowed to drift for years: anesthesiology and pathology. The anesthesiology department has been without a director since 1984; the doctor who has headed the pathology department for years is not a pathologist.\n\"To me personally it is an embarrassment,\" Dr. Bendixen said of the situation in anesthesiology. \"But it is very difficult to recruit into a situation where the income is below what the field is offering and where the equipment and facilities cannot compete with what you find in other hospitals.\"\nAs for the doctor in charge of pathology, Dr. Bendixen said: \"The fact that he is not board certified is a paper technicality. It does not translate into the function of the service being poor.\" The doctor, Jack Hagstrom, retires soon, he said.\nParceling blame is not one-sided: Harlem doctors find plenty to score against the city, starting with the revolving door to the executive director's office. The last executive director, Joseph B. Mann, abruptly resigned in December after six months on the job.\n\"I blame downtown,\" said Dr. Barbara A. Barlow, a pediatric surgeon who also heads the hospital's injury-prevention program for children. \"I cannot believe that they cannot find a competent director for this hospital who can come here and stay here.\"\nDr. James L. Curtis, who heads the psychiatry department, knows that when the new fiscal year starts in July there is usually a flurry of new hiring and purchasing. \"And then everything dries up. And you begin to get delays: People lose your papers, they pretend that somebody didn't do something and you have to do the papers over. We have that kind of monkey business going on.\"\nBut the 30-year-old relationship between Columbia and the hospital has begun to improve, hospital and university officials say. Fiscal constraints have forced the two to become more efficient and streamline their staffs. For example, instead of each having its own administrator for the laboratories, there will now be one. That process will be replicated in other departments, said Mr. Rose, the acting executive director.\nHospital officials say that because of budget problems, what has been unthinkable may have to happen: eliminating some services. They also talk about reclassifying jobs and insisting on greater productivity. Because of overspecialization and laziness, workers are often idle while many tasks go undone, several hospital officials said. 'It's a Challenge'\nThere needs to be \"a lot of decisions that nobody is going to like, especially the unions,\" said Charles Windsor, who held the executive director's job longer than anyone, but left last year to take over St. Mary's Hospital in East St. Louis, Ill.\nMr. Butler, the leader of Local 420 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said, \"There's no more juice you can get out of the workers. They are completely burned out.\"\nDespite these problems, 97 people applied for the executive director's job, Dr. Carrillo said. Mr. Rose, a 34-year-old former deputy executive director at another problem-plagued city hospital, Kings County, is one of three finalists.\n\"It's a challenge,\" he said, explaining why he wants the job. \"And let's face it: if you can do a job here at Harlem or Kings County and do it well and be able to make a difference, I think your career is made.\"\nSenior doctors and nurses are not waiting for the turnaround: they have a hospital to run. Dr. Freeman recently began a new cancer-prevention program. Dr. Curtis is making plans for a new drug-treatment wing that is to open in the summer. Betty J. McNeill, the director of nurses, is crisscrossing the country in search of nurses while preparing for up to 100 from Africa and the Phillipines by July. Dr. Barlow and her staff are getting ready for another season of repairing playgrounds and teaching safety tips to Harlem's youngsters. And Dr. Margaret C. Heagarty, head of pediatrics, is trying to convince young doctors that they should come to Harlem because it is not \"a sinking ship.\"\nThey and other fans of Harlem Hospital are worried, but they are adamant that it will succeed. Dr. Heagarty, who relishes a good fight, is prepared to take on anyone who would think of shutting down the hospital -- something that is periodically threatened.\n\"Over my dead body,\" she said. \"They're going to close this hospital over my dead body. Look around you. Does my staff look like they're defeated?\""}, {"text": "In a Warming World, Who Comes Out Ahead?\n1991-02-05T05:00:00.000Z\nIN a finding fraught with sensitive political implications, some scientists say that if global warming takes its expected course, some parts of the world could come out winners, even while many others reap disaster.\nA few regions, mainly in colder climes, may well benefit, according to computer models of climate change. The computer models merely simulate global climate change and are still being refined. They are therefore a rough guide to what may happen to various regions as the world warms, not an exact forecast.\nFor many other regions, including North America, the computer models predict both pluses and minuses whose overall balance cannot yet be assessed. But for developing countries, scientists say, the general picture is negative: most are more vulnerable to climate change and less able to adapt to it than are the industrialized nations of the cooler latitudes.\nThe question of whether some countries might gain from global warming has been bubbling just beneath the surface of discussions about climate change.\nSome politicians and environmentalists have been reluctant to confront the issue for fear it might disrupt efforts to forge an international agreement to head off global warming from gases being produced by human activity. Others, including some scientists, assert that while there might be some temporary winners, there will be none over the long run, especially if global warming is severe and if it occurs as rapidly as scientists predict. Not least, they say, the natural ecosystems that undergird human life everywhere would not be able to adjust fast enough to escape catastrophe.\nThe winners-losers issue is becoming more prominent just as delegates met yesterday at Chantilly, Va., outside Washington, in the first of several sessions to negotiate a treaty limiting the emission of \"greenhouse\" gases, which trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere. Scientists predict that these gases will heat the earth's surface by an 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century unless checked.\nSome experts note that if any countries gain from global warming, they will probably be the ones that now emit most greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons. Threat to Island Nations\n\"In the long run, there are good reasons to believe that those who are responsible are the winners,\" said Dr. Klaus Meyer-Abich, a physicist and philosopher at Germany's Science Center of Rhine-Westphalia and at the University of Essen. He has served as an expert adviser on climate change to the German parliament and has extensively studied the question of climatic winners and losers.\nWhether industrialized countries enjoy absolute gains or not, they stand to increase their already huge overall economic advantage over the third world.\nCountries that see themselves as undoubted losers include small island nations that fear a major rise in sea level and more frequent and severe tropical storms, both of which are expected to result from global warming. These nations have formed the Alliance of Small Island States to press their case for stringent controls on greenhouse gas emissions.\nThey are preparing to demand that the industrialized countries cut their own emissions and also help the island nations adapt to climate change, said Naresh Singh of Castries, St. Lucia, the executive director of the Caribbean Environmental Health Institute, an umbrella organization for 16 English-speaking Caribbean countries. Mr. Singh is a delegate to the Chantilly meeting.\nIf the level of the oceans rises by more than two feet by the year 2100, as climate experts predict, low-lying nations like the Maldives and some Pacific islands could be inundated. Other places at high risk include Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, coastal China, Louisiana and the southern coast of the North Sea, according to a recent assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body set up by the United Nations to advise the treaty negotiators and their governments.\nIn general, populations most vulnerable to global warming \"are in developing countries, in the lower income groups, residents of coastal lowlands and islands, populations in semi-arid grasslands and the urban poor in squatter settlements, slums and shantytowns, especially in megacities,\" says a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nPeople living in third-world slums are judged more vulnerable because their existence, already precarious, could be made even more so by disrupted food supplies.\nDeveloping countries are more vulnerable because they are more dependent on agriculture, forests and other natural resources for economic health, said Dr. Dennis Tirpak, director of the Environmental Protection Agency's global climate change division, a member of the American negotiating team at Chantilly.\nAgriculture in much of the third world is especially susceptible to drought. Global warming is expected to intensify drought in wide areas, and also to cause severe damage to forests and grasslands. On top of this, many third world populations already live on the margins of subsistence, and lack the resources to cope with climatic disruption.\nApart from these broad outlines, the effects of warming appear mixed and quite complicated.\n\"In some places the climate will get better and in some it will get worse,\" said Dr. Michael H. Glantz of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. But beyond that, he said, much remains unknown. Dr. Glantz, a social scientist, heads a group that studies the impact of climate change on societies and has been trying to encourage discussion and inquiry on winners and losers for some time. Last year he organized an international conference in Malta on assessing winners and losers.\nThe conference concluded, \"There will be advantaged and disadvantaged countries, regions within countries, sectors and populations.\"\n\"The identity of those advantaged and disadvantaged will change over time,\" it said. \"There are serious obstacles to their identification.\"\nDr. Tirpak explained: \"It's not a case where you can simply pick a date and have one set of countries that will win forevermore and another that will lose. It is not a very easy thing to characterize.\"\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, nevertheless, has tentatively identified potential gainers and losers. The identification is based on results of mathematical simulations of how the earth's climate would behave under global warming, and is therefore uncertain.\n\"We should not take these studies literally, as a prognosis that every detail will just come as it is written now,\" Dr. Meyer-Abich said. But he said the general pattern \"will not be changed very much\" as more is learned. Effects on Agriculture\nThe relative advantages and disadvantages are perhaps most tellingly reflected in the effects of warming on agriculture. This will occur in forms like shifting rainfall patterns, drier soil, increased evaporation of surface water, increased loss of water by crops and reduced snowpacks in the mountains, resulting in lessened runoff in the spring.\nBut warming would also bring more rainfall to some areas and more warmth and longer growing seasons to regions that are now too cool for maximum agricultural production.\nThe following examples of possible gains and losses are not all-inclusive, but suggest the variety and range of changes expected:\nNorthern Europe would become a winner, according to the intergovernmental panel's analysis. Northern Scandinavia \"stands to gain more from global warming than perhaps any other region of the world\" because it would become warmer and wetter, the panel's report said. The grasslands that feed Iceland's sheep would become more than twice as productive as they are now.\nYields of grass and potatoes would increase in much of Ireland, Britain, the Low Countries and Denmark. A temperature increase of more than 2 degrees would improve the agricultural potential of much of the European part of the Soviet Union. But substantial decreases in productivity could occur in Southern Europe. A warming of 2 to 7 degrees would enable cultivated areas to creep 500 feet to 2,000 feet closer to the summit of the Alps. Northern Japan, including Hokkaido and the northern part of Honshu, would enjoy increased yields of rice, corn and soybeans.\nBy contrast, drier soils would disrupt food production in regions like Northwest and West Africa, the horn of Africa, southern Africa, western Saudi Arabia, Southeast Asia, Mexico, Central America and parts of eastern Brazil. Prospects for North America\nFor North America, the overall climate picture is mixed. Large parts of the northern United States and Canada would enjoy a pleasanter climate and attract more inhabitants, Dr. Meyer-Abich wrote in a recent review. In Europe, too, he said, these \"privileged regions\" would be extended farther to the north.\nAgricultural production in the United States would also shift northward, according to a study by the Environmental Protection Agency, with Minnesota, Wisconsin and northern Michigan being gainers. But 10 to 50 percent of all agricultural acreage in the South might have to be abandoned. Production would probably decrease in the Corn Belt. Drier soil would cut yields of spring wheat in Canada, although there would be a small increase near the northern limit of current production. Yields of corn, barley, soybeans and hay would decline in all of Canada but northern Ontario.\nA rise in sea level could inundate coastal wetlands, damaging or destroying spawning grounds that sustain commercial fisheries. Beachfront communities would have to invest billions of dollars in coastal protection, and some settled areas on the coast would probably be inundated.\nNorthern cities would be spared considerable expense in heating costs, snow removal and road maintenance. But air-conditioning bills would soar in the South and ski resorts could be in deep trouble.\nIn one sense, national borders are the wrong framework in which to consider global climate change.\n\"Looking at it on the nation-state level may not be appropriate,\" said Dan McGraw, a professor of international environmental law at the University of Colorado. \"If significant climate change occurs, it's going to be a lot of individuals in the world who are disadvantaged. At one level, it doesn't matter so much which country they're in.\"\nBut when it comes to negotiating the treaties to moderate climate change, it is nations that do the negotiating. On that level, Mr. McGraw said, he has detected a reluctance to discuss winners and losers.\n\"Some folks feel that any discussion of the question will tend to polarize the possible participants in any sort of international solution,\" he said. The fear, he said, may be that \"as countries start focusing on whether they are likely to be a winner or loser, that will influence whether they cooperate.\"\nTemporary advantage aside, all nations are interdependent in the long run, note observers like William Nitze, a former State Department official who coordinated Government policy on global warming until last September. If the third world suffers, the industrialized countries suffer as well, he said, noting: \"Developing countries are a tremendous market for us. We have a large stake in their long-term future prosperity.\"\nSenator Al Gore, a Tennessee Democrat who favors strong action to combat global warming, contends that talk of winners and losers \"is just another cop-out that people use for not dealing with this threat.\"\nHe cited the prospect of waves of \"environmental refugees,\" fleeing ravaged third world economies or low-lying areas and causing \"enormous destabilizing pressures\" for industrialized countries. Worldwide Refugee Problem\nThe number of refugees could amount to 100 million, said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist and expert on global warming at the Environmental Defense Fund, a research and advocacy group. The pressure they may bring on the rest of the world \"is enough in itself to make people who think they're going to be winners take notice and reassess,\" he said.\nHe concedes that if the world warms by only a degree or two over the next century, then \"without question, some people could be labeled winners.\" But with an eight degree warming, the upper limit predicted by some computer simulations, \"the world would be so different at those higher levels that it is very difficult to argue that any significant number of people will find it beneficial,\" he said. \"There will be radical change, in other words.\"\nScientists predict that the rate of climatic change would be faster than at any other time in the last 10,000 years. \"If it happened infinitely slowly,\" Dr. Oppenheimer said, \"society could adjust. In a fast-changing world, there are no winners.\""}, {"text": "The Military Vs. The Press\n1991-03-03T05:00:00.000Z\nLIEUT. GEN. PRINCE KHALID BIN SULTAN, commander of the Joint Arab Forces, glanced around at the reporters and television cameras crowding in on him and beamed. The setting was perfect, and the general had good news.\nThe full moon illuminated the wreckage in the street -- the spent cartridge cases, the masonry rubble, the congealed pools of aluminum from the melted hulls of still-burning Iraqi armored vehicles. Behind the general, a large-scale map of Khafji was propped against the shattered bow of an Iraqi BTR-60 personnel carrier, and to one side lay the body of one of its crew, his head twisted grotesquely under his shoulder. In the background the blazing trails of Iraqi artillery missiles streaked through the clear night sky, and the jarring rumble of carpet bombing signaled the presence of B-52's.\n\"As you can see, gentlemen,\" the general said, \"we have retaken Khafji at heavy cost to the enemy, and with very few casualties of our own. A few snipers remain, but we shall mop them up in the morning.\"\nIgnoring the usual battlefield injunction against bright lights, the cameramen switched on their dazzling lamps. General Khalid blinked in the glare but smiled and began answering questions shouted at him in English and Arabic by a score of reporters who had arrived in an ancient school bus.\nCompared with fights I had witnessed in other wars, Khafji was no more than a minor skirmish. It was obvious that an Iraqi battalion had blundered badly, sending thinly armored personnel carriers across the Kuwaiti-Saudi border into a meat grinder, where Saudi and American missiles had all but demolished the invaders. But to the few reporters who reached the town before the blood dried, Khafji was the high point of a war that up to then had been mostly covered in briefing rooms or from aircraft and ships safely distant from Iraqi fire. It had been a video war -- at that point, Americans had not yet seen the horrible images of headless bodies, some of them women and children, being extricated from the bomb-blasted ruins of a building the United States described as a military command center and Baghdad called a civilian bomb shelter. Even in Khafji, this war seemed to smell more of greasepaint than of death.\nFor most of the news people most of the time, the gulf war has been played out in the Dhahran International Hotel, across a six-lane highway from the Dhahran International Airport -- a hotel whose turquoise-domed swimming-pool changing rooms are familiar to Americans as the backdrop for countless television network \"stand up\" reports from Saudi Arabia.\nAt one end of the third-floor ballroom of the hotel during this first month of the war, Saudi officials in white robes and off-duty Americans in camouflage uniforms sprawl indolently over sofas facing an array of television monitors, where it seems the war never ends: cruise missiles whiz down Baghdad streets, howitzers and tank guns boom, military briefers sum up from Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and commentators explain what it all means. Many of the people on the sofas doze as CNN's war drones on.\nAt the other end of the ballroom a swarm of hopeful newsmen and newswomen crowd the plush theater-lobby rope barring them from the J.I.B. -- the United States Armed Forces Joint Information Bureau. They all want access to the war, but that is a privilege bestowed on fewer than one in seven of the thousand-odd correspondents, photographers, producers and technicians who have come to the gulf seeking action -- a mob far larger than the Saigon press corps, which rarely surpassed 700 at the height of the Vietnam War.\nFor most of those who are turned away by the J.I.B., there has been little chance of seeing the war firsthand, apart from watching Patriot missiles intercept Iraqi Scuds high overhead. But day after tedious day, the accredited correspondents not assigned to combat pools -- some of them famous editors and writers on special missions -- swallow their dignity, return to the J.I.B. and plead.\nThe only war I have covered where access to the front was as limited as it has been in Saudi Arabia was the 1971 war between Pakistan and India. During that conflict, Pakistani troops barred all roads and paths leading to the front and imposed a censorship amounting to total blackout. (Correspondents filed copy by driving over the Khyber Pass to a cablehead in Afghanistan several times a week.)\nThe war-coverage system in the Persian Gulf, worked out by the Pentagon and representatives of major American news organizations last summer, has antecedents that date from the brief Grenada war of 1983, which reporters were barred from covering. Their employers objected so strongly that the Pentagon convened a commission headed by Maj. Gen. Winant Sidle, retired chief of Army information, and made up mainly of military and Government public-affairs officials. It recommended that future wars be covered by pools of news representatives -- selected, controlled and censored by the military.\n\"Media representatives appearing before the panel,\" the commission's report said, \"were unanimous in being opposed to pools in general. However, they all also agreed that they would cooperate in pooling agreements if that were necessary for them to obtain early access to an operation.\"\nTHE POOL SYSTEM OPERATING IN SAUDI ARABIA grants berths only to nominees from the wire services, a couple of magazines, a few newspapers, the television networks and some radio groups. The idea is that the \"product\" (as the J.I.B. calls all forms of news) of any pool member -- dispatch, photograph, tape or sonnet -- becomes the property of all the accredited organizations covering the war.\nIn effect, each pool member is an unpaid employee of the Department of Defense, on whose behalf he or she prepares the news of the war for the outer world.\nNonetheless, the few who gain places in the pools -- groups of 7 to 18 --count themselves lucky. As their price for seeing the war, they are taken under the wings of escort officers for \"deployment\" to ground, air or naval units, or to catchall \"rapid reaction\" pools. In theory, the larger pools are to join field units for periods of two weeks, while the \"rapid reaction\" groups will be whisked from place to place, lapping up the cream of the breaking news.\nSeveral days before the outbreak of war, I join the mob of supplicants filling out forms, and draw an assignment to a rapid-reaction pool.\nThe questionnaires demand my blood type, my religion (important to the Saudis), my next of kin. I sign my agreement to two pages of \"guidelines\" and \"ground rules,\" which enjoin me from revealing military secrets and bind me to submit to a \"security review\" (censorship) of everything I report, among other conditions. The guidelines assure the correspondent that \"material will be examined solely for its conformance to the attached ground rules, not for its potential to express criticism or cause embarrassment\" -- a stipulation I will soon have grounds to doubt.\nI am photographed, fingerprinted and handed a Saudi press badge, a Geneva Convention card identifying me as a noncombatant accompanying United States forces and a steel dog tag embossed with the kind of information (including religion and blood type) useful to medics and graves-registration teams.\nI meet Col. Bill Mulvey, the J.I.B.'s boss -- a West Point man wearing a combat infantry badge earned in Vietnam, an officer whose cheerful, frank demeanor contrasts strikingly with the suspicious glances and evasions of some of his predecessors in other wars I have covered. The colonel, clearly no press baiter but the administrator of a system hateful to most reporters, has an unenviable job.\nIt is soon evident that the United States military means to take care of me as I have never been taken care of in previous wars. I am issued a field jacket and a liner, field pants, a sleeping bag, a web belt, a canteen with a chemical-warfare cap through which a straw can be inserted, a sturdy field pack, surgical dressings, a gas mask with three injectors of atropine antidote for nerve gas (and three shots of Valium, in case the atropine sends my heart into fibrillation), a poison-gas-proof suit with boots, sand goggles and a helmet.\nThe ritual of being fitted for all this gear stirs the blood with the heady prospect of battle; it would be some weeks before Baghdad would stir a flurry of hope for ending the war by capitulation, and as far as the reporters were concerned, the war was just beginning. Recidivist war correspondents have difficulty explaining the thrill of anticipation of combat to healthier minds. We scarcely understand the feeling ourselves, or why it is that we are so powerfully drawn to combat, even against the revulsion most of us feel for the sights, sounds and smells of death.\nI SOON FIND MYSELF IN A BUS WITH THE OTHER members of my pool on the way to the front, which turns out to be an auditorium about 10 minutes away. After a short wait, an \"Air Force operational commander\" (identity withheld under the ground rules) introduces himself and prefaces his briefing with the following remarks:\n\"I'm not a great fan of the press, and I want you to know where we stand with each other. I suppose the press has its purpose. But one thing is certain: you can't do me any good, and you sure as hell can do me harm.\"\nBut then, despite this unpromising overture, the officer goes on to present one of the most lucid and informative briefings on fighter tactics I have ever heard -- an account that, not incidentally, rings with pride for the expertise of the Air Force's F-15 pilots. The thought crosses my mind that the commander's unfriendly opening was intended to establish his bona fides as a bluff but honest leader of men, rather than as a Pentagon publicity seeker.\nOn the other hand, he may really have meant to needle us, protected as he was by anonymity. I cannot entirely dismiss from my mind the anti-press cant that has pervaded American military journals and pronouncements ever since the Vietnam War. Typical of the genre was a widely read article published last September in the semiofficial magazine Army, written by Maj. Gen. Patrick H. Brady, former chief of Army public affairs and now deputy commanding general of the Sixth Army. He wrote:\n\"Some look on news as just another four-letter word, but I believe it is more useful to look at it as a C-letter word: chaos, confusion, contradiction, crime, corruption, color, catastrophe. It does not hurt if you add some S's -- sex, sensationalism, state secrets.\n\"The words of a reporter for a national news syndicate best sum it up. He came to us for some information we provided with the comment that we were always happy to get it right. He replied rather hurriedly, 'I don't care if I get it right; I only care if I get it first.' \"\nGeneral Brady is not alone in his insistence that military correspondents must be kept under strict control. In many recent public statements and articles, influential military officers have implied a causal relationship between two facts: that reporters were barred from on-the-ground coverage of the Grenada war in October 1983, and that Grenada has been America's only unequivocal military victory since World War II.\nIt needs to be said that news people also have staunch friends and defenders in the military community -- men and women who recognize that combat correspondents are for the most part honest men and women dedicated to keeping a free people sufficiently informed to make intelligent decisions. They know, also, that most of us like and admire our servicemen and servicewomen, and that within the professional limits of our calling, we often try to help them. Older servicemen recall that the late Charley Mohr of The New York Times was awarded a Bronze Star for pulling a wounded American soldier to safety while under Vietcong fire.\nBut there are also those who regard us as enemies; some even seek to pillory CNN's Peter Arnett for continuing to report useful (albeit censored) information from Baghdad through the teeth of the enemy. Peter was my friend and colleague for six years in Vietnam, where we both worked for The Associated Press, and I know no more honest newsman. When I hear critics sharpening their claws on him, feelings are rekindled in me that I thought had long been laid to rest -- feelings of contempt for the real betrayers of American ideals during the Vietnam years.\nIT IS DAWN ON JAN. 17, and the war has begun. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf tells the men and women under his command that they are members of \"the most powerful force our country, in coalition with our allies, has ever assembled in a single theater to face an aggressor.\" Radio Bahrain tells its listeners in Saudi Arabia that broadcast air-raid warnings will be preceded by the playing of a few bars of de Falla's \"El Amor Brujo,\" which mimic the pounding heels in a flamenco dance, and are loud, staccato and arresting. CNN's Baghdad bureau begins airing the first reports of the bombing of the Iraqi capital.\nI am in the bowels of a C-130 Hercules transport plane, my 30-pound pack and helmet lashed to the floor, along with my typewriter -- an implement I am forced to carry for the sake of the field censors, who insist on reading paper rather than laptop-computer displays. Behind our pool's field gear is stacked a heavy cargo of cardboard cartons containing Composition-C plastic explosive. The loadmaster announces that smoking will not be permitted during the flight.\nThe C-130 has no windows, and it is far too noisy for conversation, so one daydreams on the way to war.\nIn my mind's eye it is 30 years ago, almost to the month, and I am aboard one of three Vietnamese Government landing craft on a branch of the Mekong River south of Ben Tre. It is still an hour before dawn, and the sluggish river is shrouded with a fine mist, obscuring all but the pinpoints of light marking the anchorages of sampans and houseboats. I am in the grip of that excited anticipation that always precedes the first shots of battle.\nIt had been surprisingly easy to get here -- a conversation with a helpful Ministry of Information official, a car trip from Saigon to the lush palm groves and rice paddies of Kien Hoa province, and a chat over tea with the French-educated province chief. Years would pass before uniformed Americans arrived in Vietnam in sufficient numbers to think of organizing the foreign press corps, which in 1961 numbered fewer than a dozen.\nOfficials in Saigon had not known what sort of equipment I should take to my first Vietnamese combat operation, but at the Saigon flea market I had bought a tattered legionnaire's pack, a ground cloth and a pair of rubber-soled shoes.\nAbruptly, our speeding landing craft hit something, and screams came from the black water below us. By the light of a gasoline lantern we could see the shattered remains of a sampan, and two adults and three small children flailing to stay afloat. We churned onward, scarcely slowing down.\nIt was daybreak when we reached the hamlet that was to be our target, and we approached quietly at quarter speed. Then, as our boats crunched into the river bank, we heard a woman's cry of alarm -- a cry that our troops took as a signal to open fire.\nAs our Civil Guard company raked the hamlet with machine-gun fire, a man in black farmer's garb stood up and ran away from us across a rice field, but he took only a few steps before the hail of bullets cut him down.\nFive minutes later, having encountered no resistance, the Civil Guards ceased fire and began searching the hamlet. In one hut they found some paper Vietcong flags. As I followed them I stepped into a ditch where a bamboo- spike booby trap had been planted; I recoiled in intense pain, and thus learned the disadvantage of shoes with thin rubber soles.\nIn a field behind the hamlet, two soldiers found the man our assault force had shot, and the man, unarmed, was still alive, bloody foam pouring from his mouth. I protested in horror as the soldiers wedged a rifle stock next to the man's throat and pressed down, trying to throttle him. Whether they did so for revenge or as an act of mercy, I never learned. But the image of that atrocity (which I photographed and sent back to The Associated Press, which distributed it for publication to member newspapers around the world) has never faded from my memory.\nI can't say whether that first taste of Indochina combat colored my view of the Vietnam War in general, but it certainly made me aware that there is more to war than what one may learn from official briefings. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A greater contrast between my first operation in Vietnam and my first pool \"mission\" in Saudi Arabia -- an operation I watch from the comfort of an overstuffed chair with a thermos of fresh coffee at hand.\nIt is late at night, and we members of the pool find ourselves in a bomb-proof hangar housing the operations center for a wing of radar-evading F-117A Stealth aircraft. The square-jawed commander of the unit, who flies frequent missions over Iraq himself, could have been the model for the old comic-strip pilot-hero, Smilin' Jack.\nAs the cockroach-shaped F-117A's land and taxi into their shelters, the pilots tell us of a hard night's work, with spectacular bombing results in spite of heavy antiaircraft fire. In the comfort of the commander's office, we look at videotapes of the bombing, recorded automatically when the pilots aimed laser designators at targets to guide their 2,000-pound bombs.\nIn ghostly, slow-moving, black-and-white video images, we see a cross-hair aiming device centered on a large building the unit commander tells us is a telecommunications center in Baghdad. After a few seconds, white jets spurt from the building, and it disappears in a silent puff of video pyrotechnics. We look at another videotape, in which the cross hairs are fixed on the skylight of a building described only as \"a high-value target,\" and this, too, flies apart in jets of debris. A half-dozen more videotaped attacks tell the same story. This, manifestly, is the first war in history in which bombing is conducted with almost unerring accuracy.\nThe pilots are jubilant, the tape confirms all their claims, and it only remains for us news people to report what we have seen and heard, including the results of our close-up examination of the F-117A itself -- an aircraft about which little was known until a few months ago. Ours is a positive story, likely to be as reassuring to American readers and viewers as it is informative: the first shots of the war have been \"surgically\" precise, destroying enemy nerve centers without causing widespread destruction or loss of life.\nBut for Frank Bruni of The Detroit Free Press and myself -- the two \"pencils\" (as the Defense Department calls writers) in the pool -- it is a story that will reach the world only belatedly.\nWe type out our dispatches and hand them over to our escort officer, who finds nothing to censor or flag. Greg Jarrett of ABC News plays the audiotape he has prepared for the escort officer, who finds nothing objectionable in it. In minutes, a telephone line is transmitting the tape to the Dhahran International Hotel for distribution to radio pool members and the outside world. The videotape made by an NBC crew, including the correspondent Rick Davis's stand-up commentary, pilot interviews, close-up shots of the F-117A aircraft and their laser-guided bombs, is approved sight unseen for shipment to Dhahran and distribution.\nWe spread our sleeping bags on cots in an abandoned commissary building and go to sleep, secure in the belief that the armed forces will transmit our copy to the news community, which includes our respective employers. But at 3 A.M. Frank and I are awakened to learn that problems have arisen with our written dispatches.\nIt turns out that the wing commander has spotted passages in both of our stories that he regards as improper, and he has made some excisions and changes to which we are asked to agree. None of them appear to have anything to do with security. In Frank's copy, the adjective \"giddy,\" used to describe the pilots, has been changed to \"proud,\" and in my story, the words \"fighter-bomber\" have been changed to \"fighter.\" I can only guess why this phrase was censored. The Air Force is currently waging a campaign to save the costly B-2 Stealth-bomber project. Could it be that if the F-117A is also called a \"bomber,\" Congressional critics might argue that a second Stealth bomber -- the B-2 --is unnecessary?\nBut to make newspaper deadlines throughout the United States, Frank and I agree to all the proposed changes, on the condition that our copy is dispatched hastily, via fax machine to pool headquarters in Dhahran. This proves a forlorn hope. We learn the following day that our stories have been sent instead to officials at the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada -- the home base of the Stealth fighters -- where everything we wrote has been deemed a breach of security.\nMore than 24 hours after they were written, our stories are finally cleared, but of course, the war has already moved on, and our perishable dispatches are hopelessly stale.\nNext, we learn something new and vitally important: Our Stealth-pilot friends, in their latest attacks, have smashed Iraq's laboratories and plants involved in developing nuclear weapons. This is news of the first magnitude that will come as a great relief for those who had feared Iraq would soon have nuclear warheads for its missiles. We ask the Stealth commander for permission to report the happy tidings, but he turns us down on the grounds that new attacks on the nuclear facilities might be needed, and that nothing should be reported until the job is completed.\nWe of course agree, but the following day Agence France-Presse, the French news agency, scoops us on the story by getting details of the raid from the staff of a United States senator. And the day after that, General Schwarzkopf announces the raid himself.\nBy now it has begun to seem that pools are not the best way to cover the war, and many correspondents and cameramen are violating Saudi laws and American military regulations by setting out on their own. Among these frustrated news people are Bob Simon, CBS's warwise correspondent, and three of his associates, who drove north from Dhahran toward the Kuwaiti border in search of something meatier than briefings.\nSomething happened to Bob and his comrades after they reached the border, where their abandoned car was later found, still containing a large bundle of cash they had left in it.\nIt is not clear at this writing whether the CBS crew was captured by Iraqi soldiers; CBS News believes they are being detained in Baghdad. I cannot help feeling that part of the responsibility lies in a system that goads people into taking unnecessary -- or necessary -- risks.\nWe have found ways to see the war. Those of us who made it to the skirmish at Khafji, where a small Iraqi mechanized force briefly occupied Saudi territory, did so as part of a Saudi pool, not an American pool.\nBut the Saudi hinterlands, unlike those of Vietnam, India or Central America, do not favor news coverage by stealth. Only a handful of roads cross the naked desert -- mostly six-lane highways on which traffic is sparse and a press vehicle is conspicuous. The desert itself, particularly near the gulf coast, is crisscrossed by camel tracks that a four-wheel-drive vehicle can navigate. But driving in the desert is dangerous, even when there is no need to evade American M.P.'s or Iraqi patrols. Constant winds churn a fog of fine dust, which confuses the sense of direction and clogs air filters as well as lungs. Distances are great, and filling stations nonexistent. And then there are mine fields along the Iraqi and Kuwaiti borders.\nSome reporters, hiding out in American Marine and Army field units, are meanwhile working in the guise of mascots, given G.I. uniforms and gear to look inconspicuous, enjoying the affection (and protection) of the units they're trying to cover -- concealed by the officers and troops from the handful of press-hating commanders who strive to keep the battlefield free of wandering journalists. Life is hard for these infiltrators from the press. Nearly all the reporters who have tried to reach American front-line units have been arrested at one time or another, and sometimes been held for up to 12 hours in field jails, facing the threat that their press credential would be permanently confiscated and their Saudi visas canceled.\nEric Schmitt, John Kifner and Chris Hedges of The New York Times have all been arrested and detained by American military authorities for varying periods of time, as have Guy Gugliotta of The Washington Post, John King and Fred Bayles of The Associated Press, Joseph Albright of Cox Newspapers, and many others.\n\"I spend two-thirds of my time evading the M.P.'s and only one-third interviewing the troops,\" a friend told me. \"You have to wonder whether it's worth the effort.\"\nI think it is worth the effort. News correspondents have their share of problems reporting this war -- problems that seem to evoke little sympathy from some of our countrymen. But aside from the introduction of some spectacular new technology and communication systems, the gulf war has much in common with earlier conflicts. Americans still need to know what is happening, and it is still the task of the press to maintain the flow of information."}, {"text": "Japan's Homeless: Seen Yet Ignored\n1991-01-19T05:00:00.000Z\nIn a silent, dark alley near piers that bustle during the day, a few small piles of cardboard and blankets are all that keep the late-night chill from 10 sleeping men, a handful of the scores of homeless vagrants of this otherwise prosperous port.\n\"I chose this way of life myself, no one chose it for me,\" said Yuji Inoue, a grizzled 64-year-old unemployed construction worker, stirring momentarily for a cigarette and some conversation. \"The people who come by and see me, well, no one is hostile. But nobody's giving me money either.\"\nLike the United States and Europe, Japan is scarred by homelessness created by the stresses of advanced development. But the phenomenon is little discussed in a society that emphasizes its economic triumphs rather than those the miracle has trampled or left behind.\nCensus takers leave it up to local officials to give out the numbers of the homeless, and most decline to do so. The National Police Agency also refuses to divulge its estimates. Becoming Ordinary\nYet Japanese have become accustomed to the sight of derelicts camped in tunnels, under highways and inside train stations in Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka. No one knows how many there are, but perhaps thousands of people may live that way part of the time.\nLike their American counterparts, many suffer from alcoholism and mental illness, raising questions about how to help them while respecting their civil rights. As in the United States, the police here say they cannot sweep them from the streets unless they disrupt traffic or are disorderly.\nBut in contrast with the United States and some European countries, Japan has not been emptying its mental institutions into the streets. Last June, 336,271 patients were counted in mental hospitals, nearly twice as many as 25 years ago.\nSome experts say more Japanese homeless are from ethnic minorities than the population at large. The minorities here include Koreans and other foreign nationalities and the descendants of the Burakumin, an ancient Untouchable-like lower class, but there are no statistics.\nAnd unlike the United States, Japan is not faced with large numbers of entire families without homes, or people with jobs who cannot find housing. Drugs are not a major problem, but drinking and gambling are epidemic. Lining Up for Jobs\nGenerally, the homeless in Japan's major cities live in and near the areas where large populations of laborers reside in flophouses and line up in the morning for part-time construction jobs, usually at shape-ups run by organized crime. One such neighborhood in Yokohama is Kotobukicho, which means, roughly, town of congratulations for a long life.\n\"This area is a showcase of Japan's problems,\" said the Rev. Hidetoshi Watanabe, a local pastor. \"There's worker exploitation, old men isolated from their families, discrimination against foreigners, minorities, the mentally and physically disabled -- and of course alcoholism.\"\nSeveral local groups in Yokohama seek to help the homeless as well as the larger group of perhaps 7,000, most of them men, who live in squalid Kotobukicho, a trash-strewn corner of the downtown area where the streets are often filled with drunken and gambling vagrants.\nBefore it was razed in the American bombings of World War II, the neighborhood of Kotobukicho was a prosperous place of shops and homes. When it was rebuilt, the city chose it for dozens of cheap hotels to house laborers doing construction at the harbor and nearby American navy base. Many Refuse Aid\nToday the people who work with the residents here estimate that half the derelict population spends part of the year in the streets, often when they are out of work or want to sleep off drinking bouts. Many are eligible for welfare or disability payments but choose not to accept.\n\"It may be an oversimplification, but I think most of the homeless are there because they want to enjoy their freedom,\" said Yoshinori Shibuya, a senior official in the Yokohama social welfare bureau. \"We urge them to accept welfare payments or to go the hospital, but 80 percent refuse.\"\nCensus takers found 191 homeless people in Yokohama last October, but social workers think the number at its peak in the summer is twice that. That is a small number, perhaps, for a city of three million but startling because of the concentration of the homeless at downtown parks and public buildings.\nAnother peak time for the homeless is the New Year's period, when construction work is generally shut down for the holiday, cutting off the income for workers. At this time, Yokohama, like Tokyo and Osaka, puts up a temporary shelter -- in this case, for 200 people, in a small city park.\n\"If I earned a little more, I could move to a high-class hotel,\" said Masateru Nakano, a longtime resident, shrugging his shoulders. \"But when I get money, I spend it on my women and on drinking, so there are a lot of times when I have to sleep on the street. Life isn't so easy for me.\" No-Win Situation\nCity officials say they are criticized by groups seeking to help the homeless for not doing enough and by other Yokohama residents for doing too much, thereby supposedly making it too easy to be homeless.\nYokohama spends $2 million a year for services in Kotobukicho, including running two large centers with indoor lounges, television rooms, health clinics, bathing facilities and eating areas. The city also pays welfare or disability grants to more than 2,200 residents of the area.\nOn a recent afternoon at one shelter, 40 men in tattered clothing were slouching in chairs, watching spangle-clad iceskaters on television. Elsewhere, men were using the laundry rooms and bathing areas, and some were just sleeping in corners.\nOutside, knots of men stood at illegal gambling dens, drinking, stamping their feet in the cold and scanning pages of listings of boat races, horse races and other events. Residents say Kotobukicho has several offices of yakuza, or organized crime syndicates, that run gambling or labor operations.\nThe urgency of city efforts to get people off the streets deepened in 1983, when some junior high school students threw rocks and assaulted and beat some homeless people, killing three. In Kotobukicho, volunteers now patrol the homeless areas twice a week in the winter and once a month at other times. 'A Shameful Thing'\nTheir aim is simply to make sure they are all right, offering blankets and encouraging them to sign up for welfare, unemployment or disability grants.\n\"We are careful not to become too familiar with the people we help because it's a shameful thing for them,\" said Yoh Nonomura, a volunteer. \"They get annoyed even if we ask them their names. They generally want to be left alone.\"\nLast week, dozens of residents lined up at the city-sponsored temporary shelters for free steaming bowls of rice and vegetables distributed by the Kabukicho Day Laborers Union. That evening, volunteers spread out with food and blankets in the streets and parks.\nOne volunteer was Masaaki Kagoshima, a bearded and ponytailed organizer specializing in helping the conditions of Koreans, Filipinos, Bangladeshis and other foreign laborers who make up a part of the homeless.\n\"The problems in this area are the inevitable product of a huge and highly developed consumer society,\" Mr. Kagosima said. \"Kotobukicho is really a kind of third world society concentrated within Japan.\"\nLate at night, Mr. Kagoshima drove alone in his van with two visitors to the first building near the docks, where Mr. Inoue was sleeping with 10 friends. He said he and the others usually gathered up their blankets at the end of each night and hid them safely out of sight during the day. 'I Didn't Want to Beg'\n\"If I went to the shelter at night, my things would be stolen,\" he said, gesturing to the bedding, clothes and pillow piled in a corner. \"When I started this way of life seven years ago, I didn't want to beg for help from the government. I just don't like to beg for help.\"\nThe next stop was a park at City Hall, where Mr. Kagoshima said hello to a man and a woman underneath blankets with their dog. \"Some people can't stay in the hotels because they don't allow dogs,\" Mr. Kagoshima said. He asked the couple whether they needed blankets, and they said no.\nAt the Kannae train station, 20 men were lying in blankets along an indoor tunnel as Mr. Kagoshima and other volunteers handed out plastic bowls of hot soup and small Japanese oranges. He placed a flier about a meeting the next day on a sleeping man's back, using an orange as a paperweight.\nNearby, Yoshiaki Nakamura, a 55-year-old tunnel resident with wavy gray hair, was gulping onion soup. \"I'm satisfied with my way of life,\" he said, \"and I don't think of myself as an unlucky person.,\" He said he earned about $12 a day from picking up cardboard from trash cans and selling it to recyclers.\nAmong Yokohama welfare officials, homelessness is one of many problems faced by Japan today, particularly the problems of old people and handicapped generally. \"Of course, homelessness is a vital issue,\" Mr. Shibuya said. \"But I wouldn't give it more priority than other problems we face.\"\nBut for Mr. Kagoshima, the issue of homelessness symbolizes the need for Japanese to face up to the indifference, if not antagonism, toward people with physical and mental handicaps. \"If we don't overcome this hostility,\" he said, \"Japan will become two worlds talking past each other.\""}, {"text": "All About/Dress Shirts; Can Colors and Stripes Rescue Shirt Makers From a Slump?\n1991-03-17T05:00:00.000Z\nThe makers of men's dress shirts are trying to pull themselves out of a sales slump by splashing their goods with color. They want men to drape themselves in bold stripes and solid maroons, greens and browns instead of wearing pallid white and blue.\nEven before the nationwide recession, shirt makers, weakened by buyouts and raids, were reporting lower revenues. Their sales fell about 4 percent in each of the last two years, according to the Market Research Corporation of America, whose monthly surveys track retail trends.\nAnd declines could continue. \"People don't buy clothes in a weak economy until they wear out,\" said Lawrence S. Phillips, chairman and chief executive of the Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation. Mr. Phillips said that shirts are at least selling better than suits as men look for inexpensive ways to freshen their wardrobes.\nIn tough times, said Edward Johnson, an analyst with Lynch, Jones and Ryan, men are the first in the family to cut back their spending on clothes. But he expects retail sales in general to rebound later this year from their plunge at the outbreak of the Persian Gulf war. Others are less sure. \"There could be a resurgence in retail consumer demand, but will it be sustained?\" asked Irwin Cohen, a managing partner at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting and consulting firm.\nThe Infighting Van Heusen Tries To Overtake Arrow\nIn a highly fragmented, $2.2 billion industry, Phillips-Van Heusen is likely to claim the largest fragment, overtaking its archrival, Cluett, Peabody and Company's Arrow brand. Last year, the Van Heusen brand accounted for 8.2 percent of the market, up from 7.4 percent in 1989, according to the Market Research Corporation, while the Arrow brand's share fell from 11.2 percent to 10.5 percent.\nAlison Bisnos, an analyst at Stephens Inc., said J.C. Penney's agreement to carry the Van Heusen brand has secured its growth. \"We're looking for Van Heusen to surpass Arrow by the end of 1991,\" she said.\nMatthew Chamlin, president of the Cluett Shirt Group, dismissed the issue as \"rather an abstract one,\" since Arrow, which also makes Burberry's and Yves Saint Laurent clothes, dominates top-drawer department and men's stores, while Van Heusen has a wider range of outlets. \"It's not like Coke and Pepsi,\" he said. But Arrow is hoping that with more fashionable merchandise and slicker marketing, it can beat back its rival.. \"By September, there will be a whole new Arrow shirt world out there,\" he said.\nCluett, Peabody was wounded in the takeover wars of the 1980's. After fending off Paul Bilzerian, Cluett was acquired by West Point Pepperell in 1986. Three years later, the Chicago financier William Farley bought a majority interest in West Point. Desperate to sell assets and reduce his debts, Mr. Farley sold Cluett to the Paris-based Bidermann Group for $410 million in March 1990.\nPhillips-Van Heusen also has had to defend itself. To repel a group led by Caroline Hunt's Rosewood Corporation in 1987, the company bought back stock and acquired the G.H. Bass Company -- adding enough debt to all but rule out a leveraged takeover. Phillips-Van Heusen executives like to say that continuity of management has helped them gain ground on Arrow. The Geoffrey Beene line capitalizes on the designer market, while the company also makes many of the shirts sold under private labels like Land's End, the buttoned-down mail order company.\nAfter the two largest brands come a variety of smaller labels. The Salant Corporation has the Manhattan, John Henry and Perry Ellis brands. Salant bought Manhattan in 1988, but by last year the company's debts forced it to seek bankruptcy protection. Warnaco Inc., privately held, has Hathaway and Christian Dior. Other major manufacturers include Crystal Brands Inc., the Kellwood Company and Oxford Industries Inc.\nThe makers of brand name shirts have lost some of their best corporate customers over the last decade as retailers sought to market shirts under their own names. Some stores dropped national brands altogether, while others tarnished the brand names with frequent discounts.\nBy last year, more than 65 percent of all dress shirt sales came at discounts, according to the Market Research Corporation. \"That's not what we spent over 100 years building a brand for,\" said Mr. Phillips, whose great grandfather founded the company in 1881.\nBeyond White Besides, 'How Many Can You Own?'\nWhile blue and white shirts still account for more than half of their sales, manufacturers hope to tempt men with more variety. Edward Menicheschi, vice president of marketing at Arrow, said shirt makers have been too slow to provide men with more colorful plumage. \"Shirts are the last link in the apparel food chain that gave up and became sophisticated and responsive to consumer demand,\" he said. Sales of more fashionable alternatives to traditional colors and stripes rose to 52 percent of his business last year from 48 percent in 1989.\nMr. Johnson, the analyst, said that brighter shirt fashions helped sales of men's wear grow more rapidly than women's wear last year. \"Young men are more colorful and that's where the sales are,\" he said.\nEven Land's End, known for conservative styles, offered tab collars and radiant stripes in its special dress shirt catalogue last fall. Analysts said its customers have bought almost all the traditional shirts they need. \"How many can you own?\" added Mr. Cohen.\nShirt makers have tried to stir up sales with color before. In the 1970's, shirts came in pastel paisley and psychedelic patterns. The latest burst of color suits a more professional clientele, conscious of power and money and eager to obtain more of both. Multi-colored English stripes and muted greens, blues, reds and grays are as close as most of the newer shirts come to flamboyance.\nAll-cotton fabrics, which once seemed headed for near-extinction, have recovered to as much as 15 percent of the market, according to some estimates. \"It's part of the general trend toward the natural things in life,\" said Robert C. Skinner Jr., president of the shirt division of Oxford Industries. With more women working, he added, more men send their shirts out to be laundered and fewer value the permanent press attractions of polyester blends.\nPeripatetic Factories Japan to Malaysia, Then Costa Rica\nThe label may be American, but the shirt may be Costa Rican or Chinese. About half the dress shirts sold by American manufacturers are made elsewhere, according to the Market Research Corporation. Shirt-making is labor intensive, so staying competitive means constantly searching for cheaper labor. Companies have to keep on the move, in part because their investments can help a local economy so much that labor costs rise.\nConsider the path that shirt makers have followed. In the 1950's, they availed themselves of eager, low-paid workers in Japan. Then, as the cost of labor and real estate increased, the companies moved their plants to Hong Kong. As Hong Kong's factories gave way to offices, the shirt makers moved again, first to Taiwan and Korea, and then, in the 1970's and 1980's, to China, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh.\nOver the last five years, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras and Puerto Rico have also become major manufacturing centers. Their advantages include tax incentives under the Caribbean Basin Initiative agreement of 1983, and the two weeks it takes for finished products to reach the United States, compared with six from the Far East. \"Our total procurement from the Far East is down about 20 percent from five years ago,\" Mr. Phillips said.\nShirt makers have some major incentives to make their products closer to home. Capital tied up in finished shirts earns nothing while they are being shipped. And as the business becomes more fashion-conscious, the pressure increases to get the shirts to the shelves as soon as possible. Otherwise, a company could be left with bales of shirts in a pattern everyone simply had to have only a couple months before. WHEN IT'S FIT THAT COUNTS\nWith ready-made shirts at the tony Paul Stuart men's store in Manhattan costing up to $112.50, more and more, customers are choosing custom fitting for $70 to $150. The store's custom shirt business boomed in the 1980's and now accounts for a quarter of the shirts it sells.\nMade-to-order still fits most men's forms better than their budgets. Irwin Cohen of Deloitte & Touche estimates that this service accounts for less than 3 percent of all shirt sales -- \"and maybe that's too high,\" he said.\nBut with prices for even the most popular labels sometimes rising above $50 -- although Arrow shirts average $22, they can cost as much as $60 -- custom shirts are seizing a swatch of the mass market. Such is the inspiration for the Custom Shop, the only national chain of stores for made-to-order shirts, with 81 locations and annual revenues of about $50 million.\nThe shops' prices range from $178 for four shirts, as an introductory offer, to $97.50 for a shirt of the finest Sea Island cotton. Mortimer Levitt, the sole owner of Custom Shop Shirtmakers/Tailors, said he charged his first customer $2.15 a shirt in 1937.\nCollar varieties alone justify today's cost, Mr. Levitt said, adding that most men are suffering in collars half an inch too tight. Custom Shops offer collars in four back heights, five front heights (at age 84, Mr. Levitt admits he wears his collar high at the front \"to hide the wrinkles\"), three point lengths and three different spreads.\n\"That's a total of 180 different variations,\" Mr. Levitt said, each cut to the quarter-inch. Although his swatch books include loud navy and red gingham shirtings, most customers choose pale solids and traditional stripes.\nMr. Levitt's sales have fallen about 10 percent since last September, when the nation was entering a recession. Paul Stuart reports slower growth in sales of custom shirts during the last few years.\nBut a few privileged customers who want wardrobes as immaculate as their balance sheets can still afford to dispense with Paul Stuart's usual made-to-measure patterns in favor of having their own patterns traced, with every measurement individually made. Nothing less for the man who can pay as much as $400 per shirt."}, {"text": "Daring To Heal\n1991-07-28T05:00:00.000Z\nFEW COUNTRIES EXEMPLIFY THE WORLD'S FORGOTTEN catastrophes more graphically than Somalia, which had the ill fortune in January to see the violent overthrow of its aging dictator eclipsed by the countdown to war in the Persian Gulf.\nSince the outbreak of civil war in 1988, Somalia had unraveled into lawlessness, falling to the mercy of rampaging soldiers and armed highwaymen. By January, when the climactic battle began for control of the capital, Mogadishu, most of the international aid community had pulled out of the ancient Arab seaport. Only a handful of Europeans remained, most affiliated with a small Austrian charity, SOS Children's Village. As the havoc spread north toward the city of Berbera, even the International Committee of the Red Cross withdrew. Telephones and telexes were cut, and commercial transportation was paralyzed.\nBut one relief group defied conventional wisdom and headed in rather than out. On Jan. 7, a small team of surgical volunteers from Medecins Sans Frontieres (M.S.F.) flew into Somalia from neighboring Kenya to operate on the war-injured. Twice in the next few weeks, M.S.F. volunteers were forced to flee the country, first when waves of marauding Government troops invaded the hospital they were working in and later when rebels from the United Somali Congress overran Government headquarters and threw open prison dungeons and arms depots. Each time, the group slipped back a few days later. As Government forces and rebel factions filled the skies with artillery fire, Somalia's only contact with the outside world was the radio line between the M.S.F. volunteers and their regional office in Kenya.\nTwo decades after its birth in Paris, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) has grown from a band of swashbuckling young crusaders to the largest -- and some would argue most efficient -- medical relief organization in the world. With an annual budget of $30 million to $40 million, the group sends 2,000 volunteers a year into the field. And with 70 full-time staff members in Paris and more than 500 professionals on reserve, they are able to instantly dispatch an exploratory team of medical and logistic experts to the scene of a breaking emergency. Within hours of the team's report, they may begin to charter cargo planes and mobilize the M.S.F. logistics center in the town of Lezignan, in the south of France.\nSpawned by a group of radicals from the Paris revolt of 1968, M.S.F. and its two offshoots, Medecins du Monde and Aide Medicale Internationale, have forged a movement of medical volunteers impelled by the duty to speak out against the suffering they witness and to go where other groups will not. For much of the last decade, the French doctors acted almost as a medical cavalry as the mujahedeen fought the Soviet Army in Afghanistan. Not only were they one of the very few relief organizations in the country, but they also brought eyewitness reports of the atrocities to the attention of the West.\nOver the last 12 months, a year of disasters that left even the International Red Cross and the United Nations reeling, Medecins Sans Frontieres and Medecins du Monde were consistently on the front line. Last July, they were with the rebels as Liberia was falling apart, and a month later, they were in Syria and the Jordanian desert building camps for some of the 700,000 refugees fleeing Iraq. In January, there was Somalia. Since February, they have battled the cholera epidemic that began in Peru and is threatening all of South America. Barely had their weary volunteers brought shelter and medicine to thousands of Kurds last April when a cyclone swept over a third of Bangladesh, prompting Paris to dispatch an exploratory team to assess the destruction.\n IT'S EARLY MAY WHEN A PHOTOGRAPHER AND I ARRIVE IN Somalia. In Mogadishu, M.S.F. volunteers are still performing surgery day and night, hunkered down in the rambling, single-story pavilions of Medina Hospital. Filled to its 130-bed capacity, the hospital has expanded outdoors, engulfed by patients with festering wounds, lying on foam mattresses under the flat-topped thorn trees. Except for the Red Cross, which has ventured back with a staff of three, the international relief community is still waiting it out in Nairobi.\nThe crackle of gunfire is commonplace in the Somali capital, and explosions shake the single-story hospital. In the stifling emergency room, there is no respite. A harried, sweat-soaked French nurse named Sabine Brunello plunges to the floor to examine a patient who has just arrived on a stretcher. Looking back over her shoulder at the crowd of spectators, she shouts in English: \"Please! I want some help!\"\nA few feet away, the body of a little girl, cut down by a stray bullet, lies abandoned by her despondent parents. The floor is littered with saturated gauze and discarded rubber gloves, and flies have begun to swarm around a souring puddle of blood. Glancing across the room, Brunello murmurs, \"The kids are really the toughest.\"\nAcross the compound, the team's medical coordinator, 32-year-old Jean-Herve Bradol, is taking a short break in the kitchen of the former nurses' quarters. \"I wanted to work here precisely because it's not in the spotlight, because no one cares about it,\" he says, slouching in the heat and humidity. \"In fact, that's always been the great merit of M.S.F., they go to places others don't go.\" Bradol is married to a physician, who is back in Paris with their small child. \"We take risks,\" he says of his colleagues, \"financially, personally, with no feedback.\" The Somalia group was well aware of the disparity between the publicity surrounding the Kurdish disaster and that in Somalia. \nSpirits are low on the M.S.F. team, which works from 8 A.M. until well after midnight. Relations have not been smooth with the local medical staff, who were alienated by the rigid work style of one of the first M.S.F. doctors to arrive. After weeks of diplomacy, M.S.F. has mended the rift, but recently some Somali doctors threatened to quit unless they were paid cash salaries in addition to the food rations they receive. \"What are we doing here?\" wonders Dr. Lionel Raffin, an anesthesiologist from Paris. \"Now we are exhausted and our morale is destroyed. Are we doing anything worthwhile?\" Since Raffin arrived two weeks ago, the team has performed 82 major operations and stitched up or set bones on scores of other patients. To Raffin, this seems like a drop in the ocean.\nBut his colleague Bradol sees the group's role more broadly, as independent witness to Somalia's agonizing upheaval. \"We're not here to show people how to run a hospital,\" he argues. \"We want to pressure the Government to act well.\" Their presence also provides a gauge of the level of stability of the new Government. \"It would be very negative if we pulled out,\" Bradol says. Indeed, Charles F. Laskey, the director of CARE's Somalia program, says other agencies take their cue from M.S.F., although they also criticize them. \"Some say they're too brash, won't cooperate too much with other nongovernmental organizations,\" he says. But \"they dropped in and came out two or three times and that told us a lot. If those guys can't work there, then we can't.\"\nMonitoring the ephemeral state of order is central -- indeed vital -- to M.S.F.'s daily work, and the delicate task of keeping in touch with all the contentious factions in Somalia falls to Wim Van Hauwaert, a nurse from Belgium and the team's overall coordinator. At 28 and built like a bear, Van Hauwaert moves easily among his roles as manager, morale-booster and diplomat. Every day, he makes at least one tour through the rubble-strewn capital with his well-informed young Somali driver to assess the balance of power among the rebel factions and to evaluate the general level of anarchy.\nOne morning, I go with Van Hauwaert to inspect two huge water-purification tanks that the team has provided for several thousand people in a shantytown on the outskirts of the city. Like everyone else, we take along an armed guard. The whole city has been on alert today after fighting broke out between rebel factions last night.\nAs the driver turns down a main boulevard, 50 men and boys spring out of nowhere and surround us, swinging rifles and rocket launchers and pistols and shouting gutteral orders all at once. \"Stop!\" they holler. \"No photos! No PHOTOS!\" The tension mounts as we continue past a charred Government tank, near the Hotel Towfiq. Van Hauwaert signals with a low hand gesture for our driver to stop; both of them now seem alarmed by the number of machine-gun-mounted cars in front of the hotel and by the bands of heavily armed men who are shrieking, \"Get into the hotel!\"\nInside, the hotel receptionists stiffen as two gunmen, slung with bandoliers, storm past and up the stairs to the roof. Another four men are standing on the rooftop across the street, all aiming their machine guns at our hotel. Half an hour later, we slip out and continue on our tour.\nMost of the M.S.F. volunteers in Mogadishu are veterans of other difficult missions, but no one expected the workload, tension and deadly anarchy they found here. For the first three months, Medina Hospital was overrun with weapons; volunteers had guns pulled on them by families demanding that their relatives be treated ahead of others. \"This is my toughest mission ever, and I've worked in Kurdistan, Mali and Niger,\" says Jeanne-Marie Gomis, a nurse who specializes in war surgery. \"One patient threatened, 'If you don't help me, I'll beat you!' \"\nDespite the exhaustion, isolation and unnerving volleys of gunfire and grenades as they work, a strong feeling of camaraderie exists among the M.S.F. staff. Each evening, they break for dinner about 9, heading for the refuge of the old nurses' quarters. One by one, they flop down around the long table, to discover that once again, in the throes of Mogadishu's madness, their Somali cook, Didi, has managed to whip together a tasty meal of fish, meat stew and rice. Didi wears a snow-white chef's hat, which Bradol jokingly insists was not provided by M.S.F.\nDetermined to relax during mealtime, no one even blinks at the persistent machine-gun fire that seems 10 feet outside the window. Rather, they lose themselves in anecdotes that capture the utter chaos of the place. The table erupts in laughter over the story of the visit a month before by Dr. Bernard Kouchner, who was appointed French Minister of State for Humanitarian Action in 1988 and who was a founder of M.S.F. When he asked Somalia's interim President what kind of humanitarian aid the French Government could provide, even Kouchner, who has undoubtedly heard his share of unorthodox requests, was taken aback by the President's instant response. \"Arms,\" he told Kouchner. \"We need weapons for our policemen, so they can try to bring some order to this place.\"\n AT 51, BERNARD KOUCHNER STILL RESEMBLES A SLIGHT, SANDYHAIRED youth, though his face has become leaner with age, etched with intensity and anger. His lips, usually pursed in impatience, occasionally relax into a charismatic movie-star smile.\nAs a young physician and member of the Union of Communist Students, Kouchner was active in the Paris protests of May 1968. Later that year, he and other young doctors went to Biafra with the Red Cross, to work with the Ibo secessionists who were being bombed and starved out by the Nigerian Government forces. For many, it was their first exposure to genocide, and it was a cruel test of their Hippocratic oath.\n\"Some of the team decided to leave,\" Kouchner recalls, \"and the rest of us organized a meeting to plan how we could protect our patients.\" The group brought together pragmatic political activists like Kouchner with traditional Christian humanitarians. One of these was Dr. Max Recamier, who impressed his colleagues with his spiritual commitment to serving humanity and influenced the group's mandate to help without regard to national or political identity. \n\"We are facing a mass murder,\" Kouchner told the group, \"so if we are good doctors, we have to stop the bombing.\" Haunted by the echoes of World War II, when the International Committee of the Red Cross chose not to denounce the Nazi extermination camps, the group decided to break the oath of confidentiality they had signed with the Red Cross and to report what they saw. As healers, they argued, they had the duty to alert the world to the agony they witnessed, and to condemn the oppression causing it.\nThey also took exception to the Red Cross policy of respecting sovereign authorities and going only where they were authorized to go. Doctors, they argued, had a \"duty to interfere,\" clandestinely if necessary. \"You do not ignore a bleeding man simply because he happens to be bleeding across a border,\" Kouchner still insists. Emboldened by their new philosophical commitment, they named themselves Medecins Sans Frontieres and rounded up a corps of doctors who would be on call for emergency deployment. Surviving on small donations, hitching rides on Air France or paying their own way, they navigated perilous situations with little more than their medical bags and political wits.\n\"At first, people saw us as crazy leftist Boy Scouts,\" remembers Dr. Patrick Aeberhard, a cardiologist in his mid-40's and a former president of Medecins du Monde. \"Then we were seen as agents of the K.G.B. and C.I.A. alternatively, which was a good thing for us -- at least we weren't politically aligned. But gradually they saw that we criticized things from the place where the \npeople \nwere\" -- that is, from the point of view of the population under attack.\nThe brashness and defiance of M.S.F.'s founders propelled the movement and gave it its elan. \"The thing that is so incredible about Kouchner is that he will tell anyone what he thinks,\" Aeberhard says, recalling a 1976 incident in which Kouchner stormed out of a hospital in West Beirut that was being shelled by a Christian militia unit. \"He crossed through an incredibly dangerous zone, marched up to the Christian militia and starting yelling at them for attacking the hospital. Kouchner told them, shaking his finger, 'Listen, some day \nyou're \ngoing to be on the side that's getting bombed, and I'm going to come and help you, so you'll see I'm not taking sides.' But the militiamen sneered and said, 'Yeah, but we're going to kill you before that.' \"\nIf their courage and conviction launched the young doctors into the field, their first stabs at humanitarian relief were pure improvisation. On a recent trip to the United States to promote Doctors Without Borders, M.S.F.'s new American affiliate, Dr. Francis Charhon shared memories with Dr. Rony Brauman, M.S.F.'s current president, of the days when they knew so little about relief supplies that they had to search the Yellow Pages to order blankets and other materials in bulk. At 45, prematurely white-haired, Charhon still has a schoolboy swagger. \"Perhaps we had the imagination,\" he say, his eyes alight with amusement. \"Having no background gave us the freedom of mind, and we did it.\" \nLike many who joined M.S.F. in the 1970's, Brauman was inspired by Marxist ideals, believing that peasant revolutions would change the world. Nothing crushed the vestiges of that theory more than the savagery of the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia's revolutionaries, who left more than a million dead in their wake. Brauman was in Thailand in 1979, when thousands of ghostly Cambodians stumbled out of the jungle along the Thai border.\n\"We were lost at first,\" he says, wincing. \"Nobody can be rational in a situation like that. You could only hear the groaning, and the wind in the trees. I had nightmares for weeks after that.\"\n AT THE END OF THE 1970'S, MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES SPLIT into two camps, driven apart by a controversial scheme of Kouchner's to publicize the plight of the Vietnamese boat people by launching a ship -- the Ile de Lumiere, Island of Light -- to rescue refugees at sea. The plan triggered a bitter political debate, which brought to a climax a personality conflict and power struggle among the movement's founders. Critics denounced Kouchner's mission as self-promoting. He defended it as an act of bearing witness.\nEventually, Kouchner and his followers broke away, founding the rival Medecins du Monde (M.D.M.), which has remained smaller and more loosely structured than the parent group. (Aide Medicale Internationale, also formed at about this time, specializes in sending tiny teams behind the lines of conflict.) Brauman regards the split as the final collision of two generations of volunteers: Kouchner and the older generation wanted to remain small and informal, leaving large-scale relief efforts to the major international organizations. \nHoused in a cobbled courtyard a few blocks from the Place de la Republique in Paris, M.D.M. deploys about 500 volunteers a year to some 40 countries. Operating with an annual budget of about $20 million, over 60 percent of which comes from private donations, M.D.M. has put special effort into domestic programs for AIDS victims and the poor. It has also opened chapters in several Eastern European countries, where local physicians seek to promote health and human rights.\nSince assuming his role as politician in 1988, Kouchner's relations with both M.S.F. and M.D.M. have been stormy. His reputation as a \"media animal,\" as he has been called, was fueled by his highly publicized liaison with the leading television anchorwoman on France's Antenne 2. While the rival relief agencies squared off in the battle for funds and news teams jockeyed for access to disaster zones, Kouchner's critics accused Medecins du Monde of giving an unfair advantage to Antenne 2.\nKouchner is unrepentant. \"This is the success of the French doctors,\" he says, defending his pursuit of media coverage. \"Without photography, massacres would not exist. Nothing can be done without pressure on politicians.\"\nAs further justification for courting the media, Kouchner points to three United Nations resolutions France has successfully proposed since 1988 that have brought the guiding principle of both organizations -- the duty to interfere -- closer to becoming an inalienable right. On April 5, amid the urgency of the Kurdish crisis, the longstanding sanctity of national boundaries took an unprecedented blow when the United Nations granted states, as long as they are operating under the flag of the United Nations, the right to cross into Iraq to reach civilians in distress, a right that formerly applied only to private relief agencies.\n MEANWHILE AT M.S.F., THE \"new generation\" as Brauman calls it, has systematically forged the group into a large, formal organization, focusing on large-scale disaster relief and public health issues.\nWith spirited self-confidence, they slash through the political thicket in which they invariably land. When necessary, they are willing to irritate a host government in order to protect the lives of civilians, as M.S.F. did in exposing the forced resettlement of Ethiopian villagers in 1985. Some 100,000 people perished in the moves, the group estimates. The reminder of that terrible year brings Rony Brauman's fist down on a table. \"This was not the peak of the famine,\" he insists. \"But we could see that the forced relocation was killing an incredibly high number of people.\" Finally, in December 1985, the Mengistu Government tossed the French team out of Ethiopia.\nFrom every crisis they have distilled essential lessons. Perhaps their most renowned innovation has been the development of prepackaged \"kits\" for every conceivable disaster situation, ready to be airborne in hours. A \"kit sanitaire\" weighs 1,790 pounds and contains all the materials needed to provide potable water and sanitation for 10,000 people for three months. Kits for setting up field offices include typewriters, stamps and hole punches. A meal kit, a French version of K-rations for the volunteers, consists of dried soup, cheese, conserve, chocolate and wine.\nOver the last few years, M.S.F.'s achievements have been gathering recognition. Its \"Clinical and Therapeutic Guide\" has been adopted by the World Health Organization, and in 1987 the French Government named M.S.F. a Grande Cause Nationale. Last year, when thousands of refugees from Iraq were stranded in the Jordanian desert, M.S.F. was designated by the European Economic Community to coordinate its border relief effort.\n FROM THE DAY IN EARlY April when Medecins Sans Frontieres received word of the Kurdish exodus from a volunteer in eastern Turkey who had made the terrible journey with the refugees, it cranked into high gear, and within a week had cargo planes in the air and dozens of volunteers in Turkey and Iran. \nCasual and hip, with spiky haircuts and the latest in cowboy jackets and jeans, the young staff at M.S.F.'s high-tech headquarters in Paris convey the inimitable French air of effortlessness, but it is working at furious speed, devouring information on recruits, supplies and charter flights and shuttling it to the Kurdistan control room on the second floor. There, surrounded by maps, flow charts, computers, phones and faxes, a half-dozen staff members run the nerve center for the M.S.F. affiliates across Europe and the permanent logistics center in southern France.\nIn the reception area, over the steady din of telex printers and the beeping of fax machines, volunteers stream in, with backpacks and bedrolls. Within 36 hours of M.S.F.'s first public appeal for volunteers, 1,500 calls jammed the phone lines.\nTwo days later, the new recruits arrive in the harsh, craggy mountains of Kurdistan. Here, for the past two weeks, in the remote Turkish border post of Cukurca, Medecins Sans Frontieres has been the sole international relief agency working with the 70,000 Kurdish refugees, battling the diarrhea and dehydration caused by the camp's contaminated water.\nThe air is motionless in the 15-by-18-foot hospital tents, and by mid-morning the sour smell of fever and diarrhea is intense. Reinardt Byl, 29-year-old nurse from Holland, has been here since the beginning. He has tired gray eyes and several days of sandy stubble. \"The first day, we had five dead babies in five minutes,\" he says. \"There were so many people.\" At least 700 Kurds have died over the course of 12 days. Two-thirds of them have been children.\nThe efforts of M.S.F. and other organizations have helped reduce the daily death rate by one-third, but 70 percent of the 2,300 patients a day still suffer from diarrhea. The doctors and nurses are anxiously waiting for results from the foot of the steep rocky slope, where Guy Jacquier, a young engineer, toils in the mud with a team of American soldiers. The Americans arrived a few days ago to hook up the final pipelines for the clean water system he has designed. Cooperative and unassuming, and speaking English with a balmy French lilt, the 27-year-old Jacquier is a hit with the G.I.'s.\n\"It was great to find they already had the system in place and we could just build on it,\" says Sgt. Ken Smith. \"They're better than we are at brainstorming and planning; they've got more experience in this than we do. But we're better at getting the people to get it done.\" Now, with the help of a newly arrived sanitarian from the International Rescue Committee and the 30-man military detachment of engineers and medics, they have just begun to pipe water from nearby springs into several gargantuan inflatable tanks with spigots.\nRelief is written on Jacquier's sun-bronzed face. \"Two days ago, we had nothing,\" he says, playing down his own efforts as he lights a cigarette with his mud-encrusted fingers. \"I feel really better. By the end of this week, we should have the water system in place for all the people.\"\nFurther up the road, a medical epidemiologist from the United States Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta emerges from a tour of the camp, impressed to discover that a French epidemiologist has already done the standard survey of mortality and health status, which he had intended to do.\n\"I remember these guys 12 years ago,\" says Dr. Ronald J. Waldman, marveling at how much M.S.F.'s approach has evolved. \"They'd arrive like medical cowboys, set themselves up and let people come to them. They did pretty wild things, like intricate surgical procedures by their headlights.\"\nBut over the last decade, an increasing number of French volunteers have sought solid public health training in the United States, which has a stronger tradition of public health than France. The emphasis has shifted to the less glamorous but lifesaving activities of sanitation, nutrition and oral rehydration. At M.S.F.'s Epicentre in Paris, modeled after the Centers for Disease Control, it compiles and analyzes health data that are vital to fighting outbreaks in settings such as this.\n ASK ANY OF THE French doctors \"Why the French?\" and you get a shrug, a pout and a gaze of bewilderment. There is no doubt that one source of inspiration for the founders of the movement, a generation raised on Jules Verne and Cyrano de Bergerac, was the spirit of adventure and panache these figures symbolize. Add to that the anticolonial backlash dating from the French wars in Algeria and Indochina and the American sequel in Vietnam. While political activists in the United States tended to turn their attention to poverty at home, their French counterparts found a focus for their commitment in the nascent field of international human rights.\nOver the last 20 years, the French groups have dispatched 20,000 volunteers to 85 countries across the globe. There is no mistaking them for the traditional, bland charity workers or idealist missionaries who sometimes stalk the same territory. I first came across them in 1980, in the sprawling bamboo-and-thatch refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian border. Shaggy-haired and trailed by a curl of acrid Gitane smoke, they cut distinctive figures among the legions of sweltering relief workers who flocked to the malaria-infested area.\nM.S.F. and Medecins du Monde have brought to France a glory and respect that rivals that of the French Foreign Legion. The risks have usually been high, and several volunteers have lost their lives. Scores of others have been detained, kidnapped and taken hostage. Every year, at least a million Frenchmen send contributions to one of the groups -- ordinary people like the car mechanic in Lille who vowed to donate a day's wages to M.S.F. when a customer, Dr. Marie-Bertille DeHouk, told him she was about to spend a month in Kurdistan. Schoolchildren have flash cards and coloring books featuring the French doctors, and French television has broadcast a popular six-part series inspired by the movement.\nDr. Jonathan Mann of the Harvard School of Public Health, the former director of the World Health Organization's AIDS program, recently joined Medecins du Monde as president of its new American affiliate. \"The concept of bearing witness is not a very developed one in American health training,\" he says. But Mann is convinced that the movement will take hold in America: the French groups address a need \"specific to our time . . . not met by some of the traditional humanitarian organizations.\" \nIn the wake of this year's unending calamities, there has been renewed discussion of the need for an international rapid deployment force that can kick down doors to help victims of disasters. And if the breathless momentum of the French doctors is any sign, the call to action will resonate with young volunteers as it has for Medecins du Monde's Patrick Aeberhard: \"There's something unforgettable about the look in the eyes of people who feel you have not abandoned them.\""}, {"text": "Project Tenants See Island Of Safety Washing Away\n1991-02-04T05:00:00.000Z\nHerman Everett bounded down the stairs, his grandmother's voice filling the graffiti-smeared hallway behind him. \"Be safe,\" she called. \"Be safe.\"\nIn Mr. Everett's neighborhood these days, people don't usually say, \"See you later\" or \"Have a nice day.\" They say, \"Be safe.\"\nMr. Everett's neighborhood is the Martin Luther King Jr. Towers, a sprawling public housing project that rises from the faded Harlem checkerboard of tenements lived-in, tenements abandoned and lots now vacant but for the weeds and the rats. Trouble rings the world beyond his door like a tightening noose. Dangerous Status Symbol\nA few days after Thanksgiving, as they walked through King Towers to a store out on Lenox Avenue, the 19-year-old Mr. Everett and two boyhood friends were attacked by an armed mugger who was after Mr. Everett's black shearling coat -- the current dangerous-to-wear status symbol on the city's fast and hard streets.\nOnly Mr. Everett escaped unharmed. One of his friends, 18-year-old Desmond Lawrence, was wounded in the shoulder. The other, Bernard Richardson, a quiet young man of 20 with a wisp of a goatee, was shot in the back and killed.\nMr. Richardson lived and died a child of King Towers, neither the best nor the worst of the 324 public housing projects that have traditionally been islands of stability in New York's roughest areas, safety nets of shelter for the working poor. His father is a maintenance man, his mother a nurse's aide. Mr. Richardson himself worked in the print shop of a Wall Street insurance company.\nAnd with Mr. Everett and their friends, he dreamed -- of cars, college and, especially, escape. But if the projects are still a foothold toward the middle class -- if that part of the American dream is still possible in New York -- his death is testimony that the climb has grown longer and harder, as neighborhoods like King Towers begin to buckle under the surrounding poverty, homelessness and crime. The midtown skyline rising in the distance down Lenox Avenue might as well be another country.\n\"Bernard died right here in his own project,\" Mr. Everett said some weeks after the killing. \"You're not safe anywhere. If you're not safe where you live at, where are you safe?\"\nMr. Richardson had spent his entire life in the project. He still lived in his parents' apartment, with one of his two sisters and her small daughter.\nTall and powerfully built, Mr. Richardson was a devoted basketball player, and he looked it. But by all accounts, he was just beginning to grow up into the man he had already become; he had a gentleness slightly out of step with the streets.\n\"He could crush you with his hands, but he never had nothing to do with violence,\" said Michael Sagginario, Mr. Richardson's boss at the print shop since his junior year at Brandeis High School.\nIf anything, his friend Desmond Lawrence said, he was a bit of a homebody, often too busy or tired from work and school to spend much time with his friends. \"He'd either be upstairs in the house or at work,\" Mr. Lawrence said. \"I liked that. It showed responsibility.\"\nSince graduating, though, Mr. Richardson had been breaking out some, tentatively shedding his shyness with women, hanging out on the corner of 115th Street and Lenox Avenue. One-fifteenth and Lenox, just beyond the fringe of King Towers, is a popular spot. Bored teen-agers with little to do gather there to flirt, show off new clothes and \"snap on\" -- that is, tease -- one another. Some young people also gather there to sell drugs. 'Risk Himself for Others'\nAnd where there are drugs, there are bound to be guns. Mr. Everett recalled a party a week before the shooting: When somebody pulled out a pistol, Mr. Richardson quickly grabbed a girl, dragged her to the floor and shielded her from harm.\n\"He'd risk himself for others,\" Mr. Everett said. \"This is a kid who deserves not to be forgotten,\" said his boss, Mr. Sagginario, who remembers how proud Mr. Richardson was of a small patch of white in his beard. He thought it made him look older.\n\"I said, 'Let's shave it off,' \" Mr. Sagginario said. \"He said, 'No. That's my trademark.' But the undertaker shaved it off. He took off his glasses, too. Bernard loved those glasses.\"\nAnother memory: When Mr. Richardson was in high school, he was confronted by two teen-agers who demanded his coat. Instead of fighting, he surrendered the coat and walked home in the snow.\nFor months before he died, Mr. Richardson's parents had been thinking about moving the family back down South. Mr. Richardson did not want to go; he loved the city.\nOne week after Thanksgiving, Bernie and Lula Richardson took their son home to South Carolina and buried him there. The Project Safety Behind The Locks\nKing Towers hasn't always been King Towers. When it opened in 1951, the project was called the Foster Houses, after Stephen Foster, the pre-Civil War songwriter whose works -- \"My Old Kentucky Home,\" \"Massa's in de Cold Ground\" and \"Old Black Joe\" -- were popularized by minstrel groups in blackface. But shortly after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, the residents demanded the name change, to honor the fallen civil rights leader and better reflect the project's population, which is, and has always been, predominantly black.\nKing Towers is the size of a small town -- population 3,600 or so -- fit into the three city blocks framed by Fifth and Lenox Avenues and 112th and 115th Streets. The grounds, worn but still not worn out, are a landscape of trees, grass and playgrounds insulated from the streets by 10 rust-colored buildings that rise 13 and 14 stories into the Harlem sky.\nIn the scarred annals of public housing in America, King Towers -- like many of the New York City Housing Authority's projects -- must be considered a measured success. King Towers is poor, but it is not one of those devastated places that have become the social scientists' standards of public-housing failure. Working-Class Residents\nAt King Towers, 30.4 percent of the families receive some form of welfare. For the most part, the people of King Towers are working men and women living ordinary lives despite the nightmare raging outside their doors. They are the New Yorkers who catch the early bus to work: the maintenance men, cleaning women and nurse's aides. They are the short-order cooks and low-level clerks. They wash the clothes and empty the bedpans.\nAfter work, they rush home, a series of locks clicking behind them. Rarely are they caught on the street when darkness falls. Some even plot trips to the store as though mapping a route through a minefield.\n\"If you're going to ride the elevators alone at night,\" said Crystal Glover, a 31-year-old lifelong resident of the project, \"you better go with Jesus.\"\nLena Everett, Herman Everett's grandmother, has lived in King Towers for two generations and more. She was a young mother and wife when she moved in. She is a great-grandmother and widow now. 150,000 Are Waiting\nPublic housing was built for families like the Everetts. Today, there are 150,000 of them on the Housing Authority's waiting list. The decent, affordable apartments offered an alternative to the crumbling Harlem tenements. For many tenants, moving to the projects meant having a regular source of hot water for the first time; for the upwardly mobile, it also meant a chance to save for a house of one's own.\n\"This was my first real apartment,\" Mrs. Everett said the other day, standing over a steaming pan of corn bread.\nMrs. Everett and her husband, Fred, raised four children and a grandson in King Towers. She worked in a small factory, making clocks. Her husband worked at a laundry for more than 30 years before he suffered a fatal heart attack while riding a bus to work in 1982; he was 55. Money was always scarce, she said, hands resting on her hips, but \"nowhere will you find a time when we were on welfare.\"\n\"Don't get me wrong; I'm not knocking it,\" she said. \"Welfare helps a lot of people in need. It's just not for me. But we got by. I think I must have a guardian angel somewhere.\"\nShe had never thought of living anywhere else -- until recently.\n\"The streets around here have gone crazy,\" she said. \"There are so many guns around and now they're killing for fun.\" The Statistics The Outside Is Worse\nIn the cold, statistical light of day, life is still easier and safer inside King Towers than out.\n\"The tenants are more stable, even the ones on welfare,\" said Dr. Colin McCord, a Harlem Hospital physician who collaborated on a recent study of mortality in central Harlem. \"It's a little-known fact that in New York City, public housing has been a great success.\"\nIn central Harlem as a whole, black men on average die earlier than any other group of New Yorkers, according to Dr. McCord's study. In fact, death comes earlier for men in central Harlem than in Bangladesh.\nThis bleak picture, though, is less bleak in the projects. In central Harlem, the doctors found, the overall death rate is 23.1 per 1,000; in Harlem's public housing it is 13.9. In central Harlem, the rate of drug-related deaths is 42.1 per 100,000; in the projects, it is 14.2.\nCrime rates are lower, too, In 1989, according to the Housing Authority, there were 56.1 major crimes per 1,000 people in King Towers, compared to 108.5 over all in the 28th Precinct in central Harlem.\nBut the projects are being squeezed from without.\n\"The neighborhoods around them have declined dramatically in the last few years,\" said William Kornblum, a professor at the City University Graduate Center who has been studying King Towers and three other Harlem housing projects for more than a year. \"The proliferation of guns in the community, especially outside the projects, has been so rapid over the last few years that it has created a situation that can only be called an emergency.\"\nThe chairwoman of the city's Housing Authority, Laura D. Blackburne, said that while buildings around the projects may be deteriorating, \"we are not. We are maintaining our properties like a responsible landlord.\"\n\"What's wrong with King Towers,\" said Mr. Kornblum, \"has to do with the decline of the social environment of the city and the society. There has been an enormous erosion of opportunities for people who are at the lower end of the scale. We have faltered in our commitment to create communities where everybody gets a share of the good life.\"\nOne result has been to turn young men into targets, mother love into despair and hope into skepticism.\nSkepticism was running deep at the December meeting of the King Towers tenant association when a husky Housing Police lieutenant, John Odermatt, rolled up his sleeves and rose to speak.\nHe said that crime -- burglary, assault, drug activity -- was actually down in the development, that statistically \"things are nowhere near as bad as a lot of people think.\"\nWhen he had finished, Ruby Kitchen, the president of the tenant association, loudly cleared her throat.\n\"Excuse me,\" she said. \"You know why your statistics are down? People aren't reporting crime. They're afraid. Nothing's changed.\"\nEven the mailboxes seem dangerous.\nThe development is getting new, bigger mailboxes, and Mrs. Kitchen does not like them because they jut out into the building lobbies, providing a perfect hiding space for a child playing a game or a mugger waiting for a \"vic.\"\n\"Somebody could hide behind it and shoot you, stab you or whatever,\" she said. \"I was trained before how to come into the hallways, and now I have to learn another way.\" 'He Was a Good Kid'\nLieut. Kenneth Lindahl of the 28th Precinct has been in and out of King Towers since Mr. Richardson's death, searching for his killer.\n\"He was a good kid,\" the lieutenant said. \"He came from a good home. Decent parents.\"\nAs he spoke, the lieutenant tiptoed through the debris scattered over a muddy vacant lot across the street from King Towers. He had another murder to investigate.\nLying at the foot of a spindly tree in a valley of abandoned buildings was a dead woman, her face battered and bloody. The woman, in her 30's, might have been dumped in the lot the night before. She had no identification or shoes.\nA middle-aged woman approached the lieutenant's partner, Detective Joseph Rendine, and asked, \"Can I see her? I haven't seen my daughter in six months. That might be her.\"\nThe detective showed her a snapshot of the dead woman and the mother walked away, relieved until the next body shows up.\nSo far, the police are not that much closer to solving the Richardson case, even though there were at least a half-dozen people standing nearby when he was shot.\n\"We've had cooperation in the past from the housing area,\" Lieutenant Lindahl said. \"But sometimes people are afraid to come forward initially. It takes time. \" The Killing 'Like My Chest Was On Fire'\nThe sound of gunshots snapped Mrs. Everett awake shortly after 1 A.M. on Nov. 25. She rushed to her kitchen window but then relaxed, thinking to herself, \"Thank God, Herman's in the house.\"\nThen her 25-year-old daughter, Shawn, told her Herman and his friends had gone out to the store.\n\"I felt my heart fall right down to my feet,\" she said. \"I stayed in that window, watching for him until I almost caught the flu.\"\nA couple of hours earlier, Bernard Richardson had knocked on Mrs. Everett's door to visit with her grandson.\n\"Bernard was his usual quiet self,\" she recalled. \"I asked him to have a seat. He smiled gently.\"\nWhen she went to bed, the young men, including Mr. Lawrence and several others, were sprawled on her living-room floor playing video games.\nShortly after midnight, Mr. Richardson said he was hungry and wanted to go to the store across the project on 116th Street and Lenox Avenue.\n\"I said it was too late, but he was hungry,\" Mr. Everett said. \"So we went after we finished playing video basketball.\"\nMr. Richardson slipped on his brown leather jacket. Mr. Everett put on his aunt's expensive black shearling coat.\n\"I told him before not to wear it,\" his aunt said.\"Why? Because it's dangerous.\"\nJust after 1 A.M., the three friends left the apartment and began walking across the project. Mr. Lawrence, the youngest and smallest, wearing a coat that resembled a shearling but was not, was in the middle.\nAs they approached 40 West 115th Street, Mr. Lawrence heard music pouring out of an upstairs window. Then a young man, not much past his teens, stepped away from a group on the street and said, \"Give me your shearlings.\"\nThe three friends ignored him and kept on walking. He did not have a gun in his hand. He was one \"fool\" against three guys, Mr. Lawrence said. He had to be crazy.\nAgain the man demanded the coats.\n\"I looked back, and that's when I saw the gun,\" Mr. Lawrence recalled. \"Then I heard the shot. Then I fell to the ground. It was like a numbness in my arm. It was like my chest was on fire. Then I heard two or three more shots. I thought he was trying to kill me real bad.\"\nThe next shot hit Mr. Richardson in the back. Two more were aimed at Mr. Everett's head but missed.\nAnd when it was over, the killer walked back into the project, leaving the coats.\nThree hours later, a nurse walked into Mr. Lawrence's room at Harlem Hospital and told him his friend was dead.\n\"That put me in a daze,\" Mr. Lawrence said. \"This world is crazy.\" Thoughts of Revenge\nThe other day, Mr. Everett sat in his grandmother's living room, doing homework.\n\"I think the reason he shot was he felt we disrespected him,\" Mr. Everett said. \"Initially, I don't think he wanted to kill us. He just wanted to prove something to us. After he was shooting, I think he felt some sort of power. It felt good to him to be shooting.\n\"I've shot a gun before, on vacation down South. It does give you a sense of power. But I don't see killing anyone for no reason, especially now. I know how it feels to lose someone. I can't see myself causing somebody else that kind of pain.\n\"I know it's not healthy, but I want revenge,\" he said. \"But I know there'd be a big chance that I'd get caught and go to jail. My future would be ruined. And thinking about my future is basically the only thing keeping me sane.\"\nSince the slaying, Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Everett say, they have tried to concentrate on their futures. Both are taking accounting classes at night. Mr. Lawrence dreams of becoming a rap music producer or a writer. \"I haven't made up my mind yet,\" he said.\nFor years, Mr. Everett wanted to become a defense lawyer. Now he is confused.\n\"I think I want to be a prosecutor,\" he said. \"I want to get some of these criminals off the street. But I also know that there are a lot of innocent people in jail.\n\"As far as the criminal-justice system is concerned, I don't have much faith in it. Around here, people could be shooting for five minutes and the cops don't come. The cops only come in to pick up the pieces. Downtown doesn't seem to care about us.\n\"But it's like I feel very careless about my life. It's like I don't have a fear of dying no more.\" A Lone Voice\nTwo nights after the shooting, an old woman, her face slack with grief, lingered on the steps of the King Towers community center. She watched a group of boys playing basketball, puffs of breath hanging in the cold night air like ghosts.\n\"Did you hear?\" she said, almost to herself, \"we lost another one of our young men the other night.\"\nShe turned up her collar and began walking away, the thump of the bouncing ball echoing from the court.\n\"Be careful, honey,\" she called over her shoulder. \"Our young men are dropping like flies and folks don't seem to care.\" Next: One young woman's struggle."}, {"text": "The Art That We Live In\n1991-12-29T05:00:00.000Z\nLOUIS I.

Kahn\" by Jan Hochstim could be misconstrued as covering \nall \nKahn's drawings, when in fact it contains none of the most copious and most important of these, which are, of course, those done in the process of his design. Instead, its province is all the known extraprofessional sketches and paintings, with a complete catalogue and commentary. The images include those done in life class, on vacations, during leisure time (including portraits of himself and others) and, especially valuable, a complete record of known drawings made during three European trips when the study of monuments was his special mission. It displays Kahn's competence in a range of techniques that appear little or not at all in his architectural drawings. The extracurricular sketches cease with the European trip of 1955, after which Kahn was too busy with architecture to continue.\nFinally, Alessandra Latour's \"Louis I. Kahn: Writings, Lectures, Interviews\" provides a chronological anthology of Kahn's utterances in talks with students, interviews, speeches and essays that cover virtually all that were previously published, but does not include unpublished papers and tapes. (Some of those appear in Richard Saul Wurman's important anthology of 1986.) Together, these provide the best available sources for this material, although both fail to make clear exactly what portion of the total they contain.\nKahn's professional career began in the aura of architectural splendor promised in the monumental imagery and elaborate, formal, hierarchical planning sanctioned by the Beaux-Arts academic standards that flourished at the University of Pennsylvania's school of architecture during the 1920's and 30's under the aegis of the Parisian emigre Paul Cret. Kahn graduated in 1926, at a time when architectural grandeur seemed both appropriate and affordable. Then came the sudden plummet to the Great Depression, just when he was abandoning Beaux-Arts design to embrace the austerities of modern architecture.\nScanty work on housing projects, and dreams about the good community that could come from the social idealism of the time, combined with his conversion to modernism to evoke in Kahn a new respect for spareness, the essence of things and, at the deepest level, spiritual asceticism. It also imbued him with a feeling for the civic dimension of architecture. No American architect of his stature in his generation was less involved with commercial commissions. And despite some seminal early designs for houses, not many were realized. Rather it is public buildings that predominate. Already the polarities that characterize his achievement were in play: the splendor of monuments opposed to the bare bones of essentials. \nAfter 1945, postwar euphoria encouraged architectural visions for \"building the new society\" -- including long-deferred civic, institutional and religious buildings. For these the reigning formal and theoretical principles of modern architecture seemed inadequate, apart perhaps from the success of a simplified cubism in the best New Deal public works. Four immediate aspects of this postwar discussion on monumentality affected Kahn, to which Mr. Brownlee and Mr. De Long allude but which they insufficiently pursue.\nFirst, those who were most enamored of high technology -- or at least its look -- imagined \"mega structures\" as the proper solution for future urbanism. The most ambitious of these envisioned gigantic citadels erected on heroic truss systems combining spaces for shopping, work, living and recreation. Their elevated decks would be penetrated by monorails, spiraled with ramps for parking and crisscrossed with escalators. Others took the form of extended ribbon buildings incorporating roadways. In a series of plans through the 1950's for the center of Philadelphia, Kahn himself indulged in ideas of such megastructures.\nToward the beginning of the decade he concentrated on looming, multipurpose cylindrical elements linked to peripheral expressways. The lower levels would provide parking, then (presumably) some floors for offices and shopping, all topped by plazas circled by the further rise of the wall for more shops and offices, plus apartments, situated in the crust of the cylinder. These were to have been spaced around the grid of downtown streets, some of which would be converted to walkways. The remainder of the city would be freed of much traffic and centered on a pedestrian \"forum\" where the city's institutions would be clustered in buildings of various shapes, including the scratchy indication of a tower based on Buckminster Fuller's geodesic triangulation. Later versions add megaribbon building-and-highway structures (viaduct structures, Kahn called them), although these did not have the afterlife the cylinders had in his later buildings.\nBUT even as Kahn devised his megastructural cylinders for Philadelphia, he justified them by allusions to an elemental prototype from the past: the towers around a fortified medieval city like Carcassonne in southern France. In the elemental grandeur of the shape and positioning of his cylinders, Kahn's analogy was more than frivolous. Like their precedents, they would protect the center city against forces that threatened to destroy it.\nIn the debate on monumentality, the megastruc tural approach did not go unchallenged. Other architects preferred to concentrate on more ordinary buildings, done in the sculptural manner of Le Corbusier's late work in rough-surfaced (\nbrut\n) reinforced concrete. They opposed grandiose technology by an appeal to the archaic. Most familiar is Le Corbusier's chapel at Ronchamp (1950-55) in eastern France, with its heavy, tentlike sag of the roof suspended (or so it appears) between tilted wall planes and hollow towers like silos that rise above it. Through openings toward the tops, the towers bring natural light to the enclosed interior as a luminous mystery. To an enthralled younger generation, such sculptural form demonstrated how modern architecture might become monumental by reversing its traditional preferences for thin, machined surfaces.\nSome architects accordingly puffed concrete into bloated forms, as though monumentality consisted of no more than sheer bulk and aggressive materiality. By 1955 (in a magazine article that became a book), the English critic and historian Reyner Banham had bundled a group of such architects into the \"New Brutal ists.\" Kahn was included for his newly completed extension to the Yale University Art Gallery (1951-53), his first building to win wide recognition. Yet Kahn's approach to what was to become his favorite material was refined rather than brutal. \"Concrete wants to become marble,\" he said. His treatment was also refined by the incisiveness with which the elemental geometry defined shape and inscribed space, as well as in the precision with which the building components came together: \"I feel that the beginning of ornament comes with the joint.\"\nA third approach to monumentality at the time was heroic engineering, with prominence given to the work of engineers who had devised new structural approaches for the spanning of large spaces in reinforced concrete. The work of Robert Maillart, Pier Luigi Nervi, Eduardo Torroja and Felix Candela, in Switzerland, Italy, Spain and Mexico respectively, began to be widely discovered by architects and the general public from a flurry of articles and books that appeared on their achievement around 1950. Working individually in their own ways, on their own problems, they collectively spanned with their designs the whole of the modern movement -- \"modern\" but outside the \"movement.\" Kahn was attracted to the stretch of their arches and vaults, the more so since he believed that each room (each space) should make the mode of its construction explicit. Of his library for Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire (1965-72), for example, he spoke of enclosing a building in reinforced concrete with another in brick. The first material accounted for the wide spans of a central space open to the full height of the building and to the stacks around it; the second material accommodated the reading cubicles around its exterior walls.\nSo Kahn worked out his own destiny among these competing approaches to monumentality: megastructures, sculptural presence, heroic spans and a fourth aspect -- for Kahn the most important of all -- history. Whereas monumentality calls for a sense of tradition, modern architecture, as it asserted itself during the 1920's, had stridently assaulted the past, a requirement at the start of any avant-garde movement if it is to prevail. By the end of the 1940's, however, when the aging modern movement was itself coming under historical scrutiny, the covert role that past buildings had played in its origins became increasingly evident -- especially the role of ancient and early Renaissance classicism. Positive comment on the modern movement had earlier praised it for the destruction of a dead past; now, however, the emphasis shifted to praise the movement for salvaging the past by transforming it. In this new climate, Rudolf Wittkower's \"Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism\" (1949) became unexpectedly popular among architects. They were especially taken by a plate illustrating all of Palladio's villa plans, their elegant but simple geometry variously combined, yet, in Wittkower's opinion, all deriving from a single prototype.\nTHIS came to Kahn's attention while he was working on a series of early houses (all important, and none built). \"The Palladian plan,\" he headed a notebook page while working on these designs, under which heading he attacked the open continuities of \"free-flowing\" space typical in modern architecture and advocated its compartmentalization as rooms, each with its own functions, each a geometrical entity, each ideally revealing its structure and each with its own light, to make \"an assembly of rooms.\"\nMr. Brownlee and Mr. De Long note two other episodes in this connection. Kahn's regular travels as a visiting critic at the Yale School of Architecture during the 1950's deepened his awareness of history by exposing him to the fervor of Vincent Scully, a historian teaching at Yale who was intensely concerned with the relevance of the past for modern architecture. Then, just as Kahn received the commission for the Yale Art Gallery extension, he was also chosen for a three-month stay as Architect in Residence at the American Academy in Rome -- three months only, but he went prepared to make the most of it.\nThis is where Mr. Hochstim's volume is especially valuable for its complete coverage of the extant sketches from his three European trips. The 1950 journey was the climax, both for the quality of the drawings that came from it and for its significance in Kahn's career. The most intense sketches are pastels in broad planes that reduce what he sees to large masses, the spaces they define and the play of light over them. He began in Rome and the northern Italian cities. Then (inverting the order of the actual journey) he moved to Greece and Egypt -- thereby progressively retreating to origins. At this time the Roman ruins that became central to his subsequent buildings confronted him with grandly elemental vaulted forms in concrete and brick, elaborated by plans both clear in organization and ornamental in fit. Their ruination better revealed structure and plan, intensified the drama of light and utterly simplified all forms. For Kahn the experience of studying them must have been the more vivid insofar as it recalled the Beaux-Arts beginnings of his career. If the progression at the start was from monumentality to asceticism, now this was reversed, from asceticism back to monumentality.\nDuring the whole of this long period of preparation the words accumulated -- in talks to students, interviews, speeches and essays -- and continued for the rest of Kahn's life. They were variously marked by aphorism, fable, practical observation and Kahn's soaring vocabulary for such architectural \"essences\" as \"form,\" \"order,\" \"design,\" \"measurable-unmeasurable,\" \"served-servant spaces,\" \"harmony of systems,\" \"light\" and \"silence.\" This is Ms. Latour's province. Had Kahn produced no more than these words, he would be remembered. They comprise a primer of architecture and a paean to it, the meaning of which transcends his own building even as it explains his most impressive designs as these emerged in a creative burst during the two decades before his death in 1974 at the age of 73.\nCONSIDER here, at random, merely the formal and symbolic transformations in two buildings that he wrung from variations on a common compositional theme. Recalling the peripheral towers of medieval castles linked by \"hollow walls\" of rooms to enclose a large central space, he turned to this scheme for the design of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia (designed 1961-72, but never built). To be more precise, Kahn would have maintained that his starting point was not the castle, but rather the essential \"form\" that the synagogue \"wanted to be,\" which happened to fit the transmuted precedent of the castle as the initial stage in its design. Cylindrical towers stake out the corners of a square vestibule entering into an elongated octagonal sanctuary, the corners of which are marked by more towers, with light brought down the hollow cores of most of them from concealed skylights, as in Le Corbusier's chapel at Ronchamp or as in a castle ruin.\nNow vary the theme. In Bangladesh, cylindrical and boxlike towers (which respectively differentiate the hierarchical position of conference rooms and a prayer hall from that of the square offices) coalesce into a tight polygonal cluster to enclose, at the center, the national legislative chamber in Dhaka (1962-83). The towers are without rooftop enclosure now, and they are also opened to the outside by gaping circles and triangles. \"Wrapping ruins around the buildings,\" in Kahn's words, he shades the glazed windows on their inner walls against the blazing environment. Inside this outer palisade is a circumferential corridor rising to the full height of the building, with more giant circular openings through which one glimpses ramps to the upper levels. Inside this, another ring of offices, lighted by interior shafts, surrounds the near-circular polygonal core space for the assembly. It again rises to full height, here to a parasol dome, the symbol of authority on the Indian subcontinent.\nThe dome is not visible from the exterior but only as the interior climax, where it appears suspended within its encasement, its outer perimeter scalloped in light as the ribs of the umbrella taper to points touching the wall. So the abstracted castle motif (which is no longer a castle) is transformed into a multilayered perimeter of spaces around an institutional and ceremonial heart -- here also aligned with a prayer hall -- and all suffused in dramatic and spiritual light.\nThese two examples must suffice for other variations on this scheme, as well as a number of other inventive compositional arrangements to organize diverse \"harmonies of systems\" and \"realms of space.\"\nConcerned with the most expressive aspects of architecture, Kahn located these in the \"essences\" of the architectural experience: in elemental geometry, structure, materials, light, the web of tradition transformed into paradigms of itself and the potential for symbolism embedded in each. Each of these aspects is so inherently architectural, so abstracted yet so physically present, that he has fashioned, in building and words, more than his own legacy. This lover of the potency of the archaic opened a cornucopia to future development. If his involvement with history can be termed post-modern, it also extends and deepens modernism, whereas the historical pastiches of so much of the work that followed him returns architecture to what modernism opposed in the first place."}, {"text": "The Art That We Live In\n1991-12-29T05:00:00.000Z\nLOUIS I.

Through openings toward the tops, the towers bring natural light to the enclosed interior as a luminous mystery. To an enthralled younger generation, such sculptural form demonstrated how modern architecture might become monumental by reversing its traditional preferences for thin, machined surfaces.\nSome architects accordingly puffed concrete into bloated forms, as though monumentality consisted of no more than sheer bulk and aggressive materiality. By 1955 (in a magazine article that became a book), the English critic and historian Reyner Banham had bundled a group of such architects into the \"New Brutal ists.\" Kahn was included for his newly completed extension to the Yale University Art Gallery (1951-53), his first building to win wide recognition. Yet Kahn's approach to what was to become his favorite material was refined rather than brutal. \"Concrete wants to become marble,\" he said. His treatment was also refined by the incisiveness with which the elemental geometry defined shape and inscribed space, as well as in the precision with which the building components came together: \"I feel that the beginning of ornament comes with the joint.\"\nA third approach to monumentality at the time was heroic engineering, with prominence given to the work of engineers who had devised new structural approaches for the spanning of large spaces in reinforced concrete. The work of Robert Maillart, Pier Luigi Nervi, Eduardo Torroja and Felix Candela, in Switzerland, Italy, Spain and Mexico respectively, began to be widely discovered by architects and the general public from a flurry of articles and books that appeared on their achievement around 1950. Working individually in their own ways, on their own problems, they collectively spanned with their designs the whole of the modern movement -- \"modern\" but outside the \"movement.\" Kahn was attracted to the stretch of their arches and vaults, the more so since he believed that each room (each space) should make the mode of its construction explicit. Of his library for Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire (1965-72), for example, he spoke of enclosing a building in reinforced concrete with another in brick. The first material accounted for the wide spans of a central space open to the full height of the building and to the stacks around it; the second material accommodated the reading cubicles around its exterior walls.\nSo Kahn worked out his own destiny among these competing approaches to monumentality: megastructures, sculptural presence, heroic spans and a fourth aspect -- for Kahn the most important of all -- history. Whereas monumentality calls for a sense of tradition, modern architecture, as it asserted itself during the 1920's, had stridently assaulted the past, a requirement at the start of any avant-garde movement if it is to prevail. By the end of the 1940's, however, when the aging modern movement was itself coming under historical scrutiny, the covert role that past buildings had played in its origins became increasingly evident -- especially the role of ancient and early Renaissance classicism. Positive comment on the modern movement had earlier praised it for the destruction of a dead past; now, however, the emphasis shifted to praise the movement for salvaging the past by transforming it. In this new climate, Rudolf Wittkower's \"Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism\" (1949) became unexpectedly popular among architects. They were especially taken by a plate illustrating all of Palladio's villa plans, their elegant but simple geometry variously combined, yet, in Wittkower's opinion, all deriving from a single prototype.\nTHIS came to Kahn's attention while he was working on a series of early houses (all important, and none built). \"The Palladian plan,\" he headed a notebook page while working on these designs, under which heading he attacked the open continuities of \"free-flowing\" space typical in modern architecture and advocated its compartmentalization as rooms, each with its own functions, each a geometrical entity, each ideally revealing its structure and each with its own light, to make \"an assembly of rooms.\"\nMr. Brownlee and Mr. De Long note two other episodes in this connection. Kahn's regular travels as a visiting critic at the Yale School of Architecture during the 1950's deepened his awareness of history by exposing him to the fervor of Vincent Scully, a historian teaching at Yale who was intensely concerned with the relevance of the past for modern architecture. Then, just as Kahn received the commission for the Yale Art Gallery extension, he was also chosen for a three-month stay as Architect in Residence at the American Academy in Rome -- three months only, but he went prepared to make the most of it.\nThis is where Mr. Hochstim's volume is especially valuable for its complete coverage of the extant sketches from his three European trips. The 1950 journey was the climax, both for the quality of the drawings that came from it and for its significance in Kahn's career. The most intense sketches are pastels in broad planes that reduce what he sees to large masses, the spaces they define and the play of light over them. He began in Rome and the northern Italian cities. Then (inverting the order of the actual journey) he moved to Greece and Egypt -- thereby progressively retreating to origins. At this time the Roman ruins that became central to his subsequent buildings confronted him with grandly elemental vaulted forms in concrete and brick, elaborated by plans both clear in organization and ornamental in fit. Their ruination better revealed structure and plan, intensified the drama of light and utterly simplified all forms. For Kahn the experience of studying them must have been the more vivid insofar as it recalled the Beaux-Arts beginnings of his career. If the progression at the start was from monumentality to asceticism, now this was reversed, from asceticism back to monumentality.\nDuring the whole of this long period of preparation the words accumulated -- in talks to students, interviews, speeches and essays -- and continued for the rest of Kahn's life. They were variously marked by aphorism, fable, practical observation and Kahn's soaring vocabulary for such architectural \"essences\" as \"form,\" \"order,\" \"design,\" \"measurable-unmeasurable,\" \"served-servant spaces,\" \"harmony of systems,\" \"light\" and \"silence.\" This is Ms. Latour's province. Had Kahn produced no more than these words, he would be remembered. They comprise a primer of architecture and a paean to it, the meaning of which transcends his own building even as it explains his most impressive designs as these emerged in a creative burst during the two decades before his death in 1974 at the age of 73.\nCONSIDER here, at random, merely the formal and symbolic transformations in two buildings that he wrung from variations on a common compositional theme. Recalling the peripheral towers of medieval castles linked by \"hollow walls\" of rooms to enclose a large central space, he turned to this scheme for the design of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia (designed 1961-72, but never built). To be more precise, Kahn would have maintained that his starting point was not the castle, but rather the essential \"form\" that the synagogue \"wanted to be,\" which happened to fit the transmuted precedent of the castle as the initial stage in its design. Cylindrical towers stake out the corners of a square vestibule entering into an elongated octagonal sanctuary, the corners of which are marked by more towers, with light brought down the hollow cores of most of them from concealed skylights, as in Le Corbusier's chapel at Ronchamp or as in a castle ruin.\nNow vary the theme. In Bangladesh, cylindrical and boxlike towers (which respectively differentiate the hierarchical position of conference rooms and a prayer hall from that of the square offices) coalesce into a tight polygonal cluster to enclose, at the center, the national legislative chamber in Dhaka (1962-83). The towers are without rooftop enclosure now, and they are also opened to the outside by gaping circles and triangles. \"Wrapping ruins around the buildings,\" in Kahn's words, he shades the glazed windows on their inner walls against the blazing environment. Inside this outer palisade is a circumferential corridor rising to the full height of the building, with more giant circular openings through which one glimpses ramps to the upper levels. Inside this, another ring of offices, lighted by interior shafts, surrounds the near-circular polygonal core space for the assembly. It again rises to full height, here to a parasol dome, the symbol of authority on the Indian subcontinent.\nThe dome is not visible from the exterior but only as the interior climax, where it appears suspended within its encasement, its outer perimeter scalloped in light as the ribs of the umbrella taper to points touching the wall. So the abstracted castle motif (which is no longer a castle) is transformed into a multilayered perimeter of spaces around an institutional and ceremonial heart -- here also aligned with a prayer hall -- and all suffused in dramatic and spiritual light.\nThese two examples must suffice for other variations on this scheme, as well as a number of other inventive compositional arrangements to organize diverse \"harmonies of systems\" and \"realms of space.\"\nConcerned with the most expressive aspects of architecture, Kahn located these in the \"essences\" of the architectural experience: in elemental geometry, structure, materials, light, the web of tradition transformed into paradigms of itself and the potential for symbolism embedded in each. Each of these aspects is so inherently architectural, so abstracted yet so physically present, that he has fashioned, in building and words, more than his own legacy. This lover of the potency of the archaic opened a cornucopia to future development. If his involvement with history can be termed post-modern, it also extends and deepens modernism, whereas the historical pastiches of so much of the work that followed him returns architecture to what modernism opposed in the first place."}, {"text": "The Empire Strikes Back\n1991-03-10T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Flying Scud is a 100-year-old pub on Hackney Road in East London, where Nazi air raids inflicted such suffering 50 years ago. Since the beginning of the war in the Persian Gulf, its owner, Graham Warden, has had the place decked out in Union Jack bunting, and he doesn't give a damn if brazen patriotism offends the Muslims from Bangladesh and Pakistan who have displaced most other people like him from the neighborhood.\nThe regulars who come to shoot darts by the doorway include a couple of reservists and even a local named John Major, so Warden claims. For $:2.50 ($5), the 33-year-old publican will make you a \"Scud missile,\" with a chemical warhead of Middle Eastern arrack liquor, vodka and bitter lemon, or a \"Patriot missile,\" with American Jack Daniel's, English gin and grenadine. \"The place has been called the Flying Scud since the 1880's,\" Warden explains. \"It's actually the foam the wind whips up.\"\nAt the Flying Scud there has never been any doubt who would win the gulf war, just as there hasn't been any at Buckingham Palace. Soon after the allied ground offensive started on Feb. 24, Queen Elizabeth II, in a rare televised broadcast from the palace, asked the nation to pray that British success would be as swift as it was certain. In short order, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said \"those of us who have contributed a lot\" to the war effort \"now have a stake\" in the postwar arrangements. In the postwar period, he added, it should be made clear \"that Saddam Hussein was completely a bogus, puffed-up frog of a man insofar as he claimed to be spokesman for the Arab world.\"\nThe British are fond of saying they may not get much else right but they know how and when to go to war and how to keep a stiff upper lip. Where, they ask smugly, were the Germans and the Japanese when the call to duty came? The British seized it almost gratefully, as though it were another chance to relive their finest hour. Without much ado, they sent more than 40,000 troops east of Suez to help 500,000 Yanks liberate Kuwait from Iraq. It was almost like having the empire back, what with Lieut. Gen. Sir Peter Edgar de la Cour de la Billiere, the commander of British forces in the gulf, rattling around like Field Marshal Montgomery in a desert region Lawrence of Arabia knew so well.\nCompared with the American war machine in the gulf, the British contribution hasn't seemed like much, but it has been the biggest British deployment anywhere since World War II and by far the largest European contribution. Supported by a broad consensus of all the major parties in the House of Commons, the Government sent, along with its troops, 11 combatant ships, 12 support vessels, 100 or so attack aircraft, about 60 helicopters, and hundreds of artillery pieces and tanks.\nAs long as the war lasted, Britain was right in the war zone, with American B-52's flying combat missions from the Royal Air Force base in Fairford, about 70 miles west of London. The big planes had been using the base for years, pulling out last year after the cold war ended. The 2,500 people of the small Cotswold town gave a warm welcome-back to the air crews and the 1,000 Air Force medical personnel who came to run a military evacuation hospital for war casualties. The townspeople collected blankets and donated them to the Americans, who flew in from Texas, Mississippi and California unprepared for the cold.\n\"The atmosphere is very much like before the start of the last war,\" Ruth Ritter recalled recently. Ritter is the 65-year-old Mayor of Fairford and widow of a Royal Air Force veteran. \"I was a child then, and all the grown-ups were talking about this awful thing that was going to happen, but it had to take its course and we had to make the best of it. We were all terribly excited and rushed outside to dig tank traps and that sort of thing. Now we come to an adult stage, and we are reliving those serious, whispered conversations of our parents then. The war in the gulf is a terrible thing, but it's got to be done.\"\nThis time, people rushed off, too -- many to donate blood; others to enlist. In London, at the British Army recruiting office on the Strand near Trafalgar Square, Command Sgt. Maj. Les Griffiths sits in a booth behind a vitrine full of tin soldiers that seems to lure as many tourists as prospective volunteers to the sparsely furnished room. As soon as the war began, Griffiths says, about five times as many volunteers as usual began coming in.\n\"There was one 63-year-old ex-soldier who was terminally ill,\" he continues. \"He asked us to send him to the gulf and spare one of the young soldiers.\" The man was gently turned away. The all-volunteer army will take only people who want to make it a life career, and is not upping its national quota of 16,000 male and female volunteers this year, war or no war.\nSocial class lines still run clear in the British Army, where military leadership style hasn't changed much in 50 years and most officers join their regiments by invitation, usually after an interview at one of the elite public schools, not on Trafalgar Square. Sir Peter is a good example of the creme de la creme, a distinguished-looking aristocrat who wears the sand-colored military beret of the Special Air Service commando regiment, Britain's most elite force. A graduate of Harrow and a member of a Huguenot family, he served for 30 years in Britain's colonial wars in Malaya, Oman and the deserts of the Persian Gulf, and in the campaign to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982.\nLast September, the highly decorated general was about to retire to hobbies he listed in Who's Who as \"family, squash, down market apiculture, tennis perhaps, farming, sailing,\" when Margaret Thatcher picked him to lead the British forces under Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf of the United States. It is hard to imagine \"Stormin' Norman\" delivering a line like this one from Sir Peter about Saddam Hussein: \"It is the sort of behavior you'd expect from the rather low-grade, second-hand sort of person that he is.\"\nViolent talk or glorification of violence upsets the British, even if violence and war itself don't. Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, otherwise widely admired, shocked many people in Britain by the way he described what the allies would do to the Iraqi force in Kuwait. \"First,\" Powell said, \"we're going to cut it off, and then we're going to kill it.\" Sir David Craig, an air marshal and chief of the British defense staff, has made it sound more like a pruning operation on a genteel country weekend. \"Our overall aim,\" he said, \"has been to cut the limbs and branches from the Iraqi war machine so that it no longer casts its dark shadow over Kuwait.\"\nThat was also about all he said. British commanders generally don't like telling civilians any more than they need to know about how they run a war. During World War II, they had complete military censorship, and during the Falklands conflict all British correspondents were cooped up at sea, in military vessels, until British troops secured victory ashore. Some of Sir David's subordinates have the impression he would have liked that kind of arrangement in the gulf.\nAlthough British correspondents in Saudi Arabia have been subject to the same pool restrictions as their American counterparts, in Britain a clubby, informal system of deciding what is fit to print or broadcast is in place, backed by British secrecy regulations that allow Ministry of Defense officials to call up any editor and suppress anything they deem a military secret.\nTHE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN have been side by side in the gulf since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait last Aug. 2, when Thatcher, then the Prime Minister, happened to be at President Bush's side in Aspen, Colo. There, in the vacation home of the American Ambassador to London, Henry E. Catto, the two leaders agreed in a two-hour talk that Saddam Hussein's aggression must not be allowed to stand.\nIn the fortress-like American Embassy on Grosvenor Square, Catto -- who will be leaving for Washington this week because Bush wants him to run the United States Information Agency -- mused recently about the nature of the \"special relationship\" between Britain and the United States.\n\"It builds on itself like a coral reef, and the longer it lasts, the sturdier it gets,\" he said. \"Anguished Britons asked me all throughout 1990 why suddenly we seemed to be more involved with Germany than with them. I invariably answered that this was a function of the fact that the most dramatic change happening in the world then was in Germany. Britain was not reuniting; Germany was. And it was natural that the President should be more concerned with German affairs when the situation in Britain was quite serene.\" But, Catto added, \"a couple of high American officials\" had told him: \"It looks like the only people we can really rely on are the Brits.\"\nSince the beginning of the war, Major and Bush have been conferring by telephone every five days or so, even though, according to British officials, Bush is the Commander in Chief, and all the major decisions are his alone. That included decisions on the responses to the Soviet peace initiatives that started shortly before Feb. 15, when Saddam Hussein first acknowledged he would consider a withdrawal from Kuwait, and on the date to begin the allied ground assault.\nBritain's voice, however, may carry further after the war. To prepare the way for peace, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd traveled to the gulf states in early February to elicit ideas on the kind of British and allied presence they would like to have after the war. Senior British diplomats say they do not expect Saudi Arabia and other Arab states to agree to a permanent Western force in the Persian Gulf. \"They'd like to have us just below the horizon,\" one says, \"ready to come in and rescue them if they're threatened again.\" As a former colonial power with extensive knowledge of the region, Britain has expected to play a prominent role in the peace negotiations.\nNot everyone has supported the British involvement in the gulf. Tony Benn, a former viscount and the most visible antiwar leader in the House of Commons, not only derides this idea but dismisses the \"special relationship\" with the United States as an opiate of the British ruling classes. \"It became clear to the United States some time ago that Saddam Hussein had gotten too big for his britches and they were going to cut him down to size,\" he says. \"With the decline of the Soviet Union, the United States has seized this opportunity to reimpose control, and the British are piggybacking their way back. It is really the old imperial role.\"\nThere are also those who contend that, as with the Falklands war, the British Government has been distracting its people from domestic woes with prospects of a razzle-dazzle military victory in the gulf. In some ways, wartime London 1991 is a surreal reprise of the city in \"the last war.\" Then, Britain had a sagging economy and daily life was reduced to the barest necessities. Today, the economy is in a free fall, driven into a deep recession by anti-inflationary policies the Government can't relax too quickly. Jobs are disappearing at the rate of about 3,000 a day. Unemployment rose to 6.6 percent at the end of January, with the largest monthly increase in five years, and inflation, while on the way down, is still 9 percent, the highest in Western Europe outside of Portugal and Greece. To keep inflation under control, the Government has kept interest rates painfully high, inflicting pain and hardship on hundreds of thousands of homeowners with variable-rate mortgages. As if all this isn't bad enough, hotels and department stores have been almost deserted as business travelers and foreign tourists, terrified of terrorism, have stayed at home.\nTHE COMPOSITION OF JOHN MAJOR'S War Cabinet tells a great deal about this particular war. There are the usual suspects: Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd; Defense Secretary Tom King; the Chief of the Defense Staff, Sir David Craig; the Prime Minister's foreign policy and security adviser, Sir Percy Cradock, and Thatcher's longtime private secretary, Sir Charles Powell (who is serving Major until the gulf crisis is over). But the group also includes the Attorney General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, for advice on international law, and Energy Secretary John Wakeham, who is also the Government's publicity co-ordinator.\nThe War Cabinet, in other words, was running the war effort and worrying about its portrayal in the news media. It had plenty to worry about after the American precision bombing, on Feb. 13, of a Baghdad target the Pentagon described as a military command bunker. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians died in that attack, and the BBC and the Independent Television Network showed images of burnt bodies and distraught relatives, with commentators hinting not-so-subtly that a horrible mistake had been made.\nMajor's Government regretted the deaths but not the choice of target. The jingoistic British tabloid press had no regrets. The Sun, which ran the headline \"GOTCHA!,\" when 368 Argentine sailors were killed on the cruiser General Belgrano during the Falklands war, announced this time: \"Saddam Hussein tried to trick the world yesterday by saying hundreds of women and children died in a bomb attack on an 'air raid shelter.' He cunningly arranged TV scenes designed to shock and appall. But the victims were sent to their deaths by the Iraqi leader himself.\"\nWar is hell, most of the British people seemed to feel, and if Saddam Hussein didn't want his people to get hurt in a war, he should have pulled out of Kuwait earlier. According to polls taken a month after the bombs started to fall on Iraq, almost 90 percent of the British people supported the war fully, a figure that is not expected to fall since British casualties have been amazingly light. The day of the cease-fire, John Major told the House of Commons that 16 had been killed (9 by so-called friendly fire), 7 were seriously injured and 12 airmen were missing.\nMillions of Britons remember that their country went to war nearly 52 years ago against a rapacious dictator because he had invaded a defenseless, faraway country. Many have taken at face value their Government's reason for getting involved in the gulf conflict: to assert the principles of a new world order violated by Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait.\nThis has also been broadly accepted across party lines in the House of Commons. Labor's leader, Neil Kinnock, has not let continuing pressure from his party's back-bench radicals, or his own anxieties about a general election after the war, keep him from supporting the war effort and reaffirming that support when the ground offensive began.\nAfter the beginning of the air bombing campaign in January, antiwar protesters held rallies in London almost every weekend, but none of them came close to the size of the 150,000-strong peace demonstration in Bonn at the end of January. The long stretch of bitter cold weather that began when the war did might have something to do with it.\nBritish intellectuals have been remarkably quiet about the war, almost as if those who object to it feel bullied into silence and those who support it feel too awkward to say so. Robert Giddings, a writer who teaches at Bournemouth Polytechnic, says he thinks part of the reason is that leftists opposed to the war feel betrayed by Kinnock, who has suppressed dissent by his back-benchers, forcing five of his shadow cabinet ministers to resign.\nNew Statesman & Society, the small left-wing weekly, has not been mincing words in condemning the war, and there have been critical editorials and articles in The Guardian and The Independent newspapers. The actress Vanessa Redgrave, who has political aspirations, has deplored, evenhandedly she insists, the bombing of Iraqis by the allies, the bombing of Israelis by the Iraqis and the continuing repression of Palestinians on the West Bank.\nIn one of the crowded, noisy strangers' rooms -- cafeterias -- at the House of Commons, Tony Benn, the radical Labor Member of Parliament, brews a pot of tea and tries to explain why people like him seem to be in such a minority these days.\n\"Britain is a feudal society in which the powers of the crown have been undiluted since the 17th century, but are now exercised by the Prime Minister instead of the monarch,\" he says. \"The Prime Minister has unfettered royal powers which can be exercised in times of war. We are a nation of cap-doffers, and people defer to that kind of power without questioning it. And don't forget, the BBC is a state radio, and it suppresses the considerable public opposition to the war. I've had 8,000 letters of support for my position, and only 200 against.\"\nAlthough little remarked on in Britain, powerful currents of submerged ethnic and racial hostility have also fanned jingoistic flames. \"True Brits,\" as The Sun calls them, were baffled and irritated in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death sentence on the writer Salman Rushdie, a sentence that found widespread support among British Muslims. Now Britons could show what they thought by dropping bombs on Saddam Hussein -- never mind that Syria, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, their allies, are also Arab, Muslim countries.\nThe Muslim population -- about one million people in a country of 57.5 million -- is one segment of British society that did not even exist during the last war, and its attitudes toward this one have been decidedly uneasy. Some worship at the golden-domed President Saddam Hussein Mosque in Birmingham, built before the war with the help of a $3.2 million donation from the Iraqi leader, who insisted that the place bear his name. There have been firebomb attacks on at least three mosques around the country, but not there, according to a man who answered the telephone one recent Friday. \"We are all British Muslims,\" says Hazratmia Kazi, president of the mosque. \"Our first allegiance is to our Government.\"\nAlmost all British Muslims, in Birmingham and elsewhere, are Asians, not Arabs, but the community is more complex and divided than it appears. Some factions are pro-Saudi; others, pro-Iranian. And attitudes about the war range from outright opposition to support but tending mostly to uneasy silence. Some employers and municipal authorities in places like Bradford, with a heavy Muslim concentration, urged their staff not to wear the Union Jack on their sleeves -- as The Sun suggested all patriotic Brits do as a sign of support for the war -- to avoid offending Muslim colleagues opposed to the British presence in the gulf.\nIn January, the authorities rounded up 52 Arabs living in Britain, putting 34 of them, because of their military status, in a prisoner-of-war camp near Salisbury and placing others in prisons in Yorkshire and London. In all, according to the Home Office, 176 people were served with deportation notices between Aug. 2 and late February, including 164 Iraqi citizens. About 80 have left voluntarily. Besides those in the P.O.W. camp, 44 are being held in civilian jails or reporting regularly to police officers; 16 have won their appeals for freedom.\nOne of those detained in January was a 31-year-old Palestinian who has lived as an orphan in Britain since 1977 and whose sole offense is that he is a nephew of Abu Nidal, the terrorist, whom he said he had met once at a family gathering in 1976. Another was Abbas Cheblak, a 47-year-old Palestinian writer who has lived in London for 16 years and has a wife and two young children. He is also an executive member of the Arab Human Rights Committee, a group that has campaigned against Saddam Hussein.\nBritain doesn't have a written Constitution or a Bill of Rights, and Cheblak and others like him could only look to the Government's own review procedures for protection. British civil courts would claim no jurisdiction. With few exceptions, leaders of British public opinion do not see the detention of Arab residents as a constitutional issue.\nCheblak hired a solicitor and his wife got a Conservative M.P., Sir Dennis Walters, to take up his case. Sir Dennis said he had agreed because the Government had never offered a reason for Cheblak's detention and he felt that in fairness it should have. The Government's advisory panel lifted the expulsion order and set Cheblak free, but never told him why. It let stand the order against Abu Nidal's nephew, whose identity has been kept secret by court order, but allowed him to return to his home in South London -- so that he can apply for asylum in the same country that wants to expel him in the first place.\nFor officials at 10 Downing Street, these are just two more unavoidable casualties of war. \"There are people actually trying to blow us up, you know,\" one of them says, referring to the recent terrorist attacks by the Irish Republican Army.\nEVEN BEFORE THE I.R.A. bombings in London, Americans stopped coming to Britain because of the gulf war. And there has been considerable British griping about the lack of American civilian nerve, as though Americans were the only ones not going anyplace.\n\"I have to relate a shameful example of apparent mass cowardice -- I cannot, in conscience, employ a less emotive word -- on the part of our American cousins,\" Stephen Wood wrote to The Spectator the other day, relating his frustration in trying to arrange a tour of Scotland next September by the American Society of Arms Collectors. \"I discovered not only that the society's governing council had withdrawn its official backing to the tour but also that, of the original 200 people booked to attend, 112 had canceled,\" he wrote in \"amazement, disbelief and disgust.\"\nOne can just imagine what Thatcher would have said about such pusillanimity. Actually, a surprising number of British Government officials have said privately they are relieved she hasn't been leading the British war effort. She would have been provocative and bellicose, they say, much as she was in the Falklands war. And unlike Major, she wouldn't have been content to cash in the opposition Labor Party's support for the war at face value -- she would have probed its divisions and forced its large, repressed antiwar faction out into the open. Judging by the opinion polls, the British people like their new leader's more laid-back style, rating him as the most popular Prime Minister since Winston Churchill, who led the country in \"the last war.\"\nLike George Bush, John Major wanted to avoid heavy British casualties in gigantic tank and infantry battles in the desert, and the Government supported a continuation of the air bombing campaign with that aim in mind. Insisting on eliminating Saddam Hussein before ending the war would also have endangered the broad political consensus in support of it, and Major has not pushed the point. Again, like Bush, he has hinted that with the dictator in place, the United Nations mandate to restore peace and stability to the gulf region can hardly be fulfilled.\n\"He is a man without pity and, whatever his fate may be, I, for one, will not weep for him,\" Major said in the House of Commons on Jan. 22, soon after seven battered allied airmen, two British fliers among them, were displayed on Iraqi television, with Saddam Hussein declaring that the prisoners would be deployed as human shields at strategic sites. Major's statement was only one of many British hints that Iraqis would be the best judges of the Iraqi dictator's fate after the fighting stops.\nAnd what of the fate of the P.M. himself after peace has been declared? After a clear and quick victory, Major could risk a general election as early as May or June rather than wait for July 1992, when the writ of the current Parliament runs out. If he should fail in the polls, it would not be the first British victory on the battlefield that evaporated during peacetime -- as Churchill, turned out by the voters in his hour of triumph in 1945, would be the first to tell his successors."}]
