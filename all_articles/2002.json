[{"text": "Flooding Elbe Batters Towns Along Its Path\n2002-08-18T05:00:00.000Z\nAs dams broke upriver in Bitterfeld and M\u00fchlberg, inundating the towns, the people of Dessau were piling sandbags today on an earthwork dam -- but it was already leaking.\nThe water level in Dresden finally began to drop from its record depth of 30.84 feet, but only by less than half an inch. But other less notable German towns were bracing for what is being called ''the battle against the water,'' and 30,000 people living along the Elbe and its bloated tributaries have been evacuated so far.\nEmergency workers from Hesse -- young people who chose to do nonmilitary duty when drafted -- were doing a lot of the heavy work, alongside local teenagers and housewives. They labored at a U-shaped bend of the Elbe, where the water comes closest to this town, famous for the Bauhaus, the modern design school founded by Walter Gropius.\nTwo of the airy, geometric houses Gropius built for himself and other professors in 1926 are not far away. Nor is the water.\nManuel Fehl, 21, got here with the emergency team on Thursday night and worked for 36 straight hours, before getting some sleep last night on a school floor. ''It's important for the country,'' he said, with a trace of embarrassment. ''When you see the commitment of the local people, it's impressive.''\nBut Martina R\u00f6mpp, who owns 10 clothing shops in the area, is not optimistic that the river can be held. ''We live close by, where the warehouse is, and if the dam breaks we'll lose everything,'' she said, holding her two sons, 4 and 2.\n''No one really tells us anything about when the water will come,'' she said, but she has her car packed, ready to evacuate. ''With two kids, it will be too dangerous to stay,'' with no electricity, the water so high and the nearby sewage plant in danger. ''If something breaks here,'' she said, the Elbe combining with the smaller Mulde River, ''it's all over Dessau.''\nMs. R\u00f6mpp, 34, is one of the many Germans who believe that the flood is a result of environmental changes stemming from greenhouse gases. ''It's our new war,'' she said. ''We will have more of these floods from the heating of the planet.''\nThe German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, in a tough battle for re-election, said proudly today that his government, in coalition with the environmentally friendly Greens, had reduced Germany's output of carbon dioxide by half in the last four years. Unfortunately for his chances, he has not been so successful in reducing unemployment.\nBut politics were far from the mind of Peter H\u00e4selbarth, 45, who stood with his son, Jens, 19, and his badger, Sigi, 3, on his flooded street in Bitterfeld, 30 miles south of Dessau on the Mulde River.\nThe water moved down Friedenstrasse, the main street, about 10 yards every 15 minutes, soaking into basements and yards. Rescue workers were using boats to move around the town.\nThe town was once considered the environmental black hole of East Germany, a chemical center where a yellow haze hovered endlessly. Much has been done to clean it up, but still the water on Friedenstrasse had an oily stink, and emergency workers were toiling to protect the chemical plants in the town from the Mulde.\nMr. H\u00e4selbarth was evacuated late Thursday night, leaving some of his other animals behind, including a pond full of fish. ''We were told we were in danger but it was too early,'' he said, so he returned today to gather more belongings, bring them up to the roof and feed the other animals. As for his fish, he said, ''maybe we'll find them in the garden when we come back again.'' But that is not likely to be for some time.\nAn estimated 12 Germans have died in the flooding, along with 13 Czechs and about 60 people in Austria and Russia. But by comparison, more than 900 people died in the same period from seasonal floods in India and Bangladesh.\nElsewhere upriver, workers gave up on the pretty town of M\u00fchlberg, which was inundated when waters of the Elbe rose over a 33-foot dam. Even the local flood emergency committee had to be evacuated to higher ground in Torgau, where the Soviet Army met the American Army at the Elbe on April 25, 1945. More than 8,000 people were evacuated from around Torgau.\nAlso upriver, an important railway bridge at Riesa broke, cutting train traffic between Berlin and Leipzig. Dresden, however, appeared to have emerged without severe damage to its cultural treasures, like the Zwinger Palace and the Semper Opera, where the basements and courtyards flooded. Further downriver, residents in Magdeburg, the next major city on the Elbe's path to the North Sea, were advised to prepare to leave.\nAfter the reunification of Germany, millions were spent rebuilding the eastern parts of the country. Mr. Schr\u00f6der said the rebuilding now would have to begin again.\nMr. Schr\u00f6der has already promised hundreds of millions of euros in aid to affected German towns; Edmund Stoiber, his political opponent, called today for a fund of 2 billion euros, nearly $2 billion. In the meantime, the Swiss donated 500,000 sacks of sand, while NATO promised aid.\nBut for Bianca F\u00fcller, 10, and Denis R\u00f6se, 9, skipping down the street in front of the Bauhaus, the floods have meant no school since Thursday.\nAre they afraid? ''No,'' Bianca said. ''I live on the second floor. I'll just go home.'' Denis, not to be outdone by an older girl, said: ''I live on the third floor -- that's best.''"}, {"text": "World Briefing | World: Wet Forecast For Northern Europe\n2002-01-31T05:00:00.000Z\nA new analysis of warming global temperatures and the relationship to rainfall foresees a fivefold rise in the risk of destructive winter rains in parts of Europe in this century and of summer floods in southern Asia. Combining the output of 19 different computer models, British and Swedish scientists showed that Britain and a swath of northern Europe from Germany through Finland and Russia were most likely to see extremely wet winters. The watersheds feeding the Brahmaputra and other nearby rivers that contribute to floods in Bangladesh were the likeliest to see extreme summer rains, according to the study, which was published in the journal Nature.\nAndrew C. Revkin (NYT)"}, {"text": "Bangladeshis Sipping Arsenic As Plan for Safe Water Stalls\n2002-07-14T05:00:00.000Z\nThe arsenic, a slow, sadistic killer, has just about finished its work on Fazila Khatun. She teeters now. The fatigue is constant. Pain pulses through her limbs. Warts and sores cover the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet, telltale of the long years of creeping poison.\nMrs. Khatun is hardly alone in this suffering. Bangladesh is in the midst of what the World Health Organization calls the ''largest mass poisoning of a population in history.'' Tens of thousands of Bangladeshis show the outward signs of the same decline. Some 35 million are drinking arsenic-contaminated water, the poison accumulating within them day by day, sip by sip.\nThis calamity is accompanied by paradox. For two decades, the government, along with Unicef and various aid groups, desperately worked to wean the nation from pond water, often an incubator for lethal disease. People were instead urged to install tube wells, tapping into the plentiful supply of underground aquifers. Regrettably, no one had tested these subterranean sources for arsenic.\nBy the mid-1990's, Bangladeshi officials -- once reluctant to provoke alarm -- finally admitted that yet another tragedy was unfolding in their impoverished, disaster-plagued nation. In 1998, the World Bank sped the normal paperwork and lent the government $32.4 million to act on the emergency. Every tube well was to be tested. Safe sources of water were to be provided.\nBut the race against time has gone badly. In the four years since The New York Times first looked into the situation, the nation's ''arsenic mitigation project'' has been hobbled by the unforeseen problems of so unprecedented a crisis. It is yet another example of how the world's poor continue to die from unsafe water, a threat long ago surmounted by the wealthy.\nSuspicious of each other, the World Bank and the government became stubbornly bound up in their mutual bureaucracies, many critics say. Most of the country's estimated 11 million wells have yet to be tested. Most stricken villages are absent solutions. Most people -- the trusting converts to the ''safety'' of tube wells -- are baffled when now told that within the water lie the malign beginnings of arsenic-induced cancer.\n''It seems like nonsense to people, telling them the water is killing them when it looks so clean and nice,'' said Dr. Allan H. Smith, an epidemiologist at the University of California at Berkeley and an expert on arsenic.\nDr. Smith has called the situation in Bangladesh ''the highest environmental cancer risk ever found,'' worse than Bhopal or Chernobyl.\n''People need to stop drinking the contaminated water,'' he said. ''But they don't seem to pay attention unless there are people around them showing signs of the disease, which is of course what we're trying to prevent.''\nHere in the village of Chotobinar Chap, with the cancer pulling her under, Mrs. Khatun seems to have surrendered. She has no strength for work. She has no appetite for meals. She lies in a spare room beneath a thatched roof.\n''I feel myself fading away, and sometimes I ask God to take me,'' she muttered. ''My husband has abandoned me. He doesn't even look at me anymore.''\nFor nearly two decades, Mrs. Khatun, 39, pumped the iron handle of a tube well sunk in her front yard beside a palm tree. Her father-in-law, Abdul Hakim, his six sons and all their families used the same convenient apparatus.\nTwo years ago, the water was tested. The arsenic concentration measured .760 milligrams per liter, 15 times the amount considered safe by Bangladesh standards and 76 times the limit set by the World Health Organization.\nArsenic, a speedy killer in high doses, is a sluggish and fickle assailant in low ones. The poison requires 2 to 10 years or more to work its damage and it affects different people in different ways -- and some, seemingly, not at all.\nWhile Mrs. Khatun is the most woefully stricken in her family, others have the same nodules on their palms and heels and dark spots on much of their skin. Still others, their thirst slaked from the same well, show no signs at all.\nInformed of the danger, the family beseeched, ''Where can we get safe water?'' Here again the arsenic displayed its erratic hand, for some of the wells here are terribly tainted and others, just yards away, are harmless.\nThe nearest safe water for the family was beside a neighbor's home a quarter mile away. To get there required a walk on a narrow mud path, past several houses with shiny tin roofs, past ponds where animals bathed and algae bloomed.\n''It was hard to fetch water from so far away,'' said Mr. Hakim, a weaver. Dark spots pocked his bare chest. ''One of my daughters-in-law would go and carry back a full pitcher for drinking. But sometimes the path was too muddy. It was knee deep. She couldn't wade through it and she stopped going.''\nIt is difficult to predict how many Bangladeshis will eventually die from causes related to the arsenic. Most researchers, including Dr. Smith, are shy with estimates. Richard Wilson, a Harvard physicist who is an expert in risk analysis, puts the number at one million. Dr. Sk. Ahktar Ahmad, a public health specialist with the government, predicts a total of three million to five million.\nAny such arithmetic is highly speculative. The morbid work of the arsenic -- a persistent nudging toward cancers of the liver, lung, bladder or kidney -- can be halted in most cases by simply switching to safe water, doctors say.\nSo the question is: How many Bangladeshis will be persuaded to switch? And, if persuaded, how many can find water both safe and accessible?\nAlternatives do exist. There are even ways to filter arsenic from water. But each solution requires effort, to educate villagers and to pay for the required equipment.\nWith 130 million people, Bangladesh is the world's eighth most populous nation, its citizens packed into a territory slightly smaller than Wisconsin. The average per capita income is $370.\nArsenic has competition on the nation's mortality tables. Each year, pneumonia kills 91,000 children under age 5. Diarrhea claims 61,000 more. Tobacco surely rivals arsenic as a progenitor of fatal cancer.\nMother Nature, prone to furious mood swings, is often a mass murderer. In the wet summers, melting snow from the Himalayas joins with monsoon rains to overwhelm the rivers, flooding as much as two-thirds of the landscape. In dry months, the fierce sun can parch the soil enough to trigger a famine.\nA few miles from here is Khandkar Kalagachia. As in most hamlets, there is water, water everywhere: wells, ponds, irrigated fields.\nThough many of the villagers display signs of the poisoning, it is hard to know the extent of the contamination. Khandkar Kalagachia lies on the wrong side of the road, among the 77 percent of the nation's ''hot spot'' areas still untested.\nMuhammad Ahsanullah, a rickshaw puller, endures an overwhelming itchiness, another of the symptoms. His hands are always in motion, scratching their way from his palms to his wrists to his biceps to his shoulders. In one dexterous maneuver, he crosses his arms to get at his sides, looking like a man confined to a straitjacket.\n''I should drink from another well,'' Mr. Ahsanullah, 45, said.\nHis fingers have lesions the size of chickpeas. His soles are similarly affected, a hazardous problem for a rickshaw puller who goes barefoot. Infected wounds often lead to gangrene.\nAs Mr. Ahsanullah spoke, a small crowd gathered. Some of the men pulled up shirts to show their own dark speckling or lumpy palms.\nStanding at the front door of a shack was a young woman, Khorsheda Begum, the rickshaw puller's wife. The couple wed three years ago. Their families had arranged the marriage. She had never seen him until the wedding day.\nNow, sheepishly, she admitted she wished she could undo their union. A village quack has told her -- incorrectly -- that her husband's skin condition is contagious. Actually, the grave danger comes from the tube well in the yard.\n''Yes, I drink from it,'' she said. ''We all do.''\nTheir well is the standard device, a small cylinder sunk into the earth with a hand pump above ground. Its location was familiar to Mostafa Kamal, an engineer who works for an aid agency called Proshika. He had once tested the well and found it contaminated. But for one reason or another, he had never gotten back to Khandkar Kalagachia to assay any other samples.\n''Please test our wells now,'' one man pleaded.\nBut the engineer could not comply. He was apologetic. His agency had a contract to examine wells. ''But I only have supplies to test 200 a month and I have run out,'' he said. ''I can request more but I don't think I will get it.''\nFrom the start, the effort to correct the problem has run into problems. The primary mission was the testing of every well. If the water was safe, the top of the well was to be painted green. If not, it would be colored red.\nThis task required test kits that could accurately measure minuscule levels of arsenic, but nothing that precise was immediately available. While it was presumed that every family had a right to know if their well was tainted, little had been decided about how to help the unlucky.\n''We started taking the measurements, but as we tested, painting the wells red or green, there was a great hue and cry from people with contaminated water,'' said a government official. ''These people asked us, What do you expect us to do now?''\n''It took us a while to come up with new technologies, such as pond sand filters or rainwater harvesting or, in some areas, deeper tube wells,'' the official said. ''Different areas have different solutions. But once the best one is decided, to whom do you provide the money for installation? How do you prevent corruption?''\nPrograms were required, and each scheme seemed to call for round after round of design. The World Bank, after lending so much money, wanted the protection of exacting oversight. Some government officials, practiced in steering contracts to cronies, had supervisory interests of their own.\n''It has been terrible frustration to watch,'' said Han A. Heijnen, the environmental health adviser for the World Health Organization in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. ''So much remains to be done. Even now, the lack of knowledge among villagers about arsenic is a shame.''\nThe arsenic itself may well have been in the area's alluvial sediments for 20,000 years or more. Exactly how it came to dissolve in the groundwater is a matter of debate, but the prevailing theory is that it was a natural process.\nWhatever the cause, the arsenic's belated discovery is at the root of the calamity. Water-quality experts are divided about how much, if any, negligence was involved. Some victims are suing the British Geological Survey, which did not include a test for arsenic when it surveyed the groundwater in 1992.\nBut even after the poison was found, responses were tardy. Unicef is now a dedicated participant in the testing of wells, but it and the government were slow to admit that their ''safe water program,'' the laudable effort to stop people from drinking from disease-laden ponds, had dire unintended consequences.\nNow, with the disaster continuing, Bangladesh is of great interest to global experts, their laboratory for the study of arsenic.\nResearchers have questions, among them: Has the poison breached the food chain? Why are some people more affected than others? Is the level of arsenic in each tube well stable? Will fatalistic villagers change their habits?\nMr. Ahsanullah, the rickshaw puller, incessantly scratching, had himself given thought to an alternate source of water. Recently, he began using a neighbor's well.\n''But now I am told that, too, is bad,'' he said as he stood amid lush greenery and sprawling ponds. Within 20 feet, villagers were sloshing through the shallows that nourished a rice paddy. Still, the confused man, displaying his fear, asked gravely, ''Where can I find water?''"}, {"text": "NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: ELMHURST; A Calm Corner Keeps an Eye On a Violent Subcontinent\n2002-03-10T05:00:00.000Z\nViolence between Hindus and Muslims may be raging in India, where hundreds have died in a conflict that has become increasingly bloody. Yet in the mini-South Asia known as Elmhurst, Queens, the echoes of this turmoil are heard but faintly.\nEspecially in Elmhurst Gardens, a pair of six-story red-brick apartments on Elmhurst Avenue, two groups that have been taught from birth to hate each other gingerly coexist, primarily because they take considerable pains to stay out of each other's way.\nThe 84-apartment complex, just off a section of Broadway that bustles with Thai, Chinese, Malaysian and Vietnamese restaurants, is a microcosm of the subcontinent. Nearly half the residents are new immigrants: Hindus, Muslims and Christians from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\nThey may worry about religious violence and the threat of war between India and Pakistan, but they tend to keep their views to themselves. Many residents work hard and sometimes hold two jobs, leaving them little time to socialize with their neighbors.\nFour years ago, Shek Uezzal, a Bangladeshi, bought a one-bedroom apartment for his family in the complex. Two other Bangladeshi families in the building help his mother-in-law, who speaks no English.\n''I say 'Hello' or 'How are you?' to Indians in the building,'' said Mr. Uezzal, a man with a gleaming smile who could pass for one of the Bollywood movie stars whose images are plastered in the video rental store he runs in Jackson Heights. But most of his social contacts are with other Bangladeshis.\nLast year, Mr. Uezzal was awakened at 3 a.m. when a burst water pipe created a flood in his fourth-floor apartment. He and his third-floor neighbor Arun Achrekar, a Hindu from India, called 911 and the Fire Department. But the two men have not spoken since.\n''I hardly talk to anyone in the building,'' said Mr. Achrekar, who owns a clothing store on 14th Street in Manhattan and shares his apartment with two other Indians. ''I don't care if someone is a Muslim or a Hindu. I go to my work, make money and come home.''\nContact between Hindus and Muslims in Elmhurst Gardens is confined largely to the younger generation.\n''I have Muslim friends,'' says Vishal Vakani, a 15-year-old. Although his family worships Hindu gods, two of his closest friends are from Bangladesh and Pakistan. After school the boys play basketball at Moore Homestead Playground, a block away from his home.\nThe two teenage sons of Khaqan Hasan, who is Pakistani, bring their Indian friends over to their apartment.\n''Sometimes we talk about what is happening in India,'' said Mr. Hasan's daughter, Sana. ''But we never pursue it too much.''\nMr. Hasan's only link with India involves movies; he owns more than 20 Bollywood videos.\n''We brought our love for Indian films from Pakistan,'' he said. ''We used to watch them there, and we watch them here.''

What is known is that he was sent from his home, a village south of here, when he was about 7.\nOnce he arrived in Dubai, his meals were rationed to make sure he did not gain much weight. He was whipped when he was disagreeable. Still, he was luckier than many of his peers. Other little boys with whom he worked, he recalled, tumbled from the camels and broke their bones.\nNuru, the son of landless peasants, is among an untold number of children who are taken out of this country each year by traffickers. Some are kidnapped, others are sold.\nBoys, some as young as 4 or 5, are mostly put to work as camel jockeys in the Persian Gulf. Most girls are sent to India and Pakistan to work as prostitutes and maids. Sometimes, parents are compensated for their labor; sometimes, the money dries up in a few months. Children are known to have been ferried away for as little as 3,000 Bangladeshi takas, less than $75.\nTheir young minds can be both blessing and curse. Many simply forget their homes, the faces of their parents, the sounds of their native language. ''Are they dying? Disappearing? Getting lost? We don't know,'' said Salma Ali, executive director of the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association, one of this country's main antitrafficking organizations. ''We're not seeing many of them come back.''\nOn any given week, the association's offices see a stream of hapless parents, occasionally bearing pictures of a long-lost boy or girl.\nEmploying children as camel jockeys is illegal in Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates. But a picture of the ongoing trade emerges from the rare testimony of boys like Nuru who do make it home.\nBangladesh is considered one of the most vulnerable spots on the global trafficking market, a product of the desperate poverty here and the demand for cheap labor elsewhere.\nThe problem has begun to draw government attention. Bangladesh now has a trafficking law, with stiff penalties. But most of those who have been arrested are low-level operators: a relative, a neighbor, a migrant worker looking to gain an advantage by ferrying along a child. Court cases generally rely on no more than the testimony of a child.\nThe kingpins have eluded the authorities, specialists say. What is more, government efforts to protect the prime victims of trafficking, women and children, have had unintended consequences.\nBangladesh now effectively bars women, though not men, from working overseas legally, except for skilled professionals. Women continue to go illegally, though, taking jobs as domestics, factory workers and, unwittingly or not, as prostitutes.\nAn ambitious public education campaign against trafficking is under way, with plans for an advertising campaign, village meetings and special training for police and border guards.\nBut even those who are part of this effort say they doubt it will do much to combat a hugely lucrative business. A crackdown by Western countries on immigration, they say, only makes the passage more perilous and the smuggler's job more lucrative.\n''If there's a demand, if there's a supply, and if there are no regular channels'' for migration, said Shahidul Haque, the regional representative at the International Office of Migration here, ''people will take advantage of smugglers.''\nIn the case of a little boy named Rubel Hussain, the smuggler -- or, as Rubel's mother insists, the abductor -- was a neighbor in a Dhaka shantytown, a woman named Najma, who made a lean living fixing lunch boxes for rickshaw pullers. Najma had a son, Babul, who was Rubel's playmate. Each was about 4 years old. One night, Rubel was invited to sleep over.\nRubel's mother, Amena Begum, remembers the next morning in chilling detail. She awoke to a bad dream, rushed over to Najma's home and found it empty. Neighbors said she left with the two boys in the middle of the night. Word spread they had gone to Dubai. Both boys, it turned out, were bound for lives as camel jockeys.\nIt would not be inconceivable to think that Amena Begum, a woman with two other children to feed, no husband, and a crumbling lean-to, could have sent away her eldest child voluntarily. Indeed, she had received offers to do so -- and, she insists, rejected them in no uncertain terms. ''I will beg for a living,'' she said. ''But I won't sell my children.''\nRubel remembers waking up on an airplane and asking for his mother. Najma told him they were going on a one-day holiday. He was instructed to tell strangers she was his mother.\nIn Dubai, Rubel panicked at the sight of a camel. He screamed and wept when he was forced on. It turned out to be his salvation. He was put to work tending goats instead.\nHis co-workers, he still remembers, suffered far worse. He saw a Pakistani boy fall off a camel and get trampled. Babul, Najma's son, broke his arm. His friend, Nuru, the boy bitten by the camel, was always hungry. ''If he ate any more,'' Rubel explained, his arm around his friend's shoulder, ''he would put on weight and then he wouldn't be able to sit on a camel.''\nLast year, Najma came back to Bangladesh with both Babul and Rubel. Word spread and last May, local police, accompanied by Rubel's mother and investigators from the Lawyers Association, raided Najma's home. But the mother-child reunion was not all they may have hoped for. When Amena Begum rushed over to embrace her son, the boy turned to Najma and asked, in Arabic, ''Who is this?'' He did not recognize her. He no longer spoke a word of Bengali. He had been gone six years.\nAll through the bus ride from Najma's village back to Dhaka, Amena Begum regaled her son with tales of their past. She told him about their shanty, about how she had looked for him for weeks, about his little brother and sister.\nNajma has been in jail since last May, awaiting trial on trafficking charges. Judging by the backlog in the Dhaka courts, her case is likely to languish a long while. And even though others arranged for the fake travel papers, bought her tickets and employed Rubel, no one else has been charged.\nBoth Nuru and Rubel live in a children's shelter run by the Lawyers Association. The shelter is home to some two dozen unschooled boys, some of them former camel jockeys, others simply orphans. For the first time, they are learning their letters.\nMore than 120 women and girls, many of them pulled out of brothels, live on the shelter's upper floors. Those who run the shelter say they hope to send the girls home one day, but reintegrating girls who have worked in the sex trade, an increasing focus of antitrafficking groups here, is a formidable task: the girls are usually shunned once they return home.\nAmena Begum's existence has not improved. City authorities are razing the shantytown where she lives. The pittance she makes as a part-time maid is not enough to send either of her two other children to school.\nOn a recent afternoon, she was lying down on a blanket on the ground, coughing and nursing aches. Flies buzzed around a bowl of fish curry. Her two children cuddled next to her. She said she could not imagine offering Rubel a better life than the one he has at the shelter.\nStill, she considers herself blessed compared with some of her neighbors. One woman in the same slum lost her boy to kidnappers 10 years ago.\n''At least I got my son back,'' Amena Begum said. ''She's been waiting for 10 years.''"}, {"text": "World Briefing\n2002-01-31T05:00:00.000Z\n EUROPE \n GERMANY: IMPORTS OF STEM CELLS APPROVED \n Parliament voted to allow limited imports of human embryo stem cells for research after a long debate that pitted advocates of the scientific and economic merits against opponents who cited moral concerns and invoked the Nazis' experiments on humans.

Combining the output of 19 different computer models, British and Swedish scientists showed that Britain and a swath of northern Europe from Germany through Finland and Russia were most likely to see extremely wet winters. The watersheds feeding the Brahmaputra and other nearby rivers that contribute to floods in Bangladesh were the likeliest to see extreme summer rains, according to the study, which was published in the journal Nature. \n Andrew C.

But that's one of the few end-of-the-world, where's-the-popcorn signposts that haven't appeared in the newspapers or on a crawl under Paula Zahn's chin this summer.\nMonsoons have caused floods and landslides throughout the Himalayas, leaving more than 900 people dead and roughly 25 million displaced in Nepal, India and Bangladesh. Elevated temperatures in Tokyo have led experts to call the city a vast ''heat island.''\nBiblical floods ravaged Prague and Dresden last week, while biblical plagues of mosquitoes and beetles have been infesting a melting Alaska, where the annual mean temperature has risen more than five degrees over the last 30 years. A heat wave is overtaking the United States one time zone after another; New York City is on its way to one of the hottest summers on record. The whole season is like watching a scene from ''Ghostbusters'': ''Dogs and cats, living together,'' Bill Murray deadpans about demonic forces poised to consume New York.\nIt's as if the world has finally caught up to the lyric paranoid streaks in the imagination of the filmmaker Terry Gilliam -- the Monty Python cartoon artist turned director. In Mr. Gilliam's motion-picture dreamscapes, the apocalypse is always waiting to alight the moment someone closes his eyes. In ''12 Monkeys,'' Bruce Willis may or may not be a time-traveler flung on a mission to the present. Still, he gets splintered glimpses of the futuristic world he's left behind, where natural resources have dried up and bears throw open their furious jaws as they roam the icy, barren streets of Philadelphia -- no doubt looking for the brokers who recommended they load up on telecommunication stocks.\nWhen a real-life event mirrors a realistic movie, as when the nuclear containment problems at Three Mile Island became headlines shortly after the release of ''The China Syndrome,'' we may feel relieved. It's all part of the tradition of muckraking that used to be such fun in the movies -- a film anticipating the drop of the other shoe. But when real life feels like a collaboration between the Fates and Oliver Stone, uncorking unforeseen collusions of catastrophes to keep you in a state of constant discomfort, one's anxiety level tends to redline. It's the kind of stuff you go to the movies to see, not exit the theaters to find waiting for you on the streets.\nIt's one thing to immerse yourself in ''Blade Runner,'' Ridley Scott's lushly meditative adaptation of Philip K. Dick's grim 1968 fairy tale ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'' ''Blade Runner'' portrays a future Los Angeles of skies filled with smog that occasionally burst into flame -- something many thought of when seeing helicopters buzzing the flames engulfing Hollywood after the 1992 riots in Los Angeles. (This summer's ''Reign of Fire,'' in which dragons were loosed on modern-day London, probably grew out of Dick's paranoid libertarian streak.) It's another thing entirely to be overcome by a Reuters article about a cloud of pollution two miles thick -- a ''toxic cocktail of ash, acids, aerosols and other particles'' -- that is choking the skies of southern Asia and presenting a peril to millions of pairs of lungs. The cloud cover affects an area from Afghanistan to Sri Lanka, and the United Nations environment chief, Klaus Toepfer, said it could ''travel halfway round the globe in a week.''\nMr. Gilliam is an American who transplanted himself to an existence under the flannel-colored skies of London. He lost his stomach for America, and movies like ''The Fisher King'' serve as proof; in it, Robin Williams stars as a fearful homeless Manhattanite whose mind is pummeled by horrific visions of menacing knights stalking him with lances, or rush-hour travelers at Grand Central suddenly turning into ballroom dancers. So many terrors are packed in the heads of his protagonists that they explode from beneath their brows in unique ways. In ''Time Bandits,'' the fantasies of a little boy -- feral midgets and Arthurian combatants -- erupt from his closet. And sometimes the teeming dystopias in their heads have to be brought down by brutal means. In ''Brazil'' -- Mr. Gilliam's version of a 1984-ish future that makes Orwell's seem a tale spun over 'smores by comparison -- the lurid, sculptured scenarios conjured by the central character, a hapless bureaucrat, are finally tamed by lobotomy.\nNo such remedy for those of us standing in line at Starbucks, lost in thought over a Frappucino and having our trains derailed by a photograph of a rhino being airlifted to safety from the floodwaters of the Prague Zoo. By the way, it seems that the animal was blindfolded -- was he being moved into the witness relocation program and not supposed to know where he was going? (The actual reason is worse: it was so he wouldn't freak out.)\nOr wondering if the grande latte we're going to order should come with nonfat milk and instead catching a glimpse of an article about another victim of the West Nile virus? Makes that desire to keep an few more ounces off your waistline seem wholly unnecessary, doesn't it?\nPeculiar stories are so commonplace around the world now that the bad-dream scenarist and director Stanley Kubrick's decision to remain in Britain (like Mr. Gilliam, he was an American expatriate who found nirvana in 4 o'clock tea) seems like a meaningless gesture. Kubrick's motivation to remain behind the walls of his castle stemmed from the fear that the doom-oriented world he envisioned in ''A Clockwork Orange,'' in which roving bands of toughs got their stimulation from committing a bit of the old ultra-violence on anyone in their path, had actually come to pass.\nThere's clearly something in the air. When Steven Spielberg, the prophet of box office calm, makes a Philip K. Dick movie -- ''Minority Report,'' a worst-case-scenario take on the surveillance cameras in 7-Elevens -- the world is lurching towards deeper suffering.

However, Oxfam shows double standards of its own and the net effect of this report could be to increase opposition to freer trade, especially in the rich world which is the primary target of its campaign.\nOn the one hand the report points to the losses that poorer countries have sustained as a result of developed country protection, especially of agriculture and textiles. On the other, it casts doubt on the benefits of free trade, as well as on those of foreign direct investment.\nIts legitimate criticisms of the 1990s Washington Consensus, the one-size-fits-all rapid trade liberalization policies pushed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, merge into tearful accounts of how competition has damaged this or that poor group. Indeed, running through much of it is not just an antipathy to transnational capital that seems an echo of 1970s \"South\" rhetoric, but also to the freeing up of domestic markets.\nThis is a shame because it will find an echo not in the countries that have been relatively successful in decreasing absolute poverty levels but in those most in need of excuses for failure. It will also strengthen those who do most damage to developing countries: Western critics of globalization.\nThere is a contrast between Oxfam's complaint that most trade-generating foreign direct investment has flowed to relatively few countries and its highlighting the negative impact of such investment in countries such as China. Complaints about sweatshop conditions in China sound more likely inspired by Western worker interests than those of the escapees from rural bondage to paid employment who staff the factories of Shenzhen.\nThe damage done to agricultural prices and rural incomes throughout the world by European, U.S. and Japanese subsidies to cereal, sugar and meat production and exports is well documented by Oxfam. But its impact is lost as the report takes up much space complaining bitterly about low prices for crops such as coffee which cannot be blamed on the rich. It ignores the role that increased plant productivity \u2014 surely a good thing \u2014 has had. Instead of over-production, it blames transnationals.\nThe report also emphasizes the harm done to poorer groups within developing countries when internal agricultural trade is liberalized, as in China and India. In doing so, it shows a concern for relative poverty levels \u2014 which is a Western obsession \u2014 compared with the focus on absolute levels and overall incomes favored by the majority of successful developing countries.\nOxfam points to the fact that, as in parts of India, abysmal primary educational levels, lack of roads and power can increase income gaps and prevent people from taking advantage of trade opportunities. True. But why not focus on tackling those issues, or the governance problems in countries like Haiti, which is cited as having done poorly despite rapid trade liberalization?\nThe report bemoans the ill-effects of reliance on cash crops instead of focusing on the choice that they provide between security and higher income, the risk/reward equation. It makes much of some ill-effects on women of trade-based development but understates the liberating role of industrial employment for women in much of Asia.\nOn the one hand, too, it points out the iniquities of textile industry protectionism yet complains about the dangers to Bangladesh should it lose out to China once the Multifiber arrangement is gone. Oxfam's characterization of the Asian crisis as resulting from a flood of imports caused by trade liberalization is wrong. The problem was capital flows into countries that already had fairly open trade regimes.\nThere are plenty of half truths in the document. Trade and foreign direct investment are not panaceas. Some countries are disadvantaged by geography and resources. The IMF has abused its role in forcing trade and capital liberalization. Countries like Korea have taken different routes to success, including fierce protection of infant industries and wariness of foreign investment. Foreign direct investment can create tax-exempt enclaves with no linkages to the rest of the economy.\nBut Oxfam misses the central point that trade cannot be blamed for abuses that result from decisions by national governments, such as pollution and infringement of workers' rights.\nIf Oxfam was more sympathetic to the benefits of trade it would be more effective in combating the trade abuses \u2014 such as Europe's Common Agricultural Policy \u2014 that so damage development. Many will treat this document more as an example of Western anti-globalization sentiment than as a contribution to freer and fairer trade.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, {"text": "Climate Talks Shift Focus to How to Deal With Changes\n2002-11-03T05:00:00.000Z\nThe global climate is changing in big ways, probably because of human actions, and it is time to focus on adapting to the impacts instead of just fighting to limit the warming. That, in a nutshell, was the idea that dominated the latest round of international climate talks, which ended on Friday in New Delhi.\nWhile many scientists have long held this view, it was a striking departure for the policy makers at the talks -- the industry lobbyists, environmental activists and government officials. For more than a decade, their single focus had been the fight over whether to cut smokestack and tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nMany environmentalists had long avoided discussing adaptation for fear it would smack of defeatism.\nExperts espousing the views of industry were thrilled with the shift in New Delhi.\n''By building capabilities to deal with climate change, we'll be much better off than by just paying attention to global warming,'' said Myron Ebell, who directs climate policy for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a private group that opposes regulatory approaches to environmental problems.\nAlthough they conceded its importance, environmental campaigners said an approach that focused on adapting to climate change rather than preventing it would inevitably fail, because the impact of unfettered emissions would eventually exceed people's ability to adjust.\nMoreover, many said, coral reefs, alpine forests and other fragile ecosystems -- without the resiliency of human societies -- would simply be unable to cope with fast-changing conditions.\nThe change in attitude, expressed in the negotiations and in a formal declaration adopted Friday, has been partly driven by unusual weather this year -- record floods in Europe, landslides in the Himalayas, searing drought in southern Asia and Africa.\nNo single weather event can be linked to human-caused warming. But as the costs of weather-related disasters rise, unease about climate change rises, too. So far this year, unusual weather is blamed for 9,400 deaths and $56 billion in damage, according to the United Nations and insurers, and deaths and costs have been rising for years.\nAnother impetus is the rising realization that many significant shifts have already been set in motion by a century-long accumulation of warming gases.\nEven if emissions stopped today, some experts say, the volume of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere would slowly raise sea levels for a century or two as warmed water expands and terrestrial ice melts. The result would be coastal erosion and salt water intrusion into water supplies.\nThe new focus suits the agendas of the Bush administration and many developing countries, which for different reasons want to avoid cutting emissions of the warming gases. But some environmental campaigners say the shift will discourage efforts to cut dependence on fossil fuels like coal and oil, the main source of the offending gases, in favor of building dikes, designing hardier crops or other engineering fixes.\n''Adaptation is like the 'wear sunglasses and a hat' theory of fighting ozone depletion,'' said Kert Davies, the research director for Greenpeace, referring to the Reagan-era debate over chemicals that were weakening the earth's atmospheric shield against harmful radiation.\nIn that case, the offending synthetic chemicals were banned under a 1987 treaty, but only because damage to the ozone layer had become vividly apparent in satellite images -- and because industry had come up with alternatives.\nBut no ready substitutes exist for cheap, plentiful fossil fuels. Many experts say the use of coal and oil is bound to keep rising for decades, particularly as poor countries climb the economic ladder from bicycles and water buckets to cars and washing machines.\nConservative policy analysts said proposed curbs on fuel use were thus unrealistic and unjustified, while making countries more resilient to extremes of weather made sense for many reasons. One goal, Mr. Ebell said, should be to enable low-lying countries like Bangladesh to respond to typhoons the way Florida responds to hurricanes.\nThere are also ways to foster development in poor countries that limit harm from climate change. Experts say that in semi-arid zones in Africa and Asia, agricultural assistance could improve farmers' ability to endure heat and drought.\nIn some areas, adaptation is already under way. In the Himalayas, some communities, with the help of the United Nations, are installing alarm systems to warn of flash floods as expanding lakes of glacial meltwater grow to the bursting point in the next decade.\nLow-lying island nations, like the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, have been watching the slow rise of the seas for decades and have not only been planning to build storm barriers, but possibly to evacuate entirely at some point.\nThe emphasis on adapting is a profound turnabout from the course set a decade ago after President George Bush and other world leaders signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Though that treaty and subsequent addenda contained vague commitments by industrial nations to help vulnerable countries adapt, the emphasis was always about curbing emissions to prevent dangerous changes in the climate system.\nAdaptation got support in New Delhi because it suits both the current Bush administration, which has tried to shift debate away from emissions reductions, and developing countries, which have expressed frustration at the developed world's inertia in limiting its own emissions and its delays in pledged aid.\nAt the meeting, poorer countries did not quite say it was their turn to pollute but, led by the host country, they did demand the right to grow out of destitution, a path that will require vast use of existing fuel reserves -- mainly coal.\nOpening the plenary session last Wednesday, India's prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said per capita use of such fuels by the world's poorest populations was a fraction of that of people in the industrial powers. Mitigating fuel use, he said, ''will bring additional strain to the already fragile economies of the developing countries.''\nThe adaptation issue also got support from a new scientific analysis, published Friday, suggesting that the only way to safely stabilize greenhouse gases by midcentury was with a hugely ambitious Apollo-size research program on fusion, solar power, and other nonpolluting energy sources.\nThe lead authors of that study echoed other experts in saying it was nearly inconceivable that the Bush administration or Congress would finance such a costly crash program.\nThey also said that modest emission reductions called for under the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty supported by Europe and Japan, would not be enough to spur governments and businesses to seek the necessary technological shift. The protocol, an addendum to the 1992 climate convention, is moving toward taking legal force sometime next year, when Russia is expected to ratify it. But President Bush has rejected it, and without the adherence of the United States, the world's biggest source of greenhouse gases, the Kyoto pact's impact on climate will be negligible, scientists and treaty experts say.\nStill, some experts said Kyoto's significance should not be discounted. ''Your first trip to the gym doesn't improve your health, but you've got to get into a regular habit,'' said David D. Doniger, the director of climate policy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group. ''Kyoto is that first trip. It provides a structure to build on.''\nMr. Doniger and other veterans of the climate wars with varying perspectives said the best -- and perhaps only -- hope lay in a blend of all of the above: a mix of finding ways to improve energy efficiency now; to protect the most vulnerable countries and ecosystems from accelerating change; and to push the technological frontier to determine if any far-flung solutions can come to the rescue.\nDr. Martin I. Hoffert, the New York University physicist who led the new clean-energy study, said he was confident that technology held an eventual solution. ''We started World War II with biplanes, and seven years later had jets,'' he said.\nBut he and other climate experts acknowledged that wartime innovations emerged in crisis, not ahead of a slow-moving environmental shift."}, {"text": "Governments have not yet figured out how to cooperate : Indonesian smoke is choking Asia\n2002-08-30T05:00:00.000Z\nSINGAPORE:\u2014  A plan recently unveiled by the Singapore government promises to give this prosperous island-state a green future, including at least 310 days of clean air per year by 2012. \n But there is a catch. Singapore cannot control the widespread burning of forests and scrub to clear land in neighboring Indonesia, a practice that at this time of year sends clouds of wind-borne smoke and pollutants, known euphemistically as haze, sweeping across large swathes of Southeast Asia. \n Raging forest fires in Indonesia, fueled by an unusually long dry spell that was intensified by the El Nin\u0303o weather phenomenon, blanketed Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and even parts of Thailand and the Philippines in 1997 and 1998. It cost an estimated $9 billion in damage to public health from respiratory and other illnesses and in tourism, transport and agricultural losses. \n In this year's dry season, the Indonesian fires, compounded by the return of El Nin\u0303o, have again caused haze to drift over Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei for more than a month, raising fears of a repeat of the disastrous 1997-98 pollution that caused serious strains in relations between Indonesia and other members of ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations. \n Singapore's National Environment Agency reported this week that satellite photographs showed more than 800 hot spots, where fires were burning on Borneo. The island, one of the world's largest, is shared by the Indonesian region of Kalimantan, Brunei and the Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah. \n Air quality in parts of Kalimantan hit record lows Thursday as fires continued to belch out thick smoke, the Associated Press reported from Jakarta. The dense smoke has closed one airport in the area for more than a week while thousands of people, many of them children, have been treated for respiratory difficulties. \n Although Indonesia itself is bearing the brunt of the smoke, Malaysian officials said that Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was expected to discuss the issue of cross-border pollution with Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri when they met on the sidelines of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week. \n The Malaysian science, technology and environment minister, Law Hieng Ding said that Malaysia will be seeking support from Singapore and Brunei in urging Indonesia to take firm action to prevent a major outbreak of fires. \n \"Without an agreed-upon approach by all players to solve the underlying causes of fires, international relations will continue to be strained as smoke chokes the region,\" said Grahame Applegate, a researcher at the Center for International Forestry Research at Bogor, Indonesia. \n Indeed, some officials and analysts believe that the problem of air and water pollution and other forms of environmental damage generated in one country and spreading to others is becoming so extensive in Asia and elsewhere that it will be a key force impelling governments, industries and non-government organizations to work more closely together to combat the problem. \n In June, ASEAN environment ministers signed what they said was the first regional arrangement in the world that binds a group of contiguous states to cooperate in tackling land and forest fires, and the resultant cross-border haze pollution. \n But the agreement will only enter into force after six of the ten ASEAN member states have ratified or acceded to it, which has not happened yet. \n The United Nations Environment Program warned recently that the regional and global impacts of haze generated in Asia from rapid industrialization and urbanization, bad land use practices, and deforestation are set to get worse over the next 30 years as the region's population rises to an estimated 5 billion people. \n A panel of scientists for the environment program reported earlier this month that a blanket of pollution up to three kilometers (1.5 miles) deep stretched across South Asia, modifying weather patterns in a way that was already causing serious damage to human health and agriculture, triggering drought in some parts of the region and floods in others. \n South Asia includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldive Islands, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. \n The executive director of the environment program, Klaus Toepfer, said that the South Asian haze was the result of dramatic increases in the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, industries and power stations, as well as smoke from forest fires, the burning of agricultural wastes, and millions of inefficient cookers using wood, cow dung and other biofuels. \n \"More research is needed, but these initial findings clearly indicate that this growing cocktail of soot, particles, aerosols and other pollutants is becoming a major environmental hazard for Asia,\" he said. \"There are also global implications, not least because a pollution parcel like this, which stretches three kilometers high, can travel half way round the globe in a week.\" \n Officials at the UN's environment program said that while the Asian \"brown haze\" study focused on South Asia, the problem is comparable, if not more severe, in Southeast and Northeast Asia, including China. \n In March, the worst dust storm in a decade whipped up in China's arid north affected to neighboring Russia and Korea. The flying sand caused dozens of flight cancellations and closed primary schools in South Korea, while in Russia's Pacific port of Vladivostock the storm shrouded the city in clouds of sand and yellow rain. \n Scientists say that China's dust storms are worsening as the desert, which covers over 27 percent of the country, spreads as a result of illegal logging and over-grazing on marginal land. \n China's coal-burning power plants and factories emit some 40 million tons per year of sulfur oxides, the most in the world. Some of this pollution is carried by prevailing winds and deposited on Japan in the form of acid rain that damages crops and forests. Japanese officials have expressed repeated concern about such airborne pollution. \n Wind-borne pollution from China and neighboring countries is even reaching North America, according to scientific studies published in the United States in April.

Worked.''\nMila Milan rolls the word off her tongue, juicing each consonant and vowel, the letters performing calisthenics on her face.\nSix people squint at the paper sign she is holding and take her cue. But the sounds are born on distant continents and centuries of isolation from the Anglo-Saxon hordes.\n''Walk.''\n''Wok.''\n''Wrrrg.''\nMs. Milan squints. ''Excuse me?''\nSome of the students stare blankly. Galina Yanchinskaya of Ukraine and Dholak of Tibet laugh at their mistakes.\nAnd so it goes for the next two hours. Ms. Milan's English classes, held twice a week at the Old Bergen Church on Bergen Avenue, are lessons in patience, humor and the immutable force of the regular verb. Her students are fortunate that they have an energetic, devoted and patient professional who began teaching English at a Filipino refugee camp in 1980's. The International Institute of New Jersey is one of a handful of such places in North Jersey offering classes in the summer, particularly one that is free and has space for new students.\n''I very good artist; I need English,'' says the 33-year-old Mr. Dholak, who like most Tibetans has only one name. A carver of elegant wood boxes, Mr. Dholak arrived in Jersey City five years ago from India but still speaks, at best, fractured English, or as he puts it -- ''now, not good.'' Learning how to speak and write English will allow him to hire apprentices and build a business.\nMrs. Yanchinskaya and Mr. Dholak -- who came to this country filled with hope yet with considerably less money or language skills -- are part of an increasingly large segment of New Jersey.\nThousands of immigrants and foreign-born residents who have made New Jersey their home have not been nearly as fortunate. The great immigration wave of the 1990's -- when 13.2 million immigrants flooded the United States -- has resulted in a tsunami of foreigners yearning to learn English. Last year in New Jersey alone, where 17.5 percent of the population is foreign born, 26,000 people attended government-financed classes in English as a second language. Adult education programs, community organizations and literacy volunteers in the state are reporting skyrocketing enrollments and long waiting lists.\nNationwide, the situation is every bit as pressing. In 2000, 1.1 million adults studied in federally financed English asa second language programs, particularly outside of cities, where growth is most rapid.\nOne reason for the sharp rise in such classes is less frequently mentioned: the fear foreigners have of losing their privileges in the wake of Sept. 11 and the resulting distrust of immigrants.\n''Most people are very concerned that they need to learn English and become citizens,'' said Anna Cruz, principal of the Perth Amboy High School adult education program, which enrolled 1,745 adults last year. ''I get people right off the airplane.''\nLast September, more than 1,000 people showed up for registration at the New Brunswick Adult Learning Center, vying for classroom space for half that number. People were so eager to be admitted that they brought friends in case some seats were empty. ''People would try to sneak in,'' said Martha Clifford, a bilingual adviser and coordinator. ''It's a very sad situation.''\nTo fill the gap, some private nonprofit programs have stepped in. For instance, Jewish Vocational Services in East Orange, which once focused on helping refugees from the former Soviet Union, began to accept more immigrants from South America, the Balkans, Iran, Bangladesh and elsewhere. The flow has not stopped at the school, which has room for 500 students, who study English from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day at no cost.\n''If we had more funding, we would open more classes,'' said Nancy Fisher, director of education and training there.\nCommunity colleges are feeling the same crunch. Almost 1,800 students registered for classes last fall at Union County College. And at Middlesex County College in Edison, 1,200 students enrolled and paid $240 for most English-immersion courses.\n''A lot of them are not new residents,'' said Eileen Hansen, chairwoman of the E.S.L. department at Middlesex. ''They came here, worked at menial jobs and realized they need English to get better jobs.''\nSome programs have had to cancel lessons because of a loss of financing.\nThe International Institute of New Jersey in Hudson County, part of a nationwide umbrella organization to aid refugees, once accepted 300 students each year. Last year it lost $53,000 in state aid, part of an effort to consolidate E.S.L. teaching. Now the institute can teach only 100 students.\n''We deal with a vulnerable population,'' said Nick Montalto, executive director of the institute, ''refugees, people who suffered torture, people who are less than literate in their own language. The options are rare.''\nMrs. Yanchinskaya, who lives in Jersey City, attends the institute's summer class with six other students. Decades ago, she conjugated English verbs while attending college in Ukraine.\nSome agencies are still reeling from the sharp cutback in state financing for adult education. The Monmouth County Adult Basic Skills Consortium was one victim. The director, Carl DeJura, applied for $899,000 in state grants to cover its entire budget, but received nothing, virtually eliminating adult education in Monmouth, where 10.4 percent of the residents are foreign born.\nEducators besieged the state for help, and the Department of Education scrambled to find money. Months later, the state distributed a total of $2 million among programs in the five counties.\nMr. DeJura's group received $400,000, which meant he could seat only 994 E.S.L. students this past year, as opposed to the nearly 1,900 he had hoped to welcome.\n''We don't know year to year if the money will be available,'' he said. ''With the budget situation in New Jersey, we don't know what's going to happen,'' he said.\nMoney has long been a sore point in the world of adult education. The state Department of Education calculates that last year it spent $298, mostly in federal money, on each of the 26,000 adults who enrolled in English classes for at least 12 hours -- far less than the national average of $374 per student, according to the National Center for Literacy Education.\nPart of the problem is that few people in this area of education know how much money is available. Hal Beder, professor of adult and continuing education at Rutgers University, who is writing a master plan on the state's adult literacy needs, said he had a researcher spend eight months tracking money sources and even now ''our figure is an estimate.''\nHe found that several federal departments -- education, housing, human services and labor -- and 23 state agencies all had provisions for literacy programs and provided nearly $19 million this year for adult literacy and E.S.L. classes in New Jersey. The state contribution of $3.5 million has barely grown in recent years.\nThat fragmented approach, he said, forced schools to scramble year-round to stay alive.\nAfter years of lobbying by E.S.L. teachers, the state has changed its method for distributing money and now uses a sliding scale that provides more for the students who need the most help. Schools get $800 per semester for a class of the least literate students, $400 for those who test at the next higher level, and $200 apiece for the most literate students, said Ms. Fisher of the vocational center in East Orange. It was a necessary change, she said, adding that the sliding scale had its drawbacks.\n''You're getting more quality for your students, but you're serving fewer students,'' she said."}, {"text": "'Desirable Daughters'\n2002-04-28T05:00:00.000Z\n In the mind's eye, a one-way procession of flickering oil lamps sways along the muddy shanko between rice paddies and flooded ponds, and finally disappears into a distant wall of impenetrable jungle.

In a palanquin borne by four servants sit a rich man's three daughters, the youngest dressed in her bridal sari, her little hands painted with red lac dye, her hair oiled and set. Her arms are heavy with dowry gold; bangles ring tiny arms from wrist to shoulder. Childish voices chant a song, hands clap, gold bracelets tinkle. I cannot imagine the loneliness of this child. A Bengali girl's happiest night is about to become her lifetime imprisonment. It seems all the sorrow of history, all that is unjust in society and cruel in religion has settled on her. Even constructing it from the merest scraps of family memory fills me with rage and bitterness. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bride-to-be whispers the &quot;Tush Tusli Brata,&quot; a hymn to the sacredness of marriage, a petition for a kind and generous husband: \n What do I hope for in worshipping you? That my father's wisdom be endless, My mother's kindness bottomless. May my husband be as powerful as a king of gods. May my future son-in-law light up the royal court. Bestow on me a brother who is learned and intellectual, A son as handsome as the best-looking courtier, And a daughter who is beauteous. Let my hair-part glow red with vermilion powder, as a wife's should. On my wrists and arms, let bangles glitter and jangle. Load down my clothes-rack with the finest saris, Fill my kitchen with scoured-shiny utensils, Reward my wifely virtue with a rice-filled granary. These are the boons that this young virgin begs of thee. \n In a second, larger palki borne by four men sit the family priest and the father of the bride. Younger uncles and cousins follow in a vigilant file. Two more guards, sharp-bladed daos drawn, bring up the rear. Two servants walk ahead of the eight litter-bearers, holding naphtha lamps. No one has seen such brilliant European light, too strong to stare into, purer white than the moon. It is a town light, a rich man's light, a light that knows English invention. If bandits are crouching in the gullies they will know to strike this reckless Hindu who announces his wealth with light and by arming his servants. What treasures lie inside, how much gold and jewels, what target ripe for kidnapping? The nearest town, where such a wealthy man must have come from, lies behind him. Only the jungle lies ahead. Even the woodcutters desert it at night, relinquishing it to goondahs and marauders, snakes and tigers. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bride is named Tara Lata, a name we almost share. The name of the father is Jai Krishna Gangooly. Tara Lata is five years old and headed deep into the forest to marry a tree. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had the time, the motivation, and even the passion to undertake this history. When my friends, my child, or my sisters ask me why, I say I am exploring the making of a consciousness. Your consciousness? they tease, and I tell them, No. Yours. \n * * * \n On this night, flesh-and-blood emerges from the unretrievable past. I have Jai Krishna's photo, I know the name of Jai Krishna's father, but they have always been ghosts. But Tara Lata is not, nor will her father be, after the events of this special day. And so my history begins with a family wedding on the coldest, darkest night in the Bengali month of Paush&#151;December/January&#151;in a district of the Bengal Presidency that lies east of Calcutta&#151;now Kolkata&#151;and south of Dacca&#151;now Dhaka&#151;as the English year of 1879 is about to shed its final two digits, although the Hindu year of 1285 still has four months to run and the Muslim year of 1297 has barely begun. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those years, Bengal was the seat of British power, Calcutta its capital, its cultural and economic center. The city is endowed with the instruments of Western knowledge, the museums, the colleges, the newspapers, and the Asiatic Society. The old Bengal Presidency included all of today's Bangladesh, the current Indian state of West Bengal, and parts of Assam, Bihar, and Orissa. A reconstituted Bengal Presidency today would have over 330 million people and be the world's third most populous country. China, India, Bengal. There are more of me than there are of you, although I am both. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eastern regions of Bengal, even before the flight of Hindus during the subcontinent's partition in 1947, and its reincarnation as Bangladesh in 1972, always contained a Muslim majority, though largely controlled by a sizeable and wealthy Hindu minority. The communities speak the same language&#151;Muslims, if the truth be known, more tenaciously than Hindus. But for the outer signs of the faith&#151;the beards and skullcaps of the Muslims, the different dietary restrictions, the caste observances, the vermilion powder on the hair-parting of married Hindu women&#151;there is little, fundamentally, to distinguish them. The communities suffer, as Freud put it, the narcissism of small difference. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hindu Bengalis were the first Indians to master the English language and to learn their master's ways, the first to flatter him by emulation, and the first to earn his distrust by unbidden demonstrations of wit and industry. Because they were a minority in their desh, their homeland, dependent on mastering or manipulating British power and Muslim psychology, the Hindus of east Bengal felt themselves superior even to the Hindus of the capital city of Calcutta. Gentlemen like Jai Krishna Gangopadhaya, a pleader in the Dacca High Court, whose surname the colonial authorities lightened to Gangooly, and who, on this particular winter night squats with a priest in a palki that reminds him of wagons for transporting remanded prisoners, was situated to take full advantage of fast-changing and improving times. He spoke mellifluous English and one high court judge had even recommended him for a scholarship to Oxford. Had he played by the rules, he should have been a great success, a prince, and a power. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jai Krishna's graduation portrait from the second class of India's first law school (Calcutta University, 1859) displays the expected Victorian gravitas and none of the eager confidence of his classmates. He is a young man of twenty who looks forty; his thick, dark eyebrows form an unbroken bar, and his shadow of a mustache&#151;an inversion of prevailing style that favored elaborately curled and wax-tipped mustaches&#151;reveal a young man more eloquent with a disapproving frown than with his words. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For ten years I kept the graduation photo of Bishwapriya Chatterjee, my husband&#151;Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur&#151;on our nightstand. Last icon before falling asleep, first worshipful image of the morning. The countries, the apartments, the houses all changed, but the portrait remained. He had that eagerness, and a confident smile that promised substantial earnings. It lured my father into marriage negotiations, and it earned my not unenthusiastic acceptance of him as husband. A very predictable, very successful marriage negotiation. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had Jai Krishna been a native Calcuttan, or had he come from Dacca, Bengal's second city, he might never have suffered the anxiety of the small-town provincial elevated into urbanity. In my mother-language we call the powerful middle class &quot;bhadra lok,&quot; the gentlefolk, the &quot;civilized&quot; folk, for whom the English fashioned the pejorative term &quot;babu,&quot; with its hint of fawning insincerity and slavishly acquired Western attitudes. The rest of the population are &quot;chhoto lok,&quot; literally, the little people. Jai Krishna Gangooly lacked the reflexive self-confidence of the bhadra lok. In his heart, he was a provincial from Mishtigunj, third son of a village doctor whose practice included the indigent and Muslims. He felt he'd been lifted from his provincial origins because of his father's contacts in the Calcutta Medical College. He was not comfortable in the lawyer's black robes and powdered wig. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, the story of the three great-granddaughters of Jai Krishna Gangooly starts on the day of a wedding, a few hours before the palki ride where fates have already been decided, in the decorated ancestral house of the Gangoolys on the river in Mishtigunj town. The decorations signify a biye-bari, a wedding house. Beggars have already camped in the alleys adjacent to the canopy under which giant copper vats of milk, stirred by professional cooks, have been boiling and thickening for sweetmeats, and where other vats, woks, and cauldrons receive the chunks of giant hilsa fish netted fresh from the river and hold the rice pilao, lamb curry, spiced lentils, and deep-fried and sauce-steeped vegetables, a feast for a thousand invited guests and the small city of self-invited men, women, and children camped outside the gates. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The astrologers have spoken; the horoscopes have been compared. The match between Jai Krishna's youngest daughter and a thirteen-year-old youth, another Kulin Brahmin from an upright and pious family from a nearby village, has been blessed. The prewedding religious rites have been meticulously performed, and the prewedding stree-achar, married women's rituals, boisterously observed. To protect the husband-to-be from poisonous snakebite, married women relatives and Brahmin women neighbors have propitiated Goddess Manasha with prescribed offerings. All of this has been undertaken at a moment in the evolution of Jai Krishna from student of Darwin and Bentham and Comte and practitioner of icy logic, to reader of the Upanishads and believer in Vedic wisdom. He had become a seeker of truth, not a synthesizer of cultures. He found himself starting arguments with pleaders and barristers, those who actually favored morning toast with marmalade, English suits, and leather shoes. Now nearing forty, he was in full flight from his younger self, joining a debate that was to split bhadra lok society between progressives and traditionalists for over a century. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Dacca barrister, Keshub Mitter, teased him for behaving more like a once-rich Muslim nawab wedded to a fanciful past and visions of lost glory than an educated, middle-class Hindu lawyer. Everyone knew that the Indian past was a rubbish heap of shameful superstition. Keshub Mitter's insult would have been unforgivable if it hadn't been delivered deftly, with a smile and a Bengali lawyer's wit and charm. My dear Gangooly, English is but a stepping-stone to the deeper refinement of German and French. Where does our Bangla language lead you? A big frog in a small, stagnant pond. Let us leave the sweet euphony of Bangla to our poets, and the salvation-enhancement of Sanskrit to our priests. Packet boats delivered Berlin and Paris papers to the Dacca High Court, along with the venerated Times. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cases Jai Krishna pleaded in court often cast him as the apostle of enlightenment and upholder of law against outmoded custom, or the adjudicator of outrages undefined and unimaginable under British law. The majesty of law was in conflict with Jai Krishna's search for an uncorrupted, un-British, un-Muslim, fully Hindu consciousness. He removed his wife and children from cosmopolitan Dacca and installed them in Mishtigunj. He sought a purer life for himself, English pleader by day, Sanskrit scholar by night. He regretted the lack of a rigorous Brahminical upbringing, the years spent in Calcutta learning the superior ways of arrogant Englishmen and English laws, ingesting English contempt for his background and ridicule for babus like him. He had grown up in a secularized home with frequent Muslim visitors and the occasional wayward Englishman. In consideration of non-Hindu guests, his father had made certain that his mother's brass deities and stone lingams stayed confined in the closed-off worship-room. \n * * * \n On the morning of Tara Lata's wedding, female relatives waited along the riverbank for the arrival of the groom and his all-male wedding party. The groom was Satindranath Lahiri, fifth son of Surendranath Lahiri, of the landowning Lahiri family; in his own right, a healthy youth, whose astrological signs pointed to continued wealth and many sons. Back in Dacca, Jai Krishna had defended the ancient Hindu practices, the caste consciousness, the star charts, the observance of auspicious days, the giving of a dowry, the intact integrity of his community's rituals. His colleague, Keshub Mitter, to be known two decades later as Sir Keshub, and his physician, Dr. Ashim Lal Roy, both prominent members of the most progressive, most Westernized segment of Bengali society, the Brahmo Samaj, had attempted to dissuade him. The two men had cited example after example of astrologically arranged marriages, full of astral promise, turning disastrous. The only worthwhile dowry, they'd proclaimed, is an educated bride. Child-marriage is barbarous. How could horoscopes influence lives, especially obscure lives, in dusty villages like Mishtigunj? Jai Krishna knew these men to be eaters of beef and drinkers of gin. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I consider myself a student of modern science,&quot; Jai Krishna had explained, &quot;and because I am a student of modern science, I cannot reject any theory until I test it.&quot; And so far, the tests had all turned out positive. His two older daughters, seven and nine, were successfully married and would soon be moving to their husbands' houses and living as wives, then as mothers. They were placid and obedient daughters who would make loving and obedient wives. Tara Lata, his favorite, would be no exception. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the wintry bright hour just before twilight blackens Mishtigunj, the decorated bajra from the Lahiri family finally sailed into view. The bride's female relatives stood at the stone bathing-steps leading from the steep bank down to the river as servants prepared to help the groom's party of two hundred disembark. Women began the oo-loo ululation, the almost instrumental, pitched-voice welcome. Two of Jai Krishna's younger brothers supervised the unrolling of mats on the swampy path that connected the private dock and Jai Krishna's two-storied brick house. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bajra anchored, but none on board rushed to the deck railings to be ceremoniously greeted by the welcoming party of the bride's relatives. The bridegroom's father and uncles had a servant deliver a cruel message in an insulting tone to the bride's father. They would not disembark on Jai Krishna's property for Jai Krishna and his entire clan were carriers of a curse, and that curse, thanks to Jai Krishna's home-destroying, misfortune-showering daughter, had been visited on their sinless son instead of on Jai Krishna's flesh-and-blood. They demanded that Jai Krishna meet them in the sheltered cabin of the bajra. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jai Krishna ordered the wedding musicians to stop their shenai playing and dhol beating. His women relatives, shocked at the tone in which the servant repeated his master's message to Jai Krishna babu, the renowned Dacca lawyer, had given up their conch shell blowing and their ululating on their own. For several minutes, Jai Krishna stood still on the bathing-steps, trying to conceal at first his bewilderment, then his fury, that the man who was to have full patriarchal authority over his beloved daughter had called her names. Then he heard a bullying voice from inside the cabin yell instructions to the boatmen to pull up anchor. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They're bargaining for more dowry,&quot; muttered one of Jai Krishna's brothers. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No beggar is as greedy as that Lahiri bastard!&quot; spat another brother. \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two boatmen played at reeling in ropes and readying the bajra to sail back. \n (Continues...) \n Excerpted from Desirable Daughters by Bharati Mukherjee.

His head was beaten and there were five stab wounds in his body, the police said.\nRehana Hossain, 24, said she was in her room on the second floor of 934 40th Street, when her brother, Azim, and his wife called for her. They had heard screaming from the street, said Ms. Hossain, who is not related to Mr. Hossain.\n''My brother called the police,'' she said. ''We all went down, my whole family, and we saw the blood and the police and everyone came.''\nThe police said yesterday that they did not believe that robbery was a motive, or that the violence was gang related. They also said they did not think that Mr. Hossain had been killed because of his ethnicity.\n''It seems this was the result of an earlier dispute, so the parties were somewhat known to each other,'' a police official said. The police said they did not know the nature of the earlier dispute or who was the aggressor in the later encounter.\nYesterday, friends and relatives gathered around Mr. Hossain's mother, Rahma Begum, who lay sobbing on her son's bed in the family's small apartment at 844 42nd Street, a few blocks from the scene of the killing. Mr. Hossain's father, Mohammed Alam, was in Bangladesh, helping his oldest daughter, who was recently told by doctors that she had throat cancer, relatives said.\nThe youngest of five children, Mr. Hossain was the first in his family to attend college in the United States, they said. He was studying electrical engineering, excelled in math and science and loved to play soccer and program computers.\nAsm Alahuddin, Mr. Hossain's uncle, said his nephew ''was the youngest, but also the smartest and the wisest. ''The whole family's hope was with him,'' Mr. Alahuddin said.\nMr. Hossain had one scrape with the law a few years ago at John Jay High School, where he was arrested in connection with a fistfight, relatives said. But he had steered clear of trouble since, they said.\n''He was ambitious, and he was going to be very successful,'' said Enamul Hoque, a family friend. ''We are all in so much grief now.''\nOn the street where the killing happened, more than 100 Bangladeshi men gathered yesterday afternoon under a sea of umbrellas to pray in a driving rain.\nWearing signs that read ''Justice for Hossain'' and ''Stop the killing in the street,'' men wearing kufis and flowing robes stood alongside others dressed in leather jackets and baseball caps, filling a city block. The men prayed, their palms held aloft toward their faces, lips moving silently.\n''Today it is one father's son, tomorrow it is my son, the next day someone else's son,'' said Jamal Uddin, a Bangladeshi who lives in the neighborhood and came to pray. ''It is a tragedy for all of us.''"}, {"text": "Pennies an Hour, and No Way Up\n2002-07-06T05:00:00.000Z\nIn last week's meeting in Canada, the Group of Eight industrial nations grappled with the question of how to better economic conditions in poor nations. One powerful means would be to improve the conditions of workers in sweatshops. Two billion people in the world make less than two American dollars a day. As voters and consumers of sweatshop products, Americans can make a difference in ending the miserable conditions under which these people work.\nSome argue that sweatshops are simply a step up a ladder toward the next generation's success: the garment worker at her loom is carrying out some objective law of development, or the young girl making toys for our children is breaking out of male-dominated feudalism. This line of thinking recalls the mythic rise of our immigrant ancestors to the middle class and beyond.\nBut the real story of those white ethnic ancestors was hardly a smooth ride up the escalator. Life in a New York was better than oppression abroad, but people worked 16 hours a day for paltry wages, lived in cellars with raw sewage, died of starvation and fever and were crowded into tenements. Their misery shocked reformers like Jacob Riis and Charles Dickens. They fought their way out -- marched for economic justice, built unions, voted and finally forced the Gilded Age to become the New Deal.\nToday young, mostly female workers in Bangladesh, a Muslim country that is the fourth-largest garment producer for the United States market, are paid an average of 1.6 cents for each baseball cap with a Harvard logo that they sew. The caps retail at the Harvard bookstore for $17, which means the garment workers, who often are younger than the Harvard students, are being paid a tenth of 1 percent of the cap's price in the market. Also in Bangladesh, women receive 5 cents for each $17.99 Disney shirt they sew. Wages like these are not enough to climb the ladder with.\nThere are similar conditions in China. Three million young Chinese women working for wages as low as 12 cents an hour make 80 percent of the sporting goods and toys sold in the United States each year. Companies like Mattel spend 30 times more to advertise a toy than they pay the workers in China to make it.\nEach year Americans buy 924 million garments and other textile items made in Bangladesh and $23.5 billion worth of toys and sporting goods from China. Don't we have the consumer and political power to pressure our corporations to end sweatshop wages paid to the people who make these goods? These workers are not demanding stock options and Jazzercise studios. Women in Bangladesh say they could care for their children if their wages rose to 34 cents an hour, two-tenths of 1 percent of the retail price of the Harvard hat.\nSome economists argue that even the most exploited and impoverished workers are better off than those who are unemployed or trapped in slave labor. But that argument is not about offering anyone a ladder up, but about which ring of Dante's inferno people in developing nations are consigned to. We don't want Disney, Mattel, Wal-Mart or other major American companies to leave the developing world. We simply want to end the race to the bottom in which companies force countries to compete in offering the lowest wages for their people's labor. There should be a floor beneath which no one has to live.\nOur elected officials should end their subservience to corporate donors and begin asking some big questions: Aren't we entitled to know the addresses of corporate sweatshops in developing countries so they can be open to monitoring by local advocates? Why should our tax dollars subsidize government purchases from companies that operate sweatshops?\nUnder our customs laws, we ban imports made with inmate and indentured labor, so why not extend the ban to include those made with sweatshop and child labor? And if we insist on enforcement of laws against pirate labels and CD's, why not protect 16-year-olds who make CD's for American companies? We should be helping these workers elbow and push their way up from squalor just as American progressives once helped our immigrant forebears."}, {"text": "Independence for Kashmir Could Have Advantages for India\n2002-01-07T05:00:00.000Z\nWar will surely be avoided this time around \u2014 the international pressures on India and Pakistan are too strong. But is there any hope at all that the Kashmir dispute, source of several wars between now-nuclear powers and cause of thousands of deaths in an ongoing insurgency, can be resolved?\nOn the face of it the answer is \"no.\" The struggle is not just about land. It goes to the heart of the ideological divide which accompanied the division of British-ruled India in 1948.\nFor India, the inclusion of a predominantly Muslim state within the borders of a plural nation is a living symbol of the country's secular status. As with Palestine, the division of India was forced on the majority by the colonial power, which yielded to pressure to carve out a separate state foran ethnic/religious minority.\nFor Pakistanis, Kashmir is rightfully theirs as heirs to the Muslim-majority areas of British India. Given a democratic opportunity, Kashmiris would have chosen to join Pakistan in 1948, and they would do so today were they given self-determination.\nNor is there much prospect that the status quo in Kashmir can be changed by force. India has shown determination and ruthlessness in dealing with an insurgency that is backed by Pakistan but also has significant local support. Militant Islamic groups, helped by Pakistan intelligence, have raised the tempo of insurgency but not to anywhere near the point where Indian control becomes untenable. Pakistan is too weak ever to wrest Kashmir away by military means, and for India a conquest of the Pakistan-controlled portion would be more problem than it was worth.\nSo the prospect is for no war but no peace for the Kashmir valley, whatever Pakistan now does to rein in the militants. For India, its oppressive counterinsurgency policies will remain a serious blot on its liberal and democratic traditions.\nBut is there not a way out in Kashmiri independence? Politically this would be very difficult for a democratic India to accept. Kashmir has become such a symbol of national unity. There are genuine fears that independence for Kashmir would be a first step in the breakup of the Indian union into various ethnic and linguistic entities.\nBut there is a precedent \u2014 Bangladesh.\nIndia played the key role in the breakaway of the former East Pakistan to form Bangladesh. Its primary motive was to weaken Pakistan, but at the time there were fears that India's sponsorship of a new state based on ethnic identity would have dangers for India's own unity.\nChina in particular warned that India could reap a secessionist whirlwind.\nThe West simply saw, in Henry Kissinger's words, an international \"basket case.\" In fact, Bangladesh has proved quite a successful state, raising itself up from dependence on food aid, outperforming Pakistan in economic growth, in literacy and in social development, and creating few problems with neighbors or internationally.\nAlthough it is the most homogeneous nation in the subcontinent, its existence has not led to an upsurge in separatism in India, nor to any significant movement for the reunification of Bengal into a single nation of 200 million people. Bangladesh has worked both for its inhabitants and for stability on the subcontinent.\nPakistan has more to fear than India from an independent Kashmir. Like the secession of Bangladesh, it would strike at the root of Pakistan's raison d'\u00eatre as inheritor of the Muslim parts of British India and as a state in which Islam was supposed to override ethnic, linguistic and geographic differences.There are complications that would require boundary changes for Kashmir. India would reasonably want to keep non-Muslim areas around Jammu in the extreme south and mountainous Ladakh, which is Buddhist and has a long, disputed and strategically important border with China.\nBut these issues are resolvable. And an independent Kashmir, with or without the Pakistani-ruled portion, would be tied more closely to India than to Pakistan. Meanwhile, if the Kashmir issues were defused, Pakistan's attention would shift to its western frontiers. Economic cooperation with Indian Punjab could flourish.\nA self-confident India that has held together well is making economic progress, has a workable if messy political system and would do well to think constructively about how to resolve its biggest national as well as international problem.\n-\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, {"text": "The Melting (Freezing) of Antarctica; Deciphering Contradictory Climate Patterns Is Largely a Matter of Ice\n2002-04-02T05:00:00.000Z\nAntarctica is experiencing some of the fastest warming in the world. Antarctica is cooling.\nSome of its glaciers are thinning. Some are thickening. Ice shelves are disappearing. More sea ice is forming.\nScientists have reported all this in recent months. It may all be true, even the contradictory parts.\n''Confusing, isn't it?'' asked Dr. Eric Rignot, a glacier expert at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.\nDr. Peter T. Doran, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, agreed. ''It's a mixed bag of signals.''\nThe reason is that Antarctica is not a single, simple place. At 5.4 million square miles, it is one-third larger than the United States, and just as the Midwest may experience a heat wave while the Northeast is unusually cool, climate does not move in lock step across Antarctica. Those warning of dire consequences from global warming and those playing down the dangers of heat-trapping greenhouse gases can both find pieces of data to support their views.\n''People forget that it's a continent,'' said Dr. David Vaughan, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey. ''We don't expect everything to be the same across Asia when climate changes. It's the same thing there.''\nAntarctica's role in climate and the oceans is largely a story of ice. Ninety percent of the world's ice lies either on the continent, in ice sheets that are on average 1.3 miles thick, or in sheets that have flowed offshore to form floating platforms of ice along the coast, hundreds to thousands of feet thick. The largest of these, the Ross Ice Shelf, covers 200,000 square miles, an area about the size of France.\nThe third component of Antarctic ice is a thin layer of frozen ocean, or sea ice, that grows and shrinks with the seasons. A few feet thick, sea ice covers one million square miles of ocean in summer and grows to six million square miles in winter, doubling the size of the continent.\nNews like the disintegration of an ice shelf the size of Rhode Island a month ago conjures a vision that a warming world will lead to doom by drowning -- not from melting ice shelves, which like melting ice in a glass do not change water levels, but from melting ice sheets sending their fresh water flowing toward the sea. If all of Antarctica's ice sheets turned to water, the world's oceans would deepen by more than 200 feet.\nThat will not happen. Annual temperatures in the Antarctic interior average minus 70 degrees or colder. Even a 10-degree temperature rise -- greater than climate models' worst-case predictions -- would leave almost all of the ice frozen.\nBut ice sheets along the warmer coastal fringes of Antarctica are more vulnerable to melting. Even modest sea-level rises could increase flooding of coastal lands like Bangladesh, Florida and even Manhattan. Shifting ice could also divert the ocean currents that circle the continent, possibly disrupting the global flow of ocean water and altering the climate still further.\nThe changes in the Antarctic landscape do not have a single cause. Some are part of the natural cycles of the continent. Some are probably delayed effects of the end of the last ice age. Some may have been brought on by the warming trend of the last century.\nOn the spindly peninsula that stretches out toward South America, temperatures have risen rapidly, nearly 5 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 50 years, about 10 times as much as the average temperature rise worldwide.\nThe consequences have been quick and startling.\nWith summer temperatures now regularly rising above freezing, ice melts into puddles on the top of ice shelves along the peninsula. The water flows down into cracks in the ice, its weight forcing the cracks wider until large sections of the shelf shatter with surprising quickness.\n''There's no doubt these ice shelves are disappearing because of this warming trend,'' said Dr. Rignot of NASA.\nIn 1995, researchers started noticing the disintegration of the Larsen Ice Shelf, on the northeastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula, when the northernmost section, known as Larsen A, shattered into shards. In 1998, the middle portion, Larsen B, started shrinking, losing 1,000 square miles over four years.\nThen, in February, a 1,250-square-mile section -- larger than Rhode Island -- started splintering, and in just over a month, it was gone, sending billions of tons of ice floating into the ocean to melt. Scientists expect the remaining nub of Larsen B and C, the last section of the shelf, to fall apart in the coming years.\nAlthough their destruction does not directly raise sea level, the shelves had acted like door jambs against inland ice sheets. The sheets may now flow more quickly to the sea; the new ice displaces water and raises sea levels, the way extra ice cubes raise the water level in a glass.\nA melting ice shelf is not necessarily a sign of human-induced global warming. Ice shelves have grown and shrunk through the ages, mirroring the natural cooling and warming of the climate.\nIn a core of sediments taken from the sea floor that was once covered by the Larsen A Ice Shelf, researchers led by Dr. Eugene W. Domack, a professor of geology at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., found the tiny fossils of marine algae. The finding indicates that this part of the ice shelf had been open water at least once before. The shelf probably melted about 6,000 years ago in a previous warm spell, Dr. Domack said, and remained open water until refreezing during the Little Ice Age about 700 years ago, then remained frozen until it fell apart in 1995.\nUnder the Larsen B, however, the researchers found no algae remains in the sediments, indicating that this shelf had remained intact since it formed during the last full-fledged ice age, more than 10,000 years ago, until its demise last month.\nDr. Theodore A. Scambos, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, said the long life of Larsen B ''makes you think there's something particularly unusual about this warming'' -- perhaps evidence that the warming has been brought on by artificial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.\nAlmost at the same time of Larsen B's demise, further to the south, an iceberg the size of Delaware broke off the floating part of the Thwaites Glacier. A few months earlier, parts of the Ross Ice Shelf broke off. But these two events, scientists say, are not unusual. As glaciers flow into the water, the ice shelves grow until some point when a large iceberg breaks off, and then the process is repeated. The part of the Ross Ice Shelf where the iceberg broke away is now the same smaller size it was when the explorers Robert F. Scott and Ernest Shackleton observed it at the start of the 20th century.\nThe melting of the Larsen and other peninsula ice shelves will also not have worldwide repercussions. The amount of ice on the peninsula is relatively small, potentially contributing only a small rise in sea level.\nThe rest of Antarctica shows no signs of widespread warming. In an article in the journal Nature in January, Dr. Doran of the University of Illinois and his colleagues reported that temperatures in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, a rocky, ice-free area west of the Ross Ice Shelf, had cooled about 2 degrees Fahrenheit from 1979 to 1998. Extrapolating that data with other temperature measurements in other parts of Antarctica from the past 35 years, they concluded that Antarctica as a whole has cooled, too.\nScientists at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center have also reported that satellite measurements show that sea ice now covers about 2 percent more area around Antarctica than it did two decades ago, another suggestion of recent cooling.\nBecause climate naturally warms and cools on cycles lasting for decades, the observed Antarctic cooling does not disprove the idea of human-induced global warming. Scientists cannot say yet whether the cooling is a short-term blip masking a long-term warming trend or a long-term trend contrary to their predictions. ''It may still warm,'' Dr. Doran said. ''It's not really making up its mind yet.''\nIn a comparison of 17 computer models of world climate, all predict global warming will kick in over Antarctica, and most indicate temperatures in the interior of the continent will rise faster than in the rest of the world, said Dr. Benjamin D. Santer, an atmospheric scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. ''There is a common warming signal,'' he said.\nBecause ice reflects most light and heat back into space, the exposed water will absorb more heat as sea ice melts, and further add to the warming.\nCounterintuitively, global warming would actually lower sea levels at first. In warmer temperatures, evaporation of ocean water increases and more snow falls, more than offsetting the melting ice at the edges. But over the longer term -- perhaps centuries, perhaps thousands of years -- prolonged warmth in Antarctica would add to the ocean depths.\nOf particular worry is West Antarctica, where most of the bedrock lies below sea level. That makes the ice sheet on top more vulnerable to warming waters lapping at its edges. The worry is not entirely theoretical. Scientists have found algae remains beneath the West Antarctic ice far inland from the present ocean, a sign that the ice sheet had entirely melted at some time in the last two million years. But the fossil evidence gives little hint how quickly the melt occurred or its cause.\nScientists do not have a good sense of the current trends, because until a few years ago, data came from only a few ground-based weather stations. With satellites, scientists now keep close watch of changes to Antarctica as they occur. ''We can get images of what happened yesterday on the computer,'' said Dr. Rignot. ''That changes everything for glaciologists.''\nIn December, Dr. Rignot reported on satellite measurements indicating that the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West Antarctica were thinning and speeding up, losing about 36 cubic miles in the last decade. A month later, other researchers, including Dr. Ian R. Joughin, an engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory with an office near Dr. Rignot's, reported a change with opposite effect nearby. Two of the ice streams that flow in the Ross Ice Shelf have slowed, they said, and that area of Antarctica is gaining mass.\nNeither the slowdown in the Ross ice streams nor the speed-up of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers results from climate changes, at least not recent ones. One Ross ice stream stopped flowing 150 years ago.\nEven if the Antarctic warms in coming years, some glaciers will not be affected for a long time. Ice does not conduct heat well, and a rise of a few degrees in the air would take thousands of years to affect a glacier base a mile away, where it could lubricate the flow.\nThe thinning of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers ''may be a direct impact of global warming that happened 20,000 years ago,'' said Dr. Robert Bindschadler, a glaciologist at Goddard. ''It may be only now that Antarctica is getting around to its full-fledged response to that.''\nIn Antarctica, climate change sometimes takes its time."}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED: ANOTHER EXPATRIATE; Long-Vanished U.S. Student, And a Clue on a Kabul Floor\n2002-02-06T05:00:00.000Z\nAt Perth Amboy High, Hiram Torres was the valedictorian of the class of 1993, the son of a seamstress who charted a course from his hard-edged industrial hometown in New Jersey to Yale University.\nHe was also a headstrong teenager whose best friend said he nursed a disgust for American culture and a vision of traveling the world and becoming a revolutionary. He left Yale barely a month into his freshman year, moved to Bangladesh and then Pakistan, and last called his mother in 1998 to say he was studying in Afghanistan. She has not heard from him since.\nBut in December, Mr. Torres's name, his address in New Jersey and telephone number and other personal information were found on what appears to be a list of recruits left in a house in Kabul that neighbors said had been used by pro-Taliban Pakistani militants. The undated document, found by a reporter for The New York Times, says that Mr. Torres became a Muslim 10 months earlier in Pakistan and that he is also known as Mohammed Salman. ''He is 20 years old, unmarried, knows driving,'' the document says. Mr. Torres would now be 27, suggesting that the list is seven years old.\nThe document is just one clue in the mystery of Hiram Torres's fate. Unlike John Walker Lindh, who was captured after fighting for the Taliban, there is no indication that Mr. Torres joined the anti-American forces in Afghanistan. But Mr. Torres is apparently the only American besides Mr. Walker whose name has been found connected in any way to militant groups that operated in Afghanistan.\nThe list, written in Urdu with some parts in English, includes the names of 17 other young men, 16 with Pakistani home addresses and one from Saudi Arabia. Code names are listed for many of them.\nAlthough the list does not carry the name of any organization, it was found in a house strewn with documents and materials from Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, a Pakistani group with ties to Al Qaeda. Among the papers were tickets, passenger lists and boarding passes from an Indian Airlines flight hijacked in 1999, which Indian officials ascribed to Harkat.\nBy all appearances, the two-story house in the diplomatic section of Kabul was used as a base by the Pakistani militants. There were also business cards and stationery from Harkat, as well as combat and bomb-making manuals in Urdu, Arabic and English, and Qaeda military documents, apparently distributed by Osama bin Laden's group. Two of the other names on the list that includes Mr. Torres's were identified on the document as ''previously related to Harkat ul-Mujahedeen.'' In an indictment unsealed yesterday, prosecutors said Mr. Lindh trained in a Harkat camp in Pakistan before entering Afghanistan.\nAmerican military and intelligence officials said they were unaware of Mr. Torres's identity or possible presence in Afghanistan. Officials at the United States Central Command, which is in charge of military operations in Afghanistan, said he was not being held as a detainee.\nHis mother, Olga Torres, who now lives in Puerto Rico, was stunned when told of the discovery of the list containing the name of her missing son, and she feared the worst. ''I always think of him,'' she said, weeping. ''I'm afraid he's dead. I don't know what to say.''\nThe full story of Hiram Torres may never be known, but his eventual transformation to Mohammed Salman was foreshadowed during his years in Perth Amboy.\nHe grew up with his mother, a garment factory worker, in an apartment in a small building with a postage-stamp yard. The front windows look out on a narrow residential street crammed with other duplex houses. The rear windows overlook a truck depot.\nTeachers at Perth Amboy High School said Mr. Torres was an introvert but an academic standout. His grades averaged 97 out of 100, and he scored 1350 on his SAT, according to records released by his mother and the school, and had nearly perfect attendance. Fluent in English and Spanish, he also studied German, Russian and Latin.\nSome teachers also remember a hostile, alienated edge. They said Mr. Torres could be opinionated and difficult to deal with, and they remember his speaking his mind in a rude manner. He boycotted the National Honor Society, and at graduation refused to give his speech as valedictorian because school officials insisted that they be allowed to approve his text in advance, according to teachers, who asked not to be identified.\nMr. Torres formed a bond with Sachin Timbadia, the class salutatorian, the eldest son of a divorced mother of three from India. Bright and bored, Mr. Timbadia said they were alienated by American society and shared a contempt for the shallowness of their surroundings. ''The culture of America, the materialism of America,'' he said. ''The mediocrity around us.''\nMr. Timbadia, who has not seen his friend since they graduated but is eager to find him, said they had envisioned traveling the world and becoming revolutionaries. They vicariously escaped Perth Amboy by devouring books on World War II, moving through the philosophical treatises of Kafka and Kierkegaard and ultimately on to the Bible, the Koran and the Bhagavad-Gita. They read about secret societies and spy groups. In his bedroom, Mr. Torres hung a flag from ''The Iron Guard,'' a fascist, anti-Semitic Romanian secret society, Mr. Timbadia said.\n''His dream was to be part of a revolution somewhere,'' Mr. Timbadia recalled. As a senior, he said, Mr. Torres refused to have his yearbook picture taken, explaining that he ''wanted to keep a low profile in case something happened in the future.''\nHe said Mr. Torres explored several religions while in high school, including Buddhism. By his senior year, he was trying to teach himself to read Arabic. But Mr. Timbadia said he never knew of Mr. Torres visiting a mosque or practicing Islam. Instead, Mr. Timbadia said their interests were constantly shifting, part of a search for meaning. Hiram Torres had a yearning for rigor in his life and ''to belong,'' Mr. Timbadia recalled.\n''During the whole four years we were just spouting whatever we were reading,'' he said. But he said he did not think Mr. Torres would use violence. ''I can't recollect any episodes where his anger came out,'' he said. ''There was not any violence in this guy. It was just a lack of personal attention, lack of structure, lack of discipline.''\nMr. Timbadia took the youthful yearnings for revolution less seriously. After graduating from New York University, he became a software consultant in Silicon Valley.\nThe two friends had grown distant by the end of their senior year in high school. Mr. Timbadia was no longer committed to their dream of fleeing, feeling he had to help his mother raise his two younger siblings. A few days before graduation, Mr. Torres asked Mr. Timbadia whether he was still interested. He said no. ''At graduation, he came over and said, 'Good luck,' '' Mr. Timbadia recalled. ''That was the last time I saw him.''\nDuring high school, Mr. Torres had participated in the Upward Bound program for talented, low-income minority high school students at nearby Rutgers University, and there had befriended a student whose family was from Bangladesh. The summer after graduation, he traveled with the boy and some of his relatives to Bangladesh.\nMr. Torres returned from a month in Bangladesh a changed person, his mother said. When Ms. Torres picked him up at the airport, he was wearing a white sharwal kamiz, the flowing, baggy pants and shirt worn throughout the Indian subcontinent.\n''I did not recognize him,'' she recalled. ''He said, 'That is the country where I want to live.' ''\nMs. Torres said her son began wrapping sheets around his head like a turban at home and expressed anger at the poverty he saw in Bangladesh. He also praised the role of women there.\n''He said he liked it over there because women respect the men,'' his mother said, in an interview in Puerto Rico. ''They didn't act that way in the States.''\nMs. Torres managed to talk him into following through with his plans to attend Yale. But it was clear that his heart was no longer in college. He lasted barely a month at Yale and officially withdrew on Oct. 20, 1993, a university spokesman said.\nWilliam DiCanzio, who was dean of the residence where Mr. Torres had been assigned, wrote in a letter to Mr. Torres's mother that he was ''very surprised by Hiram's decision which he made without consulting me.'' In an interview, Mr. DiCanzio said he remembered the incident largely because it was unusual for a student to leave college so quickly. He declined further comment, citing privacy issues.\nAfter leaving Yale, Mr. Torres lived for several months with an aunt outside Boston and worked odd jobs, saying he was saving money to return to Bangladesh. He told his mother he preferred the culture there to that of the United States. But still she thought it was a bluff. ''I didn't think he would do it,'' his mother said.\nHe spent the Christmas holidays with his mother in Perth Amboy, and she said she last saw him on New Year's Day 1994.\nMr. Torres called his mother after arriving in Bangladesh. But he did not stay there long. Several months later, he called her again, this time from Pakistan.\nShe heard from him for the next several months through intermittent calls from Pakistan or messages relayed through friends. But eventually -- Ms. Torres cannot remember precisely when -- her son called to say he was in Afghanistan. When she asked what he was doing, he said he was studying. His calls grew less frequent. She said she heard from him last in 1998, when he said he was still in Afghanistan, studying.\nShe has had no trace of him since, until she was shown her son's name on the list found in Kabul.\n''Do you think this will help me find him?'' she asked. ''I don't want to die before seeing him again.''"}, {"text": "Big Gas Fields Are Found in Indian Waters\n2002-12-13T05:00:00.000Z\nTwo energy companies recently found big natural gas fields off this country's southeastern coast, discoveries that could affect energy markets -- and perhaps even the military and political balance of power in southern Asia.\nReliance Industries, which is based in Bombay and is one of India's largest companies, said that each of its first five exploration wells had struck natural gas in the Krishna Godavari basin, off Andhra Pradesh. It said it had found recoverable reserves equal to more than five trillion cubic feet of natural gas, one of the world's biggest discoveries this year.\nCairn Energy, based in Edinburgh, said that it had found an additional 800 billion cubic feet of gas while drilling in an adjacent block of the sea floor.\nBoth companies plan more drilling and predicted that more gas would be found.\nThe companies discovered the gas while drilling in water up to 3,300 feet deep, a depth that will pose technical obstacles to production and require greater investment. American companies have produced gas from even deeper waters in the Gulf of Mexico, but southeastern India lacks a comparable support network of drilling and production companies and pipelines. On the plus side, though, the Indian deepwater reserves are just 30 miles offshore, making them more accessible than the gulf gas.\nCairn Energy has also found two gas fields in shallow waters even closer to shore, one on the shore side of the newly discovered deepwater reserves off Andhra Pradesh and the other off the western state of Gujarat, with reserves totaling 850 billion cubic feet, and has put both of them quickly into production. Another company, Niko Resources of Canada, has a 10 percent stake in Reliance's deepwater field and has made onshore and offshore discoveries of natural gas in Gujarat near Cairn's finds. Niko declined to estimate the reserves it has found.\nAltogether, the new reserves are not large enough to turn India into a net exporter of energy, much less make India rich. And regulatory obstacles as well as technical hurdles must be overcome before commercial production can begin.\nStill, Pierre Audinet, an expert on South Asia at the International Energy Agency in Paris, said that Reliance's discovery alone was significant. ''It's eight years of Indian demand -- that's huge,'' he said. ''You seldom hit on discoveries that yield that kind of quantities.''\nA few reserves found in recent years in the Mideast and the Canadian Arctic have been 10 times that size or more, but they have been far from major markets. And much of the delay and cost in developing gas reserves lies in the pipelines or liquefying plants needed so the gas can be transported.\nIn India, gas accounts for just 4.3 percent of total energy consumption. Beyond that, the country relies heavily on cheap domestically mined coal, which contributes to severe air pollution in big cities.\nIf the new deepwater gas can be brought to market at an affordable price, it could reduce India's need to proceed with current negotiations to buy gas from fields that Exxon Mobil is helping to develop in Qatar and that Unocal is developing in Bangladesh, Mr. Audinet said. By disclosing the success of its initial exploration wells, Reliance may discourage bankers from lending money for the construction of pipelines and liquefied natural gas terminals to receive gas from other countries, he said.\nBesides being bad news for Qatar and Bangladesh, the latest discoveries could affect India's strategic posture. The Indian Navy is starting to see the offshore energy discoveries, and the need to defend them, as a way to press for more money and new vessels, according to Brahma Chellaney, a professor of strategic studies at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi.\nIndia's military budgets have long favored the army and, to a lesser extent, the air force, which defend against China to the north and Pakistan to the west. But China has begun building an oceangoing navy, which would approach India from the east, and it has been setting up listening posts in southern Burma to monitor military activity along India's eastern seaboard.\nIndian governments ''have sort of neglected the navy in the last decade,'' Mr. Chellaney said, ''and they need to get on with modernization.''\nCharles Lucas-Clements, a natural gas specialist in the Houston office of the IHS Energy Group, one of the world's biggest energy consulting firms, said that Reliance's claim to have found a field with such extensive reserves appeared credible. Reliance's discovery is likely to be the first of many in the area, he said, because India's southeastern coastal waters are just beginning to be explored seriously and because natural gas fields are almost invariably found in clusters.\n''If you find a really big field, you'll find a lot of midsize fields'' nearby, Mr. Lucas-Clements said, predicting that at least 10 trillion cubic feet of reserves would be found altogether by Reliance, Cairn and other companies that may buy exploration rights in the vicinity in future auctions by the Indian government.\nIndia is one of the few large energy markets with coastal waters that have not had much energy exploration. For many years, offshore exploration was a monopoly of the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Company, which was not very aggressive. Only in the mid-1990's did India begin allowing private companies to search offshore for oil and gas.\nYet in addition to being deep underwater, Reliance's gas is also far from the country's biggest users of natural gas -- power plants in Bombay and a huge fertilizer industry in Gujarat state -- and a pipeline would need to be built.\nMichael Watts, the exploration director at Cairn Energy, said that Andhra Pradesh itself could use only the natural gas from one trillion cubic feet of reserves. The state is heavily agricultural beyond the computer-programming industry here in the state capital, Hyderabad.\nHe estimated that it would cost $300 million to $500 million to develop Reliance's deepwater gas fields and build a pipeline to shore, plus $500 million or more to build a pipeline to Bombay or perhaps New Delhi, where power plants would have to be converted to run on gas.\nReliance declined to make executives available for comment.\nEven more formidable than the technical challenges are India's labyrinthine rules for foreign investments and its tangled electricity policies, other energy experts said. Cairn and even Reliance are likely to need big international partners with a lot of experience in offshore gas production before developing the fields off Andhra Pradesh, energy experts say. Natural gas projects are built on trust because nearly all of the cost is incurred at the beginning and the revenues come only over the next couple of decades, usually from long-term contracts signed with gas users before construction begins.\nForeign investors became especially wary of India's energy market after Enron built the first phase and part of the second phase of a $2.9 billion gas-fired power plant near Bombay, only to find that the state-owned electricity distribution authority was unwilling to pay the price for electricity that Enron thought had been agreed on.\nReliance is one of the most politically powerful conglomerates in India so it may have the extra muscle needed to sign enforceable long-term contracts with gas customers; Cairn may choose Indian partners to help develop its finds.\nMr. Lucas-Clements, the consultant, said that ''Indians within the country may have more leverage than foreign investors'' to make sure that contracts were binding."}, {"text": "Pakistani Group Offers Bleak View of Pakistan's Rights Record\n2002-03-29T05:00:00.000Z\nA report by a Pakistani human rights organization paints a bleak picture of respect for human dignity here, particularly for women and children.\nEvery day, on average, two women are victims of so-called honor killings, slain by a male relative for having ''dishonored'' the family name, usually by marrying without permission. The killers are rarely punished, the report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan notes.\nOver all, the report says, women have ''almost no rights'' and are ''bound to follow the wishes of male family members.''\nNearly half the country's children are malnourished, physical and sexual abuse of children is ''rampant'' and young boys are smuggled to the Middle East to serve as jockeys in camel races, the report says.\n''There is a lack of governance, and a gap between the rhetoric and actual practices,'' Asma Jehangir, a lawyer and a member of the executive council of the organization, said today, summarizing the report. Government officials have made repeated promises to improve the plight of women, but they have failed to act, Ms. Jehangir said.\n''When so many things are happening in this region, important things like human rights are not put in their proper perspective,'' she said.\nThe organization does commend the government of President Pervez Musharraf for getting tougher on Islamic militants who carry out acts of violence.\nIn the past, these militant groups have had the support of Pakistan's intelligence services. General Musharraf has banned several militant groups and detained hundreds of men suspected of terrorist acts.\nBut the rights group said the measures ''appeared to be motivated by a need to appease powerful forces abroad, rather than a commitment to serve the interests of people within the country.''\nPolitical activity has been restricted by the government of General Musharraf, who seized power in 1999.\nThe organization's 369-page report, ''State of Human Rights in 2001,'' was issued on Wednesday. Founded in 1986, the group now has offices throughout the country and a Web site, www.hrcp-web.org.\nExpanding the conventional definition of human rights beyond issues like press and religious freedom, elections, and torture and killings by the police, the report looks at social and economic conditions, including health and education.\nThe mortality rate for mothers is 700 per 100,000 live births, one of the highest in the world. The infant mortality rate is 91 per 100,000 live births, the highest in South Asia.\nThe government spends less than 1 percent of the gross national product on health, a smaller percentage than in Haiti, Bangladesh or Ethiopia, according to the report.\nEarlier this month, the United States State Department, in its annual human rights report, had a similarly critical assessment of Pakistan.\nThe State Department said the judiciary was marked by corruption and inefficiency and was subject to government pressure; the police committed murder, rape and other abuses; ''debt slavery persisted''; and women ''were subjected to violence, abuse, rape and other forms of degradation.''\nOn the positive side, the State Department concluded that the Pakistani press was able to publish ''relatively freely,'' although there was some self-censorship on important intelligence and military matters."}, {"text": "MEANWHILE : Help in little cartons for the learning poor\n2002-11-19T05:00:00.000Z\nIn the densely packed slums that line the alleys of Kalianyar in west Jakarta, times are tough and getting tougher. Some of the textile factories that provided work in this neighborhood have closed. Indonesia's coordinating minister for social welfare, Jusuf Kalla, warned recently that the Bali terrorist bombings had frightened foreign tourists away in such numbers that another 2 million Indonesians could be jobless in the next few months.\nThis would increase the number of unemployed in Indonesia to about 40 million, nearly one-fifth of the population.\nMany millions more work only part-time for wages that are barely enough to live on.\nSo it is hardly surprising that Mintarsih relishes the small packets of milk and biscuits she receives free of charge three times a week at her madrasah, or school for Muslim girls and boys.\n\"I prefer the chocolate-flavored milk,\" she said. \"The food I'm given is one of the reasons my mother wants me to go to school.\"\nAbout 600,000 Indonesian schoolchildren are receiving hygienically-sealed cartons of cows' milk, which has been processed so that it is free of harmful bacteria and packaged so that it will last for more than six months without refrigeration. Another 400,000 schoolchildren get a beverage made from soy beans. Both drinks contain calcium and protein. They are also fortified with vitamins and other nutrients.\n\"School children in Indonesia and many other parts of the world go to classes without a proper breakfast or with no breakfast at all,\" said Suharto, a former senior Indonesian health and education official. \"That makes it hard for them to concentrate.\"\nSuharto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, is vice chairman of a foundation that promotes better nutrition and health in schools in Indonesia. The program is supported in part by the sale of surplus milk powder and wheat from the United States, worth around $8 million in 2002. Indonesian and foreign companies also back the program, implemented by Land O'Lakes, the largest dairy cooperative in the United States.\n\"Milk is very good for you,\" said Markus Huet, Land O'Lakes manager in Indonesia. \"But it is relatively expensive.\" A 200-milliliter (fourth-tenths of a pint) carton of milk of the kind Mintarsih drinks at school costs around 1,250 rupiah (about 13 U.S. cents) to provide. Most parents who send their children to the school are very poor. The most they can afford to provide each is 500 to 1,000 rupiah per day to buy some food or a drink from street vendors and small shops near the school, which has no playground or canteen.\nA total of 63 children are taught at the school in small classrooms that are stiflingly hot and have barely any teaching aides beyond wooden desks, basic text books and a blackboard.\nAmir Mahmudin, the headmaster, said that since the school milk and fortified biscuit distribution started three years ago, he had noticed a significant improvement in students' performance and motivation. \"Their health and concentration is better,\" Amir said.\nThe milk program in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, only reaches about 12 percent of primary school students from 6 to 12 years of age. In Thailand, which has provided free milk to kindergartens and primary schools since 1985, about 70 percent of students aged 3 to 12 years are covered.\nStudies have shown that Thai children in the program grow taller by an average of five centimeters (2 inches) per year, compared with two centimeters before the milk was provided. Their average weight is also substantially higher, and malnutrition has fallen sharply.\nThe United States backs similar milk programs in Vietnam and Bangladesh and plans to extend them to the Philippines and Cambodia. China is now expanding its own school milk program.\n\"I think they want to build a healthier, stronger, taller and smarter generation,\" said Hudson Lee, managing director for China of the Swedish-based multinational packaging company Tetra Pak, which supports the school milk programs in Southeast Asia as well as China."}, {"text": "Prom Night, Lost in Translation; Teenagers Want to Go, but Immigrant Parents Frown\n2002-06-13T05:00:00.000Z\nThe odds were not in her favor, but Nowrin Khanam, an immigrant from Bangladesh, believed the prize was worth the effort. So she begged her mother for permission to go to her senior prom.\nIt was important to fit in, she said, to spend a magical closing night of high school with friends. Her pleas did not move her mother, who wondered what people back home would think if she let her daughter stay out past dark in a place where boys and girls would dance and, worse, dance together?\n''She said, 'Next time,' but how is there going to be a next time?'' lamented Miss Khanam, 18 and heartbroken, after missing her prom last week held by Bryant High School in Long Island City, Queens. ''You only have one senior prom.''\nAcross the country, it is the season of the prom, the best of times and the worst of times for most teenagers and their parents.\nBut forget ''Pretty in Pink'' and all those Hollywood clich\u00e9s about cheerleaders and jocks and the life-altering power of a school gym draped in crepe paper. This is New York City, where nearly half the students in public high schools are recent immigrants (and nobody parties in the gym). They come from every continent, with at least as many coming-of-age rituals. Each day of being an American is an improvisation; each custom calls for examination. Here, even the choice of prom music -- American R&B, Hindi hip-hop or salsa -- calls for negotiation among cultures.\nLike Miss Khanam, who arrived three years ago, most immigrant teenagers develop an instinct for unraveling the mysteries of American teenage etiquette, taking their cues from classmates, movies and television. They soon understand the weighty significance of the prom.\nBut a lot of their immigrant parents remain, well, clueless.\nTake the case of Zhi-De Deng, a high school senior who moved with his family from China to the United States seven years ago. His mother is a garment factory worker and his father is a machinist. Neither speaks English, being preoccupied with survival and seeing their children succeed academically.\n''I think if I were to explain to my parents what the prom is, I'm sure their reactions would be 'Huh?' because I, much like my parents, was not raised in an environment where going to parties past midnight is the norm,'' Mr. Deng said.\nHe is not going to try to explain it, anyway, because Mr. Deng, a senior at Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn, professed to have absolutely no interest in his prom. ''I'm not sure either what the prom is,'' he said. ''I'm thinking: wild party. But that's based on movies, like 'American Pie.' Which I actually didn't see.''\nBut the Hollywood version of high school does not come close to the complexity of New York's schools, where national origin can define a clique and a critical mass of students from one country can operate in their own exclusive social world.\nAt several Brooklyn high schools, immigrant teenagers from the former Soviet Union have sometimes organized their own alternative parties at Russian supper clubs that students and teachers alike call the Russian prom. Such clannishness is often evident throughout the school year. At Murrow, students said, some groups lay claim to territory, with one area of the building known as the Russian area and another as the Chinese floor.\n''Certain intersections of the halls are usually populated by a certain race or people of the same cultural background,'' said Svetlana Bezinyan, a Russian-born senior.\nMs. Bezinyan, who was 9 when she immigrated to the United States, said she considered herself one of the ''more Americanized Russians,'' but had heard that other Russian immigrants at school were trying to organize a separate prom this year too.\nShe is looking forward to attending the all-school prom later this month and has already bought a ticket, at $130, and paid $140 for her share of a stretch limousine to ferry a group of friends to the event.\n''I know going into this it's not going to be a prom like in the movies,'' Ms. Bezinyan said. ''But it's nice to party with everybody. When you're in the city and everything is so diverse, it's nice to have something that kind of borders on suburban life.''\nThe cost of a city high school prom -- tickets cost $75 to $150, and clothes and the obligatory limousine must be paid for -- is enough to deter many struggling immigrant families. So does the prospect of dating, although many students said the trend this year was to go with groups of friends rather than with a date.\nIn recent years, imported popular culture, like the Bollywood films that are wildly popular with South Asian immigrants, has helped push the boundaries of acceptable teenage behavior for immigrants.\n''I'm stunned when I see Indian films these days,'' said Annetta Seecharran, the executive director of the South Asian Youth Action group in Queens. ''They're totally westernized. They totally embrace the idea of dating and partying. It wasn't anything like that in my day.''\nEmboldened by those images and the strength of greater numbers, she said, teenagers from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh seem better able to reconcile their identities. Many adopt American rituals like the senior prom as their own cultural right.\n''When I immigrated from Guyana in the 1980's, there was a very small South Asian community,'' said Ms. Seecharran, 33. ''I was embarrassed to be Indian. I wanted to be Latina so badly. With kids today, it's O.K. for them to be South Asian, but they also adopt the urban American culture.''\nJulissa Mejia, who immigrated at 6 from the Dominican Republic, had no trouble at home about the prom. She said her parents encouraged her to go because they had such fond memories of their own graduation celebration back home. But many of her classmates at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx had to invent their own ways to adapt.\n''When you're a teen, you're trying to fit in and that's your main goal,'' Miss Mejia said. ''I've got friends, like from Bangladesh, whose parents wouldn't allow them to go. I guess they have these misconceptions about the prom, that it's just drinking and dancing. So they're going to have a sleepover at someone's house.''\nFor all the diversity in New York's high schools, the senior prom can still live up to its image as a magical and equalizing moment.\nTo Eman Rimawi, a senior at Richmond Hill High School in Queens, the prom was to be a culmination of childhood dreams. ''I've been thinking about the prom since junior high and I knew exactly what kind of dress I wanted since freshman year,'' Ms. Rimawi said. ''I just knew it was going to be a wonderful night.''\nHer mother, Evonne, is part African-American and part American Indian. Her father, who died four years ago, was Palestinian. If he were alive, she said, he would not have permitted her to go to the prom, because he never wanted her to spend time with boys.\nLast week, in her tiny living room, Ms. Rimawi finally put on her sparkly red prom gown and sat fidgeting in a straight-back chair while her mother stroked makeup onto her face. Her best friend, Stefanny Moreira, an immigrant from Ecuador, had carefully arranged herself in a nearby armchair so as not to wrinkle her long cranberry-red dress.\nThe stretch Rolls-Royce limousine they had ordered was late, which was just as well because Ms. Rimawi couldn't decide how to style her hair, and when her date finally showed up, not a date-date but a friend, his shirt needed ironing. Then the doorbell rang and everybody started pinning corsages on one another and taking pictures and it was time to go."}, {"text": "U.N. Says Millions of Children, Caught in Poverty, Die Needlessly\n2002-03-14T05:00:00.000Z\nAlmost 11 million children, most of them babies, die each year of preventable causes, according to United Nations officials meeting to hammer out a strategy to save more young lives.\nThe World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund said diarrhea, malaria, measles, pneumonia, H.I.V./AIDS and malnutrition were main causes of death and resulted from the impoverished conditions of 600 million children around the world.\nThe agencies were meeting in Stockholm to work out ways to ''reach the poorest and youngest'' in advance of a United Nations special session on children in May.\nOf the preventable deaths, ''eight million are babies, half of them in the first month of life,'' said the director general of the World Health Organization, Gro Harlem Brundtland. ''These deaths were preventable and treatable, not inevitable.''\nMalnutrition causes about 60 percent of the deaths, said Carol Bellamy, executive director of Unicef.\n''It's not just food, but access to water and sanitation,'' she said.\nSome 150 million children suffer from malnutrition, Unicef said, in a new report that surveyed 110 countries from 1995 to 2000. North Korea ranked the worst, with 60 percent of children under 5 years old suffering from malnutrition. Countries in other parts of Asia and in Africa also fared poorly, particularly Afghanistan and Bangladesh.\nIn Afghanistan, malnutrition affects one out of two children, and half of all Afghan children have stunted growth, said Ms. Bellamy.\nBurundi, Cambodia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, India, Mali, Nepal, Niger and Yemen followed close behind in the number of malnourished children.\nAt greatest risk were children under 3. Many of those who did not have access to proper food, water and sanitation became weakened or ill, and frequently died. Poor diet and sanitation in early childhood contributes to vomiting and diarrhea, which weakens children and makes them more susceptible to diseases.\nUnicef and the health organization said that progress had been made in the 1990's, citing immunization programs, and that the overall total of preventable deaths had been reduced from 14 million. Contributing to this progress in the developing world has been the increase in the percentage of mothers who breast-feed infants, which is described as crucial to good childhood nutrition. Now about 45 percent of women give their babies breast milk only, up from 40 percent in earlier years.\nBut Ms. Bellamy noted that, except for Nordic nations, contributions by rich countries for development aid have gone down, leaving the poorest countries struggling to meet their populations' basic needs. ''Even the poorer countries have to invest in their services, but it's especially difficult in sub-Saharan Africa, where conflict and H.I.V./AIDS undermine efforts,'' she said.\nThe health organization said that diarrhea could be treated with oral rehydration salts that cost as little as 33 cents per treatment, and that measles could be prevented with a vaccination often costing only 26 cents. If all children were immunized against measles in their first year, most of the 600,000 deaths caused by the disease would be prevented, officials said. Dr. Brundtland said investing $66 billion annually could save eight million lives a year.\nWhile the agencies are focused on saving the lives of millions of newborns, they also said that 1.5 million teenagers, up to age 18, die each year as a result of accidents, substance abuse, suicide, violence and disease."}, {"text": "How in a Little British Town Jihad Found Young Converts\n2002-04-24T05:00:00.000Z\n TIPTON, England \u2014 The young men lived within a few blocks of one another in a Muslim pocket in this small town near Birmingham. They were out of school and often on the streets, in the occasional fight, sometime smokers of marijuana. They were, in the slang of the British Midlands, \"dossers\" \u2014 slackers, layabouts. \n So when they renounced the street for Islam, gave up their bad habits for prayer, their parents \u2014 immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh \u2014 were pleased. Neighbors were bemused: the drifters had found faith. \n Last fall, four young men announced that they were leaving for Pakistan \u2014 for a computer course, a holiday, an arranged marriage \u2014 then disappeared. Their families had no word until January, when the Foreign Office called. Three of them \u2014 Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal and Ruhal Ahmed \u2014 had been captured with the Taliban in Afghanistan and taken to Camp X-Ray in Guanta\u0301namo Bay, Cuba. \n The fourth, Munir Ali, believed to have accompanied them into Afghanistan, is missing. \n No one knows precisely what drove them to Afghanistan \u2014 whether they went to take up arms or offer aid. What is clear is that in Tipton, as across Britain, the seeds were there: a Muslim generation uncertain of its identity and prospects, angry at the treatment of Muslims the world over, and prey to recruitment, by individual journeymen and potent imagery, to militant Islam. \n The \"Tipton Taliban\" were just four young men in a corner of one small town in England. But their story is a window into the psychic journey being taken in immigrant communities across Western Europe as young Muslims are swept up by an orthodox, and often politicized, form of Islam far removed from the \"Friday Prayers\" version of their elders. \n Some of the youths are stagnant or unemployed, others breezily successful. Either way, in a poignant kink in the immigrant arc, they have often deemed immaterial all the material comforts their parents emigrated for. \n Today, the Taliban are fallen and Al Qaeda is, at least temporarily, in some disarray. The world's attention has shifted to another group of angry young Muslims \u2014 the Palestinians battling Israel. Still, here in Britain, what one jihad champion calls the \"nexus of politics and religion and frustration\" remains unbroken. If anything, it has been fortified by events in the Middle East. \n These young men were ripe for being swept up. They lived a small-town ennui that could make trouble attractive because at least it made them feel alive. Asif Iqbal, 20, was hyper and excitable. He liked to test the limits. He had left school at 16, run with a wild crowd for a while, and blown a chance at college. \n He lived with both his Pakistani-born parents but often seemed on his own. His father, 68 and retired, was busy with leisure pursuits. His mother was uneducated and mentally a bit unwell. \"He had no one to give him advice,\" a friend said. \n He worked the night shift at an office postal service and spent most of his free time in the street, other than a Sunday afternoon soccer game. In 1999, he and a friend, also now in Camp X-Ray, had fought with other Asian youths in a nearby town, hurting one so badly he was left scarred. \n A Refuge for Muslim Activists \n When he turned toward Islam, then, Asif Iqbal did not do so in half-measures. What began as a mild curiosity soon became aggressive, even confrontational. \n His path was already a well-trodden one. Britain has during the last two decades become a refuge unmatched in Europe for Muslim activists, scholars and clerics fleeing repressive governments in the Arab world or North Africa, and thus a center of Islamist influence. \n Richard Reid, who tried to detonate a shoe-bomb on a trans-Atlantic flight, came to radical Islam at London's mosques; so did Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person charged in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Djamel Beghal, accused of plotting an attack on the American Embassy in Paris, sought spiritual tutelage there. Ahmed Omar Sheikh, who is on trial in Pakistan accused of the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl, grew up in Britain, the child of prosperous Pakistani parents. \n In all, no one knows how many of the newly radicalized have actually taken the journey from Britain to jihad. But over the last decade, members of the jihad movement say, hundreds have gone for training or fighting in Bosnia, Chechnya and Afghanistan. A document found by New York Times reporters at a Kabul house used by the Islamic militant group Harkat ul-Mujahedeen lists nine trainees, identified by code name, from Britain. \n Since Sept. 11, the presence of so many radicals, and a number of tantalizing, if ambiguous, terrorist links, have prompted other European nations to accuse Britain of being soft on terrorism. \n Stung by the criticism and fearful that Britain will become a target for supporting America's war on terror, the government is using tough, even draconian, new laws to crack down on extremism. It is also trying to better understand why young men like Mr. Iqbal turn to militancy. \n The young men of Tipton are out of British hands, for now. Whether they will be tried here or in America, or simply go free, is unclear. For now, they pass their days in sunbaked cages in Camp X-Ray, far from the Midlands drizzle. \n At Ease in Neither Land \n Their families and friends have mostly put forward the same defense: the boys were too Westernized for fundamentalism to creep in. They were irreligious; they had to be prodded to mosque. They drank. They smoked. They went clubbing and chased girls. \n Asif Iqbal preferred snooker and soccer to politics, his father told one newspaper. Shafiq Rasul's brothers said he wore Armani, as if that alone was impregnable armor against extremism. \n It is a disorienting image: Muslim immigrant parents defending their children on grounds of decadence. \n But it hints at the forces pulling at this immigrant second generation, the first to be British raised. Their parents had brought their home country to their host country and so lived comfortably in both. Their sons seemed at ease in neither. \n Aziz ul-Hak, 22, was Asif Iqbal's best friend, and if, like most people here, he isn't terribly forthcoming about what happened, he is willing to talk a bit about his own \"stressful\" in-between life. \n He speaks Bengali with his father and Birmingham English with his mates. His uniform is Nikes and a baseball cap, his wife a Bangladeshi his father picked. He does not feel particularly British, but in Bangladesh that's all he feels \u2014 a rich Briton ripe for ripping off. \n His father came from Bangladesh in 1963, part of a great migration of former imperial subjects from the Indian subcontinent invited to toil in Britain's factories. Many came here to the West Midlands, creating in Victoria Park Estate in Tipton a community that feels like a sari beneath a drab, gray English coat. \n In Truth, a Place Apart \n It is just six or so streets of linked plain prewar houses in neat uninterrupted rows. But behind the doors, the South Asian village culture survives, in the handmade chapatis, the parentally arranged marriages and the mildly intoxicating Bangladeshi leaf stored in a basket by the register at the Pakeeza grocery store. \n All this has made for the appearance of quirky cultural fusion. Pep's Park Lane Chippy serves curry sauce as well as fish and chips. Bollywood and Hollywood share space at the video store. Young Muslims study at the Roman Catholic school. \n But, in truth, the Park Estate is a place apart, a lace-curtained ghetto surrounded by the whites who make up 86 percent of Tipton's 50,000 residents. Around Tipton, young Asian men who wear Moschino jeans and gold earrings in one ear also hear themselves referred to as \"Pakis.\" \n It cannot help that the entire economic basis of this world has fallen away. The factories are mostly closed now. Aziz ul-Hak thinks himself lucky to work at a food shop, since in Tipton many young Muslims do not work at all. More graduate to prison than university. \n \"The main thing with our teenagers is a drug problem, not a religious problem,\" says Bashrhan Khan, 34. \n Similar social strains among young South Asians prompted riots in some British towns last summer. Tipton's afflictions have been milder, but jarring nonetheless. A few years ago, gangs of young whites came through the Park Estate yanking off Muslim women's head scarfs. \n The Pull Between Cultures \n The Asians settled the score, sometimes violently, but felt personally betrayed by onetime schoolmates. Two years ago, the right-wing British National Party, whose Web site now features a \"Campaign Against Islam,\" won 24 percent of the vote in a local election. \n This was the circumscribed stage on which the young men who disappeared were playing out their lives. They had left school at 16 and were living at home, two on the same street. \n Ruhal Ahmed, 20, was a takeaway worker and skilled kickboxer who felt the pull between cultures more acutely than most. A Bengali, he had fallen in love with a local Pakistani girl. In Tipton, this was not done. Parents picked partners back home. The Park Estate was too small to be disrupted by love. \n Shafiq Rasul, 24, was 6 foot 2 and model-handsome, by his brothers' reckoning. His father had come from India 35 years ago to work in a factory, and died four years ago. The son's purpose seemed less clear: shy Shafiq had dropped out of college or \"taken some time off,\" and was working part time at an electronics store. \n Munir Ali, 21, now missing, was also Bengali. Sweet and simple, he had struggled to find work, relying, as many young people here do, on temporary jobs. Before he left, he wasn't working at all. \n As he searched for his place, his older sister had found hers \u2014 unusual in a culture where women rarely work outside the home. She had won election to the local council, the first Asian woman to do so. \n After the news broke about her missing brother, she issued a statement: \"We have grown up in Britain in a Western society. All members of our family share and respect British values.\" \n Those values, like freedom of speech and human rights, have drawn Islamic dissidents seeking haven from repression at home. Some have used Britain as a base for influencing their home countries' politics, through writing, lobbying or fund-raising. \n But others are steadily kneading the identity crises of Britain's young South Asians, as well as converts like Richard Reid. These purveyors of radicalism single out moderate mosques, prisons and universities. Their foil is the West \u2014 its actions, its policies, even the very freedoms they use to malign it. \n On a Wednesday night in Luton, just north of London, 20 or so brown young men crowd into the Islamic Educational Center to hear the Syrian-born Sheik Omar Bakri Muhammad. Sons of Pakistani or Bangladeshi immigrants, most wear Western dress. \n \"They want to keep calling us Pakis, bloody Arabs, brown Kaffirs,\" Mr. Bakri says. \n He caresses a bushy beard and conjures an imaginary character to dramatize a favorite theme: the futility of assimilation. \"Abu Jabar changes his name to Bobby. He changes all his clothes. He dances. He raves with them. They still call him Paki.\" \n Bobby asks, \"For God's sake who do I belong to?\" \n Mr. Bakri answers: \"You belong to the Muslim umma, brothers. Come on in.\" \n Mr. Bakri heads Al Muhajiroun, or The Emigrants, which he calls an Islamic ideological party. Some say he is all bombast and bluff, others that he manipulates young men into jihad. Whatever the truth, he indisputably transforms anomic young Muslims into Islamists. \n Conjuring Up the Caliphate \n His followers see recreating the caliphate \u2014 the era of Islam's ascendancy after the death of Muhammad in the eighth century \u2014 as the answer to Muslims', and the world's, problems. They often sound like nothing so much as young Marxists of another era. \n Islam \"will guarantee every single individual the bare necessities of food, clothing, shelter,\" says Muhammed Ali, a 21-year-old information technology specialist of slight build and febrile mien. \n In Britain, as everywhere, Islam has ribboned into countless sects and schools that often spend as much time attacking one another as attracting fresh recruits. \n The Birmingham Central Mosque is crowded with young people raised as indifferent Muslims who have now turned to a Taliban-style Islam that provides a way of life as much as a religion. The women cover not just their heads, but their faces; the long-bearded men no longer allow their children to be photographed. \n At the same time, many well-educated young Muslims have joined Hizb ut-Tahrir, a movement brought to England in the 1980's by Middle Eastern students. Its followers, who wear Western dress and often work in high-tech jobs, use anti-American propaganda to rally support for a pan-Islamic state. \n \"Your Muslim brothers are suffering,\" they whisper to potential recruits. \n The goal of the radicals, of whatever stripe, is to make Islam a political force. To do this, they employ a potent mix of vivid imagery, Koranic scholarship, hard facts and soft-boiled conspiracy theories \u2014 the Jews attacked the World Trade Center to discredit Osama bin Laden; the C.I.A. did it to give America a way into Central Asia; Mr. bin Laden is an American agent meant to discredit Islam. \n All of this is passed along a Muslim information loop, a daisy chain of Web sites and word of mouth. Azzam.com, for example, features pictures of Iraqi babies malnourished because of American sanctions or videos of graphic slaughter by and of Muslims in Chechnya. \n Imran Khan, 32, who publishes and sells pro-jihad literature, says that jihad recruitment is \"more promising in smaller towns than larger towns.\" \n \"In smaller towns,\" he said, \"there's nothing happening.\" \n The Tales They Told \n In the small town of Tipton, Shafiq Rasul told his family he was going to take a computer course in Pakistan. Asif Iqbal was going to carry out an arranged marriage, and Ruhal Ahmed was going to watch, or going on holiday, or making a religious pilgrimage \u2014 no one, anymore, seems sure. \n As these stories have fallen away, parents and friends say the young men must have been brainwashed. They describe jihad recruiters and fiery visiting sheiks; Muslim door-to-door preachers and extremist mosques that influenced the young men. None of their theories are provable, but all are plausible. \n With three mosques in four square blocks, the Park Estate was ripe for revival. Islam here has been parsed by denomination, language and culture \u2014 all the divisions of the subcontinent. That variety well suited the Tipton youths' meanderings through faith. \n When they first turned to Islam, over idle talk at a local pool hall, their guides were moderates with mystical leanings. They borrowed tapes of Hamza Yusuf, a moderate American convert who has achieved a mass following in Britain and the United States. Their families immediately noticed a change. Asif's father was happy, he told friends \u2014 his son had become a good religious boy. \n But, friends say, the boys soon migrated to an Islam of a more puritanical bent. They became judgmental, telling friends that they would see after they died how bad their clubbing and pubbing was. \n They became convinced of their rightness. Asif once threw a punch because he could not win a theological argument in front of a group of friends. They argued against citations from classical scholars by saying they could interpret the Koran themselves \u2014 they didn't need scholars. \n They challenged moderates in town to debate visitors like Sheik Abdullah el-Faisal, a Jamaican-born, Saudi-educated preacher who came to Tipton for two visits. He talked of the obligation to jihad, of Muslims killed in Bosnia. \n A World of Conspiracies \n Mr. Faisal sketched a world of conspiracies, of cabals of Jews and Freemasons plotting to take over the world. It was more exciting than Bollywood and Hollywood combined. It was real. \n On some of his tapes, he speaks of why Muslims can never have peace with the \"filthy Jews,\" and of Muslims' right to kill a Hindu if they encounter one in the road. In February, those tapes got him arrested and charged with \"solicitation to murder,\" a charge he has said he will answer by showing that everything he said exists in the Koran. \n Asif and his friends were briefly taken with Mr. Faisal, but then moved on. They learned about Hizb ut-Tahrir, and attended lectures given by a recruiter for Al Muhajiroun. They argued that the Palestinians' conflict with Israel justified jihad. \n Then came Sept. 11. Muslims in Tipton, like those across Britain, were outraged by America's bombing of Afghanistan. Still, that the young men undertook their pilgrimage without parental permission shocked this tradition-bound community almost as much as their going at all. \n \"They were supposed to ask their mother three times and their father once,\" one young woman said. \n But the literature of jihad has an answer to that. \"Join the Caravan,\" considered a \"classic\" treatise of the Afghan jihad movement, states, \"When Jihad becomes Fard Ain\" \u2014 an individual obligation \u2014 \"no permission of parents is required.\" \n All the young men needed was someone to make the argument that jihad had become Fard Ain. In Tipton and beyond, there was no shortage of people to make it.

Two years ago, the right-wing British National Party, whose Web site now features a ''Campaign Against Islam,'' won 24 percent of the vote in a local election.\nThis was the circumscribed stage on which the young men who disappeared were playing out their lives. They had left school at 16 and were living at home, two on the same street.\nRuhal Ahmed, 20, was a takeaway worker and skilled kickboxer who felt the pull between cultures more acutely than most. A Bengali, he had fallen in love with a local Pakistani girl. In Tipton, this was not done. Parents picked partners back home. The Park Estate was too small to be disrupted by love.\nShafiq Rasul, 24, was 6 foot 2 and model-handsome, by his brothers' reckoning. His father had come from India 35 years ago to work in a factory, and died four years ago. The son's purpose seemed less clear: shy Shafiq had dropped out of college or ''taken some time off,'' and was working part time at an electronics store.\nMunir Ali, 21, now missing, was also Bengali. Sweet and simple, he had struggled to find work, relying, as many young people here do, on temporary jobs. Before he left, he wasn't working at all.\nAs he searched for his place, his older sister had found hers -- unusual in a culture where women rarely work outside the home. She had won election to the local council, the first Asian woman to do so.\nAfter the news broke about her missing brother, she issued a statement: ''We have grown up in Britain in a Western society. All members of our family share and respect British values.''\nThose values, like freedom of speech and human rights, have drawn Islamic dissidents seeking haven from repression at home. Some have used Britain as a base for influencing their home countries' politics, through writing, lobbying or fund-raising.\nBut others are steadily kneading the identity crises of Britain's young South Asians, as well as converts like Richard Reid. These purveyors of radicalism single out moderate mosques, prisons and universities. Their foil is the West -- its actions, its policies, even the very freedoms they use to malign it.\nOn a Wednesday night in Luton, just north of London, 20 or so brown young men crowd into the Islamic Educational Center to hear the Syrian-born Sheik Omar Bakri Muhammad. Sons of Pakistani or Bangladeshi immigrants, most wear Western dress.\n''They want to keep calling us Pakis, bloody Arabs, brown Kaffirs,'' Mr. Bakri says.\nHe caresses a bushy beard and conjures an imaginary character to dramatize a favorite theme: the futility of assimilation. ''Abu Jabar changes his name to Bobby. He changes all his clothes. He dances. He raves with them. They still call him Paki.''\nBobby asks, ''For God's sake who do I belong to?''\nMr. Bakri answers: ''You belong to the Muslim umma, brothers. Come on in.''\nMr. Bakri heads Al Muhajiroun, or The Emigrants, which he calls an Islamic ideological party. Some say he is all bombast and bluff, others that he manipulates young men into jihad. Whatever the truth, he indisputably transforms anomic young Muslims into Islamists.\nConjuring Up the Caliphate\nHis followers see recreating the caliphate -- the era of Islam's ascendancy after the death of Muhammad in the eighth century -- as the answer to Muslims', and the world's, problems. They often sound like nothing so much as young Marxists of another era.\nIslam ''will guarantee every single individual the bare necessities of food, clothing, shelter,'' says Muhammed Ali, a 21-year-old information technology specialist of slight build and febrile mien.\nIn Britain, as everywhere, Islam has ribboned into countless sects and schools that often spend as much time attacking one another as attracting fresh recruits.\nThe Birmingham Central Mosque is crowded with young people raised as indifferent Muslims who have now turned to a Taliban-style Islam that provides a way of life as much as a religion. The women cover not just their heads, but their faces; the long-bearded men no longer allow their children to be photographed.\nAt the same time, many well-educated young Muslims have joined Hizb ut-Tahrir, a movement brought to England in the 1980's by Middle Eastern students. Its followers, who wear Western dress and often work in high-tech jobs, use anti-American propaganda to rally support for a pan-Islamic state.\n''Your Muslim brothers are suffering,'' they whisper to potential recruits.\nThe goal of the radicals, of whatever stripe, is to make Islam a political force. To do this, they employ a potent mix of vivid imagery, Koranic scholarship, hard facts and soft-boiled conspiracy theories -- the Jews attacked the World Trade Center to discredit Osama bin Laden; the C.I.A. did it to give America a way into Central Asia; Mr. bin Laden is an American agent meant to discredit Islam.\nAll of this is passed along a Muslim information loop, a daisy chain of Web sites and word of mouth. Azzam.com, for example, features pictures of Iraqi babies malnourished because of American sanctions or videos of graphic slaughter by and of Muslims in Chechnya.\nImran Khan, 32, who publishes and sells pro-jihad literature, says that jihad recruitment is ''more promising in smaller towns than larger towns.''\n''In smaller towns,'' he said, ''there's nothing happening.''\nThe Tales They Told\nIn the small town of Tipton, Shafiq Rasul told his family he was going to take a computer course in Pakistan. Asif Iqbal was going to carry out an arranged marriage, and Ruhal Ahmed was going to watch, or going on holiday, or making a religious pilgrimage -- no one, anymore, seems sure.\nAs these stories have fallen away, parents and friends say the young men must have been brainwashed. They describe jihad recruiters and fiery visiting sheiks; Muslim door-to-door preachers and extremist mosques that influenced the young men. None of their theories are provable, but all are plausible.\nWith three mosques in four square blocks, the Park Estate was ripe for revival. Islam here has been parsed by denomination, language and culture -- all the divisions of the subcontinent. That variety well suited the Tipton youths' meanderings through faith.\nWhen they first turned to Islam, over idle talk at a local pool hall, their guides were moderates with mystical leanings. They borrowed tapes of Hamza Yusuf, a moderate American convert who has achieved a mass following in Britain and the United States. Their families immediately noticed a change. Asif's father was happy, he told friends -- his son had become a good religious boy.\nBut, friends say, the boys soon migrated to an Islam of a more puritanical bent. They became judgmental, telling friends that they would see after they died how bad their clubbing and pubbing was.\nThey became convinced of their rightness. Asif once threw a punch because he could not win a theological argument in front of a group of friends. They argued against citations from classical scholars by saying they could interpret the Koran themselves -- they didn't need scholars.\nThey challenged moderates in town to debate visitors like Sheik Abdullah el-Faisal, a Jamaican-born, Saudi-educated preacher who came to Tipton for two visits. He talked of the obligation to jihad, of Muslims killed in Bosnia.\nA World of Conspiracies\nMr. Faisal sketched a world of conspiracies, of cabals of Jews and Freemasons plotting to take over the world. It was more exciting than Bollywood and Hollywood combined. It was real.\nOn some of his tapes, he speaks of why Muslims can never have peace with the ''filthy Jews,'' and of Muslims' right to kill a Hindu if they encounter one in the road. In February, those tapes got him arrested and charged with ''solicitation to murder,'' a charge he has said he will answer by showing that everything he said exists in the Koran.\nAsif and his friends were briefly taken with Mr. Faisal, but then moved on. They learned about Hizb ut-Tahrir, and attended lectures given by a recruiter for Al Muhajiroun. They argued that the Palestinians' conflict with Israel justified jihad.\nThen came Sept. 11. Muslims in Tipton, like those across Britain, were outraged by America's bombing of Afghanistan. Still, that the young men undertook their pilgrimage without parental permission shocked this tradition-bound community almost as much as their going at all.\n''They were supposed to ask their mother three times and their father once,'' one young woman said.\nBut the literature of jihad has an answer to that. ''Join the Caravan,'' considered a ''classic'' treatise of the Afghan jihad movement, states, ''When Jihad becomes Fard Ain'' -- an individual obligation -- ''no permission of parents is required.''\nAll the young men needed was someone to make the argument that jihad had become Fard Ain. In Tipton and beyond, there was no shortage of people to make it."}, {"text": "Is the Issue Parking or Prejudice?\n2002-12-15T05:00:00.000Z\nA MUSLIM congregation's plan to raze two houses it owns here and build a mosque and a school in their place has drawn protests from some residents who worry about increased traffic. But a whiff of post-Sept. 11 anti-Muslim prejudice clings to the controversy, sharpening the anxiety for those who are concerned that it will broadcast an image of a bigoted East Meadow.\nFor nearly a decade, the Long Island Muslim Society has been holding meetings for about 150 people at the small Cape Cod-style houses side by side at 469 and 477 East Meadow Avenue, a two-lane road with parking on both sides of the street.\nThe current proposal for the mosque is a two-story domed building with about 8,400 square feet of floor space to accommodate 300 worshipers. The school, on the second floor, would have religious classes on Fridays and Saturdays for about 60 children. The plan includes 8 parking spaces but is required by the Town of Hempstead building code to have 87.\n''We want to keep our heritage alive and pray together in the new mosque in one room,'' said Mohammed Rafiqur Rahman, an immigrant from Bangladesh and the chairman of the Muslim society's trustees. Members of the group pray at the East Meadow site if they happen to be there at the five daily prayer times, but for formal prayer services they go elsewhere, mainly to the Islamic Center of Long Island, a mosque in Westbury.\nAt the East Meadow location, most of the activity takes place in the tiny living room and two small bedrooms on the ground floor of each house. Sometimes board meetings are held in the basement.\n''Look at this block -- there's one, two, three churches,'' Mr. Rahman said, pointing out the window of one of the houses. ''This is a nice place for us.''\nBut many in the neighborhood don't share Mr. Rahman's opinion, adding East Meadow to a list of Long Island locations where religious freedom has collided with quality-of-life concerns. Houses in the Five Towns and in the Town of Babylon that are being used as synagogues or churches have prompted an outcry from residents who object to traffic and parking problems.\n''It will make East Meadow Avenue a mess,'' said Sherman Beale of East Meadow. ''If the mosque attracts a steady flow of large crowds, forget about it. The avenue is already used by people who are on the Southern State and want to get to the Hub without having to take the Meadowbrook Parkway.''\nJohn Arigo, owner of a pizzeria and an accounting office across the street from the Muslim society, said emergency vehicles would have a harder time negotiating East Meadow Avenue.\n''It's a two-lane road with three firehouses,'' Mr. Arigo said. ''If you have everyone parked on both sides of the street with the other cars that are there, how do you yield to a fire truck? Or pull over for someone in an ambulance having a heart attack?''\nThat's why Helen Fowler worries about the proposal. ''They block my driveway,'' said the frail 82-year-old woman who has lived on East Meadow Avenue since 1952, when the area was mostly farms. ''God forbid someone has to take me to the hospital.''\nMohammed Saleh, the president of the Muslim society, said the new mosque would be used for prayer services five times a day, seven days a week, but stressed that few members attend daily prayers because they are at work. Mr. Saleh said the mosque would draw large groups for events like fund-raising dinners, seminars, funerals and monthly social gatherings.\nHossein Alemzadeh of Design Profiles in Northport, the architect for the Muslim society project, said the East Meadow group had looked into building an underground parking garage but found it too costly. Mr. Alemzadeh said the Muslim society asked a nearby funeral home, which has a small parking lot, and the United Methodist Church of East Meadow, which is across the street, to provide overflow parking as needed periodically for their large gatherings.\nThomas Kearns, the president of Leo F. Kearns funeral homes, said he had asked for more information and had received no response.\n''My business is unpredictable, and we never know how much of the facilities we need,'' Mr. Kearns said. ''We could have a small family with a large crowd or a large family with a small crowd and just a few cars in the lot.''\nChester Kelsey, the president of the trustees at the Methodist church, declined the request, citing schedule conflicts. ''We have many activities in addition to Sunday,'' he said. ''We have choir meetings, A.A. meetings, activities on Friday and Saturday, and we wouldn't have enough space in the parking lot for us and their group.''\nThe other nearby houses of worship have also stopped short of rallying to the Muslim society's side. Dr. Robert Canter, the pastor of Open Hand of God Church, a nondenominational Christian assembly two doors away, said by e-mail, ''If the people of East Meadow do not want the mosque to get a variance, then I feel they shouldn't get it.''\nThe Rev. Wieslaw Pietruszka, the administrator of St. Francis National Roman Catholic Church, did not return phone calls seeking comment.\nThough many residents say the new mosque would cause intolerable congestion, no one was complaining about the three nearby churches, which have a combined membership more than double the Muslim society's 150 members.\nBut traffic is clearly not East Meadow residents' only concern. At least a dozen who asked not to be identified admitted to anti-Muslim feelings and said they were strongly opposed to the mosque because it's a mosque.\n''They have a past history of being violent, and they have a current history of being violent, too, and of having radical groups,'' said Louis Darienzo, a portfolio manager from East Meadow. ''I'm sure most of them are peace-loving, but I'm thinking in the back of my head, 'Are they practicing a false religion?' You just don't know.''\nJudy Fredrickson, who lives around the corner from the proposed mosque, maintained that ''freedom of religion is important,'' but added, ''because of 9/11, I hope all they want to do here is worship.''\nNorma Gonsalves, the Nassau County legislator whose district includes East Meadow, acknowledged that a few angry anti-Muslim comments were shouted when Muslim society officials appeared to defend their proposal at a public meeting on Nov. 26 sponsored by the Council of East Meadow Community Organizations. But Ms. Gonsalves said the jeers were not representative of the community's true sentiments.\n''This issue is a lack of parking, and neighbors have legitimate concerns,'' said Ms. Gonsalves, who is a past president of the community group. ''One of the women who spoke out against the Muslim group that night was told to leave. She was told that that was not why the community organization was there.''\nBarbara Bernstein, the executive director of the Nassau chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union, accused some protesters of ethnic profiling and drew a parallel between the anti-Muslim sentiment and discrimination against African-Americans.\n''Everyone from the president on down says, 'Don't condemn all of Islam for the actions of some,' '' Ms. Bernstein said. ''Islam is essentially a peaceful religion, but it can be hijacked by religious fanatics, as happened on 9/11.''\nBut she also said that freedom-of-religion issues in East Meadow and elsewhere could not ''override public policy or law'' and that they should not ''spill over into the public arena and affect street life,'' adding that if they do, ''neighbors have the right to complain.''\nMs. Gonsalves said she was concerned that the anti-Muslim remarks of some residents would ''paint East Meadow with a broad stroke'' of religious bias and scar the community.\n''We are a diverse community,'' she said. ''We are not the white middle-class community we used to be. We have a population of 45,000 people, and we have Asians, African-Americans, people from all walks.''\nIf Ms. Gonsalves was at pains to dispel any notion of bigotry, Muslim society officials were equally intent on portraying their group as peace-loving members of the community.\n''Many of our members are here a long time,'' said Mr. Rahman, whose group is largely made up of immigrants from Bangladesh, a place not known as a hotbed of Islamic radicalism.\n''We are Americans, and our children are Americans,'' he said. ''And our religion is a good religion like other religions. No religion tells people to do a bad thing.''\nMr. Alemzadeh, the architect for the Muslim society, said he was working on an alternate design for the mosque. ''The idea is to come up with another plan and to reduce the size of the building to accommodate parking for 120 to 150 people,'' he said.\nThe Town of Hempstead Board of Zoning Appeals would have to approve the construction plan if it is to go forward, and the board has scheduled a public hearing on the proposal for Jan. 29. Mr. Saleh said the society's trustees would decide whether to revise its proposal before the January hearing."}, {"text": "Population Estimates Fall as Poor Women Assert Control\n2002-03-10T05:00:00.000Z\nFor decades, experts assumed that the world's biggest developing nations, the home of hundreds of millions in big families, would push the global population to a precarious 10 billion people by the end of this century.\nNow, evidence is now coming in that women in rural villages and the teeming megacities of Brazil, Egypt, India and Mexico are unexpectedly proving those predictions wrong. Next week, demographers from around the world will meet here to reassess the outlook and possibly lower the estimate by about a billion people this century.\nIn India alone, by 2100 there may be 600 million fewer people than predicted.\nThe decline in birthrates in nations where poverty and illiteracy are still widespread defies almost all conventional wisdom. Planners once argued -- and some still do -- that falling birthrates can only follow improved living standards and more educational opportunities, not outrun them. It now seems that women are not waiting for that day.\nA few demographers are venturing to say that the trend may have little to do with government policies on family planning or foreign aid.\nSince the United Nations conference on population and development in Cairo in 1994, women in many countries have said that if they had control over their reproductive lives, lower fertility rates would be a given. Women's health organizations now say that is happening.\n''From Delhi to Rio, women's health advocates have stood fast against top-down population policies, and have stood for women's rights -- and abilities -- to make decisions about their bodies,'' said Cynthia Steele, vice president for programs at the International Women's Health Coalition in New York. ''Whether they live in villages or high-rises, women have always known what's best for them and their families. Now we're seeing the results of their own choices to have fewer children.''\nJoseph Chamie, the director of the United Nations population division, said: ''A woman in a village making a decision to have one or two or at most three children is a small decision in itself. But when these get compounded by millions and millions and millions of women in India and Brazil and Egypt, it has global consequences.''\nMr. Chamie said it had been assumed that the fertility rates in big developing countries -- the number of births, on average, per woman -- would fall at best only to what is known as replacement level. That number is 2.1, or a little more than one child for each parent. But in big countries, even that pace would add a huge number to an already large population base before the trend eventually moderates.\nDemographers may now be willing to go out on a limb and say that the fertility rates in the big developing countries may even drop below the replacement level, and sooner than most of them would have thought possible.\nThat would follow the trend already established in industrial countries, where the population slowdown has caused concerns about shrinking labor forces and aging populations.\nJust as women are pushing for a larger role in economic life around the world, they are also apparently becoming more assertive within families. ''We're breaking both the fertility floor and the glass ceiling,'' Mr. Chamie said.\nIn India, Gita Sen, professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, said in a telephone interview that there were important cultural factors at work.\n''Fertility in India is declining and it is declining faster than many people had expected,'' she said. One reason, she said, is ''that with increasing awareness on the part of women, they are being able to control their own fertility much better.''\n''It seems to start in one village and then spread to other places around that area,'' she said. ''Attitudes are changing, and people are watching what their neighbors are doing.''\nWith declining infant mortality, mothers become more confident that their babies will survive, Ms. Sen added, and so they can have fewer children. She and other experts say that urbanization also eases some family controls on women, and makes contraceptive pills or devices easier to find.\nBoth family pressure and lack of access to reproductive health care limit many women.\nMs. Sen said a family survey in 1999 in India, where the fertility rate is still about 3.0 per woman, underlined the change in attitudes. ''It was a very detailed survey that interviewed close to 90,000 married women all across the country,'' she said. ''One of the most striking things in that was that even in the poorer northern states if you ask women about the number of children that they want, it's much lower than the number that they actually have.''\nIn Brazil, women have reduced fertility levels without an official national family planning policy, Ana Maria Goldani of the department of sociology and Latin American studies at U.C.L.A. wrote in a paper for next week's conference. Brazil's fertility rate has tumbled, to 2.27 from 6.15 in the last half century, and it continues to fall for reasons that Ms. Goldani says are only now being analyzed.\nGelson Fonseca, Brazil's ambassador to the United Nations, said that television was important. Brazilians see small and apparently happy families in television programs and think about emulating that example.\nIn Bangladesh, family planning experts noticed a decade ago that in some of the remotest areas, information gleaned from satellite television was influencing contraceptive choices. In one case, a certain intrauterine device was rejected by many women in an area where one of them had seen it described as hazardous in a Western television program.\nThere are 74 countries in what the United Nations calls the intermediate-level fertility group, with births between 2.1 and 5 per woman.\nThis group includes very populous countries like Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, the Philippines and Vietnam.\nSome demographers question whether any one trend will fit them all, and ask whether it may not be as mistaken to herald a general population decline to below replacement levels as it was to pronounce that the larger developing nations would never reach this stage.\nJohn C. Caldwell of the Australian National University urges caution. In a paper prepared for next week's meeting, he writes of a ''loss of fervor'' in the developing world for further fertility decline.\nCountries are not homogenous, he argued, and there are some large ones in Africa and Asia where there will continue to be a preference for more children.\nBut Ms. Sen says that she is not concerned about India backsliding in the movement toward ever-lower fertility rates, arguing that education and cultural factors are becoming catalysts for change.\n''For a very long time we've had a huge problem in terms of 50 to 60 percent of the female population being illiterate,'' she said. ''The most recent census, the 2001 census, shows the biggest increases in literacy happening in some of the poor northern states -- big jumps in literacy -- and that means girls going to school.\n''Those same girls are going to be making the fertility decisions in another 10 years or so,'' she said, ''and I don't think they are going to make them in the same way that their illiterate mothers may have.''"}, {"text": "Religion Journal; Colleges Are Scrambling For Muslim Chaplains\n2002-02-16T05:00:00.000Z\nShamshad Sheikh was taken aback when she was asked to become the Muslim spiritual adviser to students at Mount Holyoke College. She did not feel qualified.\nTrue, she had obtained a degree in Islamic law almost two decades earlier in her native Pakistan. She had joined a mosque in West Springfield when she arrived in Massachusetts in 1981 to study accounting. She had taught Sunday school for five years.\nBut a spiritual adviser?\n''For that, you have many, many years to go,'' Ms. Sheikh said she thought to herself. ''A person can devote a whole life to that.''\nBut Mount Holyoke, a women's college with an enrollment of 2,000, was having trouble finding a woman to fill the newly created position. So after thinking about it for several days, Ms. Sheik, a soft-spoken mother of a daughter who was then 9 years old, took the 20-hour-a-week post while keeping her other job teaching accounting at a community college.\n''I was involved with children at the mosque, so I was already involved in Islamic teaching,'' she said, ''and I knew there were no other females in the area that could take the job.''\nThat was in 1997. ''They didn't even have a job description for me,'' Ms. Sheikh recalls. She settled on the title ''Islamic adviser'' and later redefined her role as ''adviser to Muslim students and chaplain to the college.''\nFor colleges and universities, finding Muslim chaplains is often difficult.\nYahya Hendi, an imam, became the first full-time Muslim college chaplain in the United States when Georgetown University in Washington hired him three years ago.\nBy Mr. Hendi's count, 27 colleges have Muslim chaplains, most of whom serve part time or as volunteers and, like Ms. Sheikh, started with little religious training. Because colleges and universities are scrambling to meet the needs of growing numbers of Muslim students, ''they are just hiring anyone,'' Mr. Hendi said.\nA few months ago Mr. Hendi, 35, was part of a group that convened to form the National Muslim Chaplains in Higher Education Council, which is seeking to ensure that chaplains at colleges and universities are adequately trained.\nJane I. Smith is a professor in a program begun last September at the Hartford Seminary in Connecticut to train Muslim chaplains, primarily for institutions like schools, hospitals, prisons and the military. Professor Smith said her seminary faced a twofold challenge: to train Muslims who can teach their faith in what she calls ''the American context'' and to bring more women into leadership roles in a religion where women are as yet unable to lead a mosque as an imam.\nProfessor Smith likens the nascent debate among Muslims worldwide over allowing women to become imams to arguments among Roman Catholics about whether to ordain women. In designing the program she and her colleagues chose the word ''chaplaincy'' to describe the training that leads to a master of divinity degree so it would be open and welcoming to women.\nSoon after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mount Holyoke shifted Ms. Sheikh, 42, to full-time status in recognition of the hours she was devoting to seeing Muslim students and to fielding inquiries from their parents, many of whom live abroad. She also explains Islam to the rest of the campus community through speaking events, a weekly session she offers on the basics of the religion, and individual meetings.\nEvery Friday Ms. Sheikh, who wears a traditional Pakistani tunic over baggy trousers, holds a lunch where a meal prepared according to Islamic dietary rules is followed by a group discussion and prayers. Two women in her mosque take turns cooking, and Ms. Sheikh picks up the food on her way to work.\nAs students enter the lounge in Eliot House, where the college's Center for Religious Life is based, they encounter a table with leaflets and fliers, including a chart of prayer times calibrated to when the sun rises and sets in New England. About a quarter of the 112 Muslim students at Mount Holyoke fasted during the holy month of Ramadan; a handful, including Ms. Sheikh, pray five times a day.\nThe women gather on couches arranged in a circle in the middle of the room to eat and talk, before going downstairs to a carpeted room adjoining Ms. Sheikh's office to pray.\nSawsan Eskander, a senior from Bangladesh majoring in mathematics, said the fact that the college advertised a Muslim chaplain in its brochure ''had a major influence in me coming to Mount Holyoke.''\nLast fall the college opened a combination kosher and halal dining hall, where observant Jews and Muslims can eat all their meals.\n''My dad read about the juma prayers and the halal food,'' said Ms. Eskander, 21. ''He didn't imagine I would get a religious environment in the United States.''\nAndrea Ayvazian, Mount Holyoke's dean of religious life, said her colleagues realized when they hired Ms. Sheikh that ''we could either look for an imam or what Christians call a lay leader.'' Now Ms. Ayvazian would like Ms. Sheikh to further her religious studies.\n''I am encouraging her very, very strongly because I want her to get that degree,'' she said.\nProfessor Smith, of the Hartford Seminary, said that as the number of Muslims increased in the United States, ''there is a need for training indigenous leaders who know the American context.'' But where those people will come from is ''up for grabs,'' she said. ''This is a new and very interesting part of religious history in America.''"}, {"text": "COPING; Bearing the Weight of the World, But on Such Narrow Shoulders\n2002-07-07T05:00:00.000Z\nI DON'T even know what an American is,'' Seema Ahmed said, somewhat exasperated. If you aren't born here, she wondered aloud, does that mean you're not an American? If you speak English with an accent? If you eat desi food with your hands? (In Hindi or Bengali, ''desi'' is used loosely to describe that which is of home -- in this case, the Indian subcontinent.)\nSeema is 18, fresh out of high school. Born in Bangladesh, she has spent nearly half her life in this country, in Woodside, Queens. She's small, serious and, as the eldest of three children in an immigrant family just this side of survival, she is, by her own admission, also a worrywart. Every move she makes, she said, she worries about how it will affect her family. It sounded familiar, but it struck me as a lot of weight to carry on such tiny shoulders. Seema's English is all Queens, but a hint of Bengali comes through. She is a United States citizen. But truth be told, she said, she can't really think of herself as an American. ''Bengali first,'' she said, before offering her puzzlement on what makes an American.\nThe conversation was prompted by a video that Seema and a dozen other Queens girls had made under the auspices of South Asian Youth Action, a community group housed in an Elmhurst church basement. They called themselves Desi Girls on Da Rise.\nThe story goes like this. One girl's boyfriend disappears on the heels of Sept. 11. We learn later that he's one of the hundreds of South Asian men corralled by federal officials on immigration charges; we learn, too, that she's pregnant. Another girl pounds the pavement with fliers to get people out to protest the detentions. Two other girls -- Seema is one of them -- feel the heat of anti-Muslim bigotry. On the street, they are taunted as Osama bin Laden's sisters.\nIt is a fictional treatment, but it is the stuff of their lives. The girls wrote the script. They turned the video camera on themselves. ''This is us,'' they seemed to be saying. Look. Listen. Step into our shoes.\nIt seemed to be directed as much at the adults in their own communities as it was to those outside. Desi girls, after all, aren't supposed to get pregnant before marriage. They aren't even supposed to have boyfriends. These are the rules that Seema has grown up with. It has been drummed into her: to disobey would ruin the family reputation. Her parents haven't seen the video yet. She worries what impact it might have. ''Maybe they'll control me more,'' she said.\nQuestions about what makes an American have always hovered over girls like her. It's just that Sept. 11 and its aftermath have brought them into sharp relief. For weeks after the attacks, Muslim girls she knew took their head scarves off. (Seema is Muslim, but she doesn't cover.) Boys shaved their beards. Others were beaten up because they wore turbans; they weren't even Muslim. Her father, a restaurant worker, feared losing his job. Her mother was afraid to walk home from the subway in her loose-fitting salwar kameez suits.\nSchool could be worst of all. Once, when a teacher cheered the bombing of Afghanistan, Seema recalled raising her hand to say something about the fate of Afghan civilians; she was laughed at by classmates. Another teacher said something about how John Walker Lindh, the alleged Taliban sympathizer from California, had fallen under the spell of Islam. Seema cringed. ''Islam is not a witch, or some kind of a magic spell,'' she said. Desi Girls used the anecdote in their video.\nAnecdotes like these make up the background music for Seema's coming-of-age tale, and that of many girls like her. Racism is no longer someone else's cross to bear. ''We wanted to show people we have to change this, the way were being treated,'' Seema explained. ''Obviously, I do get mad sometimes.''\nIf anything, the last 10 months have helped Seema come out of her shell. She's been to demonstrations to protest the detentions. Last week, at the screening of the Desi Girls video, she was up on stage with the rest of her crew, taking questions at the microphone. It was the first time she spoke in public, she said, certainly the first time she's done anything political.\nI suggested to Seema that, perhaps, Sept. 11 had made her more of an American.\nShe didn't buy it. She is just being herself, she said."}, {"text": "Globalization\n2002-08-18T05:00:00.000Z\nGlobalization is a phenomenon that has remade the economy of virtually every nation, reshaped almost every industry and touched billions of lives, often in surprising and ambiguous ways. The stories filling the front pages in recent weeks -- about economic crisis and contagion in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, about President Bush getting the trade bill he wanted -- are all part of the same story, the largest story of our times: what globalization has done, or has failed to do.\nGlobalization is meant to signify integration and unity -- yet it has proved, in its way, to be no less polarizing than the cold-war divisions it has supplanted. The lines between globalization's supporters and its critics run not only between countries but also through them, as people struggle to come to terms with the defining economic force shaping the planet today. The two sides in the discussion -- a shouting match, really -- describe what seem to be two completely different forces. Is the globe being knit together by the Nikes and Microsofts and Citigroups in a dynamic new system that will eventually lift the have-nots of the world up from medieval misery? Or are ordinary people now victims of ruthless corporate domination, as the Nikes and Microsofts and Citigroups roll over the poor in nation after nation in search of new profits?\nThe debate over globalization's true nature has divided people in third-world countries since the phenomenon arose. It is now an issue in the United States as well, and many Americans -- those who neither make the deals inside World Trade Organization meetings nor man the barricades outside -- are perplexed.\nWhen I first set out to see for myself whether globalization has been for better or for worse, I was perplexed, too. I had sympathy for some of the issues raised by the protesters, especially their outrage over sweatshops. But I have also spent many years in Latin America, and I have seen firsthand how protected economies became corrupt systems that helped only those with clout. In general, I thought the protesters were simply being sentimental; after all, the masters of the universe must know what they are doing. But that was before I studied the agreements that regulate global trade -- including this month's new law granting President Bush a free hand to negotiate trade agreements, a document redolent of corporate lobbying. And it was before looking at globalization up close in Chile and Mexico, two nations that have embraced globalization especially ardently in the region of the third world that has done the most to follow the accepted rules. I no longer think the masters of the universe know what they are doing.\nThe architects of globalization are right that international economic integration is not only good for the poor; it is essential. To embrace self-sufficiency or to deride growth, as some protesters do, is to glamorize poverty. No nation has ever developed over the long term without trade. East Asia is the most recent example. Since the mid-1970's, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China and their neighbors have lifted 300 million people out of poverty, chiefly through trade.\nBut the protesters are also right -- no nation has ever developed over the long term under the rules being imposed today on third-world countries by the institutions controlling globalization. The United States, Germany, France and Japan all became wealthy and powerful nations behind the barriers of protectionism. East Asia built its export industry by protecting its markets and banks from foreign competition and requiring investors to buy local products and build local know-how. These are all practices discouraged or made illegal by the rules of trade today.\nThe World Trade Organization was designed as a meeting place where willing nations could sit in equality and negotiate rules of trade for their mutual advantage, in the service of sustainable international development. Instead, it has become an unbalanced institution largely controlled by the United States and the nations of Europe, and especially the agribusiness, pharmaceutical and financial-services industries in these countries. At W.T.O. meetings, important deals are hammered out in negotiations attended by the trade ministers of a couple dozen powerful nations, while those of poor countries wait in the bar outside for news.\nThe International Monetary Fund was created to prevent future Great Depressions in part by lending countries in recession money and pressing them to adopt expansionary policies, like deficit spending and low interest rates, so they would continue to buy their neighbors' products. Over time, its mission has evolved into the reverse: it has become a long-term manager of the economies of developing countries, blindly committed to the bitter medicine of contraction no matter what the illness. Its formation was an acknowledgment that markets sometimes work imperfectly, but it has become a champion of market supremacy in all situations, echoing the voice of Wall Street and the United States Treasury Department, more interested in getting wealthy creditors repaid than in serving the poor.\nIt is often said that globalization is a force of nature, as unstoppable and difficult to contain as a storm. This is untrue and misleading. Globalization is a powerful phenomenon -- but it is not irreversible, and indeed the previous wave of globalization, at the turn of the last century, was stopped dead by World War I. Today it would be more likely for globalization to be sabotaged by its own inequities, as disillusioned nations withdraw from a system they see as indifferent or harmful to the poor.\nGlobalization's supporters portray it as the peeling away of distortions to reveal a clean and elegant system of international commerce, the one nature intended. It is anything but. The accord creating the W.T.O. is 22,500 pages long -- not exactly a free trade agreement. All globalization, it seems, is local, the rules drawn up by, and written to benefit, powerful nations and powerful interests within those nations. Globalization has been good for the United States, but even in this country, the gains go disproportionately to the wealthy and to big business.\nIt's not too late for globalization to work. But the system is in need of serious reform. More equitable rules would spread its benefits to the ordinary citizens of wealthy countries. They would also help to preserve globalization by giving the poor of the world a stake in the system -- and, not incidentally, improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Here, then, are nine new rules for the global economy -- a prescription to save globalization from itself.\nIf there is any place in Latin America where the poor have thrived because of globalization, it is Chile. Between 1987 and 1998, Chile cut poverty by more than half. Its success shows that poor nations can take advantage of globalization -- if they have governments that actively make it happen.\nChile reduced poverty by growing its economy -- 6.6 percent a year from 1985 to 2000. One of the few points economists can agree on is that growth is the most important thing a nation can do for its poor. They can't agree on basics like whether poverty in the world is up or down in the last 15 years -- the number of people who live on less than $1 a day is slightly down, but the number who live on less than $2 is slightly up. Inequality has soared during the last 15 years, but economists cannot agree on whether globalization is mainly at fault or whether other forces, like the uneven spread of technology, are responsible. They can't agree on how to reduce inequality -- growth tends not to change it. They can't agree on whether the poor who have not been helped are victims of globalization or have simply not yet enjoyed access to its benefits -- in other words, whether the solution is more globalization or less. But economists agree on one thing: to help the poor, you'd better grow.\nFor the rest of Latin America, and most of the developing world except China (and to a lesser extent India), globalization as practiced today is failing, and it is failing because it has not produced growth. Excluding China, the growth rate of poor countries was 2 percent a year lower in the 1990's than in the 1970's, when closed economies were the norm and the world was in a recession brought on in part by oil-price shocks. Latin American economies in the 1990's grew at an average annual rate of 2.9 percent -- about half the rate of the 1960's. By the end of the 1990's, 11 million more Latin Americans lived in poverty than at the beginning of the decade. And in country after country, Latin America's poor are suffering -- either from economic crises and market panics or from the day-to-day deprivations that globalization was supposed to relieve. The surprise is not that Latin Americans are once again voting for populist candidates but that the revolt against globalization took so long.\nWhen I visited Eastern Europe after the end of Communism, a time when democracy was mainly bringing poverty, I heard over and over again that the reason for Chile's success was Augusto Pinochet. Only a dictator with a strong hand can put his country through the pain of economic reform, went the popular wisdom. In truth, we now know that inflicting pain is the easy part; governments democratic and dictatorial are all instituting free-market austerity. The point is not to inflict pain but to lessen it. In this Pinochet failed, and the democratic governments that followed him beginning in 1990 have succeeded .\nWhat Pinochet did was to shut down sectors of Chile's economy that produced goods for the domestic market, like subsistence farming and appliance manufacturing, and point the economy toward exports. Here he was following the standard advice that economists give developing countries -- but there are different ways to do it, and Pinochet's were disastrous. Instead of helping the losers, he dismantled the social safety net and much of the regulatory apparatus that might have kept privatization honest. When the world economy went into recession in 1982, Chile's integration into the global marketplace and its dependence on foreign capital magnified the crash. Poverty soared, and unemployment reached 20 percent.\nPinochet's second wave of globalization, in the late 1980's, worked better, because the state did not stand on the side. It regulated the changes effectively and aggressively promoted exports. But Pinochet created a time bomb in Chile: the country's exports were, and still are, nonrenewable natural resources. Chile began subsidizing companies that cut down native forests for wood chips, for example, and the industry is rapidly deforesting the nation.\nChile began to grow, but inequality soared -- the other problem with Pinochet's globalization was that it left out the poor. While the democratic governments that succeeded Pinochet have not yet been able to reduce inequality, at least it is no longer increasing, and they have been able to use the fruits of Chile's growth to help the poor.\nChile's democratic governments have spread the benefits of economic integration by designing effective social programs and aiming them at the poor. Chile has sunk money into revitalizing the 900 worst primary schools. It now leads Latin America in computers in schools, along with Costa Rica. It provides the very low-income with housing subsidies, child care and income support. Open economy or closed, these are good things. But Chile's government is also taking action to mitigate one of the most dangerous aspects of global integration: the violent ups and downs that come from linking your economy to the rest of the world. This year it created unemployment insurance. And it was the first nation to institute what is essentially a tax on short-term capital, to discourage the kind of investment that can flood out during a market panic.\nThe conventional wisdom among economists today is that successful globalizers must be like Chile. This was not always the thinking. In the 1980's, the Washington Consensus -- the master-of-the-universe ideology at the time, highly influenced by the Reagan and Thatcher administrations -- held that government was in the way. Globalizers' tasks included privatization, deregulation, fiscal austerity and financial liberalization. ''In the 1980's and up to 1996 or 1997, the state was considered the devil,'' says Juan Mart\u00edn, an Argentine economist at the United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. ''Now we know you need infrastructure, institutions, education. In fact, when the economy opens, you need more control mechanisms from the state, not fewer.''\nAnd what if you don't have these things? Bolivia carried out extensive reforms beginning in 1985 -- a year in which it had inflation of 23,000 percent -- to make the economy more stable and efficient. But in the words of the World Bank, ''It is a good example of a country that has achieved successful stabilization and implemented innovative market reforms, yet made only limited progress in the fight against poverty.'' Latin America is full of nations that cannot make globalization work. The saddest example is Haiti, an excellent student of the rules of globalization, ranked at the top of the I.M.F.'s index of trade openness. Yet over the 1990's, Haiti's economy contracted; annual per capita income is now $250. No surprise -- if you are a corrupt and misgoverned nation with a closed economy, becoming a corrupt and misgoverned nation with an open economy is not going to solve your problems.\nIf there is a showcase for globalization in Latin America, it lies on the outskirts of Puebla, Mexico, at Volkswagen Mexico. Every New Beetle in the world is made here, 440 a day, in a factory so sparkling and clean that you could have a baby on the floor, so high-tech that in some halls it is not evident that human beings work here. Volkswagen Mexico also makes Jettas and, in a special hall, 80 classic Beetles a day to sell in Mexico, one of the last places in the world where the old Bug still chugs.\nThe Volkswagen factory is the biggest single industrial plant in Mexico. Humans do work here -- 11,000 people in assembly-line jobs, 4,000 more in the rest of the factory -- with 11,000 more jobs in the industrial park of VW suppliers across the street making parts, seats, dashboards and other components. Perhaps 50,000 more people work in other companies around Mexico that supply VW. The average monthly wage in the plant is $760, among the highest in the country's industrial sector. The factory is the equal of any in Germany, the product of a billion-dollar investment in 1995, when VW chose Puebla as the exclusive site for the New Beetle.\nAhhh, globalization.\nExcept . . . this plant is not here because Mexico has an open economy, but because it had a closed one. In 1962, Mexico decreed that any automaker that wanted to sell cars here had to produce them here. Five years later, VW opened the factory. Mexico's local content requirement is now illegal, except for very limited exceptions, under W.T.O. rules; in Mexico the local content requirement for automobiles is being phased out and will disappear entirely in January 2004.\nThe Puebla factory, for all the jobs and foreign exchange it brings Mexico, also refutes the argument that foreign technology automatically rubs off on the local host. Despite 40 years here, the auto industry has not created much local business or know-how. VW makes the point that it buys 60 percent of its parts in Mexico, but the ''local'' suppliers are virtually all foreign-owned and import most of the materials they use. The value Mexico adds to the Beetles it exports is mainly labor. Technology transfer -- the transmission of know-how from foreign companies to local ones -- is limited in part because most foreign trade today is intracompany; Ford Hermosillo, for example, is a stamping and assembly plant shipping exclusively to Ford plants in the United States. Trade like this is particularly impenetrable to outsiders. ''In spite of the fact that Mexico has been host to many car plants, we don't know how to build a car,'' says Huberto Ju\u00e1rez, an economist at the Autonomous University of Puebla.\nVolkswagen Mexico is the epitome of the strategy Mexico has chosen for globalization -- assembly of imported parts. It is a strategy that makes perfect sense given Mexico's proximity to the world's largest market, and it has given rise to the maquila industry, which uses Mexican labor to assemble foreign parts and then re-export the finished products. Although the economic slowdown in the United States is hurting the maquila industry, it still employs a million people and brings the country $10 billion a year in foreign exchange. The factories have turned Mexico into one of the developing world's biggest exporters of medium- and high-technology products. But the maquila sector remains an island and has failed to stimulate Mexican industries -- one reason Mexico's globalization has brought disappointing growth, averaging only 3 percent a year during the 1990's.\nIn countries as varied as South Korea, China and Mauritius, however, assembly work has been the crucible of wider development. Jeffrey Sachs, the development economist who now directs Columbia University's Earth Institute, says that the maquila industry is ''magnificent.'' ''I could cite 10 success stories,'' he says, ''and every one started with a maquila sector.'' When Korea opened its export-processing zone in Masan in the early 1970's, local inputs were 3 percent of the export value, according to the British development group Oxfam. Ten years later they were almost 50 percent. General Motors took a Korean textile company called Daewoo and helped shape it into a conglomerate making cars, electronic goods, ships and dozens of other products. Daewoo calls itself ''a locomotive for national economic development since its founding in 1967.'' And despite the company's recent troubles, it's true -- because Korea made it true. G.M. did not tutor Daewoo because it welcomed competition but because Korea demanded it. Korea wanted to build high-tech industry, and it did so by requiring technology transfer and by closing markets to imports.\nMaquilas first appeared in Mexico in 1966. Although the country has gone from assembling clothing to assembling high-tech goods, nearly 40 years later 97 percent of the components used in Mexican maquilas are still imported, and the value that Mexico adds to its exports has actually declined sharply since the mid-1970's.\nMexico has never required companies to transfer technology to locals, and indeed, under the rules of the North American Free Trade Agreement, it cannot. ''We should have included a technical component in Nafta,'' says Luis de la Calle, one of the treaty's negotiators and later Mexico's under secretary of economy for foreign trade. ''We should be getting a significant transfer of technology from the United States, and we didn't really try.''\nWithout technology transfer, maquila work is marked for extinction. As transport costs become less important, Mexico is increasingly competing with China and Bangladesh -- where labor goes for as little as 9 cents an hour. This is one reason that real wages for the lowest-paid workers in Mexico dropped by 50 percent from 1985 to 2000. Businesses, in fact, are already leaving to go to China.\nWhen Americans think about globalization, they often think about sweatshops -- one aspect of globalization that ordinary people believe they can influence through their buying choices. In many of the factories in Mexico, Central America and Asia producing American-brand toys, clothes, sneakers and other goods, exploitation is the norm. The young women who work in them -- almost all sweatshop workers are young women -- endure starvation wages, forced overtime and dangerous working conditions.\nIn Chile, I met a man who works at a chicken-processing plant in a small town. The plant is owned by Chileans and processes chicken for the domestic market and for export to Europe, Asia and other countries in Latin America. His job is to stand in a freezing room and crack open chickens as they come down an assembly line at the rate of 41 per minute. When visitors arrive at the factory (the owners did not return my phone calls requesting a visit or an interview), the workers get a respite, as the line slows down to half-speed for show. His work uniform does not protect him from the cold, the man said, and after a few minutes of work he loses feeling in his hands. Some of his colleagues, he said, are no longer able to raise their arms. If he misses a day he is docked $30. He earns less than $200 a month.\nIs this man a victim of globalization? The protesters say that he is, and at one point I would have said so, too. He -- and all workers -- should have dignified conditions and the right to organize. All companies should follow local labor laws, and activists should pressure companies to pay their workers decent wages.\nBut today if I were to picket globalization, I would protest other inequities. In a way, the chicken worker, who came to the factory when driving a taxi ceased to be profitable, is a beneficiary of globalization. So are the millions of young women who have left rural villages to be exploited gluing tennis shoes or assembling computer keyboards. The losers are those who get laid off when companies move to low-wage countries, or those forced off their land when imports undercut their crop prices, or those who can no longer afford life-saving medicine -- people whose choices in life diminish because of global trade. Globalization has offered this man a hellish job, but it is a choice he did not have before, and he took it; I don't name him because he is afraid of being fired. When this chicken company is hiring, the lines go around the block.\nThe argument that open economies help the poor rests to a large extent on the evidence that closed economies do not. While South Korea and other East Asian countries successfully used trade barriers to create export industries, this is rare; most protected economies are disasters. ''The main tendency in a sheltered market is to goof off,'' says Jagdish Bhagwati, a prominent free-trader who is the Arthur Lehman professor of economics at Columbia University. ''A crutch becomes a permanent crutch. Infant-industry protection should be for infant industries.''\nAnyone who has lived or traveled in the third world can attest that while controlled economies theoretically allow governments to help the poor, in practice it's usually a different story. In Latin America, spending on social programs largely goes to the urban middle class. Attention goes to people who can organize, strike, lobby and contribute money. And in a closed economy, the ''state'' car factory is often owned by the dictator's son and the country's forests can be chopped down by his golf partner.\nFree trade, its proponents argue, takes these decisions away from the government and leaves them to the market, which punishes corruption. And it's true that a system that took corruption and undue political influence out of economic decision-making could indeed benefit the poor. But humans have not yet invented such a system -- and if they did, it would certainly not be the current system of globalization, which is soiled with the footprints of special interests. In every country that negotiates at the W.T.O. or cuts a free-trade deal, trade ministers fall under heavy pressure from powerful business groups. Lobbyists have learned that they can often quietly slip provisions that pay big dividends into complex trade deals. None have been more successful at getting what they want than those from America.\nThe most egregious example of a special-interest provision is the W.T.O.'s rules on intellectual property. The ability of poor nations to make or import cheap copies of drugs still under patent in rich countries has been a boon to world public health. But the W.T.O. will require most of its poor members to accept patents on medicine by 2005, with the very poorest nations following in 2016. This regime does nothing for the poor. Medicine prices will probably double, but poor countries will never offer enough of a market to persuade the pharmaceutical industry to invent cures for their diseases.\nThe intellectual-property rules have won worldwide notoriety for the obstacles they pose to cheap AIDS medicine. They are also the provision of the W.T.O. that economists respect the least. They were rammed into the W.T.O. by Washington in response to the industry groups who control United States trade policy on the subject. ''This is not a trade issue,'' Bhagwati says. ''It's a royalty-collection issue. It's pharmaceuticals and software throwing their weight around.'' The World Bank calculated that the intellectual-property rules will result in a transfer of $40 billion a year from poor countries to corporations in the developed world.\nManuel de Jes\u00fas G\u00f3mez is a corn farmer in the hills of Puebla State, 72 years old and less than five feet tall. I met him in his field of six acres, where he was trudging behind a plow pulled by a burro. He farms the same way campesinos in these hills have been farming for thousands of years. In Puebla, and in the poverty belt of Mexico's southern states -- Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero -- corn growers plow with animals and irrigate by praying for rain.\nBefore Nafta, corn covered 60 percent of Mexico's cultivated land. This is where corn was born, and it remains a symbol of the nation and daily bread for most Mexicans. But in the Nafta negotiations, Mexico agreed to open itself to subsidized American corn, a policy that has crushed small corn farmers. ''Before, we could make a living, but now sometimes what we sell our corn for doesn't even cover our costs,'' G\u00f3mez says. With Nafta, he suddenly had to compete with American corn -- raised with the most modern methods, but more important, subsidized to sell overseas at 20 percent less than the cost of production. Subsidized American corn now makes up almost half of the world's stock, effectively setting the world price so low that local small farmers can no longer survive. This competition helped cut the price paid to G\u00f3mez for his corn by half.\nBecause of corn's importance to Mexico, when it negotiated Nafta it was promised 15 years to gradually raise the amount of corn that could enter the country without tariffs. But Mexico voluntarily lifted the quotas in less than three years -- to help the chicken and pork industry, Mexican negotiators told me unabashedly. (Eduardo Bours, a member of the family that owns Mexico's largest chicken processor, was one of Mexico's Nafta negotiators.) The state lost some $2 billion in tariffs it could have charged, and farmers were instantly exposed to competition from the north. According to ANEC, a national association of campesino cooperatives, half a million corn farmers have left their land and moved to Mexican cities or to America. If it were not for a weak peso, which keeps the price of imports relatively high, far more farmers would be forced off their land.\nThe toll on small farmers is particularly bitter because cheaper corn has not translated into cheaper food for Mexicans. As part of its economic reforms, Mexico has gradually removed price controls on tortillas and tortilla flour. Tortilla prices have nearly tripled in real terms even as the price of corn has dropped.\nIs this how it was supposed to be? I asked Andr\u00e9s Rosenzweig, a longtime Mexican agriculture official who helped negotiate the agricultural sections of Nafta. He was silent for a minute. ''The problems of rural poverty in Mexico did not start with Nafta,'' he said. ''The size of our farms is not viable, and they get smaller each generation because farmers have many children, who divide the land. A family in Puebla with five hectares could raise 10, maybe 15, tons of corn each year. That was an annual income of 16,000 pesos,'' the equivalent of $1,600 today. ''Double it and you still die of hunger. This has nothing to do with Nafta.\n''The solution for small corn farmers,'' he went on, ''is to educate their children and find them jobs outside agriculture. But Mexico was not growing, not generating jobs. Who's going to employ them? Nafta.''\nOne prominent antiglobalization report keeps referring to farms like G\u00f3mez's as ''small-scale, diversified, self-reliant, community-based agriculture systems.'' You could call them that, I guess; you could also use words like ''malnourished,'' ''undereducated'' and ''miserable'' to describe their inhabitants. Rosenzweig is right -- this is not a life to be romanticized.\nBut to turn the farm families' malnutrition into starvation makes no sense. Mexico spends foreign exchange to buy corn. Instead, it could be spending money to bring farmers irrigation, technical help and credit. A system in which the government purchased farmers' corn at a guaranteed price -- done away with in states like Puebla during the free-market reforms of the mid-1990's -- has now been replaced by direct payments to farmers. The program is focused on the poor, but the payments are symbolic -- $36 an acre. In addition, rural credit has disappeared, as the government has effectively shut down the rural bank, which was badly run, and other banks won't lend to small farmers. There is a program -- understaffed and poorly publicized -- to help small producers, but the farmers I met didn't know about it.\nFree trade is a religion, and with religion comes hypocrisy. Rich nations press other countries to open their agricultural markets. At the urging of the I.M.F. and Washington, Haiti slashed its tariffs on rice in 1995. Prices paid to rice farmers fell by 25 percent, which has devastated Haiti's rural poor. In China, the tariff demands of W.T.O. membership will cost tens of millions of peasants their livelihoods. But European farmers get 35 percent of their income from government subsidies, and American farmers get 20 percent. Farm subsidies in the United States, moreover, are a huge corporate-welfare program, with nearly 70 percent of payments going to the largest 10 percent of producers. Subsidies also depress crop prices abroad by encouraging overproduction. The farm bill President Bush signed in May -- with substantial Democratic support -- provides about $57 billion in subsidies for American corn and other commodities over the next 10 years.\nWealthy nations justify pressure on small countries to open markets by arguing that these countries cannot grow rice and corn efficiently -- that American crops are cheap food for the world's hungry. But with subsidies this large, it takes chutzpah to question other nations' efficiency. And in fact, the poor suffer when America is the supermarket to the world, even at bargain prices. There is plenty of food in the world, and even many countries with severe malnutrition are food exporters. The problem is that poor people can't afford it. The poor are the small farmers. Three-quarters of the world's poor are rural. If they are forced off their land by subsidized grain imports, they starve.\nBack in the 1950's, Latin American economists made a simple calculation. The products their nations exported -- copper, tin, coffee, rice and other commodities -- were buying less and less of the high-value-added goods they wanted to import. In effect, they were getting poorer each day. Their solution was to close their markets and develop domestic industries to produce their own appliances and other goods for their citizens.\nThe strategy, which became known as import substitution, produced high growth -- for a while. But these closed economies ultimately proved unsustainable. Latin American governments made their consumers buy inferior and expensive products -- remember the Brazilian computer of the 1970's? Growth depended on heavy borrowing and high deficits. When they could no longer roll over their debts, Latin American economies crashed, and a decade of stagnation resulted.\nAt the time, the architects of import substitution could not imagine that it was possible to export anything but commodities. But East Asia -- as poor or poorer than Latin America in the 1960's -- showed in the 1980's and 1990's that it can be done. Unfortunately, the rules of global trade now prohibit countries from using the strategies successfully employed to develop export industries in East Asia.\nAmerican trade officials argue that they are not using tariffs to block poor countries from exporting, and they are right -- the average tariff charged by the United States is a negligible 1.7 percent, much lower than other nations. But the rules rich nations have set -- on technology transfer, local content and government aid to their infant industries, among other things -- are destroying poor nations' abilities to move beyond commodities. ''We are pulling up the ladder on policies the developed countries used to become rich,'' says Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.\nThe commodities that poor countries are left to export are even more of a dead end today than in the 1950's. Because of oversupply, prices for coffee, cocoa, rice, sugar and tin dropped by more than 60 percent between 1980 and 2000. Because of the price collapse of commodities and sub-Saharan Africa's failure to move beyond them, the region's share of world trade dropped by two-thirds during that time. If it had the same share of exports today that it had at the start of the 1980's, per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa would be almost twice as high.\nProbably the single most important change for the developing world would be to legalize the export of the one thing they have in abundance -- people. Earlier waves of globalization were kinder to the poor because not only capital, but also labor, was free to move. Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and a leading academic critic of the rules of globalization, argues for a scheme of legal short-term migration. If rich nations opened 3 percent of their work forces to temporary migrants, who then had to return home, Rodrik says, it would generate $200 billion annually in wages, and a lot of technology transfer for poor countries.\nGlobalization means risk. By opening its economy, a nation makes itself vulnerable to contagion from abroad. Countries that have liberalized their capital markets are especially susceptible, as short-term capital that has whooshed into a country on investor whim whooshes out just as fast when investors panic. This is how a real-estate crisis in Thailand in 1997 touched off one of the biggest global conflagrations since the Depression.\nThe desire to keep money from rushing out inspired Chile to install speed bumps discouraging short-term capital inflows. But Chile's policy runs counter to the standard advice of the I.M.F., which has required many countries to open their capital markets. ''There were so many obstacles to capital-market integration that it was hard to err on the side of pushing countries to liberalize too much,'' says Ken Rogoff, the I.M.F.'s director of research.\nPrudent nations are wary of capital liberalization, and rightly so. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist who has become the most influential critic of globalization's rules, writes that in December 1997, when he was chief economist at the World Bank, he met with South Korean officials who were balking at the I.M.F.'s advice to open their capital markets. They were scared of the hot money, but they could not disagree with the I.M.F., lest they be seen as irresponsible. If the I.M.F. expressed disapproval, it would drive away other donors and private investors as well.\nIn the wake of the Asian collapse, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad imposed capital controls in Malaysia -- to worldwide condemnation. But his policy is now widely considered to be the reason that Malaysia stayed stable while its neighbors did not. ''It turned out to be a brilliant decision,'' Bhagwati says.\nPost-crash, the I.M.F. prescribed its standard advice for nations -- making loan arrangements contingent on spending cuts, interest-rate hikes and other contractionary measures. But balancing a budget in recession is, as Stiglitz puts it in his new book, ''Globalization and Its Discontents,'' a recommendation last taken seriously in the days of Herbert Hoover. The I.M.F.'s recommendations deepened the crisis and forced governments to reduce much of the cushion that was left for the poor. Indonesia had to cut subsidies on food. ''While the I.M.F. had provided some $23 billion to be used to support the exchange rate and bail out creditors,'' Stiglitz writes, ''the far, far, smaller sums required to help the poor were not forthcoming.''\nIs your international financial infrastructure breeding Bolsheviks? If it does create a backlash, one reason is the standard Bolshevik explanation -- the I.M.F. really is controlled by the epicenter of international capital. Formal influence in the I.M.F. depends on a nation's financial contribution, and America is the only country with enough shares to have a veto. It is striking how many economists think the I.M.F. is part of the ''Wall Street-Treasury complex,'' in the words of Bhagwati. The fund serves ''the interests of global finance,'' Stiglitz says. It listens to the ''voice of the markets,'' says Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development in Washington and a former executive vice president of the Inter-American Development Bank. ''The I.M.F. is a front for the U.S. government -- keep the masses away from our taxpayers,'' Sachs says.\nI.M.F. officials argue that their advice is completely equitable -- they tell even wealthy countries to open their markets and contract their economies. In fact, Stiglitz writes, the I.M.F. told the Clinton administration to hike interest rates to lower the danger of inflation -- at a time when inflation was the lowest it had been in decades. But the White House fortunately had the luxury of ignoring the I.M.F.: Washington will only have to take the organization's advice the next time it turns to the I.M.F. for a loan. And that will be never.\nThe idea that free trade maximizes benefits for all is one of the few tenets economists agree on. But the power of the idea has led to the overly credulous acceptance of much of what is put forward in its name. Stiglitz writes that there is simply no support for many I.M.F. policies, and in some cases the I.M.F. has ignored clear evidence that what it advocated was harmful. You can always argue -- and American and I.M.F. officials do -- that countries that follow the I.M.F.'s line but still fail to grow either didn't follow the openness recipe precisely enough or didn't check off other items on the to-do list, like expanding education.\nPolicy makers also seem to be skipping the fine print on supposedly congenial studies. An influential recent paper by the World Bank economists David Dollar and Aart Kraay is a case in point. It finds a strong correlation between globalization and growth and is widely cited to support the standard rules of openness. But in fact, on close reading, it does not support them. Among successful ''globalizers,'' Dollar and Kraay count countries like China, India and Malaysia, all of whom are trading and growing but still have protected economies and could not be doing more to misbehave by the received wisdom of globalization.\nDani Rodrik of Harvard used Dollar and Kraay's data to look at whether the single-best measure of openness -- a country's tariff levels -- correlates with growth. They do, he found -- but not the way they are supposed to. High-tariff countries grew faster. Rodrik argues that the countries in the study may have begun to trade more because they had grown and gotten richer, not the other way around. China and India, he points out, began trade reforms about 10 years after they began high growth.\nWhen economists talk about many of the policies associated with free trade today, they are talking about national averages and ignoring questions of distribution and inequality. They are talking about equations, not what works in messy third-world economies. What economic model taught in school takes into account a government ministry that stops work because it has run out of pens? The I.M.F. and the World Bank -- which recommends many of the same austerity measures as the I.M.F. and frequently conditions its loans on I.M.F.-advocated reforms -- often tell countries to cut subsidies, including many that do help the poor, and impose user fees on services like water. The argument is that subsidies are an inefficient way to help poor people -- because they help rich people too -- and instead, countries should aid the poor directly with vouchers or social programs. As an equation, it adds up. But in the real world, the subsidies disappear, and the vouchers never materialize.\nThe I.M.F. argues that it often saves countries from even more budget cuts. ''Countries come to us when they are in severe distress and no one will lend to them,'' Rogoff says. ''They may even have to run surpluses because their loans are being called in. Being in an I.M.F. program means less austerity.'' But a third of the developing world is under I.M.F. tutelage, some countries for decades, during which they must remodel their economies according to the standard I.M.F. blueprint. In March 2000, a panel appointed to advise Congress on international financial institutions, named for its head, Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, recommended unanimously that the I.M.F. should undertake only short-term crisis assistance and get out of the business of long-term economic micromanagement altogether.\nThe standard reforms deprive countries of flexibility, the power to get rich the way we know can work. ''Most Latin American countries have had deep reforms, have gone much further than India or China and haven't gotten much return for their effort,'' Birdsall says. ''Many of the reforms were about creating an efficient economy, but the economic technicalities are not addressing the fundamental question of why countries are not growing, or the constraint that all these people are being left out. Economists are way too allergic to the wishy-washy concept of fairness.''\nThe protesters in the street, the Asian financial crisis, criticism from respected economists like Stiglitz and Rodrik and those on the Meltzer Commission and particularly the growing realization in the circles of power that globalization is sustainable for wealthy nations only if it is acceptable to the poor ones are all combining to change the rules -- slightly. The debt-forgiveness initiative for the poorest nations, for all its limitations, is one example. The Asian crisis has modified the I.M.F.'s view on capital markets, and it is beginning to apply less pressure on countries in crisis to cut government spending. It is also debating whether it should be encouraging countries to adopt Chile's speed bumps. The incoming director of the W.T.O. is from Thailand, and third-world countries are beginning to assert themselves more and more.\nBut the changes do not alter the underlying idea of globalization, that openness is the universal prescription for all ills. ''Belt-tightening is not a development strategy,'' Sachs says. ''The I.M.F. has no sense that its job is to help countries climb a ladder.''\nSachs says that for many developing nations, even climbing the ladder is unrealistic. ''It can't work in an AIDS pandemic or an endemic malaria zone. I don't have a strategy for a significant number of countries, other than we ought to help them stay alive and control disease and have clean water. You can't do this purely on market forces. The prospects for the Central African Republic are not the same as for Shanghai, and it doesn't do any good to give pep talks.''\nChina, Chile and other nations show that under the right conditions, globalization can lift the poor out of misery. Hundreds of millions of poor people will never be helped by globalization, but hundreds of millions more could be benefiting now, if the rules had not been rigged to help the rich and follow abstract orthodoxies. Globalization can begin to work for the vast majority of the world's population only if it ceases to be viewed as an end in itself, and instead is treated as a tool in service of development: a way to provide food, health, housing and education to the wretched of the earth."}, {"text": "THE RACIAL DIVIDE; As Black Men Move Into Middle Age, Dangers Rise\n2002-09-23T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE most dangerous time of life for a black man in America is middle age.\nAfter a decade of intense efforts to investigate and reduce the stark gap in life expectancy between between black and white men, researchers and health officials are broadening their focus beyond the violence, drugs and diseases like H.I.V. that claim the lives of many African-American males aged 18 to 35. They are asking not just why so many black men die young, but why so many die younger than they should -- of diseases that should not be so deadly.\nDeath rates for black men are higher than for whites at all ages below 84, but the divide reaches its peak between 45 and 64, the years when diseases that afflict many older Americans begin to hit black men sooner and harder. Stroke and diabetes killed black men between 55 and 64 at about three times the rate for white men their age in 2000, according to the National Centers for Health Statistics, while cancer and heart disease killed black men in that group at rates 50 percent above those for their white peers.\n''When you look at what is killing black men, it is diseases that are preventable or treatable with great survivability,'' said Dr. Claude A. Allen, deputy secretary for the federal Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe fact that there are well-established cures or preventive steps for these conditions gives health officials hope. But turning the thought around shows the frustrating core of the problem: if these diseases can be dealt with, why do black men continue to live an average of seven years less than white men?\nThe answers, experts say, lie in a tangle of medical, racial and economic factors. To Dr. Allen, the central task is improving access to health care. ''These deaths are associated with not seeking out care soon enough,'' he said. ''We should not be losing men because we have not provided access to care, treatment, information and education in a timely manner.''\nBut recent experience indicates that doing so will not be easy. In 1990, an article in The New England Journal of Medicine focused attention on the problem when it reported that a black man living in central Harlem was less likely to reach 65 than a comparable man in Bangladesh. Though the mortality gap has narrowed slightly since then, a recent report on the health of minority men, issued by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, concluded that ''from birth, a black male on average seems fated to a life so unhealthy that a white man can only imagine it.''\nTHE threat of premature death looms large in Woodlawn, a predominantly black neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago. The average life span for African-American men there is 58.3 years, according to the city's Department of Health.\nWhich is why one afternoon a week at the Woodlawn Health Center, Dr. Bonnie Thomas Jr. switches from his usual white coat and tie into jeans, a sports T-shirt, an African beaded necklace and, sometimes, a baseball cap bearing the logo of his alma mater, Xavier. Introducing himself to patients, he skips a handshake and does a ''pound'' instead, one fist on top of the other. During exams, he tries to drop as much of the ''medical speak'' as he can.\nOn Thursdays from 4 to 7 p.m., the clinic switches from its usual focus on women into Project Brotherhood, for men. They start to trickle in at 1 p.m., and by the time the clinic opens, the waiting area is full of men of all ages in suits, hip-hop garb and African clothing, Dr. Thomas said. While they are waiting, they listen to music, eat a meal provided by the clinic or even get a haircut.\nDr. Thomas and the project's co-director, Donald McDaniels, have made the atmosphere comfortable -- and free -- for a reason. ''It's extremely hard to get black men into the system, so we wanted to tear down every barrier and design a place that said, I want to be there,'' said Dr. Thomas, who grew up on the South Side. ''I don't want to be someone in a white coat who is going to talk down to them, but a guy at the corner Y.M.C.A., or someone they grew up with, which is not far from who I am anyway. But no matter how informal I can get, I'm always giving these men the standard of care they deserve; it's just packaged differently.''\nDistrust of the system and difficulties in communication are pervasive. A recent survey of health care quality conducted by the Commonwealth Fund found that almost twice as many blacks as whites thought their doctor ''looked down on them'' or treated them disrespectfully.\nMany observers point to an exaggeration of a common male trait: a reluctance to go to the doctor at all. ''Men, overall, have a particular set of pressures to show strength and not reveal weakness, and this feeling is intensified in black men,'' said Ellis Cose, a Newsweek columnist and author of ''The Envy of the World: On Being a Black Man in America.''\n''There is an ethic of toughness among black men, built up to protect yourself against racial slights and from the likelihood that society is going to challenge you or humiliate you in some way,'' he said. ''This makes it very hard to admit that you are in pain or need help either physical or psychological.''\nDr. Jean Bonhomme, president of the National Black Men's Health Network, a nonprofit advocacy and education organization in Atlanta, calls this trait ''pathological stoicism,'' a problem he sees even in himself.\n''African-American men have had to deal with tremendous hardships and not complain, because complaining didn't help,'' Dr. Bonhomme said. ''Now we push ourselves to distorted extremes without asking for help in order to 'be a man.' It is a matter of pride to brush off pain. Several years ago, I injured my back so badly that I could hardly walk. My wife saw me drop to my knees in order to get out of a chair, and said to me, 'What the hell are you doing?' I looked at myself and realized how crazy I was being.''\nNorman Jackson, who is 49 and and lives in Detroit, knew diabetes ran in his family, but avoided seeing a doctor because the visits made him feel ''vulnerable.'' Even though he was often thirsty, was urinating frequently and his vision changed so much that he said he could hardly see to drive, he insisted there was nothing wrong. Finally, about two years ago, Mr. Jackson was tested for diabetes and high blood pressure at a health screening sponsored by the African American Initiative for Male Health Improvement. He found that he had both.\n''My father was diabetic and I knew I should get my sugar checked out, but I didn't want to feel weak,'' said Mr. Jackson, who now takes medication to control both his blood sugar and blood pressure and also exercises and watches his diet. ''Eventually, I realized that this is dangerous, and you can't mess around with your health. I haven't neglected myself since.''\nWhile access to treatment is one problem, there are also problems with the treatment African-American men actually receive. Last spring, the Institute of Medicine reported on a review of more than 100 studies, and the findings were startling: even when African-Americans and other minorities have the same incomes, insurance coverage and medical conditions as whites, they receive notably poorer care. Biases, prejudices and negative racial stereotypes, the panel learned, may be poisoning the reaction of doctors and other health providers.\n''Some of the most esteemed scientists in the world proved that medical care is not being dished out fairly,'' said Dr. James W. Reed, a professor of medicine at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta and a co-author of ''The Black Man's Guide to Good Health: Essential Advice for African-American Men and Their Families.'' ''White men were referred for sophisticated procedures like cardiac catheterization three or four times more frequently than blacks with the same symptoms at a V.A. hospital, where ability to pay doesn't matter.\n''Is it overt racism? I don't know,'' Dr. Reed continued. ''Maybe it's more subtle, like physicians don't think blacks will adhere to therapy. But in the final analysis, whatever the definition, it is still discrimination based solely on skin color.''\nPERHAPS the most puzzling part of the equation has to do with high blood pressure, a major contributor to heart disease, stroke and many other diseases. It strikes one-third of all black men, and is twice as deadly for blacks as it is for whites. Interestingly, West Africans, from whom most American blacks are descended, have low rates of hypertension. Some experts suggest that stress and societal racial discrimination that black men (and women) suffer in this country play a major role. During a stressful incident, the body produces adrenaline and the heart rate and blood pressure increase. Experts speculate that constant engaging of a fight-or-flight mechanism by racial insults can contribute to chronically elevated blood pressure.\nPublic and private institutions are pushing to close the racial gap in health disparities. The bulk of programs and projects for African-Americans, however, are aimed at women. A survey of state health departments by Dr. Ronald L. Braithwaite, the director of the Center for Research on Health Disparities at Emory University, found that few were specifically for African-American men's health.\nFor instance, Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health 2010, an initiative of the federal Centers for Disease Control, was created to finance community coalitions with the goal of eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health over the next decade. But the majority of its 42 programs are either not gender-specific or are aimed at African-American women and children. ''The communities were allowed to choose health priority areas, and none said just African-American men,'' said Dr. Imani Ma'at, director of the program. ''Women are the ones who are involved in the health care system, present at schools and in churches, so they are an easier group to reach out to and communicate with.''\nSTILL, there are some programs to specifically improve the health of black men. In addition to the screening program Mr. Jackson saw in Detroit and Project Brotherhood, the African-American Male Empowerment Network offers support groups and a 10-week health promotion and disease prevention course to men in the Atlanta area. The Young Men's Clinic, a joint project of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health and New York Presbyterian Hospital, provides free medical care to mainly black and Hispanic patients.\n''Traditional approaches often don't work with black men,'' said Dr. Braithwaite, who is a co-editor of the book ''Health Issues in the Black Community.'' ''There is an increasing recognition that we have to go to the pockets of critical mass. That means going to where men convene.''\nThe Detroit project sends a medical van into black communities and has screened nearly 8,000 men over the last few years. On Sept. 7, about 2,000 people, mostly black men, attended the first annual Health Initiative for Men, a prostate cancer walk and health summit in Atlanta.\nFinally, many African-American men have simply decided to beat the odds and take responsibility for their health. Nathaniel Plowden, a supervisor for U.P.S. in Atlanta, became strict about scheduling annual physicals when his father received a diagnosis with advanced prostate cancer 16 years ago. Thanks to his vigilance, his prostate cancer was caught early, and he considers himself recovered. He and other family members are now part of a clinical trial looking for hereditary causes of prostate cancer in black men.\n''My father took care of himself, but he never went to the doctor,'' said Mr. Plowden, who is 54. ''He was in severe pain by the time he saw someone and by then we found out his cancer was very advanced. What happened to him spurred me into continuing to go to the doctor. The notion of being dumb and happy never motivated me. I want to know what's going on so I can deal with it.''"}, {"text": "ART; Assembling Collections From All Temperatures\n2002-05-12T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE current exhibition at Real Art Ways in Hartford puts the spotlight on four private collections of contemporary art in Connecticut. Its title, ''Acquiring Taste,'' is intriguing because it might mean that we viewers might acquire taste while surveying the art objects. Or the show might be a record of how the collectors came to know what they like.\nThe title certainly refers to the education that the curator of Real Art Ways, Steven A. Holmes, received as he scrupulously put the show together. His task was to make choices that represent the essence of the collections, each of them made up of countless works -- which is not an exaggeration, since new ones are acquired almost daily.\nThe show is affecting because Mr. Holmes found some vivid, even idiosyncratic personalities in the collectors. Janice and Micky Carton collect work in all media, and evidently in all temperatures. Mr. Holmes describes some pieces in the Cartin collection as ''cool,'' some as ''quasi-cabalistic,'' others as ''satirical.'' Mr. Cartin is a successful businessman who leaves most of the running of the business to someone else, while he devotes himself almost full-time to collecting. Janice Cartin is called the ultimate silent partner who fully understands her husband's obsession.\nA picture emerges of someone who loves artists as much as he loves art. Mr. Cartin's motive is that he truly wishes to help artists he admires. With certain artists he has a standing agreement that he will buy work sight unseen, or else he is persuaded by a verbal description as much as by any image.\nThe major pieces on view from the Cartin collection seem to display a certain vulnerability. Almost billboard size are six photographs of teenage boys involved in gun violence. ''The Fault Series'' (2001) by Olafur Eliasson is a grid of 32 photographs of openings in the earth. Seventeen wall drawings comprise Donald Moffit's saga in vague pencil drawings, ''Mr. Gay in the USA.'' They tell the true story of a Virginia man who went on a shooting rampage because people made fun of his name.\nSpencer Finch's drawings often have no images at all, just a title that explains their blankness such as, ''The Most Beautiful Word in the English Language (written in invisible ink).''\nWalton Ford is something of a latter-day Audubon with his large paintings mostly of birds and sometimes other animals, too, but Audubon never got apocalyptic. Mr. Ford's ''Eothen'' (2001) is ostensibly a painting of a peacock, but refers to Sept. 11. The Cartins' sculptures include a dirigible with a gondola by an artist known only as Panamarenko and a bottle containing polluted Rhine water by Joseph Beuys, the German conceptual artist who clearly influenced many of the artists in the collection.\nSol LeWitt also keeps company with artists. But Mr. LeWitt is an artist too, a Conceptualist with a worldwide reputation. He is especially well-represented in Connecticut, where most major museums and not a few minor art venues posses work by him. Artists habitually trade work with other artists, and sometimes it's simply ephemera that gains value or importance with time. This is the case with several works by Gene Beery, a California artist whom Mr. LeWitt knew in the early 1960's. Mr. Beery's pieces on cardboard or Masonite are early ventures into the now-familiar kind of Conceptual art in which written language is paramount.\nThe LeWitt collection numbers about 3,000 pieces, many of which were sent to Mr. LeWitt unsolicited. The collection is especially important and inviting because it contains small or incidental pieces by artists who are known for large well-plotted work. Tony Smith, for example, made monumental abstract sculpture, but this show includes a small Smith bronze from 1963, ''The Elevens Are Up,'' in which two small standing rectangles form the number 11.\nIn contrast the collection of Robinson and Nancy Grover is narrowly focused and very selectively chosen. The Grovers collect photography exclusively, the sort that has a purpose or message, sometimes a provocative one, beyond the capturing of an image.\nSome of the photographic studies that the art critic John Coplans made of his own aging body are here as is ''Blood and Semen V'' (1990) by Andres Serrano. The parts seem eerily abstract in Edward Burtynsky's large-scale ''Ship Breaking #10, Chittagong, Bangladesh (2000).'' Seemingly lighter in mood but still pulling a lot of conceptual weight are Cornea Parker's photographs of feathers. They include ''Feather from Freud's Pillow'' and ''Feather From Benjamin Franklin's Attic.''\nPeter Hirschl and Lisa Silvestri have fashioned a collection that anyone could seemingly collect. It includes books, coins and recorded music. The most visually compelling work in their portion of the show is a wall of 78 rpm record covers. They also have work from fine artists, such as ''Balloon Dog'' by Jeff Koons (1995), a gaudy red relief sculpture.\n''Acquiring Taste'' is at Real Art Ways, 56 Arbor Street in Hartford, through June 30.

It has been a neighborhood of cafes where dark-haired men sip strong coffee while talking late into the night. It is a place of quiet sidewalks lined with tenderly fussed-over brick houses, where a solitary widow in black can be glimpsed scurrying homeward as if she were on Rhodes.\nThe cafes are still teeming, the houses tidy. But the Greek hold on the Queens neighborhood has slowly been weakening as successful Greeks or their children leave for other locales. As a result, there are moments when Astoria has a theme park feel to it, a cardboard facade of a Greek Main Street with cafes named Athens and Omonia and Greece's blue and white colors, but a diminishing number of actual Greeks living within.\nOther groups have been rising up to take their place. On a recent Friday on Steinway Street, a commercial spine, several hundred men from North African and Middle Eastern countries were jammed into Al-Iman Mosque, one of several mosques that have sprung up in Astoria. There were so many worshipers that 13 had to pray on the sidewalk, kneeling shoeless on prayer mats and touching their foreheads and palms to the ground.\nWhen the prayers were over, El Allel Dahli, a Moroccan immigrant, emerged with his teenage son, Omar, telling of the plate of couscous and lamb he had brought as alms to honor the birth that morning of his daughter, Jenine.\n''I am very happy today,'' he said.\nAnd it is not just Middle Easterners and North Africans who are changing the sense of the neighborhood. Bangladeshis, Bosnians and other onetime Yugoslavians, Brazilians, Indians, Colombians, Ecuadorians, and yes, even young Manhattan professionals drawn by the neighborhood's modest rents and cosmopolitan flavors have settled here. For the Middle Easterners and Balkan immigrants, the draw seems to be the area's congenial Mediterranean accent: overlapping foods like kebab, okra, lentils and honey-coated pastries. And there are familiar cultural styles, like the men playing backgammon and smoking in cafes (though the Middle Easterners are as likely to smoke molasses-dipped tobacco in tall water pipes).\n''They feel more comfortable with Greeks,'' said George Mohamed Oumous, a 45-year-old Moroccan computer programmer who has lived in Astoria for 10 years. ''We've been near each other for centuries. You listen to Greek music you think you could be listening to Egyptian music.''\nIt is an old New York story, no different from the shrinking of the Jews on the Lower East Side or the Italians along Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. As immigrants of one nationality make it, they forsake the jostling streets, and newer immigrants, hoping to make their fortunes, move in.\nBut the fact that it is an oft-told story is scant consolation for longtime Greek residents who have tried to rekindle the old country in this new one. They find a bittersweet quality to a changeover that verifies their community's success but has cut the Greek population by a third in the past two decades to, by some estimates, 30,000 from 45,000. (The census figures are gloomier, putting the number of people who claimed Greek ancestry in 1990 in the local community board district, which includes Long Island City, at 18,127, according to Joseph Salvo, the City Planning Department's chief demographer. Similar figures for 2000 are not yet available.)\nAt 75-year-old St. Demetrios Cathedral, adorned with Orthodox saints in radiant gold halos, there were 374 baptisms in 1981 but just 160 last year; 150 weddings in 1981 but just 88 last year. Many Greeks are marrying non-Greeks, making it less likely those couples will choose to live in Astoria.\n''When I first came I said to myself, 'The Greeks are very clever. They choose the best places to live,' '' said Fotini Kessissoglou, who with her husband, Stavros, moved from Athens in 1986 and operates a small shop, Kesso Foods, that sells thick strained Greek yogurt. ''So I am sad when I see all the Greeks go to other places.''\nOthers, like Philippos Markakis, a poet with a flamboyant handlebar mustache who runs perhaps the only combination barbershop and coin-operated laundry in New York, miss the intimacy of a neighborhood where everyone speaks the same language.\n''People, when they say hello, they don't understand each other and they're more a little apart,'' he said in accented English that testifies to his odyssey here almost 50 years ago from the Aegean island of Fournoi.\nThe Greeks, who just a decade ago made up half of Astoria's population, are going to other places. They have made enough money in coffee shops and construction to afford homes in more spacious Bayside in Queens or Roslyn on Long Island. The children who grew up in Astoria did so well in the area's public and parochial schools that many of them are lawyers and academics who are also seeking fresher terrain.\nAt the same time, Greece is such a prospering member of the European Union that Greeks no longer feel the need to leave home, said Harilaos Daskalothanassis, managing editor of the Greek-language newspaper The National Herald. In contrast to the current trickle, Greeks in the late 1960's immigrated here at a rate of 15,000 a year.\nThe other day, a half dozen natives of Crete, three of them owners of diners on Long Island and in Westchester County, were gathered around a table under a lush grape arbor eating grilled red snapper and stewed lamb and drinking homemade Cretan wine. This was an assemblage of the Minos Club -- one of almost 100 Greek hometown societies still functioning in the neighborhood.\nThe president, Aristides Garganourakis, a spirited man with a thick mustache, told how he came to America in 1974 to work as a dishwasher, learned the restaurant trade and then opened a coffee shop in East Harlem, a pizza shop in Yonkers and finally the Dobbs Diner in Dobbs Ferry. But his son John is going to the State University of New York at Binghamton to prepare for a career in medicine.\nMr. Garganourakis's hope is that John will still come to Astoria to nourish his Greek roots. To this end he and other members of the Minos Club work hard to make sure their children sustain the Greek culture, providing lessons in Greek language and folk dances. But the likelihood that the children will live in Astoria is increasingly far-fetched.\nGreeks, driving from Manhattan or the suburbs, still fill Astoria's cafes and restaurants on summer evenings or stock up on feta cheese and stuffed grape leaves on weekends. ''They come back to Astoria when they need their Greek dose,'' is the way Amalia Kalogridakis, 24, puts it. But the neighborhood is gently shifting around them.\n''Little by little, if we don't have new blood coming in, it's starting to die,'' said George Alexiou, former president of the Greek-American Homeowners Association.\nFor the newer residents, however, the mood is expansive. On a two-block stretch of Steinway between 28th Avenue and Astoria Boulevard, there are 25 Middle Eastern shops -- selling halal meat, Syrian pastries, airplane tickets to Morocco, driving lessons in Arabic. The strip rivals the city's most famous Middle Eastern thoroughfare, Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue. In the new cafes and restaurants, television shows from Cairo and news from Qatar-based Al Jazeera are beamed in on big-screen televisions. A common street sight is women in ankle-length jalabas and head scarves surrounded by small children.\n''You don't feel homesick,'' said Noureddine Daouaou, a Moroccan taxi driver who has lived in Astoria for six years.\nGeorge Delis, district manager of Community Board 1 and an immigrant from the area around Salonika, said, ''I get complaints from Greeks that the streets are dirtier, the properties not as well kept. I say to them, 'When you came to this country, the Italians and Irish were saying there goes the neighborhood.' And that's how I feel. This is a nation of immigrants, a community of immigrants.''\nMr. Oumous, the Moroccan computer programmer, said that, for the most part, the Greeks greeted the newcomers without hostility, even though there was some suspiciousness after Sept. 11 and landlords were likely to inquire more scrupulously into newcomers' backgrounds.\nAlthough 2000 census figures on the neighborhood's nationalities are not out yet, Ali El Sayed, a broad-shouldered Alexandrian with a shaved head who is Steinway's Sidney Greenstreet, the man aware of this mini-Casablanca's secrets, estimates there are now up to 4,000 Middle Easterners and North Africans.\nMr. Sayed was a pioneer, moving from Egypt to Steinway Street 13 years ago to open the Kabab Cafe, a narrow six-table cranny that sells a tasty hummus and falafel plate. He said that many younger Middle Easterners were marrying non-Middle Easterners. He is married to an Argentinian, and his 7-year-old son, Esmaeel, speaks Spanish, not Arabic.\n''There are lots of fears that their culture is getting destroyed,'' Mr. Sayed said.\nThat statement suggests that the Middle Easterners are already adopting their Greek neighbors' stoicism.\n''In New York everything turns around,'' said Peter Figetakis, 48, a film director who left Greece at 6 and has lived in Astoria since the 1970's.

IN WHICH GEORGE TRIES TO BUILD A FENCE\nThis is a story about global warming and a scientist named George Divoky, who studies a colony of Arctic seabirds on a remote barrier island off the northern coast of Alaska. I mention all this at the start because a reader might like to come to the point, and what could be more urgent than the very health and durability of this planet we call Earth? However, before George can pursue his inquiry into worldwide climate change; before he can puzzle out the connections between a bunch of penguinesque birds on a flat, snow-covered, icebound island and the escalating threat of droughts, floods and rising global temperatures, he must first mount a defense -- his only defense in this frozen, godforsaken place -- against the possibility of being consumed, down to the last toenail, by a polar bear while he sleeps. He must first build a fence.\nCooper Island, June 4, 2 o'clock in the morning. The sky is a cold slab of gray, the air temperature hovers in the upper 20's and the wind -- always the wind -- howls across hundreds of miles of sea ice with such unremitting force that George has disappeared beneath a hat, two hoods and a thick fleece face mask covering all but his bespectacled eyes. Standing near the three small dome tents that make up his field camp on Cooper, George raises a pair of binoculars and begins to scan for bears. Past the island's north beach, a wind-scarred plain of sea ice stretches uninterrupted to the pole. To the south, the nearest tree stands 200 miles away on the far side of the Brooks Range. Here, some 330 miles north of the Arctic Circle, with the sun making a constant parabolic journey around the sky, George surveys a view that replicates in all directions: the snow-covered island merges with the sea ice at its shores, the dazzling sheets of sea ice stretch to meet a pale gray dome of sky. Surrounded by a vast, undulating whiteness, he appears to be standing in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. He appears to be standing on the tops of cirrus clouds.\n''So, . . . '' he says, and the rest of his words are carried off by the wind.\n''What?''\n''I said, so maybe we should put up the polar-bear fence before we get too fatigued!''\nHeading fast toward fatigue, I tell him that's a fine idea indeed, and exactly how many polar bears does he figure might be out there on the ice? George, who spends each summer on Cooper Island, is cheerfully indifferent to its dangers and discomforts and reassuring to those who aren't. Discussing a recent incident in which some Inupiat Eskimos had to shoot a bear that wandered into their nearby whaling camp, I consider it bad news -- there are bears in the vicinity! -- while George thinks of it as good: yes, but now there's one less bear.\nStill scanning the faint horizon line, George insists there's nothing to get worked up about. For the most part, bears stay several miles offshore, where they can gorge on ringed and bearded seals. If a bear were to come to this island, he points out, its massive 800-pound frame would stand out against the sky like an approaching blimp. Even if a bear were to wander into camp, he goes on, we are sufficiently armed with a shotgun, cans of compressed pepper spray (mace) and a flarelike device known as a screamer-banger. Nonetheless, George confirms that at least one big bear shows up on Cooper each summer, usually to scavenge the beach for dead, washed-up seals; and furthermore, that an encounter can be so unpleasant that you do have to figure the odds a little differently. ''I was out here once and injured the tendon in my knee,'' he says. ''I couldn't walk, I couldn't stay warm. I kept thinking, If it's true predators key in on the weak and the infirm. . . . '' He shrugs and gestures to the chilling evidence of predation right by our feet -- a caribou skull, several seal vertebrae, a scattering of gull's feathers and the sun-bleached skeleton of a clean-picked walrus. ''I guess it's safe to assume that most of our fellow Americans are south of us, sound asleep, a lot warmer than we are, and not preparing to put up a polar-bear fence.''\nCooper is one of six barrier islands stretching off the coast of Point Barrow, Alaska, where the United States -- along with continental North America -- comes to a chilly, desolate end. Three miles tip to tip, the island is nothing more than a snow-covered strip of sand and gravel frozen into the Arctic pack ice, its only vertical relief an odd cityscape of rusted 55-gallon drums and destroyed ammunition boxes left here by the United States Navy sometime after the Korean War. In 1972, George came out to Cooper as a young ornithologist and discovered a rare colony of black guillemots -- pigeon-size, stiff-legged seabirds -- nesting in the abandoned drums and boxes. And for many years he pursued a rather esoteric study of them -- mate selection, age of first breeding, ''the kind of thing that's of interest to about 20 ornithologists,'' he says now. Then, almost by accident, he discovered that his birds were picking up on another kind of frequency, and that if he watched and listened with great care, they could tell him about something no less consequential than the climatic fate of the earth.\nIn coming to the Alaskan Arctic year after year, George is following the logic of many other scientists -- that to understand Earth's mysterious and changing climate, you should go directly to its extremes. In the last two decades, scores of researchers have come to the nearby town of Barrow, hoping to learn why the Arctic is warming so significantly and how the changing polar climate may affect the planet as a whole -- if the Arctic sea ice were to one day disappear, it would cause drastic changes in the climate of the Northern Hemisphere. But while many scientists gather their data from remote sensing devices -- satellites, buoys, robotic airplanes -- or come to this frozen, inhospitable region on brief, well-equipped trips before returning to the comforts of the ''Lower Forty-Eight,'' George spends three months of each year sleeping in a small yellow dome tent, warming himself over a two-burner propane stove and crawling around on his hands and knees, up to his binoculars in guillemot scat. Thousands of miles away from the debates on greenhouse-gas emissions, relatively unknown even within the scientific community, George, now 55, has come out to Cooper Island every year for more than 25 years, often with no financial or institutional support. It is not too much to say that he has staked his entire adult life on this barren gravel bar and its avian inhabitants. And now, as he continues to scan the island with his binoculars under bright, 2 a.m. skies, it is not too much to say that his life is staked on whether he can successfully erect that polar-bear fence.\nThe fence became an essential part of George's repertory for survival after he awoke in his tent one night to the crunch, crunch, crunch of approaching footsteps. When he crawled out to investigate, however, he thought he must have been dreaming: he was alone on the island. The next morning, the 16-inch tracks in the snow told him otherwise. If it's possible to see your life flash before your eyes in retrospect, that's what happened to George: a big female bear and her cub had walked within 20 yards. While the cub stayed put, the mother came up to the doorway of his tent, evidently sniffing George's placid, sleeping head before he woke, unzipped his sleeping bag and inadvertently scared both bears away.\n''All right, let's see what we've got here,'' George says, shaking the many parts of the fence out of its canvas bag onto the snow. George's fence is made up of 30 three-foot-high garden stakes that he and I, fueled by the adrenaline of our recent arrival, now try to place in a circle around our tents. Each stake has a small pulley, through which we thread a fine piece of cord. The cord makes a perimeter around the tents and meets up at the home stake, which is connected to a spring-loaded mousetrap, an eight-volt battery and a car alarm with a large plastic horn. The fence operates on the principle that a bear wandering into camp will push the cord, the cord will trigger the mousetrap, and the closing of the mousetrap will complete an electrical circuit that turns on the alarm, thereby waking George and me to the dangers at hand.\nThat, at any rate, is the principle. For more than an hour, we struggle to drive the garden stakes firmly into the snow, and each time we test the fence by pushing at the cord, a stake pulls loose and the cord slackens, preventing the triggering of the mousetrap. Then, when George turns his attention to the car-alarm horn, a sharp crack echoes in the air, followed by the gentle sound of his voice: ''Uh-oh. I think I broke it.''\nAlthough George has spent more summers on Cooper Island than he often cares to count, he seems, upon first meeting, an unlikely candidate for the solitary hardships of fieldwork in the high Arctic. Handsome, boyish, with disheveled hair and a face deeply creased by abundant laughter in subfreezing temperatures, George lives nine months of the year in Seattle, and there is about him the unmistakable air of the overcaffeinated urban neurotic. He wakes up talking and, rushing to get the words out, keeps up a rapid, digressive chatter -- about George Bush and the Kyoto Protocols, the challenges of romantic commitment and the latest from Philip Roth -- almost until the moment, 18 hours later, that he falls directly asleep. It seems a waste of his conversational gifts for him to be on Cooper Island alone. It's also somewhat alarming. When I first met George in Barrow last February, I watched in wonder at his interactions with the mechanical world -- forgetting to keep his car engine running when the outside temperature dropped to 30 below; or, when he parked and did remember to plug his engine block into an electric heater, forgetting to unplug before driving off -- snap!\nBut for almost three decades, he has hurled himself to the very ends of the earth and met its risks and challenges with tireless enthusiasm. When his new stove broke on the first day of one field season, he kept a series of bonfires going all summer; when he ran out of freshwater, he placed tin cups around his tent to catch the rain; when his radio broke, he tried calling for help with an old signal mirror from World War II. (He also tried spelling HELP on the beach with large pieces of driftwood, but came up one log short, inadvertently announcing to the skies a pressing need for KELP.)\nNow, holding the two halves of the car alarm in his hands, he shrugs and says, ''To be honest, the fence doesn't keep bears out; it just lets you know that one is about to eat you. Really, it's just a placebo.'' He looks around at our camp -- one tent for cooking and two for sleeping that we've pitched far enough apart for privacy while also keeping, in George's words, ''within screaming distance.'' For our campsite, he chose what seemed the safest, most sheltered location near the island's south shore -- out of harm's way, and back from the thick, upended slabs of sea ice that have rammed up against the island to the north. But as far as I can see, we are nothing if not in harm's way: like a Bedouin camp in the desert, our three yellow tents are the only signs of life in this white-on-white landscape -- the only signs of food, come to think of it, to an animal so wily that it stalks prey by sliding on its belly behind a moving block of ice and is said to raise its white paw to cover its black nose for camouflage in the snow. ''Any bear that shows up on this island is probably very hungry or very deranged,'' George says fatalistically, ''and there's not much you can do to keep Charles Manson out of the suburbs.''\nII: IN WHICH GEORGE RIDES ON BOATS, PLANES AND SNOWMOBILES\nIf this story is, truly, about a flock of seabirds in the midst of worldwide climate change, then a reader may be moved to ask: Where are the birds? What's with all the snow and ice? And why does George seem less concerned about the tangible threat of polar bears today than he does with a few intangible degrees of global warming tomorrow? To begin to answer those questions, it may help to review the scientific argument about human-driven climate change: that our endless consumption of fossil fuels is pumping vast amounts of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise. It may also help to brush up on some geography regarding the very top of the world.\nWhether the glaciers of Greenland will continue to melt and the southern oceans rise up to flood Bangladesh, whether Cape Cod will erode to a sand spit and the American prairie dry out like the Mojave, whether thunderstorms will one day reach Antarctica and sparrows the North Pole -- whether all the disasters predicted by climatologists and their computer models eventually come to pass, one piece of the puzzle is already in place: the earth's climate will change first -- and change most substantially -- in the Arctic, that enigmatic expanse of snow and ice, of ancient peoples and unspeakably hostile temperatures that spans the top of the world.\nDespite its crucial role in managing the earth's climate, however, scientists know surprisingly little about the Arctic compared with the world's other oceans. Covered by ice, nearly impassable by ship, the Arctic is still earth's least-explored frontier. On a planet that has been thoroughly mapped, ship captains in the Arctic still make up their charts as they go along; two years ago, a Navy submarine carrying a crew of scientists passed over a drowned, mile-high mountain no one knew was there. Now that Russian science has gone bankrupt, Canadian research is suffering extreme budget cuts and most U.S. money for polar research gets funneled to the McMurdo research station in Antarctica, some of the best work to fill in the blank spots of the Arctic is being done by a small but hardy group of scientists associated with the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium, which uses this thriving, mostly Inupiat whaling community as its base.\nLike most bush communities in northern Alaska, Barrow is accessible only by air, and on June 1, George and I met up in the Fairbanks airport for the 90-minute flight. We had clear skies as we left the wooded foothills around Fairbanks and climbed steadily toward the Brooks Range. Watching the last of the boreal forest finger its way into protected valleys, we flew over the snow-and-glacier country of the Brooks -- ridge after ridge of granite peaks and frozen valleys so remote that they still exist largely without name. Cresting the mountains and passing the imaginary Arctic Circle, we saw the peaks turn to foothills, the foothills level off to the North Slope's frozen coastal plain. In north-central Alaska, the coastal plain stretches for more than 150 miles, and our plane followed the course of wild, braided rivers over a snow-covered, wind-swept landscape desolate as the moon. On this day, the Arctic pack ice was still jammed up against shore, and from the plane it was impossible to tell exactly where land ended and sea began. But eventually a hodgepodge of dusty streets and low-slung buildings came into view, and we touched down in Barrow, perhaps the only town in the United States that would be lost in a sea of whiteness on the 1st of June.\nCooper Island is just 25 miles beyond Barrow, with the ice of the Arctic Ocean against its north shore and the ice of Elson Lagoon to the south, but the fact that those 25 miles include -- at various times throughout the summer -- solid ice, junked-up ice, choppy 33-degree water, driving snow, sleet, dense fog and 40-mile-an-hour gusts makes travel to and from the island about as predictable as the behavior of Cooper's occasional bears.\nTo start his field season, George usually snowmobiles to Cooper over the frozen lagoon, as we planned to do two days after our arrival in Barrow. By mid-June, however, the lagoon ice starts to break up and Cooper begins to resemble an island with water lapping at its shores. For the remainder of the summer George is dependent on some kind of air transport for travel and resupply. The phrase ''air transport,'' with its connotations of scheduled departures and uniformed pilots, is misleading. George has built what he proudly refers to as a landing strip on Cooper, intended for small propeller planes equipped with tundra tires. In point of fact, it's a clearing in the gravel with two automobile tires to indicate the start and two crossed, wooden boards marking the end. And unless the plane is a ''tail dragger,'' the soft gravel will make it land nose first into the ground. ''Every time I walk back to camp, I drag my boots over my landing strip,'' George says. ''Do that for 20 years, and you have a nice place to land a plane.''\nThe first time George flew by small plane to Alaska, in 1972, he was traveling with three other biologists; within four years all had died in separate plane accidents. Of the 25 bush pilots who have flown him to and from Cooper over the years, five are no longer alive. Nonetheless, George remains sanguine about the perils of flying, often with some odd pilots at the controls. He has flown with the foolish (a pilot who took off with a chipped propeller after trying to fix it with a nail file), and he has flown with the idiotic (a pilot who refused to turn back when propane started leaking into the cabin). And once he planned to fly back to Barrow with a pilot who couldn't find the island beneath a 50-foot cloud bank and zoomed back and forth while George, on the ground, used his radio to guide him. (''You're to the north. . . . Now you're too far south. . . . O.K., now you're right above me!'') The only way George refuses to travel is by boat, ever since he was coming back from Cooper on a windy day and his 12-foot Boston whaler took in volumes of spray over the bow. While George bailed furiously, he and the captain watched the outboard motor slip right off the stern and sink to the bottom of the lagoon. Eventually they were towed to shore by Barrow Search and Rescue. ''I'm ready to have X number of minutes of terror if a plane goes down,'' George says, ''but just the thought of going in that water -- it's 33 degrees. It's a toxic substance. It might as well be an acid bath.''\nMy appreciation for George's fortitude only grew as I tried, while still in Barrow, to arrange a return flight from Cooper in two weeks' time. I called the local air-charter service that used to perform beach landings with a Cessna 185, but a pilot there told me they had suspended off-runway landings ''after we rolled that plane up into an itty-bitty ball.'' When I reached another pilot with his own light, fixed-wing aircraft, he asked in a challenging tone where on the island I expected him to land. I explained about the landing strip, the tires, the X marking the spot. ''Sure, sure,'' he replied and turned down the job as well. With so many recent small-plane crashes on the North Slope keeping pilots quivering on the ground, I eventually found myself with one last option: a search-and-rescue pilot named Gary Quarles, who owned a small vintage helicopter with a rebuilt engine, though he seemed as reluctant as all the rest to take on the potential complications of the job.\nAt this point, George stepped in on my behalf, and I saw for myself how he has managed to conduct a 27-year, poorly financed study in remote Alaska largely by sheer force of personality alone. Quarles has the pilot's requisite drop-dead sobriety, but George invited him over for coffee and a chat. He told Quarles about his birds. (''They're sort of like pigeons, but their black feathers have a subtle green iridescence -- it's very impressive.'') And he described all the methods he has devised over the years to survive on Cooper. (''It's like we're inventing a whole new culture out there.'') And with a nifty bit of anthropomorphism, he explained what brings the birds back to Cooper Island each year. (''Frankly, I know what they're going through. I once drove from East Lansing, Mich., to Sunapee, N. H., to visit my girlfriend, and I actually blew out the engine of my car thinking, I've got to get there! I've got to get there!'') By the time Quarles reached the bottom of his coffee cup, he was laughing and on board, promising not only to pick me up, but also to run resupply for George throughout the summer.\n''Well, I guess it's optimistic to think Gary will actually come through for us,'' George said after Quarles left. ''But then evolution selected humans for optimism, didn't it? If Gary can't do the job,'' he went on, ''I bet the folks at Search and Rescue will come get you. To be honest, this is how it always goes. Every year I fly to Barrow never knowing how I'm going to get out to the island and back. But I've learned it's just a matter of putting yourself in the next situation, putting yourself in a position where a favorable outcome is not only likely, but absolutely necessary.'' He stopped and smiled. ''See, unless you're stuck out on Cooper on June 15, no one's going to think of coming out to rescue you on the 15th.''\nOn the morning of our departure, after a fitful night of sleep, I met up with George at the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium for a final check of equipment, then to load three long wooden sleds with our gear: food, tents, stoves, pots, pans, water jugs, shotgun, radio, Global Positioning System, sleeping bags and mounds of fleece and down. Dave Ramey, who runs operations for BASC and moonlights as George's Jewish mother, alternately worried and scolded him for leaving everything to the last minute, for not upgrading his field camp after all these years. ''Really, George, why don't you just build a cabin out there?'' he said. ''It's crazy to be crawling in and out of tents all the time. And you really ought to use an Arctic oven -- that would warm you right up.''\nRamey and two of his colleagues had agreed to take us out, so we hitched the three loaded sleds to the backs of three snowmobiles and, after pushing hard from behind, ran and jumped on back. Within minutes of leaving Barrow, we hit thick fog and white-out conditions, and as we plowed across the ice-covered lagoon, we often lost sight of each other, hearing only the drone of engines in the mist before a wraithlike, hooded figure and a headlamp came back into view, as if through a desert sandstorm. For the next hour and a half, we roared across the smooth lagoon ice, tunneling through dense sheets of fog, and riding shotgun on the back of a sled, gazing out upon the absolute, featureless whiteness, I was hard pressed to say whether we were moving at 5 or 50 miles an hour; or whether the black, elongated bodies of ringed seals resting by their breathing holes were a stone's throw or a full mile away; or whether we weren't, after all, floating through a cloud bank at 30,000 feet. One summer, George came out to Cooper Island and, lacking landmarks of any kind, mistakenly set up his camp on the snow-covered lagoon -- and spent five days waiting for land to appear beneath him before he realized his terra was no more firma than a slowly melting sheet of ice. He beat a quick path to shore. On this day we had Dave Ramey and a G.P.S. to guide us, and after crossing 25 miles of lagoon ice, we reached a slight rise in elevation, no higher than the back of a breaching whale, and some bare strips of gravel, which confirmed we had reached the shores of Cooper Island.\nAfter helping to unload the sleds, Ramey and his colleagues started up their snowmobiles for the return trip to Barrow. And after waving them goodbye, George and I watched the red taillights disappear into the white fog, then stood and listened to the whine of engines diminish, then die completely in the wind. Alone with George, I looked around at the snow-covered island with its scattering of bones and feathers, the fog hemming in our sightlines to within 100 feet. Unable to tell where land ended and sea began, peering through the mist for bears and up at the sky for birds, I groped for the comforts of the familiar, or at least the analogous. Go to the Alps and you'll recognize the Himalayas. Spend time in Malibu and you'll know what's up on Montauk. But this bleak, bewildering place, in which wind rippling a pool of melt water shows up as a sign of life -- what did Cooper Island echo if you'd not yet been to Mars? George saw me shivering and said, ''Eat and drink everything in sight, and you'll start to thermo-regulate.'' So I cinched my hood a little tighter, adjusted my face mask and, beginning to comprehend what it meant to be a creature of Earth's temperate zones, shoveled trail mix into my mouth. But in truth I'd had the shivers ever since Barrow, when Dave Ramey took me aside to deliver some forceful words. ''We'll get you out to Cooper Island today,'' he said. ''But the rest is up to you. I don't know what George may have promised you,'' he went on, his tone suggesting a dozen messy situations George had dragged him into. ''But unless you've got reliable air transport lined up, you should expect to be out there till the ice melts out. I'm serious. Don't expect Search and Rescue, or me, or anyone else to come get you.'' He looked at me hard. ''If you go out to Cooper Island today, you're on your own.''\nIII: IN WHICH GEORGE FIRST ENCOUNTERS THE MYSTERY OF THE LITTLE BLACK BIRD\nCooper Island, June 6, 12:30 in the morning. The sky is full of slanting rain and freezing fog, the air temperature can't seem to reach 30 and the wind continues to blow out of the northeast with such numbing regularity that we've begun using it for support; if it stopped in an instant, we'd both pitch face-forward into the snow. Standing at the edge of the frozen Arctic Ocean, George lifts a high-powered telephoto scope up to his right eye and begins to scan the skies, wondering when his birds will leave their winter habitat on the sea ice and make their annual trip to Cooper Island to breed. George's scope is black and cylindrical and strapped with silver duct tape to the butt of an old wooden rifle. To brace the rifle stock against his shoulder and peer through the chunky, mortarlike scope, he must squint and lean back, bending slightly at the knees. Beneath his hat, his hoods and his thick fleece face mask, he looks like a nearsighted bugler, blowing reveille into a gale.\nWith no sign of the birds just yet and weather conditions such as they are, we appear to have two choices: walk or freeze. We choose to walk, while George begins to tell the story of how a heap of Navy trash -- some of it stamped with the words please do not destroy, these boxes are reusable -- came to be used by several hundred black guillemots and one lone scientist whose narrow, ornithological study eventually led him onto the trail of worldwide climate change.\nExcept for the fact that the dead walrus by our campsite had not yet decomposed, Cooper looked much the same when George first came upon it in the summer of 1972. Back then, five years after oil was discovered at Prudhoe Bay, environmentalists were on alert for the possibility of tanker spills, and George, 26 and already an ardent ornithologist, was hired by the Smithsonian Institution to go up and down the northern Alaskan coast to identify any vulnerable seabird habitats. Traveling the coastline on a Coast Guard icebreaker, he was dropped off one day on Cooper. Remarkably, the sun was out, catching the surface of all the Navy debris, and as he walked along, marveling at this strangely picturesque collection of scattered wood and rusted metal, two black guillemots, startled by the crunch of gravel, suddenly flew out from beneath an ammo box. Since guillemots don't normally breed in this part of the Arctic -- they are cavity nesters whose natural habitats, rocky cliffs and headlands, do not exist for more than 500 miles -- it was, in George's words, ''definitely a hit.'' He looked around and found eight more pairs breeding in the boxes, at which point, he says, ''I almost wet my pants.'' Before he left that day, he flipped over a piece of wood, creating a new nest site, and when he returned to Cooper three weeks later, he looked under the planks and found eggs.\nGeorge couldn't get enough money to return to Cooper for three more years, but in 1975, when funds for another assessment project became available, he asked to be sent back. When he arrived, he found 18 pairs of guillemots breeding in the boxes, and hoping to grow the colony, George began creating -- and naming -- new nest sites in earnest: Freshman Housing, the Condos, Married Student Housing. . . . ''Not only were there these odd places,'' he says, ''but you could create odd places and have them breed there.'' To a degree that was unusual even in the field of ornithology, George became obsessed, and over the next 10 years, he came out to Cooper each summer -- creating nest sites, banding the birds and, because guillemots are a long-lived species displaying fidelity to both their mates and their nest sites, coming to know them as individuals. One bird, nicknamed WOGy because of its white-orange-gray leg band, has returned to her same nest site on Cooper for more than 20 years. ''It was like a suburban street in the 1950's,'' George says. ''I knew who lived in every house.'' By 1978, there were 70 guillemots on Cooper Island, and by 1981 the population was up to 220. By 1990, almost 600 birds were scrambling around the drums and ammo boxes, looking for places to breed.\nBack then, George was thinking no more about global warming than any well-informed person with an interest in the natural world. Sharing the island with the birds and the bears, he had other things on his mind, and if he did pause to consider the Arctic climate, he assumed that it was static. Because he always got out to Cooper after the snow had melted and the birds had already occupied their nest sites, he also assumed that his seabirds timed their arrival on Cooper Island to the summer solstice, their reproductive schedule cued by the lengthening days.\nIn 1984, however, he happened to come out to Cooper earlier than usual, when the nest boxes were still covered by snow, and seeing that, he began to wonder if the birds' breeding habits were prompted not by the lengthening photo period, as he'd originally thought, but by access to their nest cavities -- like clockwork, the first egg in the colony always showed up exactly 14 days after the birds occupied their nests.\nScientific paradigms don't shift overnight, however, and more than 10 years of grinding, repetitive fieldwork would pass before George came to understand exactly what that meant. In 1995, in response to Vice President Al Gore's task force on climate change, a call went out for data sets: did anyone have information that would shed light on regional climate change? George acquired National Weather Service data on when the snow melted at Barrow and plotted the dates on a graph. Then he looked at his own data on when the first egg showed up on Cooper Island and plotted those dates as well. The correlation leapt off the page: from 1975 to 1995, snow was melting in northern Alaska, on average, five days earlier each decade. Over those same 20 years, the date his guillemots laid their eggs was occurring, on average, five days earlier each decade. In fact, since guillemots require at least an 80-day snow-free summer in which to copulate, ovulate, hatch and fledge their chicks -- and there were rarely 80 snow-free days in northern Alaska until the 1960's -- they wouldn't even be this far north were it not for warmer temperatures. Expanding their range, playing with the edge of a changing climate, his guillemots, he realized, were tracking the region's snow melt on an annual basis. And an earlier date of snow melt was, in effect, an indication that the seasons were in flux; that in a mere 20 years, the brief Arctic summer was now arriving 10 days earlier; and perhaps most important, that climate change was having a biological effect, leaving a fingerprint on a species living in a seemingly remote, pristine environment thousands of miles away from the industrial hand of man.\nAnd over the past few years, George has come to believe that the warmer Arctic climate is changing not only his birds' breeding habits but also the species in a far more profound way. Traditionally, the birds come back to Cooper Island over three successive nights, trying to gauge the degree of snow melt from the air, and there are dangers at every turn. If George's birds arrive on the island when it is still covered by snow, they can't take refuge in their dark, protected nest cavities and, with black feathers set off against the white snow, they run a high risk of predation; one summer a snowy owl showed up during the birds' mass arrival and swiped a guillemot out of the flock, eating it offshore and nicely demonstrating why getting to the island too early poses such a danger. If, on the other hand, the guillemots arrive too late, they risk losing their longtime mates, which is what happened one summer when one of George's favorite birds, Black-White-Black, returned to Cooper two days late only to find its mate, White-Red-White, otherwise engaged. Major battles ensued as Black-White-Black tried to fight his way back into his longtime nest. ''It was something to watch,'' George recalls. ''There was blood on top of the nest site and guillemot footprints in the blood!'' Caught between the perils of early and late arrival, knowing that their survival and reproductive success depends on perfect timing, the guillemots of Cooper Island have had to develop a highly sophisticated method for gauging snow melt. Those that can do it have persisted; those that can't have not. In effect, the warming of the North American Arctic has already precipitated natural selection for birds that can assess climate change in a highly sensitive way.\nJust what a hormonally crazed, falcon-fearing guillemot actually looks like became visible to me on our very first night on the island, when George suddenly looked up at the sky at 2 a.m. and said with considerable excitement, ''I think I hear guillemots!'' I heard or saw not a thing. Again, George looked and listened: ''Yup, they're definitely up there somewhere.'' And a moment later, I had my first sighting: 12 black birds in a tight flock, flying skittishly over the island at 500 feet, their rapid wing beats making a faint, wobbly Doppler sound like the hum of a dozen tiny windmills. Keeping in tight, antipredator formation, determined not to descend into owl or falcon range, they swooped over the snow-covered island, assessing the degree of snow melt on their nest sites and, evidently displeased with what they saw, disappeared as quickly as they'd arrived, dispersing like dust motes into the flat gray sky.\nOn the following night, with low fog engulfing the island, just one bird showed up, checked out the dismal conditions and flew back out to sea. But tonight, as we walk back to camp after touring the island in the steady rain, eight of them are back, flying lower and less nervously than they were two nights before. Directly above their nest sites, they set their wings and come dive-bombing toward the ground, but pull out of the dive at a hundred feet, caught between their hormonal urge to breed and their terror of landing so conspicuously on the white snow. Then, out of nowhere comes a second flock, merging with the first, flying with agitation, a few individual birds dropping from the flock with a stronger urge to land, but joining the safety of the group once again. Suddenly, their numbers have grown to 20, flying in tight concentric circles at 50 feet -- around and around, dipping, rising, surveying the ground still half-covered in snow. I take my eyes away to write some notes, and when I look up again there are 40, groups merging and breaking apart, darting like schools of minnows, keeling from black wing to white underwing, visible to invisible against the slate gray sky. For half an hour, we watch the complex choreography. And at 12:52 a.m., one bird breaks from the group and heads toward ground. ''This guy's going to land!'' George cries out. ''This guy's going to land!'' Feet splayed, wings pulled back, the first guillemot of the season arrives on Cooper with a great fluttering fanfare of wings. George looks through his scope and, recognizing the bird, lets out a hoot. ''That's a chick that fledged here -- a Cooper product, back in the 'hood!''\nAfter three nights alone on the island, George is delighted that his birds are back. But he's also mindful of the grim chronology: when he began his study almost 30 years ago, snow persisted on Cooper, preventing his birds from gaining access to their nests until the last week of June. Over those same 30 years, despite natural year-to-year variability, the birds have arrived, on average, five days earlier each decade. ''The great thing about guillemots is that they're birds, they're nonpolitical, they have no choice but to react,'' he says. ''Every weather station in the Arctic should have a bunch of guillemots nearby so that if skeptics doubt the weather data, you can point to the date the first egg gets laid in the colony.'' Tonight, it is June 6. The birds are back three days earlier than they were the year before.\nIV: IN WHICH GEORGE IMPERSONATES A GUILLEMOT\nUnlike Antarctica, a continent surrounded by ocean, the Arctic is mostly ocean ringed by land -- the frozen, inhospitable fringes of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia and Russia. And therein lies the simple reason for its crucial climatic role. For as long as human memory can recall, the majority of the Arctic Ocean has been covered, year-round, with a nine-foot-thick mosaic of sea ice as vast as the continental United States. Constantly moving, buckling, melting and refreezing, this blindingly white pack ice is remarkably efficient in reflecting solar radiation back into space before the sun's rays can overheat the region. The Arctic Ocean also serves as a kind of heat vent for the entire planet, taking the solar radiation that gets absorbed by the tropics and the temperate zones and, once it has moved poleward, releasing it to the atmosphere. But every year, as the 24-hour polar night shifts to 24-hour summer sunlight, more than half the pack ice melts, and when that white ice changes to dark, open water, the exposed ocean, instead of reflecting the sunlight, absorbs it and begins to warm the overlying air. And if, as a result of ever-increasing fossil-fuel emissions, the Arctic climate became too warm, it would create a ''positive feedback loop'': as the ice receded, the ocean would absorb more heat, potentially melting more ice until a cycle of heating and melting eliminated the permanent pack ice. Some computer models show that if atmospheric carbon dioxide were to double, the planet would heat up enough to melt the Arctic's summer sea ice by 2050. And if that forecast were to come true, extreme changes in the temperature and salinity of the Arctic and Nordic Seas would follow. In fact, the Arctic sea ice plays a crucial role in the circulation of ocean water for the entire planet; according to one theory, if the pack ice were to melt away completely, the fresh, frigid water cascading out of the Arctic and into the North Atlantic would stop the transport of warm water from the tropics to the high latitudes, shutting down the Gulf Stream and changing climate patterns throughout the Northern Hemisphere.\nWith those facts, figures and drop-dead predictions in the forefront of their minds, the scientists associated with the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium work with a special sense of mission. Walt Oechel, from San Diego State University, heads a team that flies a one-man airplane over much of Alaska's North Slope in order to measure how much carbon dioxide is produced and absorbed by the thousands of square miles of tundra -- he was the first to discover that the tundra, once thought to be an absorbing sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide, had, at some point in the 1980's, become a source, in effect pumping vast new amounts of the gas into the atmosphere. Bernie Zak, from the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., runs the Barrow site of a Department of Energy project that, along with sites in the Great Plains and the tropical western Pacific, seeks to measure the role that clouds play in Earth's heat-exchange processes. Dan Endres, living year-round in Barrow, runs the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory station here, the government agency that, along with stations in Hawaii, American Samoa and Antarctica, produced perhaps the most famous and persuasive piece of global-warming data: the graph showing 20th-century global temperatures running -- and jumping -- in tandem with worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide. And 25 miles away, there's George in his hat and gloves, huddled over his Coleman stove, with a week's growth of beard, breath pluming from his nostrils and lips starting to crack from the cold.\nWithin a week of our arrival, Cooper Island has lost much of its snow cover, the shoreline is beginning to emerge from its nine-month encasement in the sea ice and the mass of birds is back -- some 235 black guillemots set to breed in the dark cavities of the rusted 55-gallon drums and destroyed ammunition boxes littered across the flank of Cooper Island. To lower the risk of predation, and to save the brightest daylight hours for fishing out on the sea ice, the birds show up on Cooper only at night, usually sometime after 12, and roost on the north side of the island's main pond, calling to each other with a high-pitched, melancholy whistle. Then, once they've achieved the safety of numbers, they disperse to their nest sites and commence their breeding activities: courting and head-bobbing, strutting and exploring their nest cavities and, of course, copulating wildly. By day, without the guillemots in attendance, the island looks like what it is -- a gravel beach with trash on it. At night, however, with the birds teeming at their nest sites, the place is transformed by a hundred scenes of carnal bliss: Cooper Island, 90210.\nNow that the birds are back, George picks up his pace, walking all night in the wind and rain, taking detailed notes of which birds have returned, which nest sites are occupied, who is mating with whom -- all written into one of his yellow field journals with a pen taped to a footlong tent stake, the better to manipulate it while wearing two pairs of gloves. Because the birds are gone by day and here by night, George reverses his sleeping habits so that he can observe the birds from midnight until noon, then rest in the afternoon. And so that I can observe George, I do, too. But whereas the 24-hour light, the day-for-night sleep schedule and the ceaseless wind and cold all leave me disoriented -- a victim of what scientists here call Arctic brain fuzz, in which higher brain functions seem to shut down as the body works to stay warm -- George slips easily out of the diurnal rhythms of civilization and into the surreal, Cooper-driven universe, waking up cheerful and energetic after six hours of afternoon sleep. Since the sun never sets -- and won't for more than a month -- long, undifferentiated stretches of time pass on Cooper, marked only by golden, low-angle light as the sun approaches the ocean at midnight and then, some five hours later, by a gradual brightening of the sky, followed by the snow buntings' chimelike music -- a dawn chorus in a place with no dawn.\nWe do what we can to domesticate and structure the endlessly unspooling days. Waking at 10 p.m. to a breakfast of oatmeal or pancakes, we tune the shortwave radio to NPR's ''All Things Considered.'' Then, after working through the night, we sit down to a dinner of Dinty Moore beef stew at 8 a.m., accompanied by ''Morning Edition.'' At 12, not quite certain whether it's noon or midnight, we call it a day, wish each other good night and head off to our wind-blasted tents. There, we crawl inside two sleeping bags apiece and, truly warm for the first time in 18 hours, fall instantly to sleep. Many animals that live in or migrate to the Arctic each summer have special adaptive features. Polar bears have their eight inches of blubber, ankle-high willows possess scores of extra leaves to soak up the constant light, certain birds shut down their adrenal glands for the season so that their stress response does not become the death of them. Meanwhile, George, living like a large, flightless guillemot in his own low-lying cavity, seems to manage just fine without those adaptations.\nAfter three days alone on the island, we are joined by George's field assistant, Tamara Enz. Extravagantly competent, no less hardy than George, Tamara immediately sets out to fix all of his half-baked projects -- remounting the radio antenna to improve our communication with Barrow, shoveling snow into trash bags to avoid a late-summer drought of drinking water. Refusing to work all summer crawling in and out of a three-foot-high cook tent, she also builds a structure called a weatherport -- essentially a piece of canvas stretched over an arched metal frame. The weatherport affords us a place to retreat from the wind and permits the luxury of cooking in a standing position. But because it's larger than the old cook tent, we can't seem to heat it with the propane stove; when the outside temperature is 28 degrees, the weatherport's temperature rarely reaches above 32 -- it's like entering a walk-in meat freezer with the uncomfortable sensation that we are its meat. Sitting beneath the flickering light of the propane lantern while the weatherport creaks in the wind like a ship on high seas, we huddle around the radio, listening eagerly for the weather report, and the report is always the same: highs in the upper 20's, chance of rain, flurries and fog, wind out of the northeast at 15 to 20 miles per hour. Tamara, who at 35 has spent most of her working life in field camps from Maine to Alaska, tries to put the Cooper experience in perspective for me. ''Here there's no camp cook, there's no place to go and you're on call all the time,'' she says. ''You spend all day in the rain, the wind and the cold. And to warm up, you walk around in the rain, the wind and the cold.'' George smiles at the description and says: ''I've been doing this for so long, I've lost the ability to assess what's uncomfortable. I mean, it's 32 degrees in here, and I'm working in gloves, but basically I feel good. Sure, my feet feel a little funny, and I'm losing sensation in my lower lip, and for dinner I'm drinking hot Jell-O and eating Wheat Chex melted in chicken bouillon'' -- he toasts the air with his cup -- but at 32 degrees, it tastes like mother's milk!''\nOver the many years George has studied his guillemots, he has developed what he refers to as the Cooper culture -- the practice of surviving on the fewest resources possible. For the most part, poverty has been the mother of invention. Though George now gets financing from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and has income from his off-season work as a seabird consultant for the council investigating the Valdez oil spill, for many years he had to cobble together his field-season budget from a half-dozen sources or, when his funds dried up completely, raise the money himself. During much of the 1980's, he had no funds, no assistant, no radio, and he lived on a diet of oatmeal and rice. To minimize his resupply costs, he'd cache his unused cans of food and fuel in the permafrost, then draw himself a map so that he could dig them up the following year. And he has taught himself time-honored survival techniques used by the Inupiats, like supplying himself with drinking water by melting multiyear sea ice, or waiting for freshwater to float to the top of the lagoon during breakup.\nBut even now, when he has the money to prosecute his research with less day-to-day hardship, and at a time in life when many of his friends are complaining of their aches and pains, George chooses the ascetic path. ''People are always saying to me, 'Why don't you build a shack?' But I need to have a personal relationship with the birds. I need to be in their environment, to experience what the guillemots do, to know what it feels like to leave your cavity in the wind and the rain.'' Among Arctic scientists, many of whom have their data relayed to them by computer, George is an anomaly, and when he attends conferences on polar science, he sometimes gets miffed. ''I once heard someone give a paper on trace metals in Arctic water,'' he says, ''and it was clear the guy had never even been to the Arctic. I thought, I've passed more Arctic water through my bladder than you'll see in a lifetime!''\nGeorge looks out the weatherport door into a swirl of fog and freezing rain. ''Do you think it's strange that I've left a series of beautiful women in April and May -- one of whom wanted me to spend the summer at her mother's Long Island summer house -- to come up here?'' He shakes his head. ''Basically it all comes down to the yellow field books at the end of the year. I mean, I actually broke up with someone here in 1980, but I look at the field books and think: 1980, now that was a good year!''\nIn the field of ornithology, you can find other examples of scientists who have kept long-term studies going, year after year. In Great Britain, starting in the 1930's, the naturalist Ronald Lockley studied shearwaters and puffins for 20 years. In New Brunswick, Charles Huntington, a professor from Bowdoin College, has kept a study of Leach's storm petrels going since the 1950's. But in the nascent field of climatology, rare is the scientist with anything longer than a 5- or 10-year data set. That the guillemots come back year after year is, on the whole, less surprising than the fact that George does, too. In the 27 years that have elapsed since he first began his study, the dead walrus by our campsite has lost all its skin, fat and muscle; the young boy who once brought out supplies to Cooper grew up to become the mayor of the North Slope Borough; and Cooper Island itself has eroded a quarter of a mile to the northwest -- George's old campsite and airstrip on the east end are now completely underwater. When George wanders the beach, strange, ancient-seeming objects catch his eye, and he picks them up, marveling at how they could have reached Cooper Island -- before he remembers bringing them out himself more than two decades before. All of which has put him in a unique position to track changes in the Arctic climate and to make sense of large, seemingly random events that take years to figure out, like the one that began 10 years ago when the population of his guillemot colony gradually and mysteriously began to drop.\nThroughout the 1980's, almost 650 birds were coming to Cooper Island each summer, and with 85 percent over-winter survival, competition for the 200 or so nest sites was fierce -- one bird came back 11 years in a row before it could breed. ''It was like rent control in New York,'' George says. ''They were all waiting for someone to die.'' Then in 1995, he passed by two nest sites and saw the same male going back and forth, pairing with two females. ''I didn't believe my eyes,'' he recalls. ''I'd never seen a female without a male, I'd never seen bigamy, and as all males know, you can't keep one female happy. . . . '' Looking around his colony that year, he saw 10 more females who owned a nest site, but couldn't attract a mate. Something, apparently, was decreasing adult survival.\nA second clue came four years later, when George noticed a lot of sibling aggression among chicks -- a sign that food was scarce. And at several nest sites, he saw something else he'd never seen before: orphaned chicks, not yet able to fledge, starving and walking away from their nests toward shore in search of foster parents and food. ''It was pretty disturbing. I picked up one chick, and it was more stress than he could take -- he died right in my hands.'' Something was decreasing adult survival, and something, apparently, was killing off chicks.\nIf George's colony had consisted of any bird besides a black guillemot, his investigation of this gradual population drop might never have led him to look for answers in the Arctic environment. Arctic terns, for example, winter in Antarctica and fly 25,000 miles each year -- through the tropics, through the temperate zones -- before arriving in the Arctic to breed; anything between the earth's two poles could cause them to die off. Similarly, glaucous gulls, though not particularly migratory, feed on human sources of food like dumps and carrion, and therefore pick up anthropogenic contaminants that could confound interpretation. George's guillemots, on the other hand, spend their whole annual cycle in the Arctic -- wintering from September to May in the pack ice of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, then coming to Cooper Island to breed. As George puts it, ''They're not temperate-zone birds just slumming it in the Arctic.'' The guillemots feed at the ice edge all year long, where prey is most plentiful; they feed only on other Arctic organisms like cod and zooplankton; and they have a long, 80-day breeding cycle that they must wedge into the brief Arctic summer, which starts with the snow melt in June and goes right up to the first snowfall of the year in September. They are creatures, in other words, wholly dependent on snow and ice habitats sustained by them, restricted by them and adapted to them -- they are captive to the Arctic environment and thus the first to reflect a change.\nAnd George, no less captive to the snow and ice of Cooper Island, began to see a correlation: when the polar pack ice remained up against the shores of Cooper Island, as it did in the 1970's and 1980's, his guillemots -- able to feed easily from the nearby ice edge with its great density of prey -- had fabulous breeding success. When warmer summer temperatures caused the pack ice to pull offshore and retreat northward out of sight, as it did through the 1990's, his birds were unable to reach the ice edge and began to die off. By 1999, when a series of papers came out describing a major retreat and thinning of the Arctic pack ice due not only to gradually warmer temperatures, but also to a decadelong upper atmospheric shift called the Arctic Oscillation, George was in a position to put the pieces together. His colony was not merely tracking the advancement of snow melt and the earlier arrival of summer; it was also articulating a change in the very makeup of the Arctic itself -- the shrinking of the polar ice cap -- with all its potentially drastic worldwide consequences.\nGeorge, of course, is not the only scientist tracking the physical and biological affects of a warmer climate -- permafrost melting, coastlines eroding, moose expanding northward, walruses losing ice habitat on which to pup and hunt. But when it comes to relating such observations to the larger, slow-moving story of climate change, those data sets are useful only in direct proportion to their longevity and depth. And whereas some scientists find the long-distance work of climatology tedious and lacking in the kinds of signal events that grab people's attention, George is undeterred, married as he is to the year-to-year process.\nIt's interesting to consider: if George had begun his study five years ago, he would have missed the advancement in snow melt, the advancement of summer. If he'd begun his work as far back as 1990, he could never have connected the colony's population drop with the retreat of the pack ice. Having amassed a continuous, eyewitness data set for 27 years, however, he was watching the climate change not only in year-to-year increments but also in shifts from decade to decade, which has enabled him to see through the static of natural climatic cycles like the Arctic Oscillation, which may warm the region one decade, then cool it the next.\n''I sometimes forget that there's no other island in the Arctic where someone has gone back for 27 years,'' he says, cinching his hood and drawing up his face mask, preparing to leave the weatherport. ''Now I feel totally obligated to keep the study going. People say, 'Couldn't you just take a year off?' But if I skip a year, then it's lost. I only have one chance.'' He opens the weatherport door, and the wind nearly snaps it off its hinges. ''I don't want to sound like the Old Man of the Arctic, but I can remember the year the ice did this, the year the snow did that. I have the data set, I've got the numbers. It may be that I came back to Cooper all these years simply because I have minor attention deficit disorder, or all this summer sunlight has given me an addiction to high serotonin levels. But it meant something to me in a way that wasn't abstract. I was there. I saw it. And I saw it because I was there, living in my tent.''\nV: IN WHICH GEORGE SEES INTO THE PAST\nThe farther north you travel in this hemisphere, the more you hear conversations about the climate getting conducted not in the future, but in the present tense. In Whitehorse, the capital of Canada's Yukon Territory, officials now hold an annual exposition showcasing products to help residents mitigate and adapt to an already warmer climate. In Barrow, the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission spent a large part of its annual convention last year discussing, among other things, the perils of hunting bowhead whales from increasingly thinner ice. Some Alaskan natives, mindful that ''traditional knowledge'' is often considered merely anecdotal and lacking in scientific rigor, have set up a Web site (nativeknowledge.org), on which you can see two thousand people sharing much the same anecdotes: turtles appearing for the first time on Kodiak Island, birds starving on St. Lawrence Island, thunder first heard on Little Diomede Island, coastal storms undercutting houses at Shishmaref, snowmobiles falling through the ice in Nenana. . . . Already the central Arctic is warming 10 times as fast as the rest of the planet, outpacing even our attempts to describe it. In Canada's Northwest Territories, Inuit Eskimos saw their first robin last summer, though there's no word in Inuit for ''robin.''\nThose who remain skeptical that the Arctic is undergoing a period of rapid climate change point out that the region has always gone through cycles of warming and cooling, sometimes in just decades or even years. Perhaps, according to this argument, natural fluctuations cause the water to warm and cool, and the ice to thin and thicken as atmospheric pressures, water currents and wind patterns change. But the latest findings coming out of the Arctic suggesting a longer-term trend are hard to dismiss, even if their ramifications may not be felt elsewhere for many years. Recently unclassified submarine data, for example, show that the ocean's covering of snow and ice has thinned in some places by up to four feet, or 40 percent, since the 1960's. And satellite data indicate that the ice's reach has receded at a rate of 3 percent per decade since the 1970's. Recently, warmer, saltier water from the North Atlantic has crept farther into the Arctic basin than ever seen before. And that water is about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it was only a decade ago, causing further melting. Current models predict that global temperatures will rise by between 0.9 and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2050. And the rate of increase could be three to five times higher in the Arctic.\nFor their part, the black guillemots of Cooper Island cannot foretell the future. But just this past year George did devise an ingenious way for his birds to narrate the past. In the feathers of any guillemot are a host of chemical compounds that reveal aspects of its physiology, and one such compound -- a naturally occurring carbon isotope called delta 13C -- gives, in effect, a snapshot of what that bird has eaten from the carbon-based food chain in the past six months, just as a human autopsy can reveal the deceased's last meal. Since each region of the Arctic also has a different carbon signature -- the sub-Arctic Bering Sea, for example, is biologically highly productive and therefore possesses more of the isotope than the more northerly Beaufort and Chukchi Seas -- a particular feather's delta 13C content can identify not just what that bird may have eaten, but also where.\nKnowing that delta 13C is permanently preserved in feathers; knowing, too, that many Barrow-area guillemots going back as far as the 1880's had been shot, stuffed and housed in museum collections throughout the country, George sought permission to analyze those birds' feathers in order to compare them with feathers taken from his Cooper Island colony. Permission was granted, and guillemot feathers going back 120 years arrived at his Seattle home from collections in Philadelphia, Fairbanks and several points in between. George immediately sent them off to a lab, and when he plotted his data on a map, the results were startling. While the delta 13C content of the 19th-century birds was quite high, suggesting they'd had to fly as far south as the Bering Sea in winter to find ice cracks in order to fish, the more recent feathers possessed far less of the isotope, indicating that the birds had been able to winter some 500 miles to the north, in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. It suggested that over the past 120 years increasingly warmer temperatures were causing the pack ice to recede, causing cracks to open up farther and farther north. In effect, George had taken his 27-year study and back-cast it to show that guillemots were tracking more than a century of warming.\n''Skeptics can always find fault with the instrumentation used to take temperatures back in the 1880's,'' he says. ''But with the carbon isotope, it shows a huge decrease in delta 13C from 1880 to the present, which only makes sense if the birds were wintering farther and farther to the north. It's incredibly powerful. It's more than a hundred years. And it is,'' he says in a moment of gravity, ''the only interpretation of this data.''\nVI: IN WHICH GEORGE CONFRONTS HIS OWN MORTALITY\nCooper Island, June 18, 2 o'clock in the afternoon. In the huge amphitheater of the sky, several weather systems are playing simultaneously -- rain to the south, cumulus clouds to the north -- but for the moment the feature attraction is directly overhead: azure skies, not a cloud above, and the sun warming the air to an astonishing 35 degrees. With no wind for the first time in over two weeks (and no trees to rustle in a breeze), the island's birds have complete dominance of the sound stage: honk of geese, warble of snow buntings and -- the soundtrack of the Arctic -- the upward yodeling of long-tailed ducks as they fly in perfect V-formation above our heads. My, what a beautiful day!\nThe good weather is of more than passing interest to us right now. Four days ago, just minutes before he was scheduled to airlift me off the island and resupply George and Tamara with food, Gary Quarles radioed that he wouldn't be coming out after all. With the sky thick with fog, visibility was dangerously low, he said. And besides, Barrow Search and Rescue was short two pilots and had put him on 24-hour call. He'd get out to Cooper as soon as possible, he promised, weather permitting. But that was four days ago, and though we keep gazing up, looking for signs of our deliverance, there has been no indication of a chopper in the sky. For George, this is how it always goes. One year, he ran out of food on Cooper and radioed to Barrow, arranging for resupply, but the dispatcher went on vacation without forwarding George's message, and two weeks passed before someone happened to walk by the radio and heard his plaintive voice: ''This is Cooper Island, can you read me?'' Now, sitting outside the weatherport in the uncommon sunshine, he shrugs and says, ''Nothing to do but hope the weather stays clear and look forward to some very positive news. I'd say you're getting the full Cooper now.''\nIn the course of his 27-year study, George has not missed a single summer on Cooper Island, but there was a time in the mid-90's when he thought of giving it up. Back in Seattle, in what he refers to as ''the dark years,'' his marriage was coming apart, he needed to spend more time with his school-age son, Karl, and he began to doubt the value of all this work. ''Like it or not,'' he says, ''I've had a number of relationships go to hell because I always leave on June 1, saying, 'I'm going to the moon -- goodbye.' And the financial commitment is not insignificant. And so, up to 1995, there was a feeling of -- Wait a minute. What's going on here? Is this just another study with utility to only a subset of ornithologists? What have I done with my life?' '' But when, rather suddenly, his bird study began to intersect with the larger story of climate change, George recommitted to Cooper Island and his colony of guillemots in ways he'd never imagined.\nAmong his colleagues in Barrow, George is a local hero for the tenacity he has shown out on Cooper Island. And his graph displaying the advancement of egg-laying among his colony of guillemots has been given a special place of honor on the wall of the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Barrow, next to the graphs of several multimillion-dollar government studies. But aside from completing his dissertation in 1998 and having an article accepted by the academic journal Arctic, he hasn't published his results or sought a wider audience. And when I ask him why that is, he looks down, he removes and cleans his glasses with his shirt, and when he looks up again, he speaks in a slow, deliberate voice. ''It makes me feel really bad that I haven't gotten this out earlier,'' he begins. ''And so it's hard for me to talk about. I think that whatever characteristics cause people to do long-term studies are somehow linked to their not wanting or needing to be published. But I don't want to make excuses. I'm 55. My father died when he was 54. I don't want to say that I outlived my dad and then fritter away the next 20 years. Or die and have someone say of me, 'He had a data set that could have really added to the debate.' Now,'' he goes on, ''there's almost an obligation. Especially with George Bush in office, and people saying, 'Is climate change real?' You still get these people who say, 'Do you really think it's happening?' and I'm, like, 'What is it you don't understand?!' It needs to get out, and it needs to get out soon. People say that it's happening naturally, and why should we worry? But the world may not have the stability we think it has. This,'' he says, gesturing around the island, ''is evidence that stasis isn't operating.''\nGeorge does not involve himself with the various strategies -- conservation, reducing fossil-fuel emissions, reforestation programs -- that may if not reverse then at least mitigate what the vast majority of scientists now believe to be a worldwide warming trend driven in part by human activity. As George sees it, his job is to question and observe until he fully understands the workings of his own particular planet -- this strip of sand and gravel 25 miles off the coast of North America. But to witness all the changes that have come to Cooper Island and its birds over the past 30 years is to wonder when those changes will work their way up the food chain to us, despite civilization's capacity to buffer us from the day-to-day pressures of natural selection that formed the species as we know it. To be stranded on Cooper Island is to be reminded of the larger sphere on which we are all confined, along with all the changes we may have wrought. George shakes his head and looks off. ''Aside from the nuclear threat,'' he says, ''there hasn't been much in science that has the potential to affect a larger percentage of the population's everyday life.''\nAnd so, George is stepping up the pace. Having all but abandoned his original ornithological inquiry in favor of an all-out assault on Arctic warming, he plans to put a portable weather station on Cooper to get more precise correlations between the climate and his birds. He has talked to a scientist with a robotic airplane about flying out to Cooper to photograph the island from a bird's-eye view. He plans to begin sampling fat in chicks and adult guillemots to see if their nutrition can be related to ice conditions. And he has applied for a berth on a government icebreaker cruise next year to study the guillemots' winter habitat out on the ice.\nFinally, at long last, Dave Ramey's voice comes over the radio, informing us that Quarles is on his way. And within half an hour, we can see his helicopter cruising toward us over the ice of Elson Lagoon. After two and a half weeks spent on Cooper Island time, my departure seems to occur in fast-forward. The helicopter touches down by the weatherport in a swirl of dust and gravel. With Quarles waving me in, I bid a hasty farewell to George and Tamara. And after I throw in my packs and jump on board, we lift off in the deafening roar of the rotar-chop.\nAs we climb into the sky, Cooper Island begins to recede and lose detail. Out on the ocean, a line of pressure ridges -- huge, colliding slabs of blue-green sea ice -- rises up like the skyline of a distant city. Above them, a thin dark line of cloud -- what the Inupiat call ''water sky'' -- reveals the invisible presence of an ice crack out on the horizon. Give or take a passing icebreaker, or a native hunter looking for seals from an ice floe, the next group of human beings is probably in Svalbard, Norway, on the other side of the globe.\nBy the time we reach our cruising altitude of 1,000 feet, Cooper Island is just a patch of gravel in the vastness of the frozen ocean. From up here there's a temptation to employ the tropes of a hundred nature writers, to think of Cooper -- of the Arctic in its entirety -- as some distant, untouched environment, following only the rhythms of nature that the Alaskan poet John Haines once wrote of: ''A place where the clocks are stilled and the sun still holds some of its ancient power; another kind of rhythm dominates existence: When the ice goes out, when the fish come, when the geese and ducks begin to gather.'' But already those rhythms have been disrupted. The birds come back to the island earlier and earlier each year, the ice pulls offshore and the birds starve. And if the seas do rise, even Cooper Island, at nine feet above sea level, will go under. It may take years -- it may not happen in his lifetime -- but George plans to get himself a raft, just in case.\nWhen I look below me, I can barely find the weatherport and the three yellow domes. But then I spot George out by the north beach, knees bent, telephoto scope up to his eye. Clinging to the frozen rim of the inhabited world, with his levitating tents and his wavering radio antenna, his shotgun and his limp polar-bear fence, he looks to the skies and waits."}, {"text": "Celebration London\n2002-11-17T05:00:00.000Z\nOnce upon a time, there was Swinging London, an era that more or less coincided with the Beatles' first albums. Then, in the 1990's, London was declared capital of Cool Britannia, a phase that lasted all of three weeks. We Londoners breathed a sigh of relief as the city returned to its old, not too stylish, self. Not only can we live with that, we actually prefer it.\nTHE MOOD\nI'm one of those irritating people who ''divides his time'' between London and New York. This means that I regularly return to London after a couple of months away, and I'm forced to see the city through new eyes. These aren't exactly the eyes of a stranger, but there are times when London can suddenly look to me very strange indeed. The single thing that has eased my comings and goings is the Heathrow Express, a smart, clean, roomy train that sweeps you from the airport to Paddington railway station in about 20 minutes. Since my apartment is a five-minute cab ride from Paddington, it can feel as if this whole system has been created solely for my benefit.\nOnce back in London, my first job is to try to gauge its cultural pulse and temperature. Fortunately, since London is one of the great cities to walk in, this can be done simply by taking to the streets. I don't have a fixed circuit, but I usually begin on Oxford Street, the shopping thoroughfare with a former gallows at one end and a Virgin Megastore at the other. There are periods when it can seem like a tacky bazaar where all the shops are closing down and dubious characters are selling fake perfume on the corners. At other times it seems wonderfully vibrant, civilized and prosperous. Selfridge's, for instance, the department store that takes up a whole block between Orchard and Duke Streets, and which has known decidedly stodgy days, is currently a haven of designer clothes and whizzy modern furniture.\nPart of Oxford Street forms the northern boundary of Soho, which is where I always head. We might as well admit straightaway that London has a fierce drinking tradition, and Soho is the epicenter. A New York friend still can't quite believe that she once saw a blackboard outside a pub there that read, ''Come in and drink yourself silly.''\nSoho is never a quiet place, but there are times when it absolutely seethes with life, money and trendiness. The pubs, clubs and restaurants are always busy, but there are occasions when you can barely get in the door, and this applies as much to establishments that have been there forever, like the French House pub or the Gay Hussar restaurant, as it does to the cutting-edge watering holes -- Lab, on Old Compton Street, is a current hot spot, though who knows for how long?\nIf you plan your route carefully, you can walk past the former homes of Mozart and Karl Marx, as well as Agent Provocateur (run by Vivienne Westwood's son Joseph Corr\u00e9 and his wife, Serena Rees), a shop that sells surely the world's most expensive slutty lingerie. And I always saunter by the Prince Edward Theater, where, despite all predictions, people still flock to ''Mamma Mia!,'' the Abba musical; many of them even appear to be Swedish.\nFrom Soho I emerge in Charing Cross Road, historically the center of the London book trade, although it's being driven out by the new desirability and high rents of London property. The big chains are surviving, but the small, quirky bookshops are fighting a battle you fear they must ultimately lose. This makes the ones that survive -- Murder One, Any Amount of Books, Henry Pordes -- all the more cherishable. From here it requires a rather circuitous route and a brisk 20-minute walk to get to Euston Road. This has long been a blighted, windswept bit of territory, despite attractions like Madame Tussaud's and the new British Library. However, there's a section between Tottenham Court Road and Regent's Park, the north side of which has recently been turned into an architectural playground. Gorgeous modern skyscrapers with names like Euston Tower and Abbey National House, all glass and metal, wearing their innards on the outside, stand shoulder to shoulder in a straight line, often brilliantly sunlit. But directly opposite, on the not-so-sunny side of the street, Euston Road remains the grubby, unimproved London, with an old-fashioned cobbler at No. 335, a shop selling chess sets at No. 369 and a ''no refund, no fee'' accountant. The city faces itself here like nowhere else. Both are faces that Londoners know well, the excitingly new and the enduringly threadbare, and some of us love them both equally.\nTHE FOOD\nOne of my more painful London eating experiences came some years ago when I was taken out by an American friend's parents, who insisted on eating roast beef in a typical English pub they'd selected. It was, of course, terrible. The pub and the beef were equally tough and inhospitable.\nAnd to a Londoner, this came as not the slightest surprise. For decades the best advice you could give a visitor to London was never to eat in anything that called itself an English restaurant; go for Greek or Italian or Indian.\nIn fact, there's an argument that curry has become the true national dish of England. Curry permeates English cuisine in forms that vary considerably in subtlety: curried soups, curried chicken sandwiches, curry-flavored twiglets (don't ask), and almost every fish-and-chip shop in England will offer you curry sauce to go with your chips.\nLondon has hundreds of so-called Indian restaurants, though the chefs may well come from Pakistan, Bangladesh or Nepal. A few claim to serve haute cuisine -- the Red Fort and Chutney Mary's are good examples -- but it always seems to me that the unexceptional neighborhood Indian is the best choice. The one I go to regularly, admittedly out of habit rather than discernment, is the Agra, on Whitfield Street in Soho. Muhammad Ali apparently ate there once, or at least stood outside and had his picture taken -- the photographic evidence hangs inside. If Ali was looking for a plate of chicken tikka and a pint of lager, he would have been very well served.\nToday the foreign flavors in London are increasingly varied. Sushi bars flourish, and I can't imagine any national cuisine that isn't represented. A Spanish restaurant is a current favorite of mine, Cigala, on Lamb's Conduit Street, an area not much known for good restaurants. The cuisine is authentic enough -- dishes like grilled squid with mojo verde, or sea bass with escalivada -- but this is a genuine London restaurant, and a fairly luxurious one, so there's also roasted mallard with orange, olives and black cabbage, and scrambled eggs with truffles.\nIncreasingly, genuine English food doesn't need to apologize for itself. Celebrity chefs like Marco Pierre White and Alastair Little have raised standards both in their own London restaurants and in the culture at large. But for me English cookery reaches an apotheosis with the St. John restaurant in Clerkenwell, where the chef, Fergus Henderson, performs miracles with game, offal and all manner of old-fashioned foods that most Londoners stopped eating several generations ago.\nThe tamer end of the menu will probably include rabbit, grouse or cockles, but if you're really going to participate in the experience, you should choose something more exotic: jellied tripe, seagull's eggs, marrow bone salad or potted pig's head. The food is so intense and unusual, and also so good, that the d\u00e9cor is content to be plain, even austere. This concentrates the mind wonderfully, and whatever chill remains is taken off by the waiting staff who get the balance between deference and informality just right.\nThe St. John avoids the more obvious kinds of English comfort food: shepherd's pie, steak and kidney pudding, spotted dick, bangers and mash. You can get these in every pub and greasy spoon in London, but if I want my bangers and mash served with finesse, I go to R.K. Stanley on Little Portland Street. It looks the way a 1950's English cafe might, if it had been designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.\nR.K. Stanley will serve you a very good, plain pork sausage with mashed potatoes, but they're not purists about it; some sausages feature lamb or Caribbean jerk seasoning, and one of them, the squid sausage, is not really a sausage at all, but whole baby squids stuffed with a spicy filling.\nIt's still perfectly possible to find bad food in London, but it's never been easier to find the good stuff.\nTHE STYLE\nHowever well you know London, you still sometimes find yourself lost and in need of directions, so you look around for somebody who appears to be local. Whenever I do this, I invariably select a tourist who's more lost than I am, and who speaks no English. This no doubt says a lot about my own preconceptions of what a typical Londoner looks like, but it also reinforces the idea that there's no such thing.\nAnd, of course, it's not simply a matter of judging whether someone is or isn't a Londoner, you also have to judge what kind of Londoner he or she is -- the kind who'll know the way to the Sir John Soane Museum or the Tate Modern, an Emma Hope shoe shop or the Philippe Starck-designed Sanderson Hotel?\nPerhaps you'll be lucky and find someone like me who could direct you to all these places, and if you seriously want an idea of the range of London styles, I'd suggest you visit them all.\nThe Sir John Soane Museum used to be one of the best-kept secrets in London. The secret is now well and truly out, but it remains a very special and intimate place. Soane (1753-1837) was a highly regarded architect (he built the Bank of England), a collector of art and antiquities, and the small, crammed museum is his former house. Pride of place goes to an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus, which Soane bought in 1824, after the British Museum turned it down. He then threw a series of lavish parties to show it off. Quite a coup. You've probably noticed how fewer and fewer people have sarcophagi at their parties these days.\nNobody is likely to describe the new Tate Modern as intimate, though it's certainly special. The building was originally a power station, a four-square piece of industrial architecture. To enter you step into a vast hall where the turbines used to be. There's always some gigantic art on display here, though nobody has yet come up with anything that quite lives up to that space.\nBut then you ascend by escalator to a series of galleries that inevitably seem cramped by comparison, where crowds of people jostle to get a glimpse of the art. Sometimes you find yourself staggering over to the windows and simply looking out to admire the new Millennium Bridge that connects the Tate Modern with St. Paul's.\nIt would be silly to pretend that everyone who visits the Tate Modern is some kind of style maven, but it's certainly a very stylish destination, and for a public art gallery that's quite an achievement. Going there doesn't make you cool, but it's certainly a place where cool people go.\nThey also go to Emma Hope's shoe stores; there are currently three of them. What is it about London and shoes? It's where Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo got their big breaks, but whereas their style is international, Emma Hope's strikes me as profoundly local, and very London; it's the lack of flashiness and the use of fabrics like lace, beaded velvet and embossed calf. The shoes (prices are in the $300-$400 range) manage to be both understated and absolutely ravishing.\nIf you want to check exactly where you stand on the shifting sands of stylishness, you should go to Ian Schrager's Sanderson Hotel, on Berners Street north of Soho, particularly the Long Bar, where you sit on chairs upholstered in Fornasetti fabrics and drink wines or cocktails that are some of the most overpriced in London.\nNow, there are people who find the Sanderson a haven of refinement and restrained elegance. Others find it a madhouse for poseurs and wannabes, just another style bar. My own opinion is that the Sanderson is a truly great, fun place to go -- once. However, the term ''style bar'' has changed its meaning in London over the last few years -- from one of approbation to one of abuse. It's now synonymous with an overfussy, overdesigned watering hole that the true cognoscenti wouldn't be seen dead in -- which says it all. London style has to appear effortless."}, {"text": "The East End Goes Mainstream\n2002-12-08T05:00:00.000Z\nAMONG young British artists, maps are all the rage. In a London gallery, I recently ran across a collage by one artist, Layla Curtis, who had taken an ordinary road map of Europe and rearranged it so that Lyon hovered somewhere north of Stockholm.\nWhether they are commenting on the powerful fortunes of geography or the fickleness of popular perception, these artists may easily have been influenced by the topsy-turvy landscape of a changing London. The city's center of gravity -- at least, much of its cultural, financial and culinary energy -- is spreading from the traditional moneyed districts of the West End toward the former working-class districts farther east.\nThe East End was described by the Victorian writer Arthur Morrison, in ''Tales of Mean Streets,'' as ''an evil plexus of slums that hide human creeping things where every citizen wears a black eye, and none ever combs his hair.'' East London's mean reputation, particularly the lurid legacy of Jack the Ripper, who murdered five prostitutes in various East End neighborhoods, has always drawn a few curiosity seekers. But now the area, the traditional home of London's Cockneys, as well as wave upon wave of immigrants, has a broader appeal. Admittedly, conventional tourist sights along the lines of West London's imposing museums are scarce, and the area is pockmarked by postwar housing projects that replaced row houses, factories and wharves demolished by German bombers. But there are more than 80 art galleries, including Rhodes & Mann, where I discovered Curtis's work; some of London's most picturesque markets; uncrowded parks; sleek new restaurants offering international cuisine; and, of course, a new generation of East Londoners.\nTake the crowd at the Golden Heart pub in Spitalfields, where I stopped on my way home from work for a pint of bitter on a recent evening. More than 100 years after Morrison described the archetypal East Londoner, unkempt hair still seemed to be the norm, though I spotted no black eyes beneath the shaggy manes. Instead, the bar-goers wore suits, with ties loosened after a hard day in the nearby financial district, or hip zip-up cardigans to complete their look of benign neglect.\n''The people moving in now remind me of the original Cockneys,'' said Sandra Esqulant, who has run the pub for 24 years.\nWhy?\n''Look at them -- they're lovely.''\nBut it isn't just Londoners who have caught on to the area's appeal. As I browsed through the Old Spitalfields Market on a recent Sunday, the other shoppers spoke a babble of European languages as they sorted through the trendy but inexpensive clothing, home furnishings and organic food for sale. The market, seemingly under constant threat of redevelopment, has so far managed to survive the encroachment of City office towers.\nSpitalfields makes a good start to any tour because it is the heart of the old East End. If you want to get into a lively discussion in a pub, however, ask someone what other districts are included. You won't get much disagreement about the slowly gentrifying neighborhoods of Hackney or Bethnal Green, to the northeast of the City. Still-impoverished Whitechapel, only a half mile east of the Bank of England but worlds away in spirit, is also a sure bet.\nThe epicenter of hip East London is Shoreditch, just north of the City, which has seen an influx of designer bars, restaurants and galleries in the last five years. It's a great place to go bar-crawling on a Saturday night, or to take in live music at clubs like Cargo, but it seems to have lost some of its original East End vibe.\nThe first wave of gentrification brought artists and bohemians to this area, but now workers from the financial district have taken over, and local businesses have sometimes adapted to their tastes. Cargo, for instance, draws crowds on weekends when top DJ's play house music, and on other nights it offers everything from African to Brazilian bands. The club is under the brick arches of a rail line leading into Liverpool Street Station, and has an atmospheric restaurant and bar area. But when I headed there on a recent Wednesday, the music of a studio-smooth band called Temple of Sound was less interesting than its fashion statement.\nAs Shoreditch goes more mainstream, changing pockets are cropping up farther east. The Docklands, for example, is hard to categorize. It may have been the commercial heart of East London once, the port of call for ships from all over the empire; now it is rapidly regaining its hub status, but, with its stainless steel and glass towers, and chain pubs warning ''smart dress only,'' it hardly feels like the East End.\nBut along the Thames between the City and the skyscrapers at Canary Wharf there are neighborhoods like Wapping -- full of million-dollar apartments but also home to ancient pubs like the Captain Kidd, at 108 Wapping High Street, and the Prospect of Whitby, 57 Wapping Wall. The Wapping Hydraulic Power Station, Wapping Wall, has been converted into an art gallery and restaurant, like a miniature version of the Tate Modern a few miles upriver.\nIf East London lacks a unifying feel, it is perhaps because of poor transportation links. While the West End is served by numerous Underground lines, service to the east is spotty. A poky train, the Docklands Light Railway, travels to Canary Wharf and beyond to Greenwich, but is not particularly useful for sightseeing.\nOne hundred years ago Jack London complained that he couldn't find a taxi to take him to the East End. Even now, though buses fill in some of the wide gaps between Tube lines, you may have to rely largely on your feet.\nFortunately, there are plenty of places for a pleasant stroll.\nOn gray Sunday mornings I like to head to the Columbia Road flower market. In a city full of market streets, this is one of the brightest and most cheerful: several blocks lined with shops selling everything from hats to gardening equipment, with vendors hawking all kinds of plants and flowers outside. Shortly before closing time -- the market is open on Sundays only, until 2 p.m. -- they start offering bargains: \"One for a fiver, three for a tenner!\"\nFrom Columbia Road, it is a short walk to the art scene of Shoreditch. Rhodes & Mann is a five-minute stroll away along Hackney Road (No. 37, E2), and if you continue along to Hoxton Square, you run into the White Cube gallery (No. 48, N1). Jay Jopling, who helped give birth to the ''Young British Artist'' phenomenon when he opened an earlier gallery along Duke Street in St. James's in 1993 -- championing the likes of Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst and Sam Taylor-Wood -- moved to Hoxton Square two years ago and recently expanded the White Cube after he closed his West End branch. The gallery, in a converted industrial building, sprouts a glassed-in expansion on the roof; inside it resembles -- well, a white cube, a minimalist backdrop to the art.\nOther galleries are scattered throughout Shoreditch and Hackney, an area where gentrification is only starting to make inroads. Hackney, one of the poorest boroughs in Britain, is not an easy area to explore. But mixed in with the grime are some pockets of unexpected beauty. After stopping in the galleries, like Flowers East or Century Gallery, clustered around the southern end of Kingsland Road, you can head north to the Regents Canal, alongside which a towpath offers miles of serene walking or jogging -- although it's not advisable to go there alone after dark. For a while, the canal runs alongside the 290-acre Victoria Park, as elegant as any park in West London.\nBefore the autumn rains came to London I visited on a Saturday afternoon, planning a quick walk, and ended up spending the rest of the day. Victoria Park is one of the best places in London to relax, and I managed to work my way through four weekend newspapers on one of its lawns, as green and well cared for as Hyde Park, but without the crowds. For a while I joined in an impromptu soccer match with a few teenagers sporting the jelled hairdos of their Premiere League heroes. When I got hungry, I headed for Hackney Village, a rapidly gentrifying area of Victorian row houses, with a cluster of shops and cafes, along the northern edge. Between the canal and another green space, London Fields, runs Broadway Market, a High Street where the contrast between old and new is on full display. At No. 9, F. Cooke sells jellied eels, a traditional East End specialty. At No. 41, Armadillo restaurant offers a range of delicious Latin American dishes; the kitchen is run by a Brazilian chef. Other shops sell organic foods and handicrafts.\nJELLIED eels are, to put it mildly, an acquired taste, but luckily the East End's culinary offerings have come a long way. You can get cheap but tasty Indian and Bangladeshi fare in the curry houses that line Brick Lane between Shoreditch and Whitechapel; customers bring their own beer or wine, because most of these restaurants do not have licenses to sell alcohol.\nYou can sample delicious Vietnamese food at Viet Hoa, a hole-in-the-wall restaurant at 70-72 Kingsland Road. A refurbished pub, the Crown, 223 Grove Road, along Victoria Park offers organic cooking. The hip eateries in Shoreditch serve modern British and European food. And in an old pub facing the Victorian brick arches of the elevated rail lines leading into Liverpool Street Station, three antiques dealers have created one of the trendiest restaurants in London, Les Trois Gar\u00e7ons.\nThrough a darkened window, the restaurant resembles the gastronomic temple Le Grand V\u00e9four in Paris, but step inside and the similarity ends. Les Trois Gar\u00e7ons is anything but traditional -- more like a taxidermist's acid trip. A stuffed giraffe's head, topped with a crown, looms over one table. A giant ape chomps on a cigar near the entrance.\nDeliberately out of the mold, the restaurant has had mixed reviews from London food critics.And while the food is traditional French bistro fare, the prices are outrageous -- you could get a round-trip day ticket on the Eurostar from London to Paris for the cost of a dinner.\nBut despite the complaints -- or perhaps because of them -- the Trois Gar\u00e7ons manages to lure an image-conscious crowd; the evening I was there, Rod Stewart sat at a nearby table. If London's establishment in-crowd is going east, the East End must be squarely on the map.\nThe bells of Shoreditch change tune\nGetting Around\nThe London Underground offers only spotty service in the East End.\nMost useful are the Central, District and Hammersmith, Circle and City Lines. The Spitalfields and Shoreditch neighborhoods are only a short walk from Liverpool Street Station. The Docklands Light Railway, which leaves the financial district, the City, from two stations -- Bank and Tower Gateway -- runs to Canary Wharf and other destinations in the Docklands. For many other areas you have to rely on buses or mainline trains -- or walking.\nTo make navigating easier, F-EST, www.f-est.com, an organization formed to promote East London galleries, has produced a free map pinpointing them.\nAccommodations\nThe East End itself has few hotels, but the nearby City has several new hotels that make better bases than the West End for exploring the area. The Great Eastern Hotel, (44-207) 618-5000, fax (44-207) 618-5011, www.great-eastern-hotel.co.uk, at Liverpool Street Station in the EC2 section, has 267 rooms designed in the style of Terence Conran. Doubles range from $410 to $766 for suites.\nThreadneedles, 5 Threadneedle Street, EC2, (44-207) 657-8080. fax (44-207) 657-8100, www.etontownhouse.com, a 70-room boutique hotel, recently opened in a former bank in the City, and a stained-glass dome in the entry hints at its former role. Doubles are $410 to $1,223 for suites.\nDining\nThe Crown, 223 Grove Road, London E3, (44-208) 981-9998, is one of a new breed of ''gastro pubs'' -- traditional London pubs that have been updated to serve better food and offer a bit more ambience. The Crown, which overlooks Victoria Park, offers an additional twist --- the food, beer and wine on offer are certified organic.\nYou have to order at the bar, but dishes like a pumpkin and roast pepper risotto are worth it. About $54 for dinner for two with a beer or a glass of wine. Open daily from 10:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Mondays from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.\nThe tiny Armadillo restaurant, 41 Broadway Market in Hackney, E8, (44) 207-249-3633, offers an unusual menu of pan-Latin American dishes. The Brazilian chef, Rogerio David, changes the menu often, but I had a delicious fillet of beef with Argentine chimichurri. The desserts -- such as Maya chocolate ice cream with almond pastry -- are delicious, and there are Chilean and Argentine wines. About $95 for dinner for two with wine. Open for dinner Tuesday through Saturday, and for brunch on Sunday.\nLes Trois Gar\u00e7ons, 1 Club Row, E1, (44-207) 613-1924, is worth a visit if only to see the outrageous d\u00e9cor. Though the prices are also outrageous, service is fairly relaxed, and the traditional French cuisine is well done. I had foie gras layered with truffles and a plum compote, followed by tender venison accompanied by chestnuts. About $185 for two, with wine. Open for dinner Monday through Saturday.\nNight Life\nCargo, under Kingsland Viaduct at 83 Rivington Street in Shoreditch, EC2, (44-207) 739-3440, www.cargo-london.com, is one of the most popular live music clubs in London and offers a variety of shows, from jazz to world music to house. Expect to wait outside for an hour or so on weekends. Open daily, until 3 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.\nStylish bars are a dime a dozen in Shoreditch and nearby Hoxton. To find them, simply take a walk along Rivington Street not far from the Old Street Underground station, or head across Old Street to Hoxton Square.\nFor a more relaxed evening, there are still plenty of traditional East End pubs. The Golden Heart, 110 Commercial Street in Spitalfields, E1, is one of the friendliest, and the location is convenient.\nFarther afield, in the Docklands, the Prospect of Whitby at 57 Wapping Wall, E1, along the Thames is one of the oldest riverside pubs in Britain.\nMuseums and Galleries\nFounded in 1901, the Whitechapel Art Gallery, 80-82 Whitechapel High Street, E1, (44-207) 522-7888, www.whitechapel.org, is one of the oldest and largest exhibition spaces in the East End. It shows contemporary work; recent exhibitions have included Nan Goldin, Gary Hume and Rodney Graham, and a Mies van der Rohe show opens Tuesday. Closed Sunday. Free.\nThe Geffrye Museum, at 136 Kingsland Road in Shoreditch, E2, (44-207) 739-9893, www .geffrye-museum.org.uk, offers a glimpse into the changes in English domestic interiors over the last four centuries, right up to the luxury lofts that fill the nearby converted warehouses. Open Tuesday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from noon. Admission is free.\nThe Wapping Power Station, Wapping Wall, (44-207) 680-2080, is in E1. The exhibition space is closed on Mondays, and the restaurant is closed Sunday evenings. ERIC PFANNER"}, {"text": "A Variety of Ways to Give Thanks\n2002-11-22T05:00:00.000Z\n How do people express their thanks at Thanksgiving \u2014 besides eating turkey and pie? A variety of Americans, of different religious (and some non-religious) backgrounds described the way that, last Thanksgiving, they began their meal? \n Did the diners pray? Was there any special prayer \u2014 or any other kind of ritual to express gratitude? Did everyone participate? Was it comfortable or strained? Did this reflect who was gathered for the meal? Would the same thing be done next week? \n Here are some of responses: \n From The Rev. Eileen Lindner, a Presbyterian minister and deputy general secretary of the National Council of Churches: \n It is our custom to gather extended family, our college-age son, grandparents, neighbors and friends, our high school-age son for Thanksgiving. We generally have appetizers and something to drink an hour or so before we will have dinner. At that time we informally go around the room and share some description of what each of us is thankful about this particular year. \"Family, friends, and good health\" are three perennial favorites. \n After years of doing this however it is interesting to look back and see how items identified as a blessing \u2014 college acceptances, new jobs, successful surgeries, etc. \u2014 actually prove in retrospect to have been turning points in our family members' lives. The children in our family keep us honest with their participation, which sometimes features gratitude for things like a passing grade in algebra, or the absence of creamed corn from the menu. \n As we come to the table we offer a prayer of thanksgiving for those many blessings we have named. Our corporate sense of well being and gratitude for God's graciousness is therefore very much before us as we share the meal. \n From Rabbi James Rudin, senior interreligious adviser, the American Jewish Committee: \n In our family Thanksgiving has for decades been more than a Turkey Day feast. \n Like the Seder, it is the time when our nuclear family, wife, husband, two daughters, are always together plus now son-in-law, granddaughter and son-in-law's parents from Michigan. \n We really do go around the table and spend sometimes 30 minutes (depends on the size of the dinner crowd) asking each person what they are most thankful about in past year, what has changed in their lives (for better or worse). \n Interestingly, this introspection is not superficial and does in fact set a tone for the dinner. Travel, illnesses, deaths, births, job changes and promotions, loves and losses, etc. all are revealed. \n We, of course, do recite the traditional \"motzi\" before we eat. \n The entire tone is not as liturgical/ritualistic as the Seder but Thanksgiving allows us to tell our stories, unlike Passover where we link ourselves to an ancient story, albeit a defining narrative. \n Thanksgiving is unique among American national holidays. Unlike Memorial Day (war), July 4th (political independence), Labor Day (trade unionism) and birthdays of Washington, Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., etc., Thanksgiving, even its very name, offers a family and the nation a \"religious or spiritual\" opportunity that is not directly linked to a specific event \u2014 or to a specific religion, even though the Protestant Puritans may have originated it. \n When we first started going around the Thanksgiving table, I was a bit skeptical that much would be revealed from the folks at the dinner. Just the opposite:.the discussion and introspection is the best part of the event. \n Finally, during that introspection, we remember \"Thanksgivings past,\" with now deceased sibling (my brother), grandparents, great grandparents, parents, etc. \n From Maxine Phillips, managing editor of Dissent magazine and a member of Judson Memorial Church in Manhattan: \n Before the meal, we hold hands and welcome everyone. During the meal, we go around the table and each person says what he or she is especially thankful for during the past year. \n This is a practice that has evolved because we usually have guests from different faith traditions or no faith traditions and have felt uncomfortable even singing a blessing, since they usually didn't know it. \n Our own nuclear family members are split on the subject of saying grace, so that singing was our compromise. As the circle widened, we arrived at this practice as an attempt to be inclusive but retain the idea of praise and thanks. It also puts people in a good mood during the meal and leads to interesting conversations. \n From Martin E. Marty, the Fairfax M. Cone distinguished professor emeritus of modern Christian history at the University of Chicago: \n Belonging to the company of those who believe that \"Thanksgiving\" is meaningless if it means \"Thanksgiving For\" without \"Thanksgiving To,\" we get to worship on Thanksgiving morning each year. \n Then we pack off to the Illinois/Iowa Quad Cities where with four Martys from the next two generations, we give thanks \"for\" and \"to,\" sometimes enumerating blessings, including Susan Marty's gourmet cooking. \n In South Africa, by the way, we found people who could not get over the fact that the Martys celebrated Thanksgiving, because it was a \"colonialist\" feast, having origins in Plymouth Colony, where whites eat with Native Americans and then kill 'em. \n We've run into that often here, too, among the most hypermulticulturalist boutiquers. \n From R. Scott Appleby, church historian and director of the Joan Kroc Institute for International Peacekeeping at the University of Notre Dame: \n I turn to my children to remember what happened the day before yesterday and, increasingly, yesterday. Our 18-year-old daughter Clare says the following about last Thanksgiving: \n \"There were eight teenagers at the table, the four Appleby kids and four guests. . . . We said `grace,' in the usual manner. Then Dad urged everyone to think of the poor, lonely and homeless because they lack what we take for granted \u2014 home, clothes, food, education, security, loved ones. Then Dad made everyone around the table say what we are thankful for. So the atmosphere was strained rather than comfortable because they were put on the spot. . . . \n \"One guest was obsequious. He said: `I'm thankful that people like you invite people like me into their homes for the holidays.' Another, in his weird way, said: `I'm thankful that they let me write for the school paper,' his passion. I, Clare, said: `I'm thankful for my new car.' \n [Note from Professor Appleby: the sign of the apocalypse approaching: I had actually caved in and bought her a used VW-something I would never think of doing for any of my three sons.] \n \"Mom got emotional and said she was thankful for the love in our family and the good, caring people throughout the world. \n \"Dad, of course, had the most bizarre response, which he did not bother to explain, making everyone even more uncomfortable. He said: `I am thankful for the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world. An astonishing claim, and we believe it!' \n [Further note from Professor Appleby: Clare remembered only the Lamb of God part. With this prompting, I recalled that my point was more along the lines of `who somehow, mysteriously, amazingly takes away the sins of the world' and the `we believe it' sentence expressed gratitude for our faith.] \n \"This went on long enough for the potatoes and turkey to get cold.\" \n [End of Clare Appleby, more from her father: This year? I'll try to elaborate on the `Lamb of God' thing. Which could be tricky with the new round of guests: the Darbys, from Belfast; and two women anthropologists in residence at the Kroc Institute: one from Australia, working on Buddhists in Burma; one from Bangladesh, working on Muslim women in Bangladesh. \n [Past years? We have had both Jewish and Muslim guests for Thanksgiving dinner, on alternate years, and we always ask them to say the prayer or blessing over the meal. On both occasions, this has led to some kind of informal \"interfaith\" discussion.] \n From Mark Silk, director of the Leonard E. Greenberg Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life, Trinity College, Hartford: \n The lede on the Silk Thanksgiving is that we have never gone in for much in the way of formally giving thanks. I have an idea that you will not find much of that in Jewish families generally. \n Although (with the exception of some of the Orthodox \u2014 and I wouldn't be surprised if those numbers were increasing) Jews have long made a practice of celebrating Thanksgiving with the hallowed turkey and pie, it is not a Jewish holiday meal, and therefore not likely to be sanctified in the way that Jews sanctify holiday meals \u2014 with a lighting of candles, a Kiddush over the wine, a motzi over challah. \n The Jewish Thanksgiving is, of course, the Passover seder, with the \"thanks\" part of it liturgized in the singing of Dayenu (`If He had just taken us out of Egypt, it would have been enough,' etc.). So any giving of thanks to God would tend to feel Christian. \n What I can say about our family is that Thanksgiving has somehow been an occasion for getting together with my side of the family, not my wife's. . . . One possible explanation is that Thanksgiving has always been a singularly untroubled occasion for my (birth) family. \n Seders especially tended to be more problematic, with a good deal of tension over how seriously to take it religiously. My late father [a distinguished economics and business columnist for The New York Times] was barely Jewishly educated (couldn't read Hebrew for example), and was, as it is said, largely tone deaf religiously. (He strongly identified as a Jew, but that was something else.) And yet Thanksgiving was the one holiday that genuinely seemed to engage him spiritually. He had a particular fondness for what I guess is called the Thanksgiving Hymn (\"We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing . . . \"), which he learned in school in Atlantic City. \n From time to time he would try to get us to sing it; generally it petered out because no one seemed to remember all the words. We did tend to remember \"Over the river and through the woods\" \u2014 the other song that sometimes got sung at Thanksgiving. The more dependable ritual activity of the day \u2014 ongoing and much prized by my three sons and my brother's son) is a game of touch football. . . . This year we are going to my mother's on the Upper West Side. There will, I feel sure, be some football in Central Park. \n Despite this pallid approach to giving thanks, I can say that Thanksgiving has always been the happiest occasion for our family to get together, a boon for which I now feel impelled to give thanks. \n From Sohail Hashmi, professor of international politics and writer on Islamic ethics of war and peace, Mount Holyoke Colleg: \n Last year, Thanksgiving fell in the middle of Ramadan, as it does again this year. It's quite a felicitous conjunction of celebrations, because Ramadan serves for Muslims many of the same purposes as Thanksgiving: giving thanks with family and friends for the many blessings we enjoy, sharing with people who truly are in need. This Thanksgiving, like the last, will be spent fasting and praying, followed by a fast-breaking meal at sunset with the people I love most. \n From Tom Vitullo-Martin, writer and educational consultant: \n Last Thanksgiving was difficult, because our minds were more focused on the pain and suffering of our neighbors downtown in New York. We were not as much into the traditional Thanksgiving, a feast of harvest foods. For my family, the traditional Thanksgiving is a bit difficult, because we give thanks for the bounty of pastas and raviolis with tomato sauces, pork, rice and raisins, corn polenta and breads, southern hams, and the best fish one can find \u2014 crab, oyster, clam, snapper, grouper. \n Last year we visited my brother and his fiance\u0301 in Washington. My father and stepmother were able to come in from Cincinnati. He is 88, but a better traveler than me. My Palestinian-American niece, at Georgetown, came with one of her friends. \n Though we were almost all family, as a group we had never been together before at the same time. Before we ate, we held hands in prayer \u2014 not something I recall from the Roman rite, which is my pleasure. . . . We silently joined in a spoken prayer I do not recall precisely, but one of thanksgiving. . . . \n This year we are assembling in New York. The same group, sans dogs, but with additional New York friends. The foods will be about the same: Italian foods that could credibly be called Pilgrim-type, though our tastes tend more toward the native tastes than the Pilgrim's fare. \n The struggle will be to slip in oysters, which my father believes to be inedible, in such a way that he will not notice, and to convince my niece that no animal was harmed in the sausage and oyster stuffing. We will have carved a mozzarella to be her turkey, and hopefully will have convinced her that the cow was both happier and better off for having given the milk. \n Our thanksgiving will be that we are still together and that so far here and in the Middle East and elsewhere, none of our family or close friends has been injured. Our prayers will be that our family survives the onslaughts in Jerusalem and Bethlehem and Nablus, and that our friends in the military are safe and proud at the end of their battle, which we pray will be avoided, and that New York and Washington, though targeted, are not grievously injured. I doubt we will hold hands, but one can always be outvoted. \n Our prayer that Notre Dame beats Southern Cal will be silent. \n From Susan Quinn, author of \"The Deepest Spiritual Life: The Art of Combining Personal Spiritual Practice with Religious Community\" (White Cloud Press, 2002): \n Regarding last Thanksgiving: My dad would always make a toast, which we would share with him (holding up our glasses of wine). He would say something like, \"We want to thank you for all the blessings of this past year, and for bringing us together, and we hope for a prosperous and healthy new year.\" \n It was always a spontaneous, heartfelt toast, and he offered it whether only family was present or when we had guests. He never mentioned God, but in talking with my husband, we agreed that he was speaking to God. My family is not religious (my parents stopped observing any of the Jewish holidays once the kids left home), so the toast seemed to be appropriate and welcome to everyone. \n I hadn't even thought about \"the toast\" for next week until now. My Dad passed away in June after a long bout with cancer, so it will be our first holiday observance (as observances go) without him. \n I'm going to offer to give the toast (and I don't expect anyone will object), and the only differences will be that I will be explicit about thanking God, I'll ask if anyone wants to add anything to my comments, and I will probably conclude by quietly stating, \"We miss you, Dad.\" In a sense, I think his spirit will be with us, and I want to honor him. \n So my Zen and Jewish practices are not obviously included in these words of thanks \u2014 but they inform what I will do. By that, I mean that my Zen practice encourages me to take people just where they are, letting go of expectations, and being present to whatever unfolds; I don't expect anyone to observe the holidays the way I might. \n My Jewish practice tells me to help heal the world \u2014 which means to do whatever I can to help my family heal through what may be a difficult holiday \u2014 and to simply be a good person. \n Finally, I think the stresses and strains of the holidays have never come around the blessing for the meal, but around the tensions of family coming together. \n From Diana L. Eck, professor of comparative religion and Indian studies, Harvard University, and director, the Pluralism Project: \n Last year we spent Thanksgiving with my mother, nephew, and extended family at our little house in Ovando, Mont., a tiny town in the Blackfoot Valley, about 40 people and two dirt roads. \n Of course we began with prayer, as we do every dinner when we're together. In our family, it's a song-prayer that is our family version of the Star-Spangled Banner at a football game \u2014 a spirited singing of \"This is the day that the Lord hath made! Let us rejoice in it and be glad!\" \n The youngest, in this case my grand-niece Shanoah, age 3, learn this as a cherished part of their initiation into the zeitgeist of the family, so last year it was thrilling for Shanoah to take part. \n This year, Dorothy (Dorothy Austin, my partner) and I are going to Ovando again, and the meal will certainly begin the same way. Dorothy is especially good at gathering up the memory of all our beloveds who are not with us, in this case my father and brother, especially. And that is also part of the family table of prayer, especially at Thanksgiving. \n I might add that Ovando's Thanksgiving includes, beginning on Friday, the Old West Christmas Fest, complete with a chuck wagon serving cider and toddies in the square, a gala crafts fair in the school, the church, and the fire station, wagon rides, and the arrival of Cowboy Claus on horseback. \n Except for July 4, it is the biggest in-gathering of all the ranchers and residents in the valley. So Thanksgiving Day catapults us directly into the best of the holiday season. Very down-home. Quilts, home-made pot-scrubbers, hand-made pot-holders, knitted hats, etc. Nothing Macy's about it, just people happy to be home. \n I certainly have had \"interfaith\" Thanksgivings, with Jews, Christians, and Muslims at prayer round the table, here in Cambridge \u2014 with Christian, Jewish, and Muslim friends. . . . All comfortable with prayer and thanksgiving, especially in the presence of one another, since we have had many holidays together, including Christmases and Passovers. \n And then there have been wonderful Plymouth Thanksgivings with Peter Gomes at his table, and an afternoon with the Native protesters at the National Day of Mourning at Plymouth Rock. But Ovando is foremost on my mind today. \n From Miroslav Volf, Henry B. Wright professor of systematic theology, Yale Divinity School: \n Last year our family celebrated Thanksgiving at my sister's place. This year we'll do the same, and I hope that two features of our celebration will remain unchanged. \n First, the presence of strangers. Students from Croatia and Serbia, friends from this country and abroad, all joined the extended family of three generations in the festive meal. This is exactly as it should be. We express best our gratitude to God by giving to others, and a feast, where givers and recipients enjoy in common what is given, is a paradigm for the best of gifts. \n Second, my brother-in-law's prayer. He has a rare ability to make the ordinary sit comfortably within the sacred space of a ritual. After he has said \"Amen,\" all around the table \u2014 those of us who are deeply religious and others who think, \"The less religion, the better\" \u2014 have seen the ordinary shimmer a bit with transcendence, a sign that what surrounds us is neither just there nor somehow owed to us, but a gift from on high. "}, {"text": "King Midas' Beguiling Domain\n2002-05-26T05:00:00.000Z\nFOR centuries, Anatolia has been the place where Europe and Asia have encountered each other, where a rich melding and interlayering of civilizations has taken place, much to the delight of archaeologists and tourists. Today, even as Turkey seeks to join the European Union, the lead-covered domes of new mosques gleam all across the country.\nThree thousand years ago a group of people lived in central Anatolia who also looked both ways. The Phrygians, originally Europeans from Thrace, established a kingdom, apparently peaceably, within the political vacuum created by the downfall of the Hittites. Though they wrote their Indo-European language in an as-yet uncracked script somewhat like Greek, they worshiped the native Anatolian mother goddess, whom they called Kubileya. She, like the Babylonian Ishtar, preferred her companion animals to be clawed.\nMy interest in the Phrygians began over a decade ago when I attended an archaeology conference at Anadolu University in Eskishehir, a city two and a half hours west of Ankara. Every morning we piled onto a bus headed for the Phrygian Highlands, a region of green hills, purple wildflowers, huge stone outcroppings and state-regulated fields of opium poppies. The Phrygians brought artistry to this landscape, regarding its soft aggregate rock, called tufa, as prime material for sculpting tombs, caves and shrines. On one sheet of vertical rock they inscribed huge geometric designs. It's a rough place made plain, then ornamented to honor their fabled king Midas -- he of the ass's ears and golden touch. On another rock they carved giant lions, 30 feet high.\nThe lions lingered in my imagination, prompting a return visit. Last June my husband, Victor, and I flew into Istanbul, where we met up with family coming west from Bangladesh. After spending three days there, we planned to drive a rental car southeast toward the Phrygian capital at Gordion, the Highlands, then the old Roman city of Antalya on the Mediterranean.\nThe first Phrygian I met on this trip had marble flesh. He was Marsyas, a legendary musician whose Roman statue is in the Archaeological Museum in Istanbul, on the edge of the Topkapi Palace grounds. According to myth, he beat Apollo in a lyre-playing contest judged by Midas; the vindictive god flayed Marsyas alive and burdened Midas with odd ears.\nWe had come to the museum to see a reconstruction of the Midas tumulus at Gordion, but the floor was closed for renovation. Soon after, we set out for the real thing. Gordion is about an hour southwest of Ankara; we left Istanbul at 6 a.m. to beat the traffic, reaching our destination at midday.\nSituated at an intersection of ancient trade routes and excavated since the 1950's, Gordion has yielded more information about Phrygian culture than any other place. In 696 B.C., in the midst of their habitation here, the Phrygians suffered Armageddon. The Cimmerians -- mysterious horsemen from Transcaucasia -- swept in, burned their citadel, and swept onward to the Aegean. Legend says that King Midas, not wanting to witness the devastation, killed himself by drinking bull's blood. His people survived to build a lesser version of their citadel at Gordion and to migrate to the less strategically important Highlands.\nWhat was it like to be Phrygian? Artifacts in the museum at Gordion suggest that this culture's successes -- and its values, too? -- were not military, but economic and artistic. A geometric, pebble mosaic floor, dating from about 750 B.C.; numerous bronze omphalos bowls designed for finger-scooping; many decorative fibulae (proto safety pins) that other peoples in Asia Minor were eager to import; a wheel-thrown cup thin as a wineglass; a small bone flute: all imply flair and a pleasure in life. But what do we make of a clay statuette of their goddess holding a cup to her lips with her right hand and a beaked raptor in her left?\nThe landscape around Gordion is arid -- Nevada to the Highlands' Colorado. Centuries of sheep and goats have taken their toll on the Anatolian plain, which was probably greener in the Phrygians' time. The Midas tumulus -- the largest of more than 80 in the region -- is a giant, peaked earthwork 160 feet high. Too big for grave robbers to break into, it was the only one not plundered. Now anyone can enter, through a tunnel.\nThough the passage and the huge juniper logs enclosing its burial chamber are awe-inspiring -- this is thought to be the oldest wooden structure on the planet -- you must go to the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara to see the best of what filled the current emptiness. Don't expect anything auric. Midas' touch, in reality, only made objects shine like gold, as the result of an innovative metal-fusing technique that the Phrygians used in their bronze-making.\nWe ended a long day of driving in Afyon, a traditional city about two hours southwest of Gordion in the midst of a marble quarrying district. Hot and tired, we were delighted to find the new, four-star Otel Ozer, with spacious rooms and a swimming pool for an unbelievable $40 a night, at 1.45 million lira to the dollar. From its panoramic top-floor restaurant we could see that the massive outcroppings of tufa found in the Highlands, immediately north of Afyon, extended into parts of the city itself.\nEarly the next morning we headed north toward Eskishehir (pronounced Ah-skee-sheh-HERE), on the last leg of what I now called the Lion Pilgrimage. Fourteen kilometers beyond the town of Gazligol we noticed a signpost on the left that said ''Goynush Vadisi, Aslantash Aniti -- 2 KM.'' This was it, the monumental Lion Stone! We turned onto a road that was newly graveled, not the dirt track I remembered. But soon the landscape looked familiar, with the same marble troughs gathering the waters of artesian springs, so we got out and walked, passing two men and a dog resting in the shade of a large rock.\nAs we circled back, still searching in vain for felines, the men stirred themselves to greet us. Mustafa and Adem, it turned out, were watchmen-guides employed by the Turkish Ministry of Culture. They were happy to show us the 30-foot-high lions -- on a cliff right by where we had parked the car. I hadn't been wrong, though, about the grandeur of these beasts, which guard a tomb cut at the level of their haunches.\nNext we headed 59 kilometers south of Eskishehir, to a site marked by a sign saying Kumbet. The name of a village right off the road, Kumbet means tomb in Turkish. There are two here, which friendly villagers are glad to point out: one of a Seljuk holy man (probably from the 12th century) and one about 1,600 years older, large enough to have held a whole family of Phrygian nobility. The dead in the latter were also guarded by lions, who stand with upcurved tails on the pediment above the opening, their lineaments still distinct. This well-preserved tomb is a walk-in, with a view of a valley punctuated by poplars and a wall shared with the neighboring house.\nFollowing a narrow, recently paved country road 15 kilometers east from Kumbet, we came to the major site of the Highlands, Midas Shehir (Midas City), adjacent to the village of Yazilikaya. Now a large elongated hill, this panoramic site was once the acropolis of a flourishing community. Most archaeologists studying the Phrygians date it from the sixth century B.C., making it impossible for Midas himself to have lived here. His name, however, is part of an inscription carved above the imposing geometric relief facing the entrance.\nPhrygian looks teasingly like Greek, enough for scholars to understand the verb for ''dedicate,'' which appears at the inscription's end. A feminine presence at this monument would have been provided by the goddess Kubileya herself, whose portable effigy was placed in its ground-level niche, where the word ''matar'' (mother goddess) is scratched on the inner walls.\nFrom the plateau at Midas Shehir (MY-das Sheh-HERE) you look out on mountains, tilled fields, seemingly on centuries themselves. On the acropolis's double altar-throne, where once those who impersonated the goddess and her consort may have sat, you can gaze eastward and imagine yourself divine. Or, more humbly, you might descend stone steps leading to the community's cistern, feel the ghostly weight of a water jar, hear the rush of rain in the adjacent sluice. Chances are no other visitors will interrupt your reverie.\nThe only tour bus we saw carried Turkish junior high students, who hailed us as their teachers tried to prevent them from swarming the honeycombed rock next to the Midas monument. In the next few years buses may multiply. According to Veysel Gundogdu, resident guide and Yazilikaya town librarian, the Ministry of Culture is considering plans for Midas Shehir's development that could include a three-star hotel.\nWhat a shame, we thought -- until we tried to get to our day's last monument, called Aslankaya (Lion Rock), and found access to it totally unimproved by the government's tarring and graveling. As we neared the site, we almost scraped the oil pan off our rental car. But the initial journey was easy enough. We drove six and a half kilometers north of the town of Ihsaniye, where we bore right at a fork. One more kilometer and we were in the village of Uchler Kayasi (Triple Rocks). Here the best thing to do is park, ask a villager ''Aslankaya nerede?'' and walk the remaining two kilometers in the direction indicated.\nAslankaya is a lone, sculpted rock jutting above a plain. Of all the monuments in the Phrygian Highlands, it probably had the most to tell. And it will now never do so, for the heads of Kubileya and her greater-than-life-size lions set within its elongated niche were defaced in the dim past. The four bands of script carved beneath them are so eroded that future, more literate archaeologists won't be able to read them. I visited this shrine in 1990 and now was saddened to see that a high slice of rock has since been lost, apparently sheared off by the elements. What remains is a female Ozymandias, standing tall and firm on her feet, her message mystery rather than edict.\nA purple field of opium poppies, tended by farmers who trek out from Uchler Kayasi, lay directly across from Aslankaya. As we drove south from Afyon, and then on to Antalya the next day, car conversation centered around this village-based pattern of land use, which preserves the countryside's beauty. We were slowed by puttering tractors, donkey carts, a herd of cows, but the loveliness of towns tucked into lower folds of mountains and fields stretching cleanly to streams on the plains beneath them was abundant compensation.\nLike almost everyone else who has arrived in Antalya -- European tourists every July and August; the Seljuk Turks, Byzantines and Romans -- we loved its setting flanked by mountains on Anatolia's mid-Mediterranean coast. We enjoyed the diversions of this town -- a day trip on a yacht, with swimming in a secluded cove; a comic ballet beautifully performed by the Turkish national company in the restored Roman theater at Aspendos, half an hour east -- but we also pursued our Phrygian trail at the Antalya Muzesi, a large and rich institution whose collection covers several millennia. Here I saw another Marsyas and also someone very different: an ivory Phrygian madonna unearthed north of the city.\nWith the dense build of an Assyrian king and the subtle smile of a Greek kore, and two small children in tow, this figure seemed more ordinary woman than goddess. It is pleasing to think that the highlands and valleys where her creators lived still remain unspoiled, that they would recognize the view from Midas Shehir.\nEast meets West on ancient roads less traveled\nWhere to Stay\nIn AFYON , the Grand Ozer Termal Otel, Suleyman Goncher Caddesi 2, (90-272) 214-3300, fax (90-272) 214-3309, www.grandozer\n.com, is by far the most comfortable hotel, offering spacious doubles for $40 and spa services.\nIn ANTALYA , Ninova Pension, in the old Roman harbor section at Hamit Efendi Sokak 9, (90-242) 248-6114, or on the Web at www.ninovapension.com, combines comfort with aesthetics. High-ceilinged, Turkish-carpeted, air-conditioned doubles with breakfast are $45. Besides the fruit trees, the garden has a bar, a small pond, turtles and ancient pottery that was found during renovation. The English-speaking manager, Hripsime Malhas, is humorous and helpful.\nWhat to See\nThough the Phrygian sites are empty, Antalya tends to be crowded and uncomfortably hot during July and August. The best times to visit are May, June and September.\nThe Istanbul Archaeological Museum, (90-212) 520-7740, which can be entered through Gulhane Park, off Alendar Caddesi, is actually a complex of museums, including the recently renovated Museum of the Ancient Orient, with a tea garden. Admission is about $3.50, at 1.45 million lira to the dollar.\nGordion is an easy trip from Ankara, reachable by bus for $1.50 to Polatli and then by taxi for $15. Admission to the recently expanded museum, including entry to the Midas tumulus, is about $3.50.\nThe Phrygian Highlands sites are best reached by a rental car or a taxi out of Afyon or Eskishehir, arranged by the hotel and hired for the day. Rates start at $35.\nThe Aspendos International Opera and Ballet Festival, (90-312) 309-1409, www.byegm.gov.tr, staged in the Roman theater there, runs from June 8 to July 6, with performances by companies from the eastern Mediterranean and central Asia. A cushion makes the stone seats more comfortable. Tickets and daytime entry to the site, including extensive ruins on the hills, are both about $11.\nThe Antalya Museum, (90-242) 238-5688, with finds from the above-mentioned sites and others, including the prehistoric Karain cave, is right on the tram line. The admission fee is about $7.

Budget Beverly Hills, a franchise of the national company, has 20 of the new BMW Mini Coopers available at its Southern California outlets in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and West Hollywood. \n Economy-class travelers to Europe who rented a car about three decades ago may remember the original boxlike Mini, a British sub-subcompact ideal for crowded city streets. They can now drive around Los Angeles in the reincarnation, a car worthy of Austin Powers. \n The new Mini Cooper, a lot more sporty than the basic original, is the latest in a retro-styling movement by automakers around the world to produce cars that feature the looks and names of models popular in the 1950's and 60's \u2014 including the Ford Thunderbird and the Volkswagen New Beetle. \n The Mini Cooper is slightly under 12 feet from front bumper to rear, about 7 feet shorter than another Budget vehicle, the Ford Excursion S.U.V., making it easier to park (for the valet, of course). \n The styling is retro, the pricing is not: the Mini Cooper costs $125 a day with 50 miles included and 54 cents a mile thereafter; the T-Bird, $299.

Adam Murphy of Van Lear, Ky., was talking about coming under the zip, zip, zip of small-arms fire, and then, even worse, a Taliban mortar attack, the explosions getting closer and closer. He and his buddies knew they had to make a quick move. But where?\n''God was most definitely with us,'' said the private, 20, among the 600 weary American soldiers now back safely from the battleground in the Shah-i-Kot Mountains.\nHe chuckled at his own show of religion. ''That'll thrill my parents that I'm thanking God. I don't usually do that. But now, even when I'm eating chow, I'm giving thanks.''\nBut details about how this battle has been waged are scant. Conversations with some of the American soldiers returning from battle today suggest that the Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters appear vanquished, but they are willing to fight to the death. Most of the remaining battles are likely to fall on the shoulders of the Afghan fighters that are part of the American-led forces.\nStill, the operation, after a week and a half, is not over. A senior United States Special Forces officer, identifying himself only as Lt. Col. Mark, told reporters here at the Bagram Air Base that an opposing force of 100 or 200 is probably still hiding in Shah-i-Kot.\n''The more we back these guys into a corner, the more desperate they are going to be,'' said the officer, back from the field. ''We are at the high-risk part of the operation.''\nFor now, the fighting has been successful enough to allow about half of the American soldiers to take a breather. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said in Washington today that new troops would likely be rotated into the battle, but senior military officers said that the rotation was mostly for resupply and to give the troops a break from the altitude and cold.\n''Fighting continues to be very light,'' Maj. Bryan Hilferty said. ''In fact, in the past four days, we have not received sustained or accurate enemy fire.''\nFor the first time, the United States confirmed that coalition forces had captured some Qaeda fighters. ''We do have several Al Qaeda prisoners that have been captured and will be interrogated,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said.\nUnless something goes badly awry, Afghans are likely to take on more of the fighting. About 1,000 additional Afghan soldiers are moving into place, bringing the total commitment of troops to 2,000.\nThe enemy holdouts have been given a steady ultimatum to surrender or die, and they seem more inclined to the latter than the former. They have hidden themselves in caves.\n''I think they're wimps,'' said Private Murphy, seated on his bunk in Bagram's rapidly growing city of American Army tents. ''They come out of the caves for a split second, hit you as hard as they can and then run back in. What kind of fighting is that?''\nMany of the American troops, having survived enemy fire, speak in the relieved way of people just returned from a journey along death's coastline. The days pulsed with a fierce sun. The nights quivered with freezing temperatures.\n''All you hear is bullets going over your head and you're yelling, 'Where's it from? Where's it from?' '' said Pvt. Jason Alford, 21, of the Bronx. ''And then if you figure it out, you call in the B-52's,'' he continued, adding that ''it takes plenty of bombs, because those guys got their pride like we got pride, fighting for what they believe in, that Taliban stuff, whatever it is.''\nBack from surreal combat in Afghanistan, the soldiers spent today in a makeshift America, getting haircuts, taking showers and reading their mail, which was picked up in a decrepit building nicknamed Motel 6.\nDespite being in a camp ringed by majestic mountains, many soldiers could think of little good to say about Afghanistan. ''These people here must like fighting for fighting's sake because there sure isn't anything here worth fighting for,'' said Pvt. Drew Alan Ramm, 20, of Fort Worth. ''I have a message for Americans: Don't waste your money on a vacation here.''\nSpecialist Shannon Combs, 23, of Detroit, said he had an observation to make about Afghan politics. ''In America, we're used to, 'United we stand and divided we fall,' '' he said. ''But here it's disunited they stand and destined to fall.''\nBeing a Muslim, Pvt. Shaquib Khandakar, 19, of Queens, was often asked by the others to explain the Taliban. He hadn't a clue. He was born in Bangladesh. ''We cleaned out a village with three buildings and we found Korans that to me were desecrated, lying with rotten food, dead goat meat everywhere,'' he said. ''These people call themselves Muslims, but killing innocent people is not the Muslim way.''\nSgt. Joseph Noven, 21, of Valparaiso, Ind., also entered those buildings. ''There were not only the skinned goats and sheep hung up there but journals about microcommunications and chemistry. They wanted to make bombs. You know, I don't understand this whole jihad, holy war thing. What does it mean?''\nBeside him, cleaning his weapon, was his friend, Sgt. Robert Balderaz, 21, of San Antonio. ''They don't care if they die, that's what jihad is,'' he said. ''They'll kill 10 of themselves just to kill one of us. It's really messed up.''\nSgt. Paul Dominguez, 37, of Hillside, N.J., was happy to be exacting revenge for the World Trade Center attack. He was fond of the buildings themselves. They were visible from his bedroom window.\n''These people here are a bunch of lunatics willing to die for their God,'' he said. ''They won't give up, no matter how many bombs you drop. They're not right in the head. Obviously, they don't think the way normal people think.''\nBut wasn't he, too, willing to die for God?\n''Yes,'' he said. ''But these guys take it to the extreme.''\nVery few of the soldiers had actually met any Afghans, even their own allies. Their knowledge of recent history was scant. It was easy to think the worst of Afghanistan.\n''I think this is a country of followers,'' said Sgt. Justin Adamson, 22, of Oregon, Ohio. ''Osama bin Laden comes along with money, so they follow him. So who are they going to follow next? If they followed the Taliban, they'll follow anyone.''\nIn contrast, Colonel Mark, the Special Operations officer who briefed reporters about the recent fighting, had spent months alongside the Afghans, putting together plans to attack the Taliban and Al Qaeda. He was full of praise for soldiers he had worked with, especially Zia Lodin, a commander harshly criticized in the last week.\nGeneral Zia's forces were driven back during the difficult first day of fighting in the operation. Some in the American military have questioned his courage. To the contrary, Colonel Mark said, General Zia followed the plan, finding the significant part of Qaeda resistance.\n''He bravely and nobly went in there and defined it,'' the colonel said. ''He found where the leading edge of its defenses was, which was different from where we thought it would be. He got knocked down and then he got back up, and then he came back again into the same place where he had lost 10 percent of his people and then he did it a third time and he's not done.''"}, {"text": "From Pew to Barstool, New Yorkers Take a Poignant Look Back\n2002-09-12T05:00:00.000Z\n FIRE STATION \n Everybody Goes \n The men of Ladder Company 14 and Engine Company 35 in Harlem muster at 8:46 a.m. They pull their trucks onto Third Avenue, raise the American flag and step back inside the empty firehouse bay to say a prayer. \n The captain reads from a sheet of paper to his firefighters dressed in their formal Class A uniforms. \n \"This is a celebration of life, not death,\" he says, but that is as far as he gets. \n The alarm cuts him off. There is a mechanized honking and then the computer's droning voice says, \"Ladder! Engine! Battalion!\" \n One guy shakes his head, another looks down at the floor. \"Everybody goes!\" the captain shouts. He has the prayer sheet in one hand, the teletype printout in the other. \n So two trucks and the battalion chief's car rush over the Triborough Bridge to a homeless shelter on Randall's Island. The men stare at Manhattan as they shoot across the span. It is two towers short. \n \"That's our new skyline,\" Firefighter Dennis Prosick says. \n In the end, it is a false alarm. \n At the firehouse, a voice is reading aloud the names of the 343 dead on the public address system. The men climb out of their rigs and put their gear away. They stand around to listen, but they close the doors. \n GROUND ZERO \n Painful to Hear \n Long before Helen Simpkin Whalen steps onto ground zero, the wind swirling around her, she is determined to be there. She wants to make sure that her sister and the other passengers on the planes are remembered. \n Barely a year ago, in August, Ms. Whalen passed the test to become a volunteer firefighter in tiny Cottekill, N.Y. Then her older sister, Jane Louise Simpkin, died aboard United Flight 175 when it plunged into the south tower of the World Trade Center. \n Since then, Ms. Whalen has been amazed by the attention paid to firefighters and the lack of attention paid to people like her sister. \n She is the only member of her family to attend the ceremony. She comes with a friend, a volunteer firefighter from Olive, N.Y., and they are wearing their dress uniforms. Ms. Whalen says they spend their first few minutes at ground zero tending to a 6-year-old girl who has fainted, then a man whose blood pressure is acting up and a woman who has passed out. \"We were in the right place at the right time,\" she says. \n But all the while, Ms. Whalen is listening to the roll call of death. Two hours into the reading, it is time for the S's. And at 10:56, she hears her sister's name. A violinist plays \"Amazing Grace,\" one of her sister's favorites. Standing there, she considers the event a funeral for her sister, whose body has not been found. \n \"I was trying to prepare myself because I knew it would be very difficult to hear it,\" she says later. \"It was very difficult, truly distressing, to hear her name.\" \n All the while the wind puffed and blew through the proceedings, surreal in its strength. \"As if the earth was trying to blow all the dirt and ashes into the sky,\" she says. \n CONSTANCE L. HAYS \n CHURCH \n The Glow of Devotion \n Msgr. Donald Sakano keeps the lights low at the Church of the Holy Innocents on West 37th Street, an oasis amid the garment district's bustle. But the church is glowing \u2014 from hundreds of devotional candles. \n Holy Innocents is a working persons church. There are no parishioners. So sales representatives and factory workers drop in throughout the morning to say a prayer or touch a saint's statue. Monsignor Sakano says his church is a good place to remember 9/11. \n As the church bell tolls every 10 seconds, a burly man in a white T-shirt drops his canvas shoulder bag on a pew, kneels heavily and clasps his hands to his forehead. \n He is Paul J. McHale, 43, of Malverne, N.Y., who escaped from the north tower and at that moment lost his job as a currency trader. He is now going to trade school around the corner to learn how to fix refrigerators. \n On his way to class, he stops in to pray. \"I wanted to say thank you, to pray that nothing like this will happen again,\" he says, \"and to help with my studies.\" \n He hauls up his bag, weighted with textbooks, and checks the time. It is 9:45 a.m. \"I keep looking at my watch to see where I was a year ago,\" he says. \n DANIEL J. WAKIN \n NEWARK AIRPORT \n 'Celebrating Life' \n The early morning flight from Newark to San Francisco draws a mix of suited business travelers, silver-haired vacationers and those heading to the bedsides of ailing relatives. \n But there is nothing ordinary about United Airlines Flight 81, which replaces Flight 93, the jet that crashed into a Pennsylvania field last Sept. 11 during a struggle between passengers and a band of suicidal terrorists. Nor is there anything ordinary about the ghostly quiet of Terminal A, the courteous but intrusive security or the temporary memorial at Gate 17, the portal through which the passengers and crew passed that day. \"We Remember\" flashes across the destination signboard, and a vase of white roses sits atop the counter. \n As they wait to board at an adjacent gate, the passengers of Flight 81 are reflective but defiant; the faint-hearted have clearly been weeded out. \n \"I thought it was important to send a message that America will rise above and not be afraid,\" says Bob Schroeder, 42, a defense contractor from New Jersey who is on his way to China. \n Those boarding the Boeing 767, which is two-thirds empty, embark on a journey heavy with a sense of loss, remembrance and symbolic resolve. Soon after takeoff, the pilot requests that passengers consider the year's \"adversities,\" and a flight attendant, her voice cracking, asks passengers to write their thoughts on two American flags that are to be placed at ground zero. Above all, there is a remarkable tenderness between the crew and the 55 passengers. \n An hour before the plane descends, a pair of flight attendants move through the cabin with a homemade cake with red, white and blue frosting. \n Another cart carries champagne and the glass flutes usually reserved for first class. \"We're celebrating life,\" says one of the attendants, who, like other colleagues, wears a silver bracelet bearing the name of a lost co-worker. \n Then, dabbing a tear from her eye, she cuts a slice of cake and says, \"Enjoy yourself.\" \n ANDREW JACOBS \n AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS \n The Same Feelings \n Mohammed Hossain stops his taxi at a light on the Avenue of the Americas and reaches under his seat for his Bangladeshi newspaper. The front page shows a blurry picture of Lower Manhattan. \n \"See, it says seven Bangladesh people died in the towers last year,\" he explains. \"So people ask me how I feel about what is happening. And I say, `I live in America, and what you are feeling, I am feeling the same thing.' \" \n A year ago, Mr. Hossein was also feeling very scared. \n During the night of the day the World Trade Center was attacked, someone set his parked cab on fire in front of his Bronx apartment building. \n The worry has largely passed, as have those days when people would get out of his cab upon noticing his Muslim name on the license. \n Mr. Hossein, heading west through traffic, says he did hear that a Pakistani driver did not go to work today \n because his family feared he would be harassed or worse. \n \"It's ignorant people who would do this, who would say, `You are Muslim so you are terrorist,' \" he says. \n Mr. Hossain says he wants to see another big building \u2014 maybe more \u2014 on the site of the towers. \"I want people to know the World Trade Center is here again,\" he says, as he flips his \"on duty\" light on and turns north on Eighth Avenue. \"I would be proud.\" \n SUSAN SACHS \n CENTURY 21 \n Shopping as Therapy \n You need an excuse, it seems, to go shopping on a day like this. Especially at Century 21, the off-price department store that does not open until late morning because ground zero ceremonies are under way just across the street. \n So Steve Siedenburg, a stone mason, says he has to exchange some ill-fitting underwear before traveling to a job upstate. Traci Tucker, a cosmetologist, says she has not had time to buy shoes for her 4-year-old daughter. \"We look a little shallow,\" apologizes her sister, Raychelle Wilson. \n Stephanie Faegenburg, accompanied by her 2-year-old daughter, Chloe, says she is trying not to relive the anxieties of last Sept. 11, when her family was at home in TriBeCa while she was stranded in the Berkshires. \"I didn't want to stay home and watch TV,\" Ms. Faegenburg says. \"I just wanted to kind of escape a little bit. Shopping is therapy.\" \n Inside the store, about 300 employees are wearing pins signifying that they experienced the horrors of Sept. 11 firsthand. Heidi Resnick, an assistant buyer, says her husband had urged her to stay home. \"I felt I should be here,\" she says, \"to help me get stronger.\" \n TERRY PRISTIN \n HUMAN SERVICES \n Calls for Help \n Even for social service workers intent on helping jittery people, it is a jittery day. At 10 a.m., someone at their agency, F.E.G.S. Health and Human Services System, smells smoke in an elevator. \n The fire department comes, and 1,500 people spill onto Hudson and Van Dam Streets in SoHo. It is a false alarm. \n The calls for help are coming, referrals from Lifenet, the hotline advertised on subway billboards for people having trouble with their feelings about the attacks of Sept. 11 and the aftermath. \n A woman who works on John Street in the financial district calls. Her boss gave her the day off, and she has been up since 4 a.m. watching the television coverage. She feels overwhelmed. \n What should she do? Ellen Stoller, who runs the disaster relief program at the agency, takes down some information and suggests some therapy options. \n A man who lost his job after Sept. 11 sends an e-mail message. \"I'm at my wits end and I would actually consider suicide,\" he writes. A counselor is dispatched to call him immediately. \n \"Just talking to someone helps,\" Ms. Stoller says. \"The right thing to do is talk to someone. That is what we are here for.\" \n LYDIA POLGREEN \n CENTRAL PARK \n A Place for Solace \n Sean Boggs was downtown last year when the planes hit. He saw the explosion when the second tower was struck, and later panicked when it collapsed. He started running and didn't stop until he reached Central Park. \n Last year, Mr. Boggs, 27, of Astoria, Queens, sought refuge in the park. This year, he seeks solace there. \n He has taken the morning off from his job at a Chelsea publishing company and is perched on a rock by a secluded edge of the lake. His shirt, shoes and knapsack are at his side. Mallards have gathered in a cove to his right. An occasional boater braves a strong breeze and rows by. Near a weeping willow by the Bow Bridge, a fisherman casts his line for the large-mouth bass that he knows are not biting. \n \"Basically, I just wanted to spend the morning the opposite of how I spent it a year ago,\" Mr. Boggs says. \n He arrived at the park early \u2014 before the first moment of silence the nation observed \u2014 and has spent the morning sitting, walking, thinking and reading a book of graphic artists' responses to 9/11. In a while, he says, he will leave for work. But now he is enjoying a clear and quiet day. \n \"This,\" he says, \"is kind of how I hoped the morning would go.\" \n PETER KHOURY \n ROSE WAREHOUSE \n A Tribute in Flowers \n At 3 a.m., Richard Janmaat is standing in a Long Island warehouse gazing at the 27,000 roses that will soon be placed at ground zero as a tribute to the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. \n They are in buckets on the floor \u2014 pastel yellows, oranges, pinks, reds, whites. \n \"I walked in here and it brings a tear to my eye,\" said Mr. Janmaat, a floor manager for 1-800-FLOWERS, which donated the roses. \"I never thought those buildings would come down.\" \n It is Mr. Janmaat's job to transport the flowers, which came from farms in Ecuador and Nicaragua, through the misty suburban darkness on near-empty roads. \n Behind his Ryder truck full of roses, seven other company employees follow in a truck and a car. \n They arrive at the site, navigate a welter of other delivery trucks and then unload and unwrap the roses. One of them, glancing at the pit, crosses himself. As dawn breaks, they drive off. \n Just before 7 a.m., a group of volunteers arrange the roses on tables near the packages of facial tissues and stand waiting for the victims' families. \n ROBERT F. WORTH \n THE BAR \n Somehow, Having Fun \n After the Masses and the station-house memorials and a day spent looking over their shoulders, a few dozen firefighters gather at the Spring Lounge, a shot-and-a-beer joint in Little Italy, and start doing what was unthinkable a year ago. \n They are having fun. \n \"I think they're blowing off steam,\" Patricia Villari, a bartender, says between pulling drafts. The firemen shout over the stereo, some in dress coats, some in blue jeans. They lift pints and flirt, their number spilling onto the sidewalk busy with the Feast of San Gennaro vendors setting up Italian sausage carts. It is almost dusk on the day many had dreaded. \n \"Anytime we have any occasion to be together, we like to party together, says Capt. Richard Weldon, 53, from Ladder Company 20 around the corner. \"Let your hair down. Not that we have any hair to let down.\" \n \"Especially during sorrowful times, it's good to let loose,\" he says. \"Especially after a day like today. We were a little anxious about today, but it's over.\" \n It is hard not to drink to that. \n MICHAEL WILSON \n FEDERAL HALL \n A Fortunate Delay \n On the day of memory, they are standing in the place where democracy began in New York. \n Respectfully, by ones and twos, cameras in hand, they arrive to mark the city's most awful anniversary by visiting the Federal Hall National Memorial on Wall Street, the site where Congress convened for the first time in 1789. Here, a year ago, some 250 people fleeing the collapsing World Trade Center sought refuge. \n \"I'm here today because I need to relive Sept. 11 and put it to rest,\" says Mary Horowitz, who worked on the 38th floor of the south tower and watched it collapse after emerging from the No. 1 train. The rotunda echoes as she offers thanks that \"my subway was so delayed that day.\" \n John Delmauro and Sean Hurley even have a snapshot of last year's visit. Escaping from the dust cloud, they paused before the iconic bronze statue of George Washington, who took his oath of office there. \n \"Don't know why we stopped,\" Mr. Hurley says, recalling that he snapped a dusty Mr. Delmauro amid the debris. \"George W. was standing there and it was as if he was saying, `Don't worry, I'll get you through this.' \" \n GLENN COLLINS \n HOSPITAL \n A Life Begins \n Sometime between 6 a.m., when the contractions start, and 1:22 p.m., when Julia Kordas emerges from her mother's body, Edyta Duda turns to Karol Kordas, her curly-haired husband and high school sweetheart, and says, \"No more children.\" \n But now Julia has arrived, and she is swaddled in a striped blanket, her dark hair slick under a blue and pink cap, her tiny feet black with ink from footprints gently taken by a nurse at Beth Israel Medical Center. \"You forget about this pain,\" Ms. Duda, 28, says, cradling the child. \"This is the most beautiful moment in life.\" \n Mr. Kordas, 27, says he had a feeling the baby would be born today, 10 days before she was due. The date had stood out in his dreams. \"Something about reincarnation,\" he says. \n The new parents, Polish immigrants who have felt intensely American for the past year, do not shut out the other meaning of this day. Instead, they embrace it, leaving the television tuned to the ground zero ceremony and describing their new arrival as particularly precious within the context of loss. \n \"People die and people are born,\" Ms. Duda says, as her husband videotapes the scene, recording a new history. \"This is life.\" \n ELISSA GOOTMAN \n BROOKLYN BRIDGE \n A Return Visit \n People run across the Brooklyn Bridge this morning, but it is for health, as opposed to life. A few clouds sail west to east, but they're just clouds. You have to shield your face from debris as the wind kicks up, but it's just dust and leaves. \n Phil Lodico, 24, walks across the Brooklyn Bridge. It's been a year since he's crossed the East River by foot. Last year, he was among the throngs who walked, limped, ran, wept their way across. He had come from Midtown. \n \"Traveling solo,\" he recalls, one step and then another toward Park Slope. This morning, early, he rides to Manhattan, circles ground zero, then walks back across the Brooklyn Bridge, sort of in slow motion. \"To replay the day,\" he says. A sort of offering to the dead. \n Dharmindra Singh, 29, a mechanic, stares out a window onto Flatbush Avenue. What do you recall? He doesn't want to get into it. His brother was among those who ran across the bridge and into the garage. He couldn't breathe. \n Mr. Singh says his co-workers saved his brother's life: they carried him to the hospital. \"I don't want to remember all that,\" he says, after remembering. \n Sometimes, you work to remember. Sometimes, no matter what, you can't forget. The nose can't forget. A man sweeping an office courtyard has it still. \"The death smell,\" he calls it. \n SOMINI SENGUPTA \n AT HOME \n A Personal Memorial \n No television is on at Lisa Friedman's home in Woodbury, N.Y.; no radio, either. She cannot bear even to think of the collaborative grief filling ground zero, let alone to be there. \n She told her twin 12-year-olds, Daniel and Michael, that she would attend a commemorative ceremony at the middle school. She can't find them in the crowd, but no matter, she says, so long as they don't have to worry about her being in Manhattan should something else should go wrong. \n In the end, she says, that fear is what kept her away from the events at ground zero, where her husband, Andrew, died. \"I'm the only one they've got now,\" she says of her sons. \"And they've been sad long enough.\" \n At 8:46 a.m., the school grounds go silent. The wind picks up, fanning brown leaves and schoolgirls' hair. Ms. Friedman tries to force back tears but can't. \n The children return to class and Ms. Friedman drives to the Syosset-Woodbury Community Park, where a new basketball court shaded by old oaks was dedicated to her husband last month. A 6-foot-4 sports nut, he would have loved shooting hoops there. \n Ms. Friedman raised $30,000 to build the court and install a bronze plaque. This is her only memorial. All she's recovered from ground zero is her husband's bank card. \n \"I think I made a good choice,\" she says, speaking of this day and of all the days she spent with her husband. He would not have wanted his family burdened with grief. \n Later, friends will take her shopping, and then they will all go with the boys to Mr. Friedman's favorite Italian restaurant. \n But with a late summer sun making the courtside plaque glow, Ms. Friedman takes a minute to tell her friends a story. On the way to school this morning, she asked the boys if their father would have gone to the ceremony in the city if she had died last year instead of him. \n \"They told me, `No way,' \" she says. \" `Daddy would have gone golfing.' \" \n ANTHONY DePALMA \n SUBWAY \n A Borrowed Tear \n The subway, as it nearly always does, soldiers on, pausing for nothing. A man in an American flag tie heads to work. A man in a white sailor's hat digs through the trash. A woman sits on the train and reads \"Bonfire of the Vanities,\" which must seem like a book of ancient history. \n At the World Trade Center station, the staring eyes, made of mosaic, look out strangely, as they have since they were installed on the walls there. But someone has come along and added something: small plastic tears, stuck on with tape. \n A firefighter, in dress blues, pulls off a tear and puts it in his pocket as he walks out to the ceremony. \n Down the platform, Gerard Ouazon, from Lyon, France, stands near the exit that once lead to the towers and looks at his watch: \"This is when it happened.\" \n \"I am from France,\" he says, \"but I love New York and this country. So this day is hard for me, too.\" \n The next train stops at the station and the conductor, Anthony Irby, leans into the microphone. Reflexively he calls out, \"Chambers Street, World Trade Center. Last stop.\" \n \"I never think about it,\" he says. \"It's just what I say. But today \u2014 it sounds really strange.\" \n RANDY KENNEDY \n EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT \n Listening Closely \n It is just after noon as John T. Odermatt, the commissioner of the city's Office of Emergency Management, speeds in a truck bound for his new $8 million headquarters on Water Street in Brooklyn. \n His truck passes rows of mobile light towers, and then backs into a garage under a low-slung converted furniture warehouse tucked beneath the Brooklyn Bridge. \n Inside the center are skids of bottled water and news about a Northwest Airlines flight that had been diverted.

Two women, both workers at the laundry, keep quietly folding T-shirts, sheets and boxer shorts fresh out of the dryers and stacking them in neat piles on a blue counter. An elderly woman puts down her A.A.R.P. Bulletin to peer into the round hole of a washing machine and then yank out wet clothes. \n But a young man about to pour detergent onto his load of laundry looks at the screen and stands still, holding a cup of Purex in midair.

Five times a day, the muezzins' calls to prayer sound from the minarets of the 135-year-old Darul Uloom seminary that is famed throughout the Islamic world and teaches the form of Islam known as Deobandism.\nBut while the Deobandis of India, and India's 130 million Muslims in general, have embraced India's secular Constitution and religious diversity, the Deobandis of Afghanistan and Pakistan sought to impose their fundamentalist brand of Islam by force.\nPakistan, India and Bangladesh, the nations that were once Britain's Indian empire, have the world's second-, third- and fourth-largest Muslim populations. Almost one out of every three of the world's 1.2 billion Muslims lives in the subcontinent.\nSo, to American policy makers newly interested in South Asia, it is important to ask why South Asia's Deobandis have taken such sharply divergent paths. ''Everybody thinks of Islam as Arab, but you have to pay attention to Islam in South Asia,'' said Vali Nasr, a political scientist at the University of San Diego. ''If you don't, you confront something like the Taliban and everyone says, 'Where did these guys come from?' To understand that, you have to understand Deoband.''\nHere in Deoband, the concept of jihad as a holy war is simply not taught. ''In our madrassas you will not find even a stick to beat anyone,'' said Marghboor Rahman, the seminary's elderly, bearded vice chancellor.\nBy contrast, the Deobandi madrassas of Pakistan became training grounds for holy war and many of the Taliban leaders. Masood Azhar, Deobandi leader of the Pakistan-based Army of Muhammad, is believed to have been behind terrorist attacks on India, and the Taliban, as the Deobandi harborers of Osama bin Laden, posed a mortal threat to the United States.\nThe answers about the different brands of Deobandism on the subcontinent appear rooted in India's secular, democratic tradition and in the region's complex interplay of history, politics and demography.\nTo step onto the campus of Darul Uloom in Deoband is to step back in time. The 3,500 boys and young men, mostly from peasant backgrounds, attend free of charge. They leave their sandals outside the scalloped doorways of classrooms that are more than 100 years old.\nIn one, a teacher read by the hour from the Hadith, a collection of the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, while hundreds of students wrapped in shawls against the winter chill and wearing white caps sat on the floor, listening respectfully.\nMr. Rahman, 86, the school's leader, turns to history when he talks about why India's Deobandis are different from their cousins across the border. He explains that the seminary opposed the creation of Pakistan, a Muslim homeland. ''We are Indians first, then Muslims,'' he said, speaking in Urdu.\nThe divide between Deobandis had its origins in the 1947 partition of the British Indian empire into India and Pakistan, an event that set off cataclysmic violence between Hindus and Muslims and sundered the Muslims of the subcontinent, too.\nNo longer were devout young Muslims from all over the former empire free to attend the seminary at Deoband, and today, the Deobandis of Pakistan who were educated in Deoband itself have largely died out.\n''They have adopted the same educational syllabus, but beyond that, they developed in a different manner,'' Mr. Rahman said. ''We do not have any relationship with them.''\nThe seminary in Deoband was founded in 1866 to preserve Muslim identity and heritage in the face of British imperialism, which had replaced the rule of the Mughals, India's Muslim conquerors.\nThe seminary's teachers imparted to their students a socially conservative vision of Islam purified of folk and Hindu customs and concerned with teaching individuals how to practice their faith properly.\nIn politics, the Deobandis joined the independence movement led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, a Hindu, and opposed the separate Muslim homeland of Pakistan that was ultimately founded by Mohammed Ali Jinnah, a secular-leaning barrister who smoked cigarettes, wore hand-tailored suits and spats and married a Parsi, a non-Muslim.\n''Jinnah never used to offer prayers, so how could he have created an Islamic state?'' Mr. Rahman asked.\nSecular democracy has proved to be a bulwark against fundamentalism in India, and it was built on a demographic foundation that made Islamic nationalism impractical here.\nWhile Pakistan is 97 percent Muslim -- and religion has been routinely exploited there for political gain -- India, a much more populous nation with almost as many Muslims numerically, is only 12 percent Muslim.\n''The Muslims of India are scattered all over the place,'' said Syed Shahabuddin, editor of Muslim India, a monthly magazine. ''Out of 545 parliamentary districts, just 11 have a Muslim majority. How can you make a Muslim political party?''\nStill, in more districts Muslims form a crucial swing vote in a social system where the Hindu majority is often fractured politically by caste. As a result, they have a measure of influence at the ballot box, if not the ability to win outright control.\nDeoband is in the state of Uttar Pradesh, where the state election season is under way. The political parties of the low castes and the peasant castes are competing ferociously for Muslim votes.\nThe severest provocation of Muslims happened here in Uttar Pradesh in 1992, when Hindu fanatics tore down a 16th-century mosque at Ayodhya. Ever since, Muslims have often cast their votes tactically for the party best positioned to defeat the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, whose leaders led the movement to build a Hindu temple on the site of the mosque.\nLess than a mile from Deoband is the majority-Muslim village of Labakri. The villagers consider themselves Deobandis, but the purity of Islamic practice expounded by the scholars at the nearby seminary does not extend even this far from the gates of Darul Uloom.\nThe people continue to follow a caste system that is theoretically forbidden. Like most Muslims in India, their forebears were low- to middle- caste Hindus who converted to Islam over centuries. Hindu cultural practices of caste and dowry have persisted.\nIn this village, people had barely heard of Mr. bin Laden and voiced little interest in distant Afghanistan, far from their everyday concerns of the sugar cane harvest, low wages, petty corruption and poor government services.\nLiaquat Ali, a 48-year-old farmer, declared that he supported the Samajwadi Party, led by a Hindu from the cowherd caste, because it is more secular and more influential.\nBut as Mr. Ali ranted on about the evils of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, a young farm hand, Mohammad Mustaqeem, cut him off. ''He was the B.J.P. regional chief in the area!'' Mr. Mustaqeem exclaimed. ''He voted B.J.P. last time! He supported them because he realized they would be in power and that it would be good to be friendly with them.''\nA bit defensive, Mr. Ali conceded the point but insisted, ''I supported the B.J.P. because they talked about justice, but in the past five years, they did everything but deliver it.''\nThe Deobandi villagers of Labakri, like the Muslims of India, have overwhelmingly chosen to express themselves at the ballot box, not through organized violence.\nBut in Pakistan, Deobandis, who are Sunni Muslims, have been instrumental in armed Islamic militancies in Afghanistan and Kashmir and in efforts to turn Pakistan into a theocratic state.\nA series of powerful players -- Pakistani military dictators and democrats, rich Saudis and the American government -- tried to harness Islam to their own political and geopolitical purposes. They fed zealotry on a rich diet of money, patronage and arms, creating a fundamentalist force in Afghanistan and Pakistan that no one could control, say scholars and political analysts.\nThe Pakistani military sought to strengthen its rule through an alliance with clerics and from the 1980's funded thousands of madrassas.\nThe Saudis, many of whom followed their own austere and conservative brand of Islam known as Wahhabism, sought to build a Sunni wall around Shiite-dominated Iran and contributed heavily to Pakistan's Deobandi madrassas, as well, Professor Nasr said.\nThe Americans poured money into Pakistan to fund Islamic militants who fought the Russians in Afghanistan. The elected government of Benazir Bhutto nurtured the Taliban in the hopes of setting up a malleable government in Afghanistan.\nSince the mid- to late 1990's, both Pakistani military rulers and prime ministers have allowed secret funding of Islamic radicals who have fought Indian rule of Kashmir, India's only majority-Muslim state. (Notably, with the exception of Kashmiris, India's Muslims have not joined the war against their own country and often insist, like Hindus, that Kashmir belongs to India.)\nEven here on the campus of Darul Uloom in Deoband, students admire the exploits of the Taliban, the Deobandis they have never known, but who stood up to the Americans.\n''Our schools have nothing to do with them, but still, what Americans did to the Taliban was unfair,'' said Khalil-ur Rehman, 20. ''They wanted to finish the Taliban because they brought Islamic rule.''\nBut asked whether he would rather live in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, or in secular India, Mr. Rehman did not hesitate. ''India is our motherland,'' he said. ''And we love it.''"}, {"text": "Watch What You Wish For, Including a White Christmas\n2002-12-26T05:00:00.000Z\nA northeaster battered the East Coast yesterday with sleet, freezing rain and snow that closed airports and major highways and gave New York City its whitest Christmas since 1909.\nIt was not what Irving Berlin had in mind. It was wet, slippery and dangerous. Whipping winds and icy slime shut down the city's two airports, made traveling by car perilous and kept people who were planning to venture out for a holiday meal holed up at home.\nAs of midnight, 5 inches of snow had fallen on Central Park, the only significant snow on Christmas inside the city since 1969, when 2.1 inches fell. That made it the first official white Christmas -- defined by meteorologists as a Dec. 25 with one inch on the ground -- in 33 years. The only other New York City white Christmas of the 20th century came in 1909, when seven inches fell, according to Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University.\nThere have been dustings and traces, to use the technical terms, in the city on several Christmases past, and some New Yorkers may be positive that they have, in fact, frolicked through many a white Christmas in the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's.\nThe unusual holiday snowfall came as the storm pounded much of the Northeast, turning from icy rain and sleet into snow in the late afternoon, as temperatures fell below freezing.\nBy the time the snow started tapering off late last night, records for Christmas Day had been set in Buffalo and other parts of upstate New York that reported more than two feet of snow. Officials were forced to close a 100-mile stretch of the New York State Thruway from Syracuse to Amsterdam, near Albany. Around the city, the snowfall was heaviest in the suburbs, with 9.2 inches reported in Valley Stream on Long Island as of 9:30 p.m. and similar amounts north of the city. Today's forecast called for windy and sunny weather, with highs in the mid-30's. .\nOnce the snow began yesterday afternoon, it fell at a furious pace -- at least two inches an hour -- and it was met with a mixture of delight and misery.\nFor anyone trying to travel -- or work -- on the holiday, there was the unpleasantness of having snow spraying into their faces, or their shoes sliding across the sidewalk, their cars trundling slowly across slippery, unplowed roads or their flights delayed or canceled.\n''Life is very miserable,'' said Mutfar Rasman, 54, a Bangladeshi immigrant who was pumping gas at a Sunoco station in the Van Cortlandt section of the Bronx late yesterday, as the snow, which had soaked his gloves so much that he finally removed them, began to fall faster and faster. ''It might be good for Americans, but for me, it's very difficult.''\nThere was a clear difference of opinion across the region yesterday as to whether snow on Christmas -- the kind of snow that fell yesterday, anyway -- was something to cherish or something to curse.\nFor Juan Carlos Alvarez, 34, who moved to Manhattan from Miami six months ago, the notion of a white Christmas made him giddy.\n''Yeah, snow -- it's perfect,'' he shouted into his cellphone yesterday, as he stood in Rockefeller Center and chatted with a friend in Utah while the snow began to fall. ''I couldn't have planned it any better. This is Christmas in New York, right? That's what it's all about.''\nEarlier yesterday, the city Sanitation Department deployed 500 workers and 359 salt spreaders, officials said. But they did not start plowing the roads until about 4 p.m., after waiting for at least an inch to an inch and a half to accumulate.\nVito Turso, a spokesman for the department, said the city reacted ''right according to plan,'' with 1,000 pieces of equipment out on the streets by about 9 p.m., including salt spreaders and dump trucks, and a total of 1,600 workers deployed overnight to clear the streets.\nAfter being closed for about four hours, runways at La Guardia Airport reopened at 10 p.m., and runways at Kennedy reopened at 11:30 p.m.Alan Hicks, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that flights were expected to depart through the night, to make up for lost time. He said that Christmas was not a heavy travel day.\nNewark Liberty International Airport remained open, although flights were delayed for up to two hours.\nMany of those who had planned to fly wished they had not.\nAt the Spirit Airlines check-in counter at La Guardia yesterday evening, an argument between irate passengers and airline employees, some wearing cheerful red Santa caps, became so heated that someone summoned police at the airport.\nOne of the angry passengers was Chelsea Rudder, 19, a student at Pace University who had planned to fly to Detroit for a family gathering.\n''My Christmas is ruined,'' said Ms. Rudder, dressed in a festive red fur-trimmed coat.\nAmong waiting passengers, a 4-year-old girl slept on the floor, using her mother's black coat as a blanket. Adults slept on rocking chairs set in front of windows, which looked out on snowplows and tractors.\nAn information clerk asked earnestly whether information was needed, and a man lugging two duffel bags snapped, ''I need something, and it ain't information.''\nAt Kennedy, American Airlines Flight 2 from Los Angeles landed safely about 5:30 p.m., but the plane was stuck on the runway until about 11 p.m., said Andrew Schneider, 31, a passenger.\nPassengers kept their tempers under control.\n''I think the whole Christmas spirit kind of calmed people down,'' Mr. Schneider reported by cellphone, as his 3-month-old son, Sam, fussed in the background. ''No one was happy to be sitting on the plane for five hours, but no one was getting irate.''\nAbout 9,000 people on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens lost electrical power yesterday afternoon. It was restored by 10:30 p.m. Officials said it was unclear whether the problem was related to the storm. In Westchester, 1,200 Con Edison customers lost power in the morning in what officials said was a weather-related incident, and an additional 300 homes in the Sea Gate neighborhood of Brooklyn lost power because of ice on the wires.\nOn the Upper West Side, a few hours after the snow began to stick, the streets were quiet. Parents wearing pained-looking expressions held hands with children wearing puffy coats, trying to hurry them home. Winds whipped snowflakes into people's eyes, and men with wool hats shoveled snow at bodegas.\nSnow collected gracefully on the branches of trees along Riverside Drive, but the winds were so fierce -- reaching 40 miles per hour -- that there were few people around to appreciate the wonderland effect.\nBlanca E. Salazar, 31, a Mexican immigrant visiting from North Carolina, stood on 101st Street and videotaped the scene as cars, most of them taxis, streamed down a Broadway sprinkled with snow. She had no hat, and snowflakes collected on Ms. Salazar's shiny black hair. But that was a small price to pay, she said, for the joy her relatives in Mexico would get from watching a home movie of a snowy New York.\n''I love snow, I love it,'' said Ms. Salazar, slipping her video camera into her jacket. ''I think it's a great day, a beautiful day.''\nIn the suburbs, where the storm dropped as much as half a foot or more, people able to stay inside said they felt cozy, but many plans were changed. Danielle and Robert Goodman held a holiday party in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., but three out of the four families they invited could not make it last night because of the bad driving conditions. But for those who were there, said Ms. Goodman, ''the spirits are high. It's beautiful, like a fairyland outside.''\nThe snowstorm, which moved out of the central Plains, was blamed for at least 18 deaths since Monday. The intense weather system moved east Tuesday night, from the Midwest into Pennsylvania and then into New York and New England.\nMost of the storm-related deaths were caused by traffic accidents. Since Monday, six people were killed in Missouri, four in Oklahoma, three in Kansas and one in New Mexico.\nNumerous accidents were reported yesterday in the New York region, but the police said none were serious. And for city drivers, at least there was a parking reprieve: alternate-side regulations will be suspended today."}, {"text": "Star Turn\n2002-10-06T05:00:00.000Z\nThe AUTOGRAPH MAN\nBy Zadie Smith.\n347 pp. New York:\nRandom House. $24.95.\nReading Zadie Smith's gloriously undisciplined first novel, ''White Teeth,'' was like going to a rip-roaring party where you met so many great people it didn't matter that at 4 a.m. the beer suddenly ran out -- and some drunk knocked over the stereo. Before crashing to earth with its abrupt, tie-everything-together-in-knots ending, Smith's comic novel, published in 2000, soared higher than any other fiction debut had in years.\nThe narrative strategy of ''White Teeth'' was one of compulsive character generation. A hilarious overture about the bungled suicide attempt of Archie Jones (a charmingly defeatist doofus who suggested a British Homer Simpson) flowed into a satirical sketch of Archie's Jamaican bride, Clara Bowden, a Jehovah's Witness desperate to flee the family cult; this riff then prompted a wicked digression about Clara's cockney ex-boyfriend, Ryan Topps, a self-styled rebel whose scooter, alas, ''didn't do more than 22 m.p.h. downhill.'' And that was just the opening pages.\nSo what if she lacked a plot? Smith simply kept on going, crowding her stage with resentful Bangladeshi waiters, smug Jewish geneticists, adulterous music teachers, self-doubting Muslim separatists. All of these inventions were amusing; some were among the wittiest caricatures since Dickens. Moreover, because the novel's true subject was the improvised patchwork of North London, its sprawling structure became an accidental virtue. ''White Teeth'' wandered all over -- but in so doing, it brilliantly captured a sense of place.\nThe novel made Smith deservedly famous. Even she knew, though, that ''White Teeth'' lacked the shape of a masterpiece. She publicly disowned her firstborn, calling it the ''literary equivalent of a hyperactive, ginger-haired tap-dancing 10-year-old.'' Now the 26-year-old author has delivered a slimmer follow-up, ''The Autograph Man,'' that offers a corrective to the excesses of her debut. It may be, however, that Zadie Smith wasn't meant to behave. ''The Autograph Man'' is more entertaining than lots of novels, but it doesn't come close to the divine mess of ''White Teeth.''\nIn an apparent effort to button down, Smith has settled on a clear protagonist: Alex-Li Tandem, a half-Jewish, half-Chinese (and half-depressed) autograph trader from North London. Smith even gives Alex a plot, an amiable quest narrative. Her 27-year-old hero travels to New York to look for Kitty Alexander -- a reclusive 1950's starlet who has finally mailed Alex her signature, after years of failed entreaties. Alex reveres Kitty's old films; her frozen beauty is a ''sacred thing,'' arousing deeper feelings than sex with his girlfriend, Esther.\nHis unusual ethnicity aside, Alex is a safe choice for a character. He is the prevailing stereotype of his generation, the pop-culture-addled trivialist. When not selling autographs on the Internet, Alex rents videos. (''You watch too many films is one of the great modern sentences,'' Smith cleverly writes. ''It has in it a hint of understanding regarding what we were before and what we have become.'') The only unusual thing about Alex's immersion in cinematic imagery is that it's a deliberate emotional strategy -- a way of suppressing grief for his dead father.\nTracking down Kitty breaks Alex out of his Hollywood prison. Kitty, it turns out, is no Norma Desmond, clinging to faded glories; she's a sensible woman comfortable in her dying skin. Meeting her jolts Alex awake from his fantasies, inspiring a belated sense of engagement with the people around him.\nIt's satisfying to witness Alex overcome his intimacy issues. Yet Smith can't hide the fact that she's spinning a rather pat tale about a self-absorbed man who, soon after his sperm count starts dwindling, realizes he wants to be ''in the world.'' This is the same laddish parable Nick Hornby spent most of the last decade polishing.\nComing from Smith, this theme feels disappointingly myopic. After all, ''White Teeth'' was the first book in ages by a 20-something novelist who didn't write exclusively about mopey 20-somethings. It wasn't solely the length of ''White Teeth'' that evoked ''Middlemarch''; it was Smith's understanding that young people are only part of the story. ''White Teeth'' abounded in jaded, confused youths, but Smith wisely forced them to interact with older people who saw the world differently.\nPerhaps that's why ''The Autograph Man'' feels so lightweight during its first half, in which Alex defends his celebrity obsession to his equally callow London friends. Most of these conversations simply float away, like the marijuana smoke often accompanying them. Smith tries to fill the emptiness of this chatter with jokes; explaining the laws of spliff-fueled dialogue, she drolly plays Moses: ''The one who is more stoned shall have the right -- for the period during which he is more stoned -- to tell the other man exactly what his problem is.''\nIf only these exchanges were so direct. In one typical chapter, Alex spars with Adam, a friend fascinated by cabala, the Jewish mystical tradition. Between tokes, Adam intones murky slogans: ''The godhead is incomplete. He needs us.'' Alex is unimpressed: ''That's a big job, my friend.'' Adam rightly criticizes Alex as shallow, but he's not exactly on a higher plane; whereas Alex seeks transcendence in a celebrity's inky scrawl, Adam hunts for ''shards'' of God in ''six chosen letters'' culled from the Torah. Both are fixated on symbols. This comparison is interesting, but Smith fails to develop the idea. Adam remains a static quote machine, and Alex never truly listens to him.\nThe book springs to life, however, when Alex arrives in New York. Smith clearly relishes focusing her eye on a fresh city. An analysis of the symbiotic relationship between Poles and Brooklyn hipsters is hilarious. And she expertly deadpans that a gentrified Manhattan hotel looks ''dazed at its own sudden respectability, like a dissolute grandfather forced into a suit and dragged to a wedding.''\nThe novel's best moment describes Alex and Kitty sharing a quiet Brooklyn evening soon after meeting. An intimate exchange between young and old, it's like watching Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz curl up and chat over coffee. Together they watch a video of Kitty's 1952 film, ''The Girl From Peking''; Alex sees magic, but his idol sees a silly movie. ''I look as Chinese as my shoe,'' she concludes. Refreshingly, Alex pays attention to Kitty's observations, and Smith subtly charts his transformation from fan to friend.\nSuch connections are rare in this novel. Whereas ''White Teeth'' expressed an almost na\u00efve confidence that people from different backgrounds could communicate, ''The Autograph Man'' is too often cynical. Although Smith clearly loves pop culture herself -- she spiritedly alludes\nto ''Poltergeist,'' ''Star Wars,'' Hugh Grant's sex scandal -- she mocks her characters for being brainwashed by it. ''Men who don't want to go home go to a bar,'' Smith writes. ''Alex knew this because he'd seen it in the films.'' Alex's friends parrot ''awful movie phrasings.'' (A character relaxing in a limousine exults, ''Ah, this is the life.'') And they rehash shopworn ''International Gestures,'' from the ''Jewish shrug'' to the ''meaningful look.'' It's troubling to see a writer whose first novel taxonomized a dazzling array of humankind portray her characters as homogenized drones.\nSome readers may attribute this shift to Smith's unexpected fame -- as if she were the literary equivalent of Madonna, whining about the oppressiveness of stardom. That's unfair. As the devout Muslims (and devout scientists) of ''White Teeth'' proved, Smith is genuinely attracted to true believers. The problem is that celebrity worship is harder to take seriously. Although Smith strains to do so -- Alex, she writes, finds Kitty's projected image as wondrous as ''the stained-glass window in a church'' -- she understandably can't hide her contempt. Next time, she'd be better off dwelling on characters whose preoccupations elicit more respect.\nIf ''The Autograph Man'' ultimately sinks, it is nearly saved by Smith's buoyant prose. In ''White Teeth,'' a character describes Archie's daughter Irie as someone who ''swallowed an encyclopedia and a gutter at the same time.'' That's an apt description of Smith's own voice, one still audible in ''The Autograph Man.'' Nowadays, she laments, someone in mourning is likely to be tagged with ''Excessive Grief Syndrome.'' With slangy brutality, she renames death ''the infinity slap.'' But Smith can do more than make wisecracks. In one sentence, she sums up the sadness Alex and his mother still feel over his father's passing: ''Every time they met, they felt it afresh, as if they had planned a picnic, Alex arriving with all the cutlery, Sarah with the mackintosh squares -- where was the food?'' This is a writer who can still tap-dance; she just needs to find her rhythm again."}, {"text": "Bonfire Of the Vanities\n2002-12-21T05:00:00.000Z\nThere's only one thing left for Trent Lott to do now. He will have to become a Democrat.\nIn his doomed but endlessly inventive effort to grovel his way back to political favor by taking positions way to the left of his own party, the senator came out for ''across the board'' affirmative action and pledged to proclaim the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation some kind of quasi-Kwanzaa holiday. If the Lott panderthon had lasted into the weekend, he might yet have endorsed Al Sharpton's theory of the Tawana Brawley case or popped up on Comedy Central to host a holiday festival of ''Sanford and Son'' reruns. Tom Wolfe couldn't make this stuff up.\nBut of course he already did. The hypocrisy and cynicism we saw in the Lott affair from nearly all parties -- political and otherwise -- was ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' all over again. The supposed cause of our new racial uproar, the senator's remarks at Strom Thurmond's centennial birthday party, rapidly became irrelevant to the big picture (as did the clueless majority leader himself). Is Mr. Lott a racist? According to Jim Jeffords, former Senator Paul Simon and nearly everyone else who knows him, he's not. But after awhile that no longer mattered. Mr. Lott had become, in the words of a widely quoted (but unidentified) White House hand, a ''walking pi\u00f1ata.'' And a most convenient one. Republicans, Democrats and the press alike could all prove our moral superiority, cost-free, by stringing up a certifiable fool.\nBut we shouldn't congratulate ourselves quite so fast. The Lott story didn't break this month -- it broke four years ago. Where was the press then? Where were the Democrats? From December 1998 until the following spring, a black columnist at New York's Daily News, the politically nonpartisan Stanley Crouch, repeatedly laid out goods on Mr. Lott more damaging than the senator's latest transgression: his long and intimate association with the white-supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens, an organization whose initials are not a phonic echo of K.K.K. for nothing. A few newspaper reporters and columnists recounted the same history, but Mr. Crouch, instead of winning a Pulitzer, was largely ignored by big guns in the media as well as by political leaders of both parties.\nMr. Lott's new offense almost fell through the journalistic cracks as well. Though his embrace of Mr. Thurmond's past took place in a room full of Washington reporters and politicos and was broadcast on C-Span, it was not at first reported in any paper (or on any evening TV news broadcast), even those that did cover the Thurmond party. Why? It may be because the spectacle of a leading Republican backslapping with unreconstructed Dixiecrats did not initially strike anyone as big news.\nWhen Jeb Bush succinctly condemned Mr. Lott for the crime of being ''damaging to the Republican Party'' -- as opposed to, say, being damaging to black people -- he was telling the truth. Mr. Lott would not have hurt his party were he an anomaly within it. What made him toxic to the Republican fraternity was his careless revelation of its darkest predilections.\nAmong the Lott transgressions that resurfaced during his trial-by-media was an occasion in the 1990's, cited by Robert George in The New York Post, when he summoned black staffers abruptly into his personal office ''to provide 'color' for photos in a media profile.'' Such a media strategy is no different from that of the 2000 Republican convention, where the party filled the stage with a ''Soul Train'' jamboree of break dancers and gospel singers to provide ''color'' for its own image. The goal of that minstrel show -- as well as of the strategic planting of black faces in likely TV shots on the floor -- was to belie the fact that black delegates at that convention made up 4 percent, a historic low for the party (even lower than at the Pat Buchanan-Pat Robertson convention in Houston in 1996).\nMr. Lott's public display of nostalgia for the South's racist past is hardly unique either. The attorney general, John Ashcroft, gave an interview to a neo-Confederate magazine, Southern Partisan, in 1999 in which he vowed ''to do more'' to defend the legacy of Jefferson Davis, a Lott hero as well, from anyone who would smear him for having ''some perverted agenda.'' (Slavery, perhaps?) Some of Mr. Ashcroft's actions in public life have matched his words. When he was Missouri attorney general in the 1980's, a federal judge threatened to hold him and his state in contempt for their ''continual delay and failure to comply'' with a landmark voluntary desegregation plan in St. Louis, according to a Washington Post report in January 2001. When running for governor, Mr. Ashcroft even boasted of having done ''everything in my power legally'' to fight that plan. This was 35 years after Mr. Thurmond's Dixiecrat candidacy.\nIn its effort to portray Mr. Lott as a one-of-a-kind bad apple, The Wall Street Journal's editorial page said on Thursday: ''Republicans may once have used race to polarize the electorate, especially in the South. But that strategy long ago stopped being useful.'' Tell that to George W. Bush, who beat John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary after what Newsweek called ''a smear campaign'' of leaflets, e-mails and telephone calls calling attention to the McCains' ''black child'' (an adopted daughter from Bangladesh). Or to Sonny Perdue, the new Republican governor of Georgia, elected in part by demagoguing the sanctity of the Confederate flag.\nLong ago stopped being useful? Tell that to Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Bush, who appeared at Bob Jones University in 1999 and 2000. ''Of all universities in America,'' asked the commentator Fareed Zakaria on ABC last weekend, ''why is it that Republicans have felt the need to make a pilgrimage to the one university that bans interracial dating?'' Now that Mr. Lott is no longer the issue, will any of the conservatives who called for his decapitation answer that question?\nThe point here is not that these Republican leaders are racists, or that all (or most) Republicans are racist, or that all racists are Republicans. ''These are not normal Republican ideas,'' wrote the conservative author David Brooks, in a characteristically thoughtful piece about Mr. Lott in this week's Newsweek. And he's right. But there are still too many Republican politicians who believe they can pander to whatever racist voters are out there without being called on it. When they are, they cringe -- not so much because they care about losing their few black votes but because they care about losing soccer moms who are offended by race-baiting. ''Elections are settled in the suburbs nowadays, 43 percent of the vote,'' said George Will in condemning Mr. Lott. It's that political reality, not any moral imperative, that mandated the majority leader's death sentence.\nPresident Bush is no bigot, and as he likes to remind us, some of his best employees are Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. He is in favor of something called ''affirmative access'' -- which has led to a grand total of zero black Republican Congressmen in the next Congress. ''Compassionate conservatism'' seems less a program than a p.r. strategy to provide cover for the likes of a Lott or an Ashcroft.\nAsked this week what the administration has done for black Americans, Ari Fleischer used the kind of examples we heard from Mr. Lott. He said that ''the president looks forward to going to Africa'' (how patronizing can you be?) and wants ''to double funding for historically black colleges and universities'' (weren't the Republicans for color-blind policies rather than a politically correct form of de facto segregation?). Mr. Fleischer also said that the president sees education as ''the next civil rights movement.'' If so, Mr. Bush is not that movement's courageous leader; in his education bill, he dumped the tiny school voucher provision that Republican polls say many black families want.\nBlack voters are not fooled by such empty theatrics. For all the ''diversity'' at his convention and his rhetorical ''compassion,'' Mr. Bush drew a third less of the black vote than his father and Bob Dole did. The White House's main concern now is that white voters be fooled. So Republicans are trying to create a moral equivalence between Democratic racial lapses and their own, hoping that Robert Byrd's long-renounced K.K.K. past and use of the word ''nigger'' will somehow blur their own recent record. Bill Frist is the ideal new Senate majority leader, because his own genuinely good works in Africa and ''compassionate conservative'' geniality will camouflage a voting pattern that, on any issue touching black Americans, is virtually the same as Mr. Lott's.\nI almost feel sorry for Trent Lott. Despite all the hyperbole that preceded his demise, he is no Bull Connor or David Duke or even Jesse Helms. He's just the guy who had to die before anyone looked too closely at other, even more powerful politicians' sins."}, {"text": "ONE YEAR LATER; Still New York, in All Its Pain and Glory\n2002-09-11T05:00:00.000Z\nNOTHING has been forgotten. That could never be. But things go on, start anew, revert to some mean. Even on the E train downtown, where the stations still advise, ''To World Trade Center all times,'' and the conductors intone, ''E train to World Trade.'' One year after it faced its own mortality, New York, in its daily curiosities and unexpungeable flavor, is still New York. For some time, no one knew if that could happen.\nNew York has not disconnected from itself and devolved into a trembling mass of paralysis. It has not been unmade but remade. Its sense of control and invulnerability is gone, but New York has become a city of regeneration. From its white-gloved neighborhoods to its downbeaten corners, it is a city pulsing with added exertion to be normal -- its own kind of normal.\nBut it breathes a different psychological air, and lives with an indefinite urgency. It is a city with its fingers crossed. Its citizenry hangs in delicate equipoise between faith and fear. Much of the abiding hope of the city is invested in time -- the amount of time that passes without something else seismic happening. Every day free of interruptions beyond the anomalies of urban life fosters more faith. Every day an agitated metropolis seems to feel a little better.\nThis is New York. This is Sept. 11.\nIn a city of eight million people, there are many New Yorks, and, in an age of terror, there are some new New Yorks.\nThere are people who are angry that more people are not still angry, and people who are angry that people are still angry.\nThere are haunted people still in therapy over the incoherence of that day, and haunted people who still don't know they need therapy. There are a dozen women, downtown women, familiar to themselves as the Starbucks Group, who continue to meet once a week at a Starbucks with a young therapist. Over lattes and cappuccinos (always skim milk), they work through the pain. They began with the demons of 9/11 and in time found they unlocked other buried traumas, and now everything comes out, all the riddles of their lives.\nThere has always been Neurotic New York but now there is Survivalist New York, people with their particle masks, their potassium iodide, their small vessels to ride the waters. There are families erecting houses in outlying suburbs, places to flee to, but for now they'll stay.\nMost of New York has stayed, committed to its regimens, sometimes with self-imposed constrictions. Certain people won't walk through Grand Central or Penn Station or the Empire State Building, or step into Manhattan itself. The city, skyscraper capital of the world, contains nearly 4,400 high-rise buildings, but some people won't live or work in the clouds.\nAnd there is Soki Brumfield, a young mailroom worker who woke up on Sept. 11 with ''a feeling in my stomach that something was going to happen'' and later in the morning hurried petrified down 68 dark, smoke-filled floors to escape the disintegrating World Trade Center. For months, she hurt in her soul but has returned to work at 1 Liberty Plaza, where the windows from her office on the 38th floor take in the sweep of the emptiness, the backward depth of history there. She, like the city, is regenerating, beginning to be herself again.\nThe morning was still early, the playground exalted with sunshine. Kate Hinds, who writes part time for WNET, Channel 13, the public television station in New York, and Doris Cassar, an art director, members of a longstanding play group, were at River Run Playground on the Upper West Side. Ms. Hinds's daughter, Fiona, 2, assumed her habitual pursuit of dirt. Edward, Ms. Cassar's 3-year-old, gamboled about the swings.\nIn the weeks after Sept. 11, like parents throughout New York, they spoke of whether they could remain, whether they could possibly raise children in a city under siege. All the families of the play group remained. They don't even talk about it anymore.\n''I do remember being nervous to be in a public playground or in a museum,'' Ms. Cassar said. ''I was calling my pediatrician daily and then weekly about air quality. But we decided it was better to just live. Part of it is in God's hands. But the other thing is, where would you hide?''\nOf concern now was the eternal New York problem. She was pregnant and looking for a bigger apartment. Nothing promising was available.\nMs. Hinds's husband, Boyd Hinds, who works at home managing money, had been ready to leave. ''He felt like New York had a giant bull's-eye,'' Ms. Hinds said, ''and then with what went on in Israel, he had this nightmare about someone bombing the M104 bus that I always ride.''\nShe defended her city, her M104. Back and forth. Her husband capitulated, but the issue is not entirely settled. ''Sometime in the winter,'' she said, ''I even had this big fight over the phone with someone in Vermont, who wanted to know how long I was going to live in New York. I said, 'O.K., two-pack-a-day smoker.' ''\nNow her mother, Eleanor Katz, 60, has just sold her house in New Jersey and bought an apartment in Manhattan to be closer to her grandchildren. In years past, she was in the foreign service.\n''I lived in Caracas when there was guerrilla fighting,'' Ms. Katz remembered. ''I lived in Bangladesh when they were going through their civil war. I lived in London when I.R.A. terrorists were planting bombs.''\nGiven her context, New York seemed to her almost the safest of all places.\n''I want to become a New Yorker,'' she said. ''I like the feeling about being among a lot of people and being anonymous.''\nNEW YORK is a city of fresh beginnings, second chances and redemption. It is a city of self-image, romance and work. Three stories:\nStory one: Dr. Howard Beaton, 52, the head of surgery and emergency services at New York University Downtown Hospital, gave good medical advice but rarely followed any. Working four blocks from ground zero, then and now, caught in the enormousness of the city's loss, he felt that to exorcise what had happened he needed to make better of himself. He was 220 pounds, remiss with his diet, tardy with his own health assessments. He had never exercised. Four days after 9/11, he began to run. He began to diet. He is now 63 pounds slimmer, has put 10 inches off his waist and is three suit sizes smaller. Gone are his high blood pressure, his high cholesterol. ''I had to change me to deal with the change in the world,'' he said. ''I chose to turn it into something constructive.''\nStory two: Gabe Winocour, 31, supervises mentally retarded adults, and Maria Ramona Hart, 39, is in the midst of a prolonged anthropology doctorate. They live in Long Island City, Queens. They had dated since August 2000, but on Sept. 11 were on unsteady ground, wondering if they would stay together.\nMs. Hart hardly ever ventured downtown, but on that awful day she was working a temporary job in the financial district, and as the towers fell, she found herself hunched in an alley with strangers, gasping from the roiling smoke, imagining her own end.\nBut she stumbled to safety, over the Brooklyn Bridge. Mr. Winocour was grateful beyond words in finding her unharmed. One of his best friends lost her boyfriend in the towers.\nSomething was awakened in them, an urgency to move their life forward, get off the dime.\nThe next Saturday, a still shaken Ms. Hart was tacking up missing posters for the friend's boyfriend among votive candles in Union Square. When she later went to see Mr. Winocour, he came out with it: ''Marry me.'' And she said, ''Yes.''\nThe wedding took place on Aug. 8, and now they are expecting a child. Ms. Hart has still not been able to fly, but she and her new husband will raise the child in New York. ''Not only are we going to stay,'' Mr. Winocour said, ''we're going to really begin a new life by putting roots down.''\nStory three: The day after Mr. Winocour and Ms. Hart were married, Leroy Elijah Hannon tasted his first freedom as an adult. He had been in prison for 10 years, starting when he was 16, serving a manslaughter sentence.\nBehind bars, unable to share much with anyone, he hurt on Sept. 11. ''People think you're a criminal, you're thought you have no feeling about tragedy,'' he said. ''Nobody asks us about 9/11. I felt part of the tragedy. I felt it, too.''\nWalking down Flatbush Avenue, in downtown Brooklyn, he was intent on his own regeneration. He was now living with his mother, returning to where he began. He had a bead on a carpentry job.\n''I'm trying to fit back into society,'' he said. ''I'm convinced I'm not going to mess up. My desires have changed. I want to make it in New York, above all New York.''\nNEW YORK is a city of many small villages. In their community papers, you read about the celebration of a 100th birthday, about bicycle registration night at the precinct stationhouse, about free soap on Wednesdays at the laundermat.\nIn a polyglot city, there are certain raw emotions, too, when foreigner carries a different meaning than it used to, and this has unsettled some neighborhoods.\nIn Woodside, Queens, a stew of cultural diversity, two guest editorials taking strong views on immigrants ran recently in the Woodside Herald, serving the communities of Sunnyside, Woodside and Long Island City. Buster Sabba, the publisher and editor of the paper, sensed tension out there, and ran the views, not necessarily his own. ''There are very angry people out there,'' he said.\nOne editorial insisted mainly that immigrants ought to learn the English language. The other, harsh and bitter, demanded that all Arabs living here be asked for proof of their loyalties to America, that they wave the American flag and chant, ''Allah Bless America.''\nThese fulminations irritated and enraged many readers. Mr. Sabba was swamped with angry letters citing blind hatred and racism. Robyn Love, 37, in Sunnyside, wrote a protesting letter to the Herald's advertisers. Her husband sent his response to the paper, about taking their 5-year-old son to buy a lemon soda at a store run by a family from Iraq that was always friendly, always fair.\nMr. Sabba was taken aback. ''I was brought up to honor the flag,'' he said. ''I have arguments with my children -- they're 32 and 35 -- about burning the flag. They would allow it in protest. We argue about that to this day.''\nBut he thought about that second editorial: ''I have mixed emotions about having run it.''\nMs. Love felt so shaken because if anything her fidelity to New York had intensified. ''In some ways, I guess I like it more,'' she said. ''I feel New York is vulnerable and I want to look out for it.'' She likes to knit, does it well. She has begun a knitting class in Sunnyside Park. Through the creation of clothing, she hopes in a modest way to sweeten her city.\nTHE usual assortment of activities was available at the Riverdale Senior Center in the Bronx. Canasta. Bridge. Pool. A movie. Coming up was a read-aloud and a watermelon session.\nAnd now -- lunch!\nSophie Posmentier, 86, her face radiating as much assurance as contemplation, ate with Estelle Himelberg, and said, yes, some of the old people had encased themselves in a new solitude, but not her. ''I'm not afraid,'' Ms. Posmentier, known as Smokey, said. ''Things can happen no matter what. I go once every two weeks to Manhattan, for theater. I go at night. I go alone. I hop a bus. I don't want to live in fear and I don't.''\nMs. Himelberg said: ''This friend. She goes out to her car. She put her bag on the fender of the car. This guy drives by and takes her bag. You can't hide your head.''\nMs. Posmentier said, ''That has nothing to do with Sept. 11.''\n''Well, I suppose you're right,'' Ms. Himelberg said.\nIn the other room, Mack Hire, 75, was playing pool alone. He was hounded by arthritis, and had been advised to move around, hence the solitary pool game. ''You can't be scared,'' he said. ''There's no place to run. You have to hand it back to them.''\nHe took a shot at the six ball in the corner, missed. ''Pool is a good way to move around,'' he said. ''Good exercise. Light exercise.''\nCURIOUS are the emotions of the night. At night, the city most exposes its soul. You can see the resumption of life as New York lives it.\nIn a good restaurant on the Upper East Side, where a sign in the window said, ''Help New Yorkers Rebuild the Big Apple,'' three women, all dressed entirely in black, finished up and one talked about a television personality who she knew had had an eye job because she saw her at jury duty and then later saw her on TV and her eyes were so scrunchy. And another said, ''How much should we tip?'' And one of the others said, ''I never tip on the tax.''\nAlong Central Park, 22 joggers were running together (''Stay on the left side. Stay on the left side.''), past a woman combing her hair on a bench and whistling the theme song from ''Oklahoma.''\nAnd at 8:30, men were polishing the brass on the doors at Trump Tower, and two tourists were videotaping it. Several dozen people were in the pews at St. Patrick's Cathedral, saying prayers, and a man was asked to remove his cap, which said, ''FDNY.''\nThere were visitors from Brooklyn and Ames, Iowa, and Brainerd, Minn., and Ecuador and India and the Bronx.\nAt Grand Central Terminal, Michael Jordan's Steak House was busy and people boarded trains and in one corridor there remained the wall of missing faces, and three teenage girls walked past, and one said, ''I can't even look.''\nOthers stared with intent, abstracted looks and some cried quiet tears. Someone had written on the board, ''WTC victims are all slain angels and are now in heaven.''\nIn Times Square, crossroads of the world, parents guided strollers past the man selling the ''greatest pickup lines'' for $1 and immodestly priced gift shops with glass towers and plastic towers and metal towers, and a kinetic teenager, sneakers scraping the pavement, instructed her mother, ''Either you take me to Planet Hollywood or I scream, right here!''\nOut on the water, in the late summer breeze, men with rifles stood on passing Coast Guard boats, while on the disheveled street a sightseeing bus motored past Macy's, everyone smiling, looking, and the city could accommodate them both.\nAnd there a dyspeptic driver honked at a pedestrian -- move it! -- and she had on a blouse that was an American flag. Then the staccato wail of a siren -- whoop, whoop, whoop -- and no one flinched, no one looked up, no one at all.\nAt the First Avenue Pub at 21st Street, there was an American flag waving outside and a picture in the window of the firefighters raising the flag at the leveled World Tra de Center, and there were 13 TV's over the bar tuned to four different channels. On one of them a commercial came up for a compact disc of 60's songs and the one that got shown was ''Eve of Destruction'' by Barry McGuire.\nAlong the bar, people hunched on their stools, sunk down inside themselves. And a young woman in glasses with her hair swept up was telling the bartender about a friend who was in a bad car accident and something went through the windshield and knocked out all of her teeth and sliced off part of her tongue and she had an out-of-body experience in the ambulance and now she is all right.\nAnd the bartender said, ''That's amazing.''\nOn Spring Street in SoHo, professional masseurs were doing massages right on the sidewalk, four chairs set up there, at 10 at night, telling passers-by: ''It's nice. Make you feel good.''\nOn the Bowery, two men, working on pints, were talking, one of them on crutches, and one said: ''I met a man at the park, and he invited me to stay at his place. The only problem is he didn't have a lot of space. I like space.'' New Yorkers being fussy, now and forever.\nAnd it was late, after midnight, and in Washington Square Park, a fire-eater was performing in the waterless fountain to a small ballyhooing audience, and people still played fetch with their dogs in the dog run.\nON 16 downtown acres, the pulverized remains of the World Trade Center had been removed, its steel now being recycled into something else, and the flattened expanse sat there, enclosed by fencing, awaiting its undetermined destiny.\nThe now indigenous tourists, noses against the fencing, took their looks, drew their conclusions. One family was there, with a teenage daughter, who, wanting her friend to absorb it too, had her on her cellphone, feeding her the details: ''It's like this big hole. There's this building with like sheets draped over it. It's weird. There's not much here. But it's history, I guess. Are you going online later?''\nAnd then at the tip of Manhattan, on the Staten Island Ferry, free rides both ways, a young woman pointed out to her companions, ''Right there, behind that black building, there were two gray towers.''\nAnd one companion said, ''You mean there, right there?''\nAgainst the other rail, a man with shoulder-length hair and a chirpy voice said he had just fed the pigeons in the park 50 pounds of birdseed because he liked to feed them, and he got to talking to three teenagers he found companionable and he called them ''munchkins'' and gave them a $100 bill and said have dinner on him. They said he was too generous and he opened his briefcase and he showed them dozens of $100 bills.\nAnd a young man was singing for money, his cap on the floor, and a preacher was preaching devotion to the Lord.\nAnd ahead on Staten Island, where there was so much sacrifice and grief, they were still holding funerals, a year into regeneration.\nAlready at Moravian cemetery, 34 trade center victims were in the earth, dust to dust, their names on a separate list, and when another burial was scheduled, the gravediggers would be told that this was a victim who could expect a very big funeral, and they might have to wait longer to come back to seal the ground.\nAnd Tom Fougner, 33 years at the cemetery, mowing grass as a teenager and now digging graves, was touched by those victims in a way he was only touched by the extreme categories of death. ''It affects you when it's a baby or it's someone you know or it's on a holiday like Christmas Eve,'' he said. ''My grandmother was buried on Christmas Eve.''\nSo he had a red, white and blue ribbon dangling from his backhoe, and what a year for him, for a few months ago he had to dig the grave of one of his closest friends. He didn't want to, of course, but there was no one else on duty. And so with abashed resignation he dug it. What more, he wondered, would he have to face in this long and trembling year.\nHe lived on Staten Island, and regularly went to Manhattan to sample its entertainments and visit friends, but he has refused to go since Sept. 11. He opens the space for death every day -- often five, six times -- but Manhattan scares him. ''Someday I might go back,'' he said. ''I hope so. It's nice to talk to your friends in person rather than on the phone.''\nA cold city and a compassionate city, death and life, it can be both.\nBen Shelton, 49, was a paramedic working his shift for St. Vincent's Hospital in the West Village. He didn't need to talk about that day any longer, but he was down there, before the buildings imploded, and then up at Chelsea Piers, with no one to treat, and there was that abject feeling of helplessness, and who forgets that quickly?\nSteve Trautman, 41, his partner this day, back then stood idle on 911 duty, when the phones did not ring.\nLate on the 11th, he finally got called just south of the ruins, hard to even see, and what was it but a drunk splayed on the street. He felt it was like being on the moon, and what he brought back was a drunk. That was his memory.\n''It bothered me that I wasn't down there involved, I'll be honest about that,'' he said. ''I'm still sad, I'm sad across the board that we got hit in our own backyard.''\nYet New York is about nothing if not life and hope, and they were out there now and every day saving lives, and just as much participating in their own regeneration from embedded memories of a year of monsters.\nThere was a high-risk delivery of a baby, and a man feeling dizzy and someone who passed out at a McDonald's. The contours of 911.\nLook there, a man they picked up all the time. His name -- real name -- was Richard Nixon. A homeless man, and he was carrying dry cleaning. ''What's he doing with dry cleaning?'' Mr. Trautman said.\nThe answer would wait. In came a call for an ''unconscious,'' a man on the floor at the back of a Duane Reade on 14th Street, and they got there and he was awake and sitting up. Some sort of seizure. They took his vitals, not bad at all, and loaded him into the ambulance.\nAnd so they rode through the city, under weeping skies, carrying a strange life under their care. Past throngs of pedestrians and cars, the sounds and whispers of the city, and of course the ghosts, a city eternally old and eternally young, changing and changeless.\nThe patient asked, ''Am I O.K., man?''\nThere was that day and there was this day, and they were a year apart. And today Mr. Trautman could say: ''It looks like you're O.K. It looks like you'll be fine.''\n''You O.K.?''\n''I'm O.K.,'' Mr. Trautman said. ''I guess we're all O.K.''\nThey didn't talk. The rain splashed on the windshield. The siren whooped, and no one looked.\nThis is New York. This is Sept. 11."}, {"text": "POP AND JAZZ GUIDE\n2002-11-01T05:00:00.000Z\nA selective listing by critics of The Times of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. This weekend, most of the city's rock clubs are participating in the CMJ Music Marathon, a convention that began on Wednesday. The showcase concerts are free to a limited number of CMJ participants.\nAHMED ABDULLAH, Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Street, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766. Mr. Abdullah, the trumpeter, was an interesting figure in the late 1980's jazz scene: a free-jazz musician intrigued by rhythmic vamps that gave his work a cohesion. (He played briefly with the great drummer Ed Blackwell as well as with the tenor saxophonist David S. Ware.) He has been in charge of booking Sista's Place, a new storefront jazz spot, and here presents his own band. Tomorrow at 9 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $15 (Ben Ratliff).\n* A.R.E. WEAPONS, W.I.T., Club Luxx, 265 Grand Street, between Driggs and Roebling, Williamsburg, Brooklyn (718) 599-1000. Two local acts with two ways of being obnoxious. The best known A.R.E. Weapons song is ''Street Gang,'' which puts half-sung vocals on top of a thin beat -- it's like a Suicide song, but with less mystery and more swagger. The three women of W.I.T. wear glamorous outfits while relying on a tactic generally associated with more established groups: they lip-sync. Tomorrow night at 11:30; admission, $10. A CMJ show (Kelefa Sanneh).\nJOSEPH ARTHUR, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Mr. Arthur's songs bring together the troubled drama of Peter Gabriel, the sullen determination of Kurt Cobain, the stoic calm of Leonard Cohen and the gravel of Tom Waits. In a voice that can sound as if it has been scraped against concrete walls, he sings about characters who have been kicked around, but are still struggling. Tomorrow night at 11:30, he headlines a bill with Ocean Blue, Allen Clapp, Sprites, Marmalade and See Venus; admission is $12. A CMJ show (Jon Pareles).\nVASTUVADI BAUL, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. The Bauls of Bengal are singers whose repertory has been handed down for centuries: rousing, clear-cut folk tunes driven by handclaps and drums. In this World Music Institute concert, Vastuvadi Baul leads a troupe from the Bangladesh Institute of Performing Arts. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $21, $15 for students (Pareles).\nTERENCE BLANCHARD, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Victoria Theater, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Mr. Blanchard, the trumpeter who dived fully into film composition in the 1990's and mostly released soundtrack records during that time, came back a little while ago with a new band, and most recently with ''Let's Get Lost'' (Sony Classical), which ropes in the four popular jazz singers of the moment -- Diana Krall, Jane Monheit, Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves -- to work over a handful of compositions by Jimmy McHugh, the theater composer famous for songs like ''Sunny Side of the Street'' and ''I Can't Give You Anything but Love.'' Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $35 (Ratliff).\n* BOX CAR RACER, H20, THE USED, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. The headliner is Box Car Racer, featuring members of the first-rate pop-punk group blink-182; Box Car Racer's self-titled debut album is slightly slower and heavier than blink-182's most recent disc, but it is nearly as catchy. Try to arrive in time to see the Used, a promising group with a charming habit of interrupting tuneful passages with temper tantrums. Tonight at 8; admission is $24. A CMJ show (Sanneh).\nJUNIOR BROWN, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 997-4144. Junior Brown has his own instrument, the double-necked guit-steel, which allows him to play biting electric guitar leads in one verse and suave steel guitar in the next. He had a moment of media glory in a television commercial. But in most of his music, he is a country traditionalist, true to honky-tonk tempos and the deadpan baritone vocal style of Ernest Tubb. Every so often, keeping listeners on their toes, he lets loose a Jimi Hendrix lick. Sunday night at 8; tickets are $20 in advance, $25 on Sunday (Pareles).\nREGINA CARTER, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. It has been obvious for years how talented a violinist Ms. Carter is: she is a thoroughbred musician who has played all kinds of jazz and has a classical background, too. But her unfocused recording career only recently found its direction, with a series of records from Verve that have established her seriousness. She is better heard in a small space like this, where the speed of her intelligence and heat of her improvisations can be registered in the bones. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11 p.m., with a 12:30 a.m. set tomorrow; cover charge is $30 and $25 on Sunday night (Ratliff).\nMARC CARY AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Mr. Cary, an exciting, percussive pianist from Washington, played go-go music before coming to New York. Once here, he served the three best apprenticeships available in recent jazz, with the bands of Arthur Taylor, Betty Carter and Abbey Lincoln. Lately he has been broadening his career: he has a straight-ahead trio, and he also has this band, which has groove and world-music tendencies. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight; cover, $15 with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).\nJAMES CHANCE AND THE CONTORTIONS, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-5252. As the 1970's ended, Mr. Chance concocted punk-funk: dissonant, syncopated, horn-driven vamps behind his own grunts and rants about soured love and frenzied commercialism. Honking an alto saxophone, hurling himself around the stage, he was abject and cantankerous. He is headlining with Rye Coalition, a not entirely serious hard-rock band, as well as with Broken Spindles, the Mercury Program, Lo-Hi, the Dears and the Prosaics. Tonight at 8; admission is $12. A CMJ show (Pareles).\nLES CLAYPOOL'S FROG BRIGADE, the World, 1501 Broadway, at 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 398-1816. Mr. Claypool, the bass player and creaky-voiced singer of Primus, has spun off another band, Frog Brigade, to house his fast-fingered riffing and metallic attack. The band will probably insert progressive-rock nuggets from King Crimson or Pink Floyd into its sets. Deadweight opens tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $20 in advance, $23 tomorrow. A CMJ show (Pareles).\nCHEMICAL BROTHERS, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. Amid the knob-twiddlers of electronica, two things distinguish the Chemical Brothers. One is their library of samples, which includes plenty of electric-guitar power chords among the blips and swoops; the other is their sense of timing, which comes from rock rather than dance music and doesn't tolerate too much repetition. Their music keeps evolving and kicking into higher gear, choosing momentum over hypnotism. Tomorrow night at 11:30, they're topping an electronica bill with Cassius, Simian, Erland Oye Soundsystem and Audio Bullys. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $40. A CMJ show (Pareles).\nDILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505. Hearing this tricky, quasi-metal band is like watching rugby: it's all high-impact scrimmaging, fractured and tightly composed, with rhythms pounded in uneven numbers as two guitarists alternated between torrential arpeggiation and slashing chords. Tomorrow night at 11, followed by the band International Noise Conspiracy. Admission: $10 in advance, $12 tomorrow. A CMJ show (Ratliff).\nDIRTY VEGAS, FC KAHUNA, RADIO ZUMBIDO, LOW-END SPECIALISTS, Show World Center, 671 Eighth Avenue, at 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 586-7829. A night of dance music, scheduled to last until around dawn. Dirty Vegas -- responsible for the sublime single ''Days Go By'' -- is to play a D.J. set, which can't possibly be worse than its live set. Perhaps the most intriguing act on the bill is Radio Zumbido, the electronic alter ego of guitarist Juan Carlos Barrios. Tonight at 11:30; call for admission. A CMJ show (Sanneh).\n* DR. ISRAEL AND SEVEN/ DJ REKHA, Hudson Cafeteria, Hudson Hotel, 356 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 554-6302. The deep, leisurely bass lines of dub reggae are the foundation of jungle, which layers jittery electronic drumbeats on top of those bass lines. Dr. Israel (alias Douglas Bennett), a reggae singer, reunites the two branches of reggae's family tree, singing uplifting messages over vertiginous grooves, which can also veer toward hard-rock and punk power chords. Tonight at 1:45 a.m. DJ Rekha, at 1 a.m., specializes in the South Asian-flavored dance music known as bhangra, which merges Punjabi rhythms and vocals with club beats. Tonight's lineup also includes Dub Gabriel, Sultan 32, Samsara Sound System and DJ Kiva, starting at 11 p.m. Free. A CMJ show (Pareles).\nLIBERTY ELLMAN, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. An original jazz guitarist who first made his name in San Francisco and drifted to New York in the company of a few other gifted musicians, including Vijay Iyer and Elliot Kavee, Mr. Ellman is drawn to hip-hop and African music, stressing the upbeat. But one gets the sense of a relaxed, grounded talent at work. His band includes the saxophonist Mark Shim, the bassist Stephan Crump and the drummer Derek Phillips. Tonight at 9 and 10:30; admission is $12 (Ratliff).\n''FREEDOM NOW AND THEN: THE MUSIC OF MAX ROACH,'' Lincoln Center, Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse, 165 W. 65th Street, Rose Building, 10th floor, (212) 721-6500.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $45 (Ratliff).\nHOWE GELB/ SUE GARNER, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn (718) 230-0236. Mr. Gelb, the songwriter at the core of Giant Sand, applies his scratchy voice to songs that can sound quiet and offhand or go lurching and twanging toward chaos. Meanwhile, they take on questions of fate and mortality: ''See how we abide, surviving the emergency when worlds collide.'' Ms. Garner, who has long been exploring the fringes of rock, has lately let her torchy side emerge. Sunday night at 8:30; admission is $10 (Pareles).\nMICHAEL GIRA/DEVENDRA BANHART, CB's 313 Gallery, 313 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, (212) 677-0455. Mr. Gira, who used to lead the Swans, plays some of the most somber rock imaginable, strumming an echoey guitar and intoning bleak lyrics, sometimes working his way through grim crescendos. It is music about old wounds that can never heal. Devendra Banhart's eerie, wavery voice and stream-of-consciousness songs reach back to the childlike surrealism of some of psychedelia's most beloved oddballs: Syd Barrett and the pre-glam-rock Marc Bolan. Mr. Gira performs tonight at midnight; Mr. Banhart appears at 11 p.m. on a bill that also includes Virgil Shaw (10 p.m.), David Dondero (9 p.m.), Howie Beck (8 p.m.) and Nik Freitas (7 p.m.). Admission is $10. A CMJ show (Pareles).\n* GLASS CANDY AND THE SHATTERED THEATER, WOLF EYES, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. A showcase for the puckish local record label Troubleman Unlimited. Glass Candy and the Shattered Theater specializes in brittle, desolate songs; somehow, the occasional groove only heightens the austerity. Wolf Eyes makes off-kilter electronic music that is warmer and stranger and much less coherent. Tomorrow night at 7 with Song of Zarathustra, the Flying Luttenbachers, the Rogers Sisters, the ABC's, and Trance and the Arcade; admission is $12. A CMJ show (Sanneh).\nWINARD HARPER, Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, Flushing, Queens, (718) 463-7700. A former member of the Harper Brothers, who for a minute in the late 1980's looked as if they might make a splash in mainstream jazz, Winard Harper has settled into his role as being one of the busiest and best freelance drummers around town. He has flash and energy to burn. With the singer Carrie Smith. Tonight at 8; tickets are $27, $24 for students and 65+, $22 for members (Ratliff).\nDANIELLE HOWLE, the Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006.

Tonight at 11, on a bill that also includes Mecca Normal (midnight), Sport Murphy (10 p.m.) and Jeff Hanson (9 p.m.). Admission is $13. A CMJ show (Pareles).\nILLINOIS JACQUET BIG BAND, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Since the early 1940's, when he started out with Lionel Hampton's band, Illinois Jacquet has had a saxophone style that most resembled blown kisses and thrown bricks: he is one of the old-fashioned soft-at-heart players. His big band, which he has kept together against the odds for around 15 years, has the knockabout heft that used to be common in jazz. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.; cover charge is $30 (Ratliff).\nKID KOALA, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Kid Koala is a turntablist, a disc jockey whose fast hands turn vinyl discs into sources of percussion and raw noise as well as ricocheting grooves. He tempers his scratching virtuosity with humor as he slices and dices everything from jazz albums to children's records, and he remembers that listeners like a groove. Tonight at 1 a.m., he shares a bill with Push-Button Objects (midnight). Admission is $18. A CMJ show (Pareles).\nHAROLD MABERN TRIO, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. Mr. Mabern is from Memphis and plays with a comfortable, blues-bebop feel; he has big hands, and he is a powerful pianist.

Mr. McHenry, the young tenor saxophonist, has a warm, mature, velvety tone somewhere in the neighborhood of Don Byas's in the 1940's, and he applies it to music that is as modern and harmonically open as you want it to be; he is growing fast and has his own sound, which is half the battle. Sunday night at 10. Mr. McHenry's band comes after three other bands (the evening starts at 7), ranging the full spectrum from composed to free jazz. Admission is $10 (Ratliff).\nMIA DOI TODD/BURNT SUGAR, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8770. Ms. Todd is a poetic folk-rocker originally from Los Angeles, with a pure voice and jarring, imagistic lyrics; Burnt Sugar is an improvisational jazz-rock band, nodding in the direction of Sun Ra and electric Miles Davis. Tomorrow night at 7 (Burnt Sugar) and 9:30 (Ms. Todd); admission is $15 for the early show, $20 for the later one. A CMJ show (Ratliff).\nMOLDY PEACHES/ DANIELSON FAMILLE/IDLEWILD/ FRAMES/ BRENDAN BENSON AND THE WELLFED BOYS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Adam Green and Kimya Dawson, who lead the Moldy Peaches and are about to separate for solo projects, can be crude, earnest, funny, folky and punky. They volley lines or sometimes sing two lyrics at once, and although they have song titles like ''Who's Got the Crack,'' easy laughs aren't all they offer. Tonight at 1 a.m. Daniel Smith, leading Danielson Famille (at midnight), sings earnestly about Christian faith and the vagaries of the flesh in low-fi songs that lurch and tinkle. Idlewild (at 9:40 p.m.) plays fast, punk-infused songs, while Frames (at 8:40 p.m.) and Brendan Benson (at 7:50 p.m.) offer individual takes on tuneful pop-rock; admission is $15. A CMJ show (Pareles).\n* THE MUSIC, MY MORNING JACKET, OK GO, SING-SING, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. A strong lineup of bands playing rock 'n' roll, more or less. The Music creates a fuzzy, bluesy din; My Morning Jacket draws from country to find a stately, achy style; OK Go prizes energy and melody above all else; and Sing-Sing, featuring Emma Anderson (formerly of Lush), makes unassuming music based on simple tunes. Tomorrow at 9:30 p.m.; call for admission. A CMJ show (Sanneh).\n* WILLIE NELSON/ NICKEL CREEK, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070.

He shares the bill with Nickel Creek, a young band applying the verities of bluegrass to all kinds of songs. Sunday and Monday nights at 8; tickets are $37 to $77 (Pareles).\n* ONEIDA, Luxx, 265 Grand Street, between Driggs and Roebling, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-1000. The relentless, driving minimalism of 1970's bands like Can, the fuzztone abuse of garage-rock, the squall of post-punk and a reckless sense of humor share an adrenaline buzz in the songs of Oneida. Sometimes-repeating keyboard lines and bass riffs batter relentlessly against frantic drums; sometimes the songs spiral into dissonant psychedelic crescendos. Tonight at 11, with Avenue D (11:30 p.m.), Lovelife (10 p.m.), Aspera (9 p.m.), Okkervil River (8 p.m.) and Spokane (7:30 p.m.), all followed by an electro D.J. set by Larry Tee.

The Polyphonic Spree, a quixotic project from Dallas, musters a pop miniorchestra and a white-robed choir to sing grandly optimistic songs that recall the psychedelic pop of ''Penny Lane'' and ''Happy Together.'' Tonight at 11, with Gary Lightbody opening at 9:30 p.m.; admission is $12. A CMJ show (Pareles).\n* RAINBOW QUARTZ NIGHT, Arlene Grocery, 95 Stanton Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-1633.

Mr. Roney, the trumpeter, got close to Miles Davis in that old master's late years, and henceforth his thin, passionate trumpet sound and many of his aesthetic choices have borne the mark of Davis, directly or indirectly. This band includes the West Coast pianist Patrice Rushen, the saxophonist James Spaulding, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Lenny White. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10 p.m. with an 11:30 p.m. show tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $25 (Ratliff).\n* SIGUR ROS, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070.

The Slip works on the jazzy side of the jam-band circuit. It is a guitar-bass-drums trio that sidles into odd meters, elliptical guitar tunes akin to Pat Metheny, funk grooves or quasi-African group drumming. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $15. A CMJ show (Pareles).\nTHE SOUNDTRACK OF OUR LIVES, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111 The mid-1960's moment when garage-rock turned into acid-rock, and teenage aggression suddenly turned to metaphysical concerns, is revived by Soundtrack of Our Lives, a Swedish band that sings in English. The band has learned a lot from the early Pink Floyd, the early Who, the Beatles circa 1967 and countless obscure English and American bands; it recaptures the sense of teetering between discovery and disillusionment. When Ebbot Lundberg sings, ''It's the end of a broken imaginary time/ It didn't stay long,'' he obviously doesn't want to believe it. Sunday night at 10:30, with Citizen Bird at 9:30 p.m. and Cato Salsa Experience at 8:30 p.m.; admission is $15 (Pareles).\nSWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 247-7800.

An electronic pop trio from Nashville, led by an unusual singer, Annette Strean.

The Walkmen, tonight at 2:15 a.m., play tarnished rock anthems with undertones of seen-it-all decadence; French Kicks, at 1:15 a.m, plays perky new-wave rock that is as volatile as the romances the band members sing about. The Ceasars open tonight at midnight; admission is $15. A CMJ show (Pareles).\nTHE WARLOCKS/ THE FLESHTONES, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. With two drummers and four guitars, the Warlocks escalate the surging, psychedelic drone-rock of early Pink Floyd, with a touch of Steppenwolf thrown in. Tonight at 1 a.m, preceded at midnight by the Fleshtones. Year in and year out, the Fleshtones have held on to the sound of 1960's garage rock, with its distortion-edged guitars and hoarsely exuberant vocals. Once it sounded like punk; now it is starting to sound like die-hard purism. The lineup also includes the Forty-Fives (at 11 p.m.), Hiss (10 p.m.), the D4 (9 p.m.), Young Heart Attack (8 p.m.) and Etiquette (7 p.m.). Admission is $10; a CMJ show (Pareles)."}, {"text": "Text: Senator Carl Levin\n2002-10-04T05:00:00.000Z\n CARL LEVIN (D - MICHIGAN). Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in support of an alternative resolution, which I will be introducing, and to explain why I believe it is the right way to go and is a better alternative than the White House approach. \n At the outset, whatever differences there may be among us, the one thing on which we can all agree upon is that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the Middle East. He has used weapons of mass destruction against his own people and against Iran. He has launched invasions of Iran and Kuwait. And for the last 11 years he has defied the will of the entire world, as expressed in United Nations Security Council resolutions, by refusing to destroy his weapons of mass destruction and prohibited ballistic missiles. \n Another point upon which I believe there's a consensus among members of the Senate is the fact that confronting the threat posed by Saddam Hussein could ultimately lead to committing U.S. military forces, including ground forces, into combat, and that the vote we take on a resolution relating to Iraq maybe the most important vote that we make this year. \n Whether we commit our forces to attack Iraq as part of a United Nations authorized coalition or whether we go it alone could have immense consequences for our security and for future peace and stability in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East and beyond. And that's why I will be introducing an alternative resolution. \n The resolution that was agreed to between the White House and House leadership fails to address the two main problems with the original White House discussion draft. And those problems are the following: \n The White House approach still specifically authorizes at this time the use of force on a unilateral, go-it-alone basis - that is without Security Council authorization. \n Second, the White House approach authorizes the use of force beyond dealing with Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. \n The resolution that I will be introducing is consistent with how I think most Americans want us to proceed. It emphasizes the importance of dealing with Iraq on a multilateral basis. And it withholds judgment at this time on the question of whether the United States should go it alone, should go unilaterally against Iraq should the United Nations fail to act. \n Now what my alternative resolution does is the following: \n First, it urges the United Nations Security Council to adopt promptly a resolution that demands unconditional access for U.N. inspectors so that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and prohibited ballistic missiles may be destroyed. And within that same U.N. resolution authorizes the use of necessary and appropriate force by U.N. member states to enforce such resolution in the event Iraq refuses to comply. \n My alternative resolution will also specifically authorize the use of United States Armed Forces pursuant to that U.N. Security Council resolution. If Iraq fails to comply with its terms, it provides that the president would then inform the Congress of his determination that the United States has used appropriate diplomatic and other peaceful means to obtain compliance by Iraq with such U.N. resolution \n My resolution affirms that under international law and the U.N. charter, the United States has at all times the inherent right to use military force in self-defense, affirming the fact that there is no U.N. veto over U.S. military action. And the alternative resolution which I'll be introducing affirms that Congress will not adjourn sine die so that Congress can return to session to consider promptly proposals relative to Iraq if, in the judgment of the president, the U.N. Security Council does not adopt the resolution that I've described above. \n It provides further that the president report to Congress every 60 days on the status of efforts to have the U.N. Security Council adopt such a resolution, and if such a resolution is adopted to obtain compliance by Iraq with the resolution. \n Many of us were relieved when the president of the United States went to the United Nations and rightfully declared that the Iraqi threat is, quote, exactly the kind of aggressive threat that the United Nations was born to confront, close quote. \n The president reminded the world that Iraqi aggression was stopped after the invasion of Kuwait, quote, by the might of coalition forces and the will of the United Nations, close quote. \n And in calling the United Nations to act again the president committed the United States to, quote, work with the U.N. Security Council to meet our common challenge, close quote. We will work, he said, with the U.N. Security Council for necessary resolution. \n And acting in this manner the president was setting in motion the same process that was used when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August of 1990. At that time, then-President Bush on Nov. 29, 1990 obtained U.N. Security Council authorization for the use of force if Iraqi forces did not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15, 1991. \n President Bush assembled a coalition of 39 nations that included Arab nations - Bahrain, Egypt, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates - and Muslim nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Morocco, Niger, Pakistan, Senegal, Sierra Leone and, our NATO ally, Turkey. \n The Senate and the House of Representatives passed a joint resolution authorizing the use of force to achieve implementation of the U.N. resolution on Jan. 12, 1991, almost seven weeks after the U.N. had acted and three days prior to the U.N.'s deadline. \n The fact that the United States went to and obtained U.N. authorization for the use of force meant that, with very few exceptions, the world was united in support of the United States and against Saddam Hussein. It did not mean that the United States was going to war against an Arab nation, it meant that the world community with the participation of Arab nations was taking action against Iraq. It did not mean the United States was going to war against a Muslim nation, it meant the world community with the participation of Muslim nations was going to war against Iraq. It resulted in the sharing of risks and the sharing of costs of war. \n Also importantly, the United Nations by its approval gave unquestioned international legitimacy to the U.S.-led military action. And the United States by seeking U.N. approval cemented the credibility and the relevancy of the United Nations. \n President Bush has now gone to the U.N., as his father did before him, and laid out the issues with the following words: \n All the world now faces a test, he said, and the United Nations a difficult and defining moment. Are Security Council resolutions to be honored and enforced or cast aside without consequences? Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant? The United States helped found the United Nations. We want the resolutions of the world's most important multilateral body to be enforced. And right now those resolutions are being unilaterally subverted by the Iraqi regime. Our partnership of nations can meet the test before us by making clear what we now expect of the Iraqi regime. \n That test for the United Nations was laid out clearly by President Bush. Negotiations are going on now among permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. And we all pray that they'll meet the test. And that is why my resolution specifically urges the Security Council to adopt promptly a resolution that, quote, demands that Iraq provide immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to the United Nations weapons inspectors so that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons usable material, ballistic missiles with a range in excess of 150 kilometers, and related facilities are destroyed, removed or rendered harmless; and authorizing the use of necessary and appropriate military force by member states of the United Nations to enforce such resolution in the event that the government of Iraq refuses to comply. \n Congress has a test that we have to face as well. And that test in my view is to support the president's request to the United Nations and not to do anything that will undermine the effort to get the United Nations to do what the president has requested that they do and that, in my judgment and in most of our judgments, they should do. \n In other words, if Congress endorses the use of force, even in the absence of a U.N. resolution at this time, what it does is enable the members of the Security Council to take a pass on the use of force. They can avoid taking a tough position on the basis that the U.S. will act no matter what the U.N. does. \n I think we all want the U.N. to be relevant and credible. We want the U.N. to succeed. We don't want the U.N. to be relegated to humanitarian and disaster relief and other tasks that are useful to international peace and security but are not essential. And I believe that if done wisely we can unite not only the Congress but ultimately the world community on a course of action that we all seek: the elimination of Saddam Hussein's ability to threaten the world with weapons of mass destruction. \n In other words our focus should be on uniting the world and not dividing it. And let me say it again, I strongly believe that the test for Congress is to help the president lead and unite the world and not divide it. \n The resolution that the White House supports authorizes the use of military force with or without world community support. In addition to letting the members of the U.N. Security Council off the hook, the adoption of that type of resolution tells the world that the United States is ready to act unilaterally, to go it alone, and the United States Congress isn't even willing to wait to see if the United Nations will act to follow the president's request and unite the world to enforce its resolutions before deciding that we will go it alone. \n Now moreover, by not limiting the authorization for the use of force at this time to the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, the White House resolution endorses the use of force for a regime change and for a host of other purposes as minor as getting the return of Kuwaiti archives, which is a requirement of one of the U.N. resolutions which the White House resolution says that we will go to war to enforce. \n That language, saying that we will use force for other purposes than the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, separates us from the one nation that has been our most faithful and trusted ally, Great Britain. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw have made clear on numerous occasion that Great Britain's willingness to go to war is to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. \n Why on earth would we want to divorce ourselves from Great Britain? Even if we abandon the effort to unify the world, why would we emphasize the only apparent difference that we have with Great Britain? \n But the most important question in my opinion is whether we decide to go it alone at this time, to go to war with or without the support of the world community. In my view, a go-it-alone approach where we attack Iraq without the support and participation of the world community entails serious risks and could have serious consequences for us in the Middle East and around the world. It makes a difference. It makes a difference when deciding to use force whether or not the use of force has the support of the world community or not. \n If we go it alone would we be able to secure the use of air bases, ports and supply bases and over-flight rights in the region, in that region? And those rights and those capabilities are so important to the success of a military operation against Saddam. If we go it alone would there be a reduction in the broad international support for the war on terrorism, including the law enforcement, financial and intelligence cooperation that are so essential? If we go it alone would that destabilize an already volatile region, undermine governments like Jordan and Pakistan, and possibly end up with a radical regime in Pakistan, a country that has nuclear weapons? If we go it alone, we go without the support of the world community, would Saddam Hussein or military commanders of his be more likely to use weapons of mass destruction against other nations in the region and against our military forces in response to our attack than would be the case if he faced a U.N. authorized coalition? Particularly if that coalition included Muslim nations as the coalition did during the gulf war. If we go it alone would other nations use our action as a precedent for threatening unilateral military action against their neighbors in the future? If we go it alone would we be undercutting efforts to get other countries to help us with the expensive, lengthy task of stabilizing Iraq after Saddam is removed? \n By seeking a U.N. resolution that would authorize U.N. member states to use force if Iraq does not comply with its terms, we aren't giving the United Nations a veto. Rather we are getting from the United Nations strength and international credibility and legitimacy should military force be needed. \n The alternative resolution which I will offer is clear about the fact that we are not giving the U.N. a veto. We are just seeking from the world community support before we decide whether to go it alone. \n In his testimony before the Armed Services Committee on Sept. 23, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili, addressed the issue of acting pursuant to a U.N. Security Council resolution that authorizes the use of force in the following manner, quote: \n I'm convinced that such a resolution would in fact be a powerful tool. And I say that, he said, for a number of reasons. First, we need to impress upon Saddam Hussein that he is not just facing the United States but that he's facing the will of the majority of the world. We must also ensure that we have made it possible for as many of our friends and allies to join us. Some of then privately tell us that they would do so, but that it's difficult for political internal reasons, whatever, very difficult to do so without the United Nations having spoken on the issue. Some of them believe deeply that you should go to war only unless you're directly attacked, that you should go to war only with the sanction of the United Nations. Others just have that in their culture. And finally, General Shalikashvili said, I think it's important from a security point of view. Because every time we undermine the credibility of the United Nations we are probably hurting ourselves more than anyone else. We are a global nation with global interests. And undermining the credibility of the United Nations does very little to help provide stability and security and safety to the rest of the world. \n General Shalikashvili ended by stating that, quote: \n So I see nothing but value added for the United States to try our very best to get that kind of resolution. Close quote. \n Gen. Wes Clark, the former NATO supreme allied commander who testified at the same hearing, echoed the views of General Shalikashvili and added this: \n We need to be certain that we really are working through the United Nations in an effort to strengthen the institution in this process, and not simply checking a block. \n Those two former senior commanders were concerned of course not only with the diplomatic and political aspects of working through the United Nations, but also with the practical impact of not going through the United Nations and the impact that that would have on the actual conduct of a war. \n And Gen. Joseph Hoar, who's the former commander in chief of U.S. Central Command, that's the command with the responsibility for the Middle East region including Iraq, testified as follows, quote: \n In the Arab countries, while they are supporting us in private, have a serious problem in convincing their populations that this is the right thing to do. And so I believe, he said, that we have to give them top cover as well. And we will do that with the United Nations. On an operational level, he said, I would just point out this: That for example if you can't bring Saudi Arabia into the coalition to be able to use, at a minimum, air space, but ideally air bases as well, the complications associated with carrying out a military campaign will grow exponentially. We need them, we need a broad base, we need it for the political reasons as well as the military reasons that we all understand. It will make the whole job a great deal easier. And in the long run, he said as Wes Clark said, in our relationship with these countries in the future it will expedite and ease our ability to do business after the military campaign is over. \n That testimony points out the practical problems that will result if we are using military force against Iraq without the support of the world community. The Saudi foreign minister has specifically stated that if there is a Security Council resolution backing military action, all United Nation members would have to honor it. But he made clear that Saudi Arabia remained opposed in principle to a unilateral attack by the United States. The ability to use Saudi air space, no less Saudi air bases, would be a major impediment to the use of military force against Iraq. \n And the position of our Europeans allies should be considered as well. The Washington Post reported last Monday a senior European official responding to the U.S. going-it-alone approach as follows - and this is quite a succinct and extraordinary comment - quote: \n A lot of Europeans would feel they had been put in an intolerable position. For those who would agree to participate militarily, it would be less a coalition of the willing than of the dragoon. \n It says a lot. Mr. President, it is very important that we carefully consider the short-term and the long-term effects of unilateral action by the United States, and whether we need to make a decision on that at this point when we should be pressing all of our energies for U.N. action. And, as my alternative resolution does, letting the U.N. know that we are ready to enforce their resolution. Because my alternative resolution specifically authorizes the use of American forces in support of a U.N. resolution. \n My alternative doesn't wait to see what the U.N. will do. My resolution puts the focus on getting the U.N. to act, but says in advance to the U.N. we will authorize military force and use it in support of the resolution that we are seeking. Very different from waiting for the U.N. to act, which is a matter of fact what we did during the gulf war. This body didn't vote on authorizing military force until after the U.N. authorized member states to use force. \n My alternative resolution is stronger than that. It is a strong message to the U.N.: We are so committed to your acting to enforce your resolution, and to authorize member states to enforce those resolutions with military force, we are so committed to that course and we believe it is so important that we force Saddam Hussein to open up to inspections and to disarm, we are so committed to that that this Congress - in my alternative resolution - authorizes U.S. military force now in the expectation and the hope and belief that you as a U.N. body will authorize member nations to act. \n So this alternative approach, called the Multilateral Use of Force Authorization Act of 2002, provides for the use of force pursuant to a subsequent U.N. Council resolution that authorizes U.N. member states to use force. It withholds judgment at this time on the question of whether the United States should go it alone unilaterally against Iraq. It doesn't preclude that should the president call us back into session and seek that authority. It does not preclude that at all. \n Mr. President, if we authorize the use of our military forces on a go-it-alone basis at this time, at the time when we're seeking U.N. support, we will send the wrong message to the United Nations. Telling the United Nations that - if you don't enforce your resolution, we will - not only sends an inconsistent message, it lets the U.N. off the hook. \n We should be seeking to unite the world against Saddam Hussein and not divide it. The best chance of having Saddam Hussein comply is when he looks down the barrel of a gun and sees the world at the other end, not just the United States. \n And so our focus should be on securing a U.N. resolution that can unite the world, that has the best chance of forcing compliance, that reduces the risk to our forces and to our interests throughout the world, that avoids to the maximum extent possible the negative consequences if force is required, including the loss of cooperation in the war on terrorists, that has the best chance of isolating Saddam Hussein rather than isolating the United States. \n This resolution, again, does not determine that we won't go it alone if the U.N. does not authorize the use of force. It withholds judgment on that very difficult and very different issue. What it does do is say that in that case, if the U.N. does not act, that the president can convene us quickly in order to seek authorization to go it alone should the U.N. not act in a prompt way. \n The vote that we take, Mr. President, may have significant consequences for our children and our grandchildren. I believe our security is enhanced when we seek the authority and the credibility of the United Nations, and if military force is required that it is used with the full support of the world community. \n I thank the chair and I yield the floor. "}, {"text": "THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE MOOD; Nation's Memory of 9/11 Colors the Debate on Iraq\n2002-10-06T05:00:00.000Z\nAs it echoed down a highway that straddles the continent from suburban New Jersey to San Francisco, the national conversation about war in Iraq was dominated this week by images of smoldering buildings in New York and Washington.\n''We have seen what happens when we let things slide,'' said Chris Federico, 20, a junior here at Notre Dame and sports editor of the campus newspaper.\nIn scores of interviews along Interstate 80, in cities and small towns, on farms and a college campus, last year's attacks framed the debate about a war in Iraq, with many people insisting that America should never again be caught unaware.\n''Sept. 11 showed us we can't sit on our duff,'' said Jerry Ryan, a retired Army colonel, retired school principal and mayor of Bellevue, Neb.\nStill, the Americans interviewed were rarely enthusiastic. Many sensed hidden motives behind the drumbeat of war.\nElection-year politics, nearly everyone agreed, have accelerated the rush to attack Iraq, in the White House and in Congress. Many talked, too, about how President Saddam Hussein had eluded the first President Bush and later tried to have him killed. Personal vengeance, they speculated, is almost certainly on the mind of the second President Bush.\nPeople said they hungered for a coherent explanation from the president -- stripped of what one woman called his recent ''yippee-ki-yay'' rhetoric -- that laid out why Iraq was suddenly such a threat. There was also widespread apprehension about terrorist repercussions.\nBut in interview after interview, Americans seemed unwilling, indeed unable, to discuss Iraq without bringing up Sept. 11. Although the sentiment was far from universal, many said they trusted President Bush on Iraq because of his resolute action against terrorism in the past year.\nThe interviews along the 2,909-mile highway were not a scientific opinion poll. But they were a geographically broad and demographically diverse sampling of argument, fear and conjecture about a war many Americans now view as inevitable.\n'Everybody Here Is Not Saddam'\nNot far from the eastern terminus of I-80, in a Muslim neighborhood of Paterson, N.J., Musleh Ahmed Siddiquey lingered inside the Bengal Grocery.\nHe had finished midday prayers at the mosque next door and was explaining why it was a bad idea to go after Iraq.\n''Bush is maybe a little crazy, like his father,'' Mr. Siddiquey, 49, a businessman, suggested gently. ''If he wants to remove Saddam, there is a way to do it peacefully.''\nMr. Siddiquey quickly added that he supports the United States. Like many of the men who spilled out of the mosque here, he said no one should mistake his disagreement with Mr. Bush for a lack of patriotism.\n''This country is giving us food and shelter,'' said Mr. Siddiquey, who is from Bangladesh. ''In our country people are going to bother me, but here we are getting all kinds of freedom.''\nMuslims in this corner of northeast New Jersey have felt uneasy since last fall, when the community became a footnote to 9/11. Several of the hijackers rented an apartment here as they planned their attacks.\nIn the end, there was little trouble besides taunting. But Muslim leaders here advise followers to express patriotism to all who ask, and to tell anyone that a religious life means devotion to America.\nThe other day, a non-Muslim friend of Mr. Siddiquey's was teasing a mutual friend.\n''He kept calling him 'Saddam, Saddam,' '' Mr. Siddiquey said. ''I told him, I know that you are joking, but that is not good. He is not Saddam, and everybody here is not Saddam.''\nMr. Siddiquey said he feared that if the United States did go to war, many Americans would lose sight of this distinction.\nA Distasteful Topic at Lunch\nDessert was a 40-layer cashew tart and chocolate banana bread pudding. But the main lunch course for five women from Shaker Heights, Ohio, was war. In particular, they chewed on the ethics of pre-emptive war in a time of terrorism.\n''I think if you lead with scruples, you are at a disadvantage,'' said Amy Handel, 52, a retired social worker with two grown children. She argued that Americans were learning what Israeli Jews have known forever: They are vulnerable, and sometimes must break the rules to stop murderers.\nNo one at the table disputed this, though all seemed to find it vaguely distasteful.\nThese were liberal-leaning women from an affluent Cleveland suburb. They found Mr. Bush's positions on social issues abhorrent. But they were unanimous in their belief that Saddam Hussein was a monster who would use weapons of mass destruction -- unless he was stopped.\nThey agreed, too, that Mr. Bush was earnestly trying to protect them. They had heard the cynical argument that the president was as interested in Republican control of the Senate as he was in a regime change in Baghdad. But they did not buy it.\nStill, they wished the president would at least try to sound smarter.\n''He really needs to do a better job of presenting a more cohesive and cogent rationale for this war,'' said Beth Curtiss, who is active in Cleveland's Jewish community.\nMrs. Handel said the president must learn ''to sound less like a vigilante than he does.'' She added: ''After 9/11, the yippee-ki-yay stuff was what we needed to hear. But now I think we need to hear how he is working with other countries against Saddam.''\nThe women said the American public had been told too little about the precise nature of the Iraqi threat. They wondered if the White House merely wanted to scare Mr. Hussein into obeying orders.\n''Is it a game of chicken?'' asked Susan Seitz, 52, a retired lawyer raising four children, ages 11 to 22. ''The more we talk about it, the more it seems like it.''\nThe Truck Stop Perspective\nJust off I-80 in western Ohio, at the Toledo 5 Truck Stop, long-haul drivers wolfed down meals as an amplified woman's voice kept shouting about showers: ''Driver No. 19, Shower No. 5 is now ready.''\nTerry Weller, taking a supper break from hauling paper from eastern Pennsylvania to Chicago, did not seem to hear the woman's grating voice. He talked about how he expected war to play out.\n''I am hoping it is going to be surgical strikes here and there,'' said Mr. Weller, 46, who lives in Somerset, Pa., and has a son in the Marines. ''This war will not be that difficult to win. There will be casualties, but we will not be seeing planeloads after planeloads of bodies coming back.''\nThe timing of the war, he acknowledged, was bad. The value of his stock portfolio has plummeted. ''But you can't really have wars when they are convenient,'' he said.\nMr. Weller, who said he was a moderate Republican who voted for Mr. Bush, smiled when asked whether midterm elections were coloring the war debate. ''Bush wants a Republican Senate and he needs a Republican Senate,'' he said. ''Politics is definitely there. But this deal in Iraq is real.''\nAnother diner, Lawson Russell, 38, a trucker from Chicago who was hauling furniture to Minneapolis, repeated an argument often voiced along I-80.\n''It looks to me like George W. is trying to finish off his daddy's business,'' he said.\nBut Mr. Russell, a deacon at his nondenominational church in Chicago, said he was inclined to trust the president. ''I feel for Mr. Bush,'' he said. ''I know where he is coming from. Do we have to have the Sears Tower come down before we take the Middle East serious?''\nWar and the Fighting Irish\n''It is a bit embarrassing that we don't talk about the war more,'' said Helena Payne, a senior and news editor of The Observer, the student daily at Notre Dame. ''We have a pretty comfortable life here.''\nAll nine of the paper's senior editors agreed that students on the South Bend campus, which lies just south of I-80, are far less worried about war than they are excited by football. The Fighting Irish played at home today against Stanford.\nNone of the nine editors was implacably opposed to attacking Iraq, but seven said Mr. Bush had yet to make a compelling case. ''When your president uses three-letter words and two-word sentences, then the rationale for war can never be very clear,'' Ms. Payne said.\nJason McFarley, the editor in chief, said he was uncomfortable with what he saw as the president's eagerness to go to war, with or without the backing of the United Nations. ''Why is it just us?'' asked Mr. McFarley, 20.\nNo one in the newsroom, however, denied that Saddam Hussein was a menace. C. Spencer Beggs, a senior and the arts editor, said that was exactly why a pre-emptive attack was necessary.\n''I don't have to wait for someone to stab me to disarm him,'' said Mr. Beggs, 21.\nHis argument left the other students looking dispirited, but no one disagreed.\nUnanimity at the American Legion\nEd Shultz got into plenty of fights when he was growing up in West Branch, Iowa. Sometimes he picked fights with other boys. Sometimes they picked fights with him.\n''I knew if a guy used brass knuckles or whatever that I was going to hit him first,'' said Mr. Shultz, 50, a carpenter who retired from the Marine Corps seven years ago. ''I wasn't going to turn my back and let him hit me with the brass knuckles.''\nTo Mr. Shultz, the bully with the brass knuckles is Saddam Hussein. ''We've already been in fistfights with him -- he always plays dirty, he doesn't have any rules,'' he said.\nIn West Branch, where 133 of the 2,188 residents are veterans, Mr. Shultz has plenty of company, especially at American Legion Post No. 514. The chatter there has not been about whether to invade Iraq, but when.\nNine veterans gathered over doughnuts at the legion office the other night to discuss the war. The lone Democrat, Bruce Jeffries, said he, too, supported unilateral action if the United Nations refused to lead, though he remained uneasy about it.\n''I think we have to play so other countries wouldn't think we were just attacking somebody,'' said Mr. Jeffries, 54, an insurance salesman and Vietnam veteran. ''I think we're making more Saddams and bin Ladens, if they see us going in there.''\nDoubts Amid the Saber Rattling\nFew communities along I-80 back President Bush more emphatically than Bellevue, Neb., a town of 50,000 south of Omaha.\n''We cooperate in every way,'' said Mayor Jerry Ryan, 67. ''Twenty percent of the population is retired military. They're very militant. I'd be surprised if you didn't get 8 out of 10 people want to go it alone in Iraq, right now.''\nYet for all the saber rattling, Mr. Ryan, like many others, voiced doubts about the urgency of tackling Iraq now, the reliability of military intelligence and planning for a postwar Iraq. They wondered, too, why the administration's most wanted man was no longer Osama bin Laden.\n''The fixation on getting a single individual really surprised me,'' he said. ''If you go in, and those 12 Iraqi palaces contain nothing but prostitutes, we've got a problem.''\nWaiting for Evidence\nUnder the towering gold dome of the Capitol in Lincoln, Neb., few office workers sounded convinced that Iraq must be attacked soon.\n''I'd like to see a lot more evidence that Iraq is tied to the terrorists,'' said Ken Wade, a court administrator. ''I have a hard time being so concerned about this man getting the bomb, and others, like Pakistan, already have it.''\nOf a score of workers interviewed here, just one seemed persuaded. ''I know it puts all our military in a lot of danger, but I think it needs to be done,'' said Deb Ketterer, 46, a staff assistant at the Department of Motor Vehicles.\nKay McKay, 37, a procurement manager, said she was trying not to think about the war -- but failing. She has a son who is 20.\nThe View From the Ranch\nWith the fall chill setting in, Tracy Almquist, a ranch hand who has a waxed handlebar mustache and wears an American flag bandanna around his neck, went to the Big ''R'' store in Cheyenne, Wyo., for work gloves and long johns. As he shopped, he said the time was ripe for war.\n''With those weapons of mass destruction, it won't just be people in combat who are killed, but innocent bystanders,'' said Mr. Almquist, 39, a father of four. ''In the long run, we may be saving more lives by going to war now.''\nMr. Almquist said he did not expect a great many American casualties. If there were, he said, the war would probably end. He said there was no way Americans would put up with another Vietnam.\nPrayers and Nightmares\nThe washer and dryer at his house were broken. So Jose Partida, a cook who works at two casinos in Reno, Nev., went to a coin laundry with his wife. He watched over the dryers, folded clothes and fretted.\n''I'm a Catholic, and I believe that nobody wins in war,'' said Mr. Partida, 33, the father of four. ''I have boys, and war always means people killed.''\nHe has prayed that there would not be a war, he said, but he is a realist. He is especially concerned about his oldest son, Fernando. A recruiter has been after the boy to join up.\nAs much as he dreads that, Mr. Partida understands the desire.\n''I'll never forget that day, Sept. 11,'' he said. ''It was the worst nightmare that all American people have. I wish they could find a way not to be in the war, though, to deal with the problems they have . . .''\nHis voiced trailed off and he spoke of the power of prayer.\nGiving Peace a Chance\nTheir numbers were not large, but there was an intensity inside the downtown Berkeley offices of California Peace Action. A dozen or so staff members worked at computers, while two volunteers stuffed envelopes in a back room.\nAntiwar fliers and a box of bold black-and-white posters declaring ''Don't Invade Iraq'' were piled near the front door.\nCalifornia Peace Action is the state's largest peace organization, with 30,000 members, though recent antiwar demonstrations sponsored by a variety of organizations in the Bay Area have drawn only small crowds.\nThe White House wants to discourage a debate about war, said Peter Ferenbach, the group's executive director. But he predicted that this effort would fail.\n''With each passing week you see more and more questions coming up from the American people,'' he said.\nThe most corporate-looking activist in the office was Aaron Campbell, 27, the director of major gifts, visiting from Los Angeles. The rush toward war, he said, has helped raise money and attract members.\n''This year is our biggest membership recruitment year in a while,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''I'm very hopeful seeing the response that we've gotten from the general public. But going up against the Bush administration is very daunting.''"}, {"text": "SPARE TIMES\n2002-09-13T05:00:00.000Z\nMUSEUMS\nAMERICAN MUSEUM OF THE MOVING IMAGE, 36-01 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens.

They say the alliance, which extends from North Africa to Southeast Asia, now poses the most serious terrorist threat to the United States.\nThis new alliance of terrorists, though loosely knit, is as fully capable of planning and carrying out potent attacks on American targets as the more centralized network once led by Osama bin Laden, the officials said.\nClassified investigations of the Qaeda threat now under way at the F.B.I. and C.I.A. have concluded that the war in Afghanistan failed to diminish the threat to the United States, the officials said. Instead, the war might have complicated counterterrorism efforts by dispersing potential attackers across a wider geographic area.\nThe ability of the loose network to achieve deadly results was displayed Friday in Karachi, Pakistan, when a car bomb exploded outside the American Consulate, killing 11 people and injuring 26. No Americans were believed to have been killed. Pakistani officials warned of a new militant coalition with Qaeda remnants.\nMoreover, as Al Qaeda followers have fled Afghanistan, the old bin Laden hierarchy has been succeeded by tactical operatives with makeshift alliances with militant groups in countries like Pakistan, Egypt and Algeria.\nSince the Taliban defeat in Afghanistan, intelligence analysts say they have not regarded Al Qaeda as a spent force. But they have redefined estimates of its potency and reach, saying that the American-led war in Afghanistan badly disrupted the group's leadership and forced Mr. bin Laden and his top lieutenants to turn to new operational leaders.\n''Al Qaeda at its core was really a small group, even though thousands of people went through their camps,'' one official said of the bin Laden training camps in Afghanistan. ''What we're seeing now is a radical international jihad that will be a potent force for many years to come.''\nAt least seven Qaeda operatives, whose important roles have not been previously disclosed, possess the managerial skill and authority to carry out attacks, officials said. They said the operatives have assumed a larger leadership role in place of the central command group, which was badly disrupted by the war in Afghanistan. Muhammad Atef, the military commander of Al Qaeda, was killed in American airstrikes last November; he was the most senior member of Al Qaeda to be killed during the fighting in Afghanistan.\nOne terrorism suspect who is said to personify the changing threat is Khalid Shaikh Muhammad, a Qaeda member from Kuwait who authorities have said was a central organizer of the Sept. 11 attacks. He has been sought by federal agents since the mid-1990's in a failed plot to blow up a dozen American airliners over the Pacific Ocean. The presence of someone of his standing in carrying out large-scale attacks makes intelligence officials worried. But they say they cannot tell where, how and when such attacks might come.\nThe six others include several Egyptian men who played a role in the bombing attack on two United States embassies in East Africa in August 1998. They also include Saif al-Adel, a Saudi who is believed to have a seat on Al Qaeda's consultative council, helping to approve attacks, including the embassy bombings.\nTo track the more dispersed remnants of Al Qaeda and its affiliates, Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director, has created two analytical units within the new counterterrorism analysis division to focus on what analysts call the ''international jihad.''\nThe current role of Al Qaeda's traditional leadership group and how much power its members have been forced to cede to their midlevel commanders is the subject of a debate among intelligence analysts about whether Mr. bin Laden is alive or dead.\nAs months go by without evidence of his whereabouts, several senior officials said this week that they were skeptical that he survived the American-led bombing in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan last December. But he has dropped from sight for long periods before and, lacking proof, most experts remain unconvinced that he is dead.\nSeveral senior government officials said they had recently picked up a possible clue. In Afghanistan, Mr. bin Laden surrounded himself with a phalanx of fanatically loyal security guards, a few of whom have surfaced in other countries in recent months. Some experts say that if Mr. bin Laden were alive, his retinue of guards would have remained by his side.\nOne official who has monitored Al Qaeda for years said some of the new central figures were drawn from the coalition that Mr. bin Laden assembled in late 1998 to help carry out his religious order to ''kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military, in any country where this is possible.''\nThe International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, the umbrella group Mr. bin Laden founded in February 1998 in a training camp in eastern Afghanistan, included not only Al Qaeda, which had militants from many countries, but also two leading militant groups from Egypt, as well as Islamist groups from Algeria, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\nSome experts regard the formation of this alliance as Mr. bin Laden's most significant political achievement.\nTo some extent, Al Qaeda itself was always something of a hybrid that staged not only highly structured, top-down attacks but also relied on affiliated -- or like-minded -- militant groups that concocted and financed their own schemes, with Al Qaeda's blessing, to strike at American targets.\nFor example, Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian militant arrested in December 1999 trying to enter the United States from Canada to detonate a bomb at Los Angeles International Airport during the nation's millennium celebration, was seen by investigators as a freelancer who was part of this broader network from which Al Qaeda recruited. Though officials say he trained at a Qaeda camp in Pakistan and received some help in Canada from the group's operatives, they say he did not clear either his specific target or his plot with Al Qaeda's leadership.\nLaw enforcement officials said it remained unclear whether Al Qaeda directed more recent plots like the one ascribed to Jose Padilla, the American who is said to have met with Al Qaeda leaders for discussions about detonating a radioactive bomb in the United States. The officials said it was uncertain if Mr. Padilla, a former gang member, had the skills to build a bomb or acquire radiological material. Like Richard C. Reid, the Briton accused of trying to blow up a Paris-to-Miami flight in December by igniting explosives in his shoe, Mr. Padilla has emerged as a minor figure in sharp contrast to operatives like Mr. Muhammad, whom authorities regard as far more worrisome.\nAlthough sworn members of Al Qaeda were estimated to number no more than 200 to 300 men, officials say that at its peak this broader Qaeda network operated about a dozen Afghan camps that trained as many as 5,000 militants, who in turn created cells in as many as 60 countries.\nForeign intelligence officials said that even if Al Qaeda's entire leadership were eliminated, Western targets would remain at risk from the broader network posed by radicalized militants from the two major branches of Islam -- the majority Sunni branch of the faith, and minority Shiites.\n''The Sunni Muslim threat will remain for the short-to-medium term,'' said one foreign intelligence official. ''A significant proportion of them are from Egypt, Algeria and Somalia,'' the official added.\nRegrouping the Network\nClues on the Web To Remote Sites\nSmiling as he lounged on a floor pad in what appeared to be a private home in Afghanistan, Mr. bin Laden seemed to be fully in control. Al Qaeda's leader, in a videotape released by American authorities in December, appeared intimately acquainted with the details of the Sept. 11 hijackings.\nOn the tape, Mr. bin Laden said he knew that the suicidal nature of the plot was withheld from some of ''the brothers'' until just before the hijackings. Six days before the attacks, Mr. bin Laden said he was aware of the precise day and time of the attacks. And he said he was aware there would be multiple aircraft strikes at targets inside the United States.\nFor intelligence analysts, the tape provided a critical piece of information. The video confirmed that Mr. bin Laden could communicate with his operational forces in the field. The depth of his knowledge indicated that he not only was an inspirational figure but also operated as a commander in chief who was responsible for the attacks.\nBut since December, when the American-led raid at Tora Bora in northeast Afghanistan sought to root out one of Al Qaeda's last strongholds, Mr. bin Laden, as intelligence analysts put it, has ''gone dark.'' Intelligence agencies have heard nothing from him for six months. None of their sources, electronic or human, have provided any clear indication of his fate.\nThe fate of his terror network has been better understood. In recent months, Internet traffic among Al Qaeda followers indicates that elements of the network have regrouped -- some in remote sanctuaries in Pakistan, government officials said.\nSome of Mr. bin Laden's midlevel commanders have turned to new Web sites and Internet communications as part of what officials have described as a concerted effort to reconstitute a terror network after the rout of the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nThe Internet activity indicates that some of Mr. bin Laden's followers may have fled to villages in the Pakistani province of Baluchistan, along the Afghan border, a sometimes lawless region. American officials now believe that some of these villages in Baluchistan could be serving as new sanctuaries for Al Qaeda members.\nEarlier this week, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he had seen indications that Al Qaeda followers had regrouped in the Kashmir region, an area disputed by Pakistan and India. Indian leaders have long accused Pakistan of harboring Islamic militants in Kashmir.\nThe New Leadership\nWithout a Chain, The Links Persist\nWith Al Qaeda's leadership in disarray, at least seven Qaeda members who have specialized in organization and tactics have assumed a more prominent role within the loose coalition of remaining terrorist groups, analysts and government officials said.\nThe officials said these Qaeda lieutenants have both the authority to initiate attacks and the ability to carry them out by providing cash and false documents to operatives.\n''The operators who are still out there -- they are the ones that will conduct the next terrorist attack,'' a senior government official said.\nIntelligence and law enforcement officials say they now believe that Al Qaeda operatives like Mr. Muhammad are operating independently, out from under the control of the bin Laden chain of command, which may no longer exist as a working command structure as it did in Afghanistan.\nBesides Mr. Muhammad, who was identified last week as being suspected of having a major operational role in the Sept. 11 attacks, the officials identified six other people whom they view as the planners of new attacks. Officials said they were scattered among several countries to regroup the activities of what is left of Al Qaeda and operations involving other terror groups.\n''I'd sleep a lot better at night if these guys were off the street,'' a senior government official said.\nAccording to government officials, these are the key leaders:\nSaif al-Adel is said to sit on Al Qaeda's consultative council, the group that approves all terrorist operations, including the embassy bombings and the attack on the American warship Cole in October 2000 in Yemen. Mr. Adel, a Saudi, came to Al Qaeda as part of its affiliation with Egyptian Islamic Jihad. The United States government has been trying to find Mr. Adel since 1993, when he trained tribal fighters to attack the United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia, an operation that killed 18 American soldiers.\nFazul Abdullah Muhammad is a native of the Comoros Islands, an impoverished archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Using the alias Haroun Fazul, Mr. Muhammad was Al Qaeda's chief operative in Kenya in the mid-1990's.\nMuhsin Musa Matwalli Atwah is a 37-year-old Egyptian who was one of five fugitives indicted in the two American Embassy bombings in East Africa in 1998. Mr. Atwah was believed to have been in Afghanistan last fall, but American authorities said this week they do not know his current location.\nMustafa Muhammad Fadhil is an Egyptian who the authorities said was an important organizational operative in Al Qaeda. Mr. Fadhil is believed to have rented the house in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where a half dozen conspirators made the car bomb that exploded outside the United States Embassy there, an attack that killed 11 people. Mr. Fadhil was also indicted in the embassy bombings case, but he has eluded capture. An American official this week said that Mr. Fadhil ''was one of the most important people we are pursuing.''\nAbdullah Ahmed Abdullah, an Egyptian, has served since the early 1990's as a senior adviser to Mr. bin Laden, officials said. He was indicted for his alleged involvement in the bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi. Cooperating witnesses have told the authorities that he conducted surveillance of the embassy three days before the bombing.\nFahid Muhammad Ally Msalam, 26, is another Qaeda suspect wanted for being directly involved in the bombing of the embassy in Nairobi. Mr. Msalam, a Kenyan, is said to be the Qaeda member who bought the Toyota truck that was used in the bombing. Prosecutors say he packed it with explosives and transported it to the embassy. His fingerprints were found on a magazine that was inside a Nike gym bag that also contained clothing with traces of TNT, according to testimony at the embassy bombing trial last year in Manhattan.\nSenior government officials said that despite some Qaeda members who have been captured or killed, the organization still has the ability to initiate terrorist strikes.\nOne official said this about the remaining goal: ''It's body bags. That's all that matters to them now.''\nTracking the New Network\nShifting Alliances Of Militant Groups\nIn May, not long after a suicide assault, also in Karachi, that killed 11 French citizens, Pakistani intelligence officials told President Pervez Musharraf that some of the country's most militant Islamic groups had joined forces to carry out fresh attacks against American targets. Pakistani officials said they believed that the attack on the American Consulate had been carried out by a new coalition of organizations drawn from the remnants of Pakistani militant groups that were disrupted during General Musharraf's crackdown earlier this year.\nOfficials emphasized that it was no longer possible simply to label all post-Sept. 11 plots as Al Qaeda inspired, because the new terror alliance has largely replaced the old bin Laden network. Senior government officials said this week that the Karachi bombing had been an example of the new broad-based coalition of various terrorist groups coming together for operations. ''What many of these groups have in common, however, is that they had members go through the Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan,'' one official said.\nInvestigators have also looked for clues of the remade terrorist landscape in both the attacks and the foiled plots since Sept. 11.\nAt least six plots have been disrupted since Sept. 11. The first, on Sept. 13, was a plot to destroy the United States Embassy in Paris. A French citizen of Algerian ancestry was arrested in Paris and told prosecutors that he was part of a Qaeda plot to blow up the embassy.\nIn Singapore last December, the police arrested what they described as 13 Qaeda members who were part of a cell that had prepared to blow up embassies of the United States, Israel, Britain and Australia.\nEarlier this week, Moroccan authorities said they had broken up a Qaeda cell that had identified NATO ships in the Strait of Gibraltar as potential targets.\nTwo men, both tied to Al Qaeda, have been arrested since Sept. 11: Mr. Reid, the shoe-bomb suspect who was accused of trying to blow up a Paris-to-Miami flight on Dec. 22, and Mr. Padilla, the former Chicago gang member accused this week of beginning a plot to build and detonate a ''dirty bomb'' in the United States.\nInvestigators say they see important similarities between Mr. Reid and Mr. Padilla. Neither man is the traditional Al Qaeda attacker -- Mr. Reid is British, while Mr. Padilla is American.\nAlthough some government officials said Mr. Padilla's dirty bomb plot was only in its earliest stages, they said they were most struck that Al Qaeda would use someone like Mr. Padilla, whose American passport would allow him to enter the country with ease. ''It's a very nice package for them to be able to move somebody -- he has the clean passport,'' one official said. ''We have some strong leads and ideas of where his support was coming from.''\nIn Mr. Padilla's case, investigators said the new leadership's resiliency illustrates a saying attributed by a senior official to Ayman al-Zawahiri, a deputy to Mr. bin Laden whose whereabouts are not known: ''Zawahiri described Al Qaeda as a bunch of grapes -- even if you manage to pull off one grape, you still have a lot more grapes left.''"}, {"text": "Travel\n2002-12-08T05:00:00.000Z\nI GREW up in an era when nobody went anywhere. O.K., so I'm exaggerating -- but just a little. In the 1960's and 70's, aside from ski trips to Vermont, our family pretty much stayed home. For my parents, a trip to Bermuda was the height of adventure.\nThen everything changed. Airline deregulation and a spike in disposable income; the raising of the Iron Curtain; global A.T.M.'s; the aptly named World Wide Web, conjuring vacation paradises at a keystroke: it all added up to a revolution in travel. A few years ago, when I was teaching a college writing class, one of my students requested a week's extension on a paper that was due during our winter break. He'd fax it to me, he said -- from Katmandu. Suddenly, everyone was going everywhere.\nAll this activity has depleted the world's store of unfamiliar places, sending travel writers ever farther afield in search of the exotic. But nowhere is the sense of a world overrun by travelers more evident than in what might be called the stay-away travelogue: books by writers whose goal in describing a place is to urge the rest of us to leave it alone.\nTake, for instance, Craig Childs's SOUL OF NOWHERE: Traversing Grace in a Rugged Land (Sasquatch, $22.95). A former river guide and desert ecologist (and the author of seven books), Childs has spent years hiking through the mountains and canyons of Utah, Arizona and northern Mexico, and he doesn't want us following in his footsteps. ''I have left references to specific locations of archaeological sites and wilderness regions in this book as obscure as possible,'' he announces in an author's note. ''When geographic names are used, they will not locate a site within an area any smaller than 100 square miles.'' All right, already, we won't go!\nIn some ways, ''Soul of Nowhere'' looks like a boys' book, with Childs and various companions hunting rabbits with a slingshot, hanging out in remote caves, smoking cigarettes rolled out of wild tobacco and engaging in other Huck-and-Tom adventures. But Childs isn't interested in fun. It's grace he wants, and he marches after it with the zeal of a pilgrim. Hohokam cliff dwellings and Anasazi snake petroglyphs inspire hushed reverence -- Childs and his friends keep their voices down as if in church -- and rapturous reflections on premodern man's capacity for responding to nature with religious awe.\nChilds's own feats of asceticism are nothing if not awe-inspiring: he's a modern-day desert father, seeking transcendence in self-deprivation, solitude and steadfast meditation on his mortality. Repeatedly, Childs tempts a gruesome fate, climbing rock arches a hundred feet high, where an inch's misstep means death, and sleeping on snow-blasted cliff ledges in the middle of winter. ''An error in my food calculations'' leaves him half-starved in the bleakness of the Sonoran lava fields; a trek through the ''predatory landscape'' of southwestern Arizona results in nasty abrasions and infections from cactus spines embedded in his skin. It would be ''so easy,'' he says at one point, ''to be carried away.'' Childs uses the desolate places he writes about as an existential testing ground where, in facing the prospect of his extinction, he discovers an abiding will to live.\nAnother sort of ''keep out'' sensibility pervades THE ROADLESS YAAK: Reflections and Observations About One of Our Last Great Wild Places (Lyons/Globe Pequot, $22.95). A collection of writings solicited by the novelist and environmentalist Rick Bass, the book addresses the Bush administration's attempt to undermine a Clinton-era Forest Service initiative prohibiting road construction and timber harvesting on 175,000 roadless acres of the Yaak Valley in northwestern Montana (and another 58 million such acres in other national forests). The contributors include a ''clear-cut survivor'' and ''river activist,'' a ''fierce advocate for grizzly bears'' and a few dozen others, all invited to ''testify'' on behalf of ''this strange, dark, lush rainy region'' that Bass -- one of only 150 residents of the valley -- calls ''a gold standard of ecological diversity.''\nThe book's conservationist argument depicts the Western wilderness as a foundation of American culture. ''Egypt has its Pyramids, Italy its splendid churches,'' one contributor notes, adding, ''We have our wild places.'' And these wild places shape not just our culture but our character; they provide, another contributor argues, ''a governing idea in the way we perceive ourselves as Americans.'' The fear many of Bass's essayists share is that without the wilderness as a frame of reference we will float free into a wholly utilitarian understanding of nature. The book articulates a gloomy presentiment of this future and its embrace of ''the mistaken impression,'' as one essayist puts it, ''that people are the permanent feature while the natural world is mutable, shrinkable and ultimately dispensable.'' The wilderness is our treasure, and if we squander it, these writers warn, we squander not only our heritage but our essential spirit.\nIf Bass's anthology is often deadly serious, then Lawrence Millman's LOST IN THE ARCTIC: Explorations on the Edge (Thunder's Mouth, paper, $15.95) is often deadly funny. Millman (whose previous books include ''An Evening Among Headhunters'') puts himself in the way of all kinds of harm in all sorts of places, and lives to laugh about it. Take, for instance, his offhand description of the bear paw print he sees while hiking on Kodiak Island: ''It was twice the size of my boot, which meant that the bear in question would wear a size 21 shoe, and that wouldn't even include the customized orthopedic extension for its claws.'' He loves a tall tale, especially told from a bar stool -- like the one he heard from a man who claims to have dentures fashioned from the teeth of a bear he shot, or the mushroom picker's boast of finding a matsutake so big it could be picked only with a chain saw or a winch.\n''Lost in the Arctic'' abounds with Millman's high jinks. On the Micronesian island of Yap, he consults a village medicine woman about a painful rash on his legs; she tells him he's possessed by a spirit and offers to cure him -- for a few packs of Marlboros. In another village, he takes shelter from the midday heat in a thatched-roof structure only to find, when greeted by giggling women, that he has blundered into the village's menstrual hut. Marooned on a nameless island off the Melville Peninsula in the icebound Canadian Arctic, Millman shares coffee with his guide, Qungujuq: ''He got his caffeine fix by sticking the grounds directly into his mouth like a wad of tobacco, thus avoiding the bland intercession of water. When I tried to imitate him, I accidentally swallowed the grounds and ended up with very bad heartburn.'' Again and again, Millman extends a generous invitation for the reader to experience schadenfreude at his expense, leaving you glad it's him out there on that iceberg and not you.\nAnother extreme place I'm happy to let others visit without me is the Tsangpo River valley in the Himalayas of southeastern Tibet. In 1992, Outside magazine ran an article entitled ''What's Left Out There?'' listing ''the world's last great unknowns,'' which included the innermost reaches of the Tsangpo gorge, so inaccessible that they remained uncharted almost to the very end of the last millennium. One question had long troubled the few Western travelers to venture up the valley. How could the river lose so much elevation so fast (eight times the gradient of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon) unless there was a Niagara-sized falls hidden somewhere within the gorge? The ''riddle'' of the Tsangpo's ''lost falls'' led the early-20th-century botanist and explorer Francis Kingdon-Ward to call it ''the great romance of geography.''\nLike the Shangri-La of James Hilton's 1933 novel, ''Lost Horizon,'' the Tsangpo gorge has been, as Michael McRae puts it, ''a blank slate for the dreams and fantasies of the Western imagination.'' In THE SIEGE OF SHANGRI-LA: The Quest for Tibet's Sacred Hidden Paradise (Broadway, $25), McRae (a contributing editor for National Geographic Adventure) offers a fascinating gallery of the explorers who ventured into the region over the last two centuries, profiling figures like Kingdon-Ward, a gentleman naturalist who traveled with tins of foie gras and a huge Tibetan mastiff named Ah-poh and collected over 20,000 species of flowering plants. Kingdon-Ward's latter-day counterpart is a charismatic American named Ian Baker, a Buddhist iconographer, tour group leader, extreme climber and, as one friend calls him, all-around ''bliss boy.'' Baker typifies the spiritual adventurers who began wandering around Tibet once the Chinese opened it to tourists a decade ago. As McRae describes him, he's a disconcerting mix of religious pilgrim and publicity hound, a man who undertakes a Tsangpo pilgrimage at the urging of his Tibetan spiritual adviser -- carrying a big check from the National Geographic Society.\n''The Siege of Shangri-La'' chronicles the 1990's competition among various wilderness outfitters, kayaking expeditions and film crews to scoop their rivals and come back with the story of the discovery of the inner canyons -- a drama of intrigue, rivalry and Faustian ambition'' that sheds light on the intensely competitive nature of modern adventuring. McRae details the consequences of the feverish market for undiscovered places: needless risking of lives, dubious and bitterly contested claims about the lost falls, and an orgy of hype that culminated in National Geographic Adventure anointing Baker one of seven ''explorers for the millennium.'' But that's what happens when the unexplored world runs dry while our thirst for explorers persists.\nWhile some travel writers look for lost places, Hillel Halkin went looking for a lost people. ACROSS THE SABBATH RIVER: In Search of a Lost Tribe of Israel (Houghton Mifflin, $28) chronicles the claim of the B'nei Menashe of northeast India to be descendants of the biblical tribe of Manasseh. Hoping to shed some light on the matter, Halkin, an American-born journalist and translator who lives in Israel, sets off for their home province, wedged between Bangladesh and Myanmar. There he's startled to discover mezuzot nailed to kitchen doors, shops called Zion Hardware and Israel Grocery, and synagogue services using prayer books with Hebrew words spelled out phonetically in the local Mizo language. ''Either a Tibeto-Burmese people in a remote corner of Southeast Asia had a mysterious connection with ancient Israel,'' Halkin writes, ''or they were the victims of a mass delusion.''\nThe fate of lost tribes has long fascinated both Jews and Christians, and Halkin provides a summary of claims down the ages, from medieval times up to the rampant Lost Tribism of the New World. (William Penn considered Indians so Semitic-looking that he said being among them was like visiting Jewish neighborhoods in London.) The case for the B'nei Menashe hangs on such tantalizing evidence as a song about a red sea and stories of long-ago sacrifices to a God named Yah. Are these dim collective memories of Old Testament traditions? Halkin remains skeptical until he meets a delightful doctor and self-taught ethnographer who has spent decades traipsing about the countryside researching a monograph he calls ''The Wonderful Genealogical Tales of the Kuki-Chin-Mizo.'' From its evidence, including a story about being driven from their homeland by a sangah meichol, or wildcat (possibly ''a garbled memory of Shalmaneser,'' the Assyrian king who besieged Samaria and drove the lost tribes into the mists of myth), Halkin concludes that he has found ''a fragment'' of the tribe of Manasseh.\nPart wry travelogue, part exegetical detective story, ''Across the Sabbath River'' is animated by Halkin's sympathy with these would-be Israelites and their spiritual homelessness -- lost in a remote and war-torn corner of India, cut off by ethnicity, language and religion from the Hindu majority. ''Show me I was once a Christian, and I'll be a Christian,'' one man pleads. ''Show me I was a Jew, and I'll be a Jew. . . . But show me who I am.'' It's hard not to see Halkin's conclusion as an act of generosity toward people whose passionate desire to be Jews, in his view, qualifies them to be just that. ''Abraham did not have Jewish ancestors,'' he points out, addressing the B'nei Menashe in their synagogue. ''He became a Jew by having the courage to be one.''\nOf course, the mystical sense that home is elsewhere -- a foreign place you are irresistibly and mysteriously drawn to -- afflicts individuals as well as groups. A HOUSE SOMEWHERE: Tales of Life Abroad (Lonely Planet, paper, $13.99), edited by Don George and Anthony Sattin, samples over two dozen writers on the theme of making a new life in a Chosen Land. There's a three-part paradigm to the form -- falling for, settling in and parting from -- and these essays (some original and some excerpted from previously published books) capture all three. With almost swooning lyricism, Niall Williams and Christine Breen describe their new home in County Clare, Ireland. There they join in the custom of the cuaird -- which, they explain, derives from the old Gaelic word for visiting but involves much more than that: ''The dark was forgotten, the rain unheard, the wind that tunneled along the black and winding roads blew unnoticed, for the cuaird was on, the kettle was boiling above the turf fire, and the tart was being brought from the oven.''\nIn a hilarious excerpt from ''A Year in Provence,'' Peter Mayle recounts a kitchen renovation suffered at the hands of a contractor who bounds in vowing to ''attaquer la cuisine,'' his speech ''full of the onomatopoeic words like tok and crak and boum that the French like to use when describing any form of collision or breakage.'' Not surprisingly, his ministrations leave Mayle and his wife living for weeks ''in a permafrost zone with the mistral screaming through the hole in the kitchen wall.'' Creating an entirely different mood, the bittersweet valedictory of Errol Trzebinski (the author of biographies of Denys Finch Hatton and Beryl Markham) to her oceanfront home in Kenya recalls how the life of her family was changed by a single late-night telephone call.\n''A House Somewhere'' explores the way places reveal surprising affinities in the people who adopt them. My favorite is the essay by the South American novelist Isabel Allende, now a resident of Northern California, who writes of hiring a crew to ''distress'' her newly built home, creating the ''historical impossibility'' of a century-old Chilean house on a hill in Marin County. ''It's a fake,'' she says, sounding like a true American, ''but I love it.''\nIn A CERTAIN SOMEWHERE: Writers on the Places They Remember (Random House, $24.95), Robert Wilson turns a posse of contributors loose on much the same subject, with results (all originally commissioned for Preservation magazine) that are just as good. Thus Ann Beattie pays tribute to the rumpled spirit of Key West (''It's definitely not the cutting edge -- it's more like the remnant that got snipped''), while Thomas Mallon describes the splendor of the Main Reading Room of the New York Public Library, which he finds ''as romantic as any place in the city.'' And David Huddle's account of his hardscrabble Appalachian hometown casts its violence, pride and courtesy as outgrowths of its geography -- the ''tilted thinking'' of a hill town ''where houses and churches have to be built with a high wall and a low wall.''\nThe relation of outer to inner landscape informs a third anthology, THE ILLUSTRATED VIRAGO BOOK OF WOMEN TRAVELLERS (Virago/Trafalgar Square, $35), a compendium of several centuries' worth of women's travel writings. ''Women,'' Mary Morris argues in her introduction, ''move through the world differently than men,'' and their travel writing often provides ''a dialogue between what is happening within and without.'' Maybe, maybe not. But whatever the nature of the dialogue, Morris and her collaborator, Larry O'Connor, provide a wide variety of voices here. Suggesting much about her own prejudices, the 19th-century British novelist Frances Trollope visits America and recoils from the ''uncouth advances'' and ''familiarity of address'' she finds ''universal throughout all ranks in the United States.'' In an excerpt from ''Out of Africa,'' Isak Dinesen conveys her love for her adopted home as she evokes the beauty of a Kenyan lake seen from an airplane, teeming with flamingos that ''spread out in large circles and fans, like the rays of a setting sun, like an artful Chinese pattern on silk or porcelain.'' Demonstrating her skills as a reporter, Andrea Lee, whose 1979 account of Easter in Moscow presciently anticipates the fall of Communism more than a decade later, writes of ''the feeling of a vast and growing secret in the city, a gathering power that had nothing to do with Lenin.''\nMorris's notion of a kind of travel writing that makes ''the beholder as significant as the beheld'' is nicely borne out by my favorite among this season's travel books, the British novelist Jenny Diski's STRANGER ON A TRAIN: Daydreaming and Smoking Around America With Interruptions (Picador USA, $24), an account of her desultory wanderings on Amtrak. ''I am not a travel writer in any reasonable sense of the word,'' Diski announces at the outset -- and if you're looking for landscape, look elsewhere. It's people, not panoramas, she's interested in. An incorrigible nicotine fiend, Diski hangs out with fellow enthusiasts, who turn out to be a lively cast of characters: a Heidegger devotee in a baseball cap; a pair of beautiful girls who may or may not be transvestites; a pipe-smoking Amish elder; a manic, multilingual chef who boasts of making beef Wellington for Willie Mays (whom Diski, cluelessly British, refers to as Willie May). They all drink and talk politics and sing songs by Patsy Cline -- with Diski, despite her initial reluctance, soon reveling in the camaraderie. ''America was rolling over on its back and waving its legs in the air,'' she writes, ''offering me its soft sentimental underbelly to rub.''\nThe perils of Diski's journey have nothing to do with marauding bears or extreme climates. Instead, they're rooted in the steadfast otherness of other people, and ultimately in the dangers of self-knowledge -- for Diski, the predicament of being in her mid-50's and knowing, for better and for worse, who she irrevocably is and what she irrevocably has done. The travelogue-as-memoir can seem forced in the hands of less capable writers, but Diski pulls it off, effortlessly blending observation and recollection. Her discussion of America's antismoking fervor, for example, leads her back to her own adolescent bad-girl desire to smoke, then to the subject of desire itself and to the memory of a man she shared cigarettes with (and contemplated loving) years ago in a psychiatric institute where both were briefly committed. From there she wanders to the disappointments of romance and finally makes her way back to the conclusion that ''smoking is a love that has never gone wrong.'' Diski's Seinfeldian pitch to her editor -- it will be a book about nothing happening'' -- proves true enough, and yet with a writer this quirky and sharp, we don't need incident. We're happy enough just to ride the train of her thoughts.\nDiski cites Nabokov as an influence, and her own tangle with remembered time is distinctly Nabokovian -- as are her mix of passion and detachment and her ability to write tenderly while retaining a cool unsentimentality about herself and others. Funny, surprising and harrowing, ''Stranger on a Train'' delivers the kind of adventure travel we will always need: its discoveries aren't new places but fresh new ways of seeing old ones."}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED: PORTRAITS OF GRIEF: THE VICTIMS; Blunt Talker, Devoted Aunt, Russian migr, Young but Wise Man\n2002-02-03T05:00:00.000Z\nHere are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.\nDANIEL O'CALLAGHAN\nAlways at the Ready\nSummer and winter, morning, noon and night, Lt. Daniel O'Callaghan wore his thick black bunker pants around the Ladder Company 4 firehouse in Midtown Manhattan. ''It would be 102 degrees out, and he'd be wearing his bunker gear,'' said Al Schwartz, a firefighter who drove the truck with the lieutenant sitting up front beside him. ''He was always ready to charge in.''\nThis was a man who set the Fire Department like a seal upon his heart as well as a seal upon his arm. But he also taped paintings by his 6-year-old daughter, Rhiannon Rose, to his office walls at the firehouse, and when he left his house would back his pickup truck up the street just to wave goodbye one more time to his 17-month-old, Connor Daniel. And when he left their home in Smithtown, N.Y., to work a 24-hour shift, he left a trail of Post-It notes in places where his family would find them: the dresser drawers, the refrigerator, the pillows.\n''He'd draw smiley faces on them,'' said his wife, Rhonda, who married him on his 31st birthday, ''and he'd write 'I love you' or 'I miss you' on them.''\nA lot of firemen work second jobs to make ends meet. But not Lieutenant O'Callaghan, who would have turned 43 today. ''He was always with us,'' his wife said. ''I'm glad, because my daughter has all these special memories.''\nHe usually carried a battered prayer card with a book of matches stapled to it in his jacket pocket. It was his good-luck charm. On Sept. 11, he left it behind.\nABUL K. CHOWDHURY\nA Devoted Moviegoer\nAbul K. Chowdhury and Young Kim first spotted each other in their freshman English-as-a-second-language class at the College of Staten Island. She was the daughter of Korean immigrants; he was the younger son of a diplomat from Bangladesh. She worked as a manicurist to earn her tuition; he wanted to become a computer expert.\nThey began sharing the long slog by road, water and rail between school and their respective apartments. Their first kiss took place aboard the Staten Island Ferry, the Manhattan skyline in the distance.\nLast April they were married, she in a long white gown, he in a tuxedo, their mothers in traditional dress. Mr. Chowdhury, 30, had landed a job with Cantor Fitzgerald, a job he loved. He and his brother Qaisar cared for their parents and looked out for their four sisters. ''We two brothers, we help the whole family,'' Qaisar Chowdhury said. ''We two brothers are like two arms.''\nMrs. Chowdhury taught at the College of Staten Island, and after work she would meet her husband outside the World Trade Center, the towers glowing like a pair of lanterns. Like an old married couple, they had their routines. ''We loved to see movies,'' Mrs. Chowdhury said. ''We used to enjoy the previews, and decide which ones we were going to see next.''\nGEORGE J. STRAUCH\nDid It 'All the Way'\nGeorge J. Strauch was, in the words of one friend, ''just a regular, great guy'' who never did anything halfway.\nMr. Strauch, 53, worked as an insurance broker at Aon at 2 World Trade Center. He commuted there each day from Avon-by-the-Sea in New Jersey because he loved the water and almost any sport connected to water. He was an avid sportsman (golf, fishing, sailing) who often included his wife and daughter on his outings.\n''I met him at 17, married him at 22 and never looked back,'' said his wife, Virginia. ''He listened to people. He was a wonderful boss. He loved the Yankees. The rest of it is he and his daughter, the center of his world.''\nMrs. Strauch said that Mr. Strauch taught their daughter, Hilary, 12, to play golf so they could play together. He also coached her school basketball team.\nTom Kenny, the friend who called Mr. Strauch regular and great, said that Hilary's birth after 15 years of marriage completed Mr. Strauch's life. He already had career success, a good marriage, his sports. He brought the same intensity to being a father that he brought to everything else. ''Whatever he got into, he got into it all the way,'' Mr. Kenny said.\nROBERT NAGEL\nHistory and Sci-Fi Buff\nHis wife used to tease Robert Nagel that he never watched a television channel below the number 13. He could not stand commercials, and therefore commercial television.\nInstead, he watched black-and-white movies on cable (though the spread of commercials to cable did not please him), and he was faithful to the History Channel, no matter what was on it. His wife, Janet, has not been able to bring herself to watch that channel since Sept. 11.\nLieutenant Nagel, a member of Engine Company 58, lived in Manhattan with his wife and their daughter, Bridget. The other thing that captivated him was science fiction; hundreds of science-fiction books were spread around the house.\nHe was the type of person who let people know what was on his mind. He was blunt. He was opinionated. ''He didn't like things to be bottled up,'' Mrs. Nagel said.\nHe could discourse at considerable length on almost any subject. It was not unknown for his monologues to well exceed the listening patience of his friends. When he sensed a distinct waning of interest, he would quickly inject the phrase, ''and furthermore,'' and then stop talking. It became his little joke. Sometimes, someone would say something and he would interject, ''and furthermore,'' and then immediately clam up. Those who knew him just chuckled, and so did he.\nSUSAN SAUER\nAn Inveterate Traveler\nSusan Sauer set goals for herself, and that applied to her wanderlust. She decided that she was going to visit 50 countries by the time she turned 50. That meant by November of this year. By her count, she had been to 48 as of last summer.\nAnd an itinerary was in hand for a trip last fall that would have put her over the top. Her good friend, Clare Doyle, had to admit it was perhaps the wackiest itinerary she had ever heard of, but it did the job. Ms. Sauer was going to fulfill one dream by attending cooking school in Italy, a country she had already been to, then was going to stop for one day in Hungary, which would be No. 49, before winding up in Wales, No. 50.\nMs. Doyle teased her about whether Wales, being part of the United Kingdom, could rightfully count as a separate country, but she pointed out that Ms. Sauer had been to Czechoslovakia when it was one country, so maybe the math was O.K.\nMs. Sauer, a managing director at Marsh Inc., lived in Chicago and was attending a meeting at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. She had five nephews, whom she adored and treated as the perfect aunt would. A new interest was golf, which she had taken up a couple of years ago, in part because one nephew was in college on a golf scholarship. She was planning to participate in a golf trip to the Dominican Republic this month, and by then who knew how many countries she would have been up to.\nSIMON MADDISON\nKept His British Habits\nSimon Maddison liked his marmite. He was British, and it was not easy to find the spread -- which is made from yeast -- in America, so he carried his own jar.\nIt was one of the routines his wife, Maureen, found so endearing. He kept a jar at her parents' house. He kept a jar at her parents' shore house. He carried a jar on vacations. One thing must be clear: she liked his habit, but she hated marmite. It's an acquired taste and smell, and she never acquired it. ''It's gross.'' she said.\nMr. Maddison, 40, a software consultant for the eSpeed division of Cantor Fitzgerald, lived in Florham Park, N.J., making sure not to wake his wife when he left at 6 a.m., and making sure he got home in time to play with his three children before their bedtime. Their favorite game was ''sandwich,'' with pillows as the bread and the children as the ingredients.\nMrs. Maddison sees traces of her husband in the children. Caileigh, 7, has his sense of humor; Kyle, 4, his enormous heart; Sydney, 1, his unwavering determination.\nThey also have picked up some British expressions. They say ''serviette'' instead of ''napkin,'' ''boot'' for the trunk of the car. If Kyle said he was going to play with his trucks, Mr. Maddison would correct him: ''No, you're going to play with your lorries.''\nAll three children have also acquired his fondness for marmite. Holding her nose, Mrs. Maddison spreads it over their toast and bagels. She'll never remove it from the house. ''Actually,'' she said, ''it sort of smells better now.''\nFAINA RAPOPORT\nA Grateful Refugee\nFaina Rapoport carried a mental portrait of New York City for years. It was a means of survival while she and her family waited to hear from the United States government about whether they qualified for the refugee program. Her family, Jews from Moscow, wanted to escape religious persecution.\nIn 1994, New York City was no longer a painting in the gallery of Mrs. Rapoport's mind. It became real -- the family received refugee status. They were free to worship as they pleased.\nThey settled in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, a bustling Russian Jewish community near Coney Island.\nMrs. Rapoport, a computer programmer, studied English, while her husband, Yuriy, a civil engineer, became a construction inspector.Their children, Alex, 25, and Elena, 19, attended school.\nSoon Mrs. Rapoport, 45, learned enough English to pursue a job. Eventually, she became a computer programmer at Accenture at the World Trade Center. Her salary helped buy a condominium near the beach.\nThe job also let her see two things in her mental portrait of the city: Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. ''I know my mother is still happy about coming to America,'' Elena Rapoport said. ''She accomplished things that she never would have been able to do in Russia. No one misses Russia.''\nTHOMAS PEDICINI\nAttached to His Guitar\nThomas Pedicini never strayed too far from a guitar. His brother-in-law Raymond Morace's earliest recollection of him is as ''a skinny 13-year-old kid jumping around his room playing air guitar'' to Van Halen. In his mother's last memory of him, he is teaching his 11-year-old cousin how to play, a few days before his death.\nIn between, Mr. Pedicini, 30, an easygoing sort and seemingly effortless golfer, studied business and had been working as a trader at Cantor Fitzgerald since 1998, a job he got through another brother-in-law, Mark Colaio, who died with him.\nAfter Sept. 11, in Mr. Pedicini's apartment in Woodside, Queens, one of his roommates found a tape of him strumming and singing his way through some of his favorite tunes. ''He was too shy even to show it to me, but I could hear him in there singing and playing so I knew he was up to doing something,'' said the roommate, Jordan Zed. He gave the tape to Mr. Pedicini's parents. More musical memories.\nBut Mr. Zed remembers Mr. Pedicini mostly as a decent human being whose life was going somewhere. ''You'd sit around and talk about where you see yourself in five years,'' he said. ''He had dreams and goals. He wanted to eventually find the right girl and settle down and have a family and work his way up in the firm. It seems so sad.''\nROBERT CRAWFORD\nModest, Helpful, 'Great'\nJennifer Eppolito has dozens of reasons to call her father, Robert Crawford, great: he would stand outside Brooklyn churches in all kinds of weather, selling raffle tickets to benefit St. Rose's Home, a cancer hospital. When he was honored for his work, he would not want to be in any photographs.\nHe told her, when she was little, ''It's more important to listen to what people are saying than it is always to talk.''\nHe was a firefighter for 32 1/2 years.\n''You could ask him about anything, like how does a refrigerator work, and he would be able to sit there and put it into pieces you would understand,'' she said.\nWhen Mrs. Eppolito's daughter, Alexandra, was born, Mr. Crawford took flowers in a vase with the Virgin Mary on it. He taught Alexandra her address by the time she was 2. He called her Poo Poo, and at 62, played Barbies with her.\n''To describe my father as great, that's not even a good enough word,'' Mrs. Eppolito said. ''I was lucky for him to be my father. There is no other man that, in my eyes, could stand up to him.''\nJOHN MURRAY\nVery Much in Charge\nIt was in character, the way John Murray came down to the Sky Lobby and then went back upstairs to help get people out of the building, Joe Sacco said of his boss, whom everyone knew as Jack.\nMr. Murray, who ran corporate services for the Industrial Bank of Japan, was in charge of facilities, purchasing, security and communications, among other things. ''He was running the properties for the bank,'' Mr. Sacco said. ''He would've always been the last person out, to make sure everyone else got out. He was very serious about those issues.''\nMr. Murray, 52, was also a key person in the bank's disaster recovery team, and one of the leaders of the business contingency committee. ''Because he was so good at managing, he had everything set up so we could follow the plans,'' Mr. Sacco said. ''His departments were able to do what they needed to because of his leadership.''\nMr. Murray, who had one son, John, had a particular laugh, said his wife of 28 years, Patricia. That laugh would have come in handy when the bank was trying to recover from Sept. 11. ''Life goes on, the way he would've wanted it,'' Mr. Sacco said. ''He set up for this.''\nMARIE PAPPALARDO\nProtector of Cats\nMarie Pappalardo's passions were deep and varied. Once, with a friend, she finagled her way into the stall of Affirmed, the Triple Crown-winning racehorse, and hugged him. ''Because he always ran with such love, and he was strong, he was something she always loved,'' said Ms. Pappalardo's daughter, Maria Koutny.\nShe was profoundly devoted to the Feast of the Three Saints, celebrated on Labor Day weekend at her home church, the Holy Rosary in Lawrence, Mass. When she neared the end of her pregnancy and was told that her daughter would be born that Sunday, she said she would not give birth until she had been to the feast. And she was right.\nMs. Pappalardo, 53, who was returning home to Paramount, Calif., on Flight 175 after visiting the Boston area -- for the feast and Ms. Koutny's birthday -- was also a devoted protector of cats, catching wild ones and taking them to her vet for shots and spaying.\n''She made a hole in her garage so they could come in and eat and get out,'' Ms. Koutny said. ''One was Goofy, one was Daisy, one was Minnie, they all had those kinds of names. Hopefully the person living there now is still feeding the feral cats.''\nPATRICIA KURAS\nDevoted Daughter\n''My brother and I try to fill the gap she left behind, but it's just not the same,'' Tom Kuras said of his sister, Patricia Kuras, a 43-year-old facilities manager for Marsh & McLennan. ''She always put herself second, so that the family's needs came first.''\nSo no one was surprised by what happened five years ago when Ms. Kuras's mother had a stroke. Without being asked, she sold her beloved little red Nissan sports car and the quaint house in Brooklyn that she had just remodeled. In the Grant City section of Staten Island, Ms. Kuras bought a smaller home to share with her mother. She took the basement while her mother and a live-in nurse occupied the rest of the house.\n''She gave so much of herself,'' Mr. Kuras said of his younger sister. ''She lived for my mother.''\nMs. Kuras's body has yet to be recovered. But in January, searchers delivered a small bit of closure to her family: her mother's insurance cards. She carried them everywhere.\nDARYA LIN\nStayed Behind to Help\nDarya Lin was not easy to rattle. Growing up in Iran in the early 1980's near a border under heavy bombardment by Iraq, she nevertheless had a ''very, very healthy childhood,'' said her mother, Nahid Mashayekhi Lin. ''She never had any fear or any bad memories.''\nSo it makes sense to her friends and family that on Sept. 11 Ms. Lin, a 32-year-old senior manager with Keane Consulting Group who was advising clients that day at Aon, stayed on the 78th floor to help a pregnant client while others in her group ran downstairs to safety.\nBut Ms. Lin was also aware of her mortality. Over the summer, when she returned a pair of running shoes she had borrowed from her mother, one of them had a note with her name and personal information inside. ''She said, 'Yeah, mommy, because when people die, the first place they look is in their shoes.' ''\nMs. Lin, whose father is Burmese, moved with her parents to Ann Arbor, Mich., when she was 11; as an adult she traveled in Europe and the United States, eventually settling in Chicago. She never returned to Iran, but kept up with the language and was considering a return visit with her mother. ''She had very good handwriting in Persian and she used to write me in Persian,'' her mother said. ''In her letters, she would thank us for everything we'd done.''\nMICHAEL J. ARMSTRONG\nCounselor Without Portfolio\nMichael J. Armstrong had an uncanny way of looking people deep in the eyes and telling them things that stuck with them, that sometimes changed their lives.\nThere was the confused, rambling Grateful Dead fan he met on a train in 1993, who was hooked on drugs and on the run from his parents.\nThe young man wrote Mr. Armstrong a letter shortly after their meeting that Mr. Armstrong's family found in a drawer when they cleaned out his Upper East Side apartment after Sept. 11.\n''After talking to you,'' the letter said, ''I've worked everything out with my parents and will be returning to work for them and continuing a drug-free life. I have positive goals but I almost threw them away. I just want to thank you for helping me.''\nThere was the man from the Upper East Side who served time in prison. When he got out, he was shunned by most people; Mr. Armstrong went out of his way to talk to him, to make him feel welcome.\n''Since Sept. 11, we've realized what a great impact he's had on people's lives,'' said Catherine M. Nolan, whom Mr. Armstrong, 34, a vice president of sales at Cantor Fitzgerald, was to marry on Oct. 6."}, {"text": "A NATION CHALLENGED; Qaeda's Grocery Lists And Manuals of Killing\n2002-03-17T05:00:00.000Z\nOn Aug. 17, 1995, Amir Maawia Siddiqi, the son of a bookshop owner in a small village in Pakistan, set down his oath of allegiance to the jihad.\n''I, Amir Maawia Siddiqi, son of Abdul Rahman Siddiqi, state in the presence of God that I will slaughter infidels my entire life,'' he wrote. ''And with the will of God I will do these killings in the supervision and guidance with Harkat ul-Ansar.''\nHe accepted a code name, Abu Rashid, signed his name and concluded, ''May God give me strength in fulfilling this oath.''\nThe oath, found in a house in Kabul used by a Pakistani Islamist group, was part of an extensive paper record that fleeing Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters left behind last fall at sites across Afghanistan. Reporters for The New York Times collected over 5,000 pages of documents from abandoned safe houses and training camps destroyed by bombs.\nIt is a rare collection, the raw, unmediated stuff of the jihadis' lives. Individually, the documents are shards -- as mundane as a grocery list and as chilling as notes for the proper positioning of a truck bomb. But taken together, they tell a rich inside story of the network of radical Islamic groups that Osama bin Laden helped assemble in Afghanistan.\nThe documents show that the training camps, which the Bush administration has described as factories churning out terrorists, were instead focused largely on creating an army to support the Taliban, which was waging a long ground war against the Northern Alliance.\nAn estimated 20,000 recruits passed through roughly a dozen training camps since 1996, when Mr. bin Laden established his base of operations in Afghanistan, American officials say. Most received basic infantry training that covered the use of various small arms, as well as antiarmor and antiaircraft weapons and, in some cases, basic demolition, the documents show.\n''The vast majority of them were cannon fodder,'' a United States government official said.\nA smaller group of recruits was selected for elite training that appeared to prepare them for terrorist actions abroad. ''Observing foreign embassies and facilities,'' was the subject of one Qaeda espionage course. Another taught ''shooting the personality and his guard from a motorcycle.''\nAbove all, the documents show how far Mr. bin Laden progressed in realizing his central vision: joining Muslim militants, energized by local causes, into a global army aimed at the West. From the mid-1990's on, recruits came to Afghanistan from more than 20 countries, as varied as Iraq and Malaysia, Somalia and Britain.\nThe young men arrived in Afghanistan under the auspices of several different militant groups, each of which ran training camps. But once there, they received strikingly similar courses of religious indoctrination and military training. Parts of the same Arabic-language terrorist manual were found in houses of three of those groups: Al Qaeda, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and Harkat ul-Ansar, the Pakistani group that changed its name to Harkat ul-Mujahadeen and has been linked to the killing of the American journalist Daniel Pearl.\nCommingled under that umbrella was a mix of spoken and written languages; in the documents translated by The Times, there were more than half a dozen: Arabic, Urdu, Tajik, Dari, Pashto, Uzbek and Russian. A few documents were in English.\nThis community of militants had progressed so far that it took on the feel of a bureaucracy. There were forms to keep track of ammunition, spending and more. Al Qaeda commanders, like middle managers everywhere, griped about the bosses. In one letter, a commander commiserated with another about their boss's lack of support, and tried to bolster his friend's flagging morale, reminding him, ''Jihad is, by definition, surrounded by difficulties.''\nReporters came upon the documents in musty basements and yards strewn with trash and grenades and mines. Some were streaked with mud, others partly burned. They hardly present a complete picture of Al Qaeda. They show no specific plans for terror operations abroad, and while hinting at an ambition to use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, they contain no evidence that the groups possess them.\nThey are a decidedly eclectic amalgam. In a house used by the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, an Islamist publication inveighed against ''the phenomena of the Beatles and the hippies,'' which had ''caused a great danger against the security of America and Europe.'' A National Rifle Association target was found in a Harkat house in Kabul. A few miles away, in a Qaeda house, a sign implored, ''My brother the mujahid, my brother the visitor, please keep the guest house clean.''\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9s of Holy Warriors\nThe letter, dated Feb. 26, 1995, was addressed to ''respected emir for ministry of ammunition'' and it announced the arrival at a Harkat safe house of another recruit.\n''Brother, Muhammad Afzal, who is with this letter, is coming for the training,'' said the letter from a Harkat official in Pakistan. ''He is master in karate. You can try to take full advantage of him, very hard-working fellow. Blessings to all other fellows.''\nThroughout the late 1990's, young men streamed through the Khyber Pass and on to dusty training camps operated by Al Qaeda and other Islamic radical groups. Many carried letters of introduction as proof of their trustworthiness.\nLists found in houses around Afghanistan show that the men came from countries in the Islamic world and beyond: Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Bosnia, Bangladesh, China, the Philippines, Russia, Britain, Canada and the United States.\nThe imported military force turned middle-class homes in Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kandahar and other cities into headquarters and guest houses, crammed with recruits. Derelict Afghan military bases and fallow fields became training grounds.\nA variety of documents, mostly handwritten, offer glimpses of the young men, and of what drew them to the jihad. One document, found in a Kabul house used by Harkat, contains short biographical sketches of 39 recruits. They were all unmarried. Few had gone beyond secondary school. But quite a few, the interviewers noted, had studied the Koran. Several had previously been connected to fundamentalist groups at home. Many, it appears, were asked if their parents had given them permission to join the jihad. Twelve, the document noted, had permission. Fifteen did not.\nThe list gave this information about a man with the code name Sultan Sajid: ''Son of Mr. Muhammad Anwar, owner of sweet store. Age: 18 years. Status: Unmarried. Education: Matriculate and learned Koran by translation. Knows how to make sweets, and can hunt birds and fish. Five brothers and four sisters. Address: Kamoke District Gujranwala, at Saboki dandian. Got permission from home happily.''\nOf a man code-named Hafiz Abu Muhammad, the document says: ''Education: Matriculate, memorized Koran. Knows how to embroider. Served in military for three and a half years. He is fond of jihad; that is why he came to us.''\nSixteen-year-old Hafiz Muhammad Arif was the son of a customs officer and had five brothers and four sisters, one in medical school. ''No permission from home,'' the list says. ''His [family] wanted to send him to America. Impressed by the speech of Mr. Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman Khalil,'' Harkat's leader.\nAcross Kabul, near the Intercontinental Hotel, an ornate, two-story home with a fireplace in the living room had been converted into a Qaeda safe house. There, the lists revealed less personal information; code names were primarily used. But they did record the weapons the men carried.\nA man from Yemen, code-named Abu Labath, was armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle and three hand grenades. He arrived on May 7, 1999. Abu Qatada al-Madani, a code name suggesting he came from the Saudi city of Medina, arrived on Nov. 29, 1998, armed with a Kalashnikov, an ammunition pouch and hand grenades. He had memorized through the ''second part'' of the Koran and completed ''half of the foundational course.''\nAfghanistan was the embodiment of Mr. bin Laden's vision of a global jihad. Radical leaders and foot soldiers met there, networked and bonded, sharing military tactics and religious tracts. The abandoned houses and camps were strewn with inspirational pamphlets, books, videos and CD's, all sounding the call to arms. Central to their message was the re-establishment of the Caliphate, the era of Islam's ascendancy after the death of Muhammad in the eighth century.\nThe Caliphate ''is the only and best solution to the predicaments and problems from which Muslims suffer today and indubitable cure to the turbulence and internal struggles that plague them,'' said one English-language treatise. ''It will remedy the economic underdevelopment which bequeathed upon us a political dependence on an atheist East and infidel West.''\nThere was a publication for every count in Mr. bin Laden's indictment of the West.\nThe cover of a magazine called The Window shows a woman weeping as a cobra bearing the Star of David looms over Muslim protesters at the Dome of the Rock, the holy Islamic site in Jerusalem. A pamphlet with an American soldier superimposed over the holy city of Mecca urges readers, ''Fight until there is no discord and all of religion is for God.'' A yellow paperback book, ''Announcement of Jihad Against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Holy Places,'' shows a map of Saudi Arabia encircled by American, French and British flags. Its author was ''Sheik Osama bin Laden.''\nDiverse Muslim groups joined Mr. bin Laden's global jihad. Sometimes, they also came seeking help in pressing their own causes back home.\nIn a Qaeda house in Kabul, there was a public statement from the ''Islamic Battalion, Kurdistan, Iraq,'' dated Nov. 20, 1999, calling on ''the movement for Islamic unity'' to help in the jihad against President Saddam Hussein. There was also a handwritten letter to Mr. bin Laden from an unidentified Russian who said his group needed training for two attacks in Russia.\nHarkat members fought alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan, but their true obsession was India's control of the disputed territory of Kashmir. In the moldering basement of the group's Kabul house, amid rocket-propelled grenades, ammunition boxes and land mines, sat boxes of glossy green labels for a recruiting cassette featuring ''sermons of distinguished Muslim scholars'' and ''jihadi poems.''\nFighters from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan had a different agenda: installing an Islamic government in Uzbekistan, and ultimately uniting Central Asia and Xinjiang, a predominantly Muslim region of western China, into an sprawling Islamic theocracy called Turkestan.\n''All the Muslim people of Turkestan have lost their patience and have chosen the holy road to emigration for preparing for jihad-in-the-way-of-God,'' said a flier found in the headquarters of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan in Mazar-i-Sharif. ''Thank God that all these new immigrants have completed jihad training and are prepared for practical jihad.''\nPush-Ups and Sit-Ups\nA sprawling training camp in the serene farming village of Rishkhor, 20 miles south of Kabul, is mostly rubble now. Walls are still painted with Koranic verses and slogans invoking the jihad. ''All the Christians, Jews and infidels have joined hands against Afghanistan,'' one poster begins. Bombing by American fighters last fall destroyed all but two of the dozen or so buildings and turned fields into a landscape of craters. The ground is littered with unexploded mines and unspent ammunition. Everywhere there is paper.\nDocuments from Rishkhor -- where Afghans, Pakistanis and Arabs trained -- along with records, notebooks and manuals found elsewhere in Afghanistan, show that recruits received the kind of regimented, demanding basic training that infantry soldiers get in much of the world, but with steady infusions of Islamic fervor. This is reflected in the ''Rules for the Day'' found at a Harkat house. It declares:\n''Follow all Islamic principles.\n''Pray five times a day.\n''Punctual for food.\n''No ammunition training without the permission of the teacher.\n''Cleanliness.\n''Clean beds and tents once a week.\n''Clean the environment.\n''Do not leave compound.\n''No political discussions.\n''No arguments.\n''No drugs.\n''Go to bed early.''\nPhysical training began at 6 a.m., according to a schedule found at the house. Calisthenics performance was scrupulously monitored. One morning, a recruit named Abu Turab led his class of 38, knocking off 45 push-ups and 40 sit-ups and crawling 25 meters in 21 seconds, according to a chart.\nAbu Rashid was in the middle of the pack, with 30 push-ups, 30 sit-ups and 35 seconds in the crawl. Even injured men took part. Abu Hanza, who the chart noted had a wounded hand, and Asad Ullah, with a wounded leg, did 30 sit-ups each and crawled 25 yards in 23 seconds. (They skipped push-ups.)\nOthers struggled to make the grade. Saif Ullah took a full 60 seconds to crawl those 25 yards. Others labored to complete a group run. Khalid was ''slightly behind,'' Abdullah ''cannot run along,'' and Asad Ullah ''stopped three times,'' according to the chart. Tipu Sultan appeared to be the worst of all, managing only 11 push-ups and 10 sit-ups and skipping the group run. His name was scratched off the list.\nAfter their workout, recruits took a break, presumably for breakfast, and returned for basic infantry classes from 8:30 to 9:10, 9:15 to 10:40 and 11:10 to 12:35. After lunch and prayers, the afternoon was for Koran study, sports and lectures. Students answered essay questions. ''It is not easy to write on martyrs such as these,'' one said in answering a question on the lives of the great Muslim martyrs. ''The pen does not give them their due.''\nClasses at the different camps followed the same basic infantry lesson plan. A training notebook from a recruit named Muhammad Rashid Arghany moved through the use of the Kalashnikov, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, map reading and celestial navigation. The course was highly detailed, and the recruit appears to have taken handwritten notes every step of the way.\nMilitary instruction drew on religious doctrine. ''Without a sign from the leader you should not retreat,'' read the notes of a student in a class on ambush tactics. ''Because the Koran says: 'Do not retreat, but stay steady; in time of war there is no death. My only power is the power of Allah.' ''\nThe instructor emphasized the importance for gunmen to remain completely still while laying in wait. ''This is very difficult work, and therefore in order to save oneself from melancholy, and selfishness and confusion, you must remain in prayer and meditation on Allah,'' the class notes say.\nThe notebook goes on to describe how to carry out a coordinated infantry assault, a carefully timed maneuver in which infantrymen advance while support troops on their flank fire directly in front of them. If the timing is off, the advancing soldiers can be killed by the fire of their comrades.\n''If he is hit by their own bullets or if the enemy's fire becomes intense, do not become upset, but do your work with patience and care,'' the notes say. The lecturer explained that a soldier killed by his own forces would still be considered a ''shahid,'' or martyr, and be granted immediate entrance to heaven.\nLike any army, though admittedly with its own religious and political vernacular, the jihadi network was constantly indoctrinating and building esprit de corps. A quick summary of the ''Goals and Objectives of Jihad'' was found in a Qaeda house:\n''1. Establishing the rule of God on earth.\n''2. Attaining martyrdom in the cause of God.\n''3. Purification of the ranks of Islam from the elements of depravity.''\nAnother document described the two ''illegitimate excuses for leaving Jihad'' -- ''love of the world'' and ''hatred of death.''\nThe Qaeda Media Committee made sure past victories were remembered. A flier from one guest house advertised a screening of a new film, ''The Destruction of the American Destroyer Cole.''\n''Please let us know your comments and suggestions,'' the committee wrote.\nOther notebooks depicted an entirely different type of training: espionage and explosives classes, perhaps for more advanced recruits or those headed to terror cells abroad. (Ahmed Ressam, a Qaeda member convicted of plotting to blow up Los Angeles International Airport during millennium celebrations, testified at a trial in New York last year that he first attended a basic infantry camp and then received advanced training.)\nAn espionage class notebook, written in neat Arabic but not signed, had the following headings: ''How to use a code, security of operations, security plan, intelligence, intelligence gathering, surveillance, methods of communication, methods of opening envelopes, persuasion, planning for intelligence operations, recruitment, managing assets, choosing an asset.''\n''Persuasion,'' for instance, involved ''obtaining information from a person through conversations with him without his realizing the importance of what he is saying.''\nThere were step-by-step instructions on surveillance: ''Get complete description of person, his habits, his daily errands, his children and his wife, his standing in the community, his skills and educational goals, his income, when he wakes, the best times for inspecting his house, places he goes regularly.''\nAn Arabic-language explosives curriculum found in the Harkat house gave detailed instructions on how to make and handle a range of substances: nitroglycerin, HMDT, RDX, C-4, C-3, dynamite and ammonium nitrate.\nA final section dealt with ''major poisons and poison gasses,'' which ''can be extracted in various ways, and we shall, God willing, review these various ways later.'' The document listed the toxins -- including ricin, botulism and cyanide -- and described how to manufacture and use them.\nThere were syllabuses for a variety of advanced classes. For one class, a Harkat document listed these ''standards to be achieved'':\n''1. Follow the armed person, and kill him quietly.\n''2. To be able to patrol closely.\n''3. To penetrate at enemy positions with expertise.''\nAnother Harkat class, this one 65 days long, involved instruction in such matters as ''hit teams'' and ''hijacking of air, bus, ship.'' For yet another, the fourth item on the syllabus was ''Movie, 'Great Escape.' ''\nAmong the students at one elite 10-day program was a Qaeda recruit named Atta al-Azdi. On his first day, a Sunday, he learned ''shooting the personality and his guard from a motorcycle,'' his class schedule shows. On Monday, he moved along to ''shooting at two targets in a car from above, front and back.''\nThe training, which included strict limits on the range and number of bullets he could use, wound up with lessons in ''killing personality using R.P.G.,'' a rocket-propelled grenade, and ''killing personality and guards from car.''\nAn instructor scribbled a one-word evaluation of Mr. Azdi's performance during the final two sessions: ''Good.''\nBureaucracy and Paperwork\nBehind the sprawling network of camps lay an extensive bureaucracy. And like every bureaucracy, it churned out paper: expense forms, finance notebooks, computer parts inventories, lists of rented houses.\n''Twenty-Second Jihad Division -- Kabul Front'' had its own forms for tracking soldiers and expenses, with the name of its commander, ''Abdul Wakil from Somalia,'' printed in the lower left-hand corner. ''Al Qaeda Ammunition Warehouse'' forms kept an inventory of weapons and munitions.\nOfficials were hounded to monitor spending. In a testy note dated June 19, 2001, a Qaeda official named Abdel Hadi el-Ansary wrote to a colleague, ''El Shaikh Abu Abdalla had personally emphasized for the second time the necessity of absolutely sending the budget expenditure tables.''\nEven the most common expenditures were recorded. ''Bread, vegetables, cooking oil, medicines,'' one expense form read. ''Potatoes, onions, tea, rice,'' read another. One document accounted for an assistant chef's salary of $20 a month.\nThere were even inventories of martyrs. A computer-generated list found in the Harkat house enumerated each man's ''time of death,'' ''place of death,'' ''cause of death,'' ''where buried,'' and ''number of grave.''\nThe groups even produced organizational guidelines, including a 28-page Arabic-language document, ''Forming Military Units at the Behest of the Ministry of Jihad,'' found in a Qaeda house.\nOne page devoted to command structure listed three divisions under the ''executive officer'': ''administrative affairs,'' ''personnel issues'' and ''social work.'' It went on to enumerate various administrative responsibilities, including ''monitoring young men,'' ''attention to administrative affairs of brothers staying for periods of longer than six months,'' and ''undertaking basic services -- food, cleaning clothes, making sure meals are served on time.''\nAnother page showed how to set up a camp for a battalion of soldiers, with a diagram showing placement of the entrance gate, sleeping quarters, ammunition warehouse, water tank, mosque and headquarters. The camp, the document said, ''is like a beehive,'' where soldiers should ''check and maintain their weapons,'' ''train for combat,'' receive ''moral guidance'' and have ''pure, clean competitions between the various units for excellence.''\nThere were equipment specifications. Each ''mujahid,'' according to a Harkat document, should get ''uniform, boots, army belt, hat, handkerchief, flashlight, batteries, soap, pencil, jackets, gloves, medicines.''\nMr. bin Laden, who has effectively used the media to fashion an image and spread his message, was also quite interested in what the press was saying about him and his cause. The March 2001 issue of the Qaeda Media Committee's monthly press packet included news articles culled from the Internet with these headlines:\n''Taliban Halt Production of Opium.''\n''Belgian Intelligence Service Stops Bin Laden Smuggling of Russian Missiles.''\n''Jordan: 9 Indictments Against 2 Leaders of Bin Laden's Organization.''\n''Taliban Execute 2 Women Accused of Prostitution.''\nUnder a headline that read ''American State Department: Israel Used Excessive Force'' was a picture of a Israeli soldier picking up the body of an Arab man. The soldier resembled former Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel. Under the picture was a note: ''Barak murdering a Muslim.''\nIf the jihadi army operated like other organizations, it also displayed much of the usual internal bickering.\nRecruits complained about their instructors. ''Thank God for the opportunity to take this course,'' a recruit named Rami wrote in what appeared to be an evaluation of one of his classes. But then he pointed out that ''I'm not sure about the requirements of this course, since the trainer pressures the trainees and stresses their nerves.''\nCommanders griped about their bosses. In an Aug. 27, 2001, letter, a commander named Abd al-Hadi al-Ansari commiserated with a colleague, Abd al-Wakil, about how their superior did not support them. He said he had noticed a recent loss of morale in Mr. Wakil and counseled him on how to navigate the frustrations of the bureaucracy.\n''Don't let anyone put pressure on you. Don't accept an assignment you cannot implement,'' he wrote. ''Whenever you are given a new assignment, try to create your own team and never choose brothers that are older than you.''\nEven the big bosses carped.\n''I think that there are no more people who truly trust in good any more,'' said a memo dated June 15, 1998, from a Qaeda house. ''Everyone has trained his followers so that they are only concerned about their own status, name and rank, that they have forgotten everything about following orders and respecting their main leader.''\nIt was signed ''the servant of Islam Mullah Muhammad Omar.''\nChain of Command\nMr. bin Laden's dream took shape on the desolate Shamali Plain, a broad plateau just north of Kabul where years of trench warfare have turned a belt of vineyards into a maze of wilted vines and jagged stumps. Hundreds of young Muslim men who came from around the world for indoctrination and training in Afghanistan were sent to the front to fight for the Taliban in a grinding war with the Northern Alliance.\nDefending the Taliban's hold on Afghanistan was the primary mission of the jihad, and Northern Alliance soldiers spoke with awe of the willingness of Arabs, Pakistanis and other volunteers to die for the cause.\nMr. bin Laden, in a long dispatch to the Muslim faithful found in a house used by Al Qaeda in Kabul, urged them to recognize Mullah Omar, the head of the Taliban, as ''the leader of the faithful.''\nBut for many fighters, the deepest inspiration was Mr. bin Laden himself.\nIn a handwritten Arabic letter from the trenches north of Kabul, a commander named Oma al-Adani described a dream ''one of the brothers'' had about Mr. bin Laden. ''I was in my bedroom, and I saw the Prophet Muhammad,'' he wrote. ''He looked to his left and saw Fahd, the king of Saudi Arabia, and said, 'Those are not from me, and I am not from them.' ''\n''Then he walked and saw Sheik Osama and the martyrs,'' a reference to Mr. bin Laden and his followers, ''and said, 'Those are from me, and I am of them.' ''\nThe machinery that Mr. bin Laden had assembled answered his call to defend the Taliban. Ledgers, notebooks and letters found in houses used by Al Qaeda and Harkat detailed the movement of soldiers to units stationed north of Kabul. A notebook entitled ''Kabul front'' and written in Arabic appeared to record fighters sent to the front: Bilal, 20, who went to Afghanistan in 1998, and Amir, 23, who arrived in 2000.\nLeft behind in the trenches of the Shamali Plain are crumpled scraps of paper that reflect the diversity of fighters Mr. bin Laden had drawn to the jihad. In one bunker, Lufti, an Arab recruit, left a note written by two friends, imploring, ''Don't forget us in your prayers while you're gone.'' Pakistani newspapers and cassettes with sermons by radical Pakistani clerics were found a few hundreds yards away. A pay stub for a young Pakistani man named Ahmad Bakhtair lay on the ground outside one bunker. His job title was ''helper,'' according to the stub, and his net salary in May 2001 was 2,655 rupees, or roughly $40.\nIn another trench, a volunteer left another scrap: a page from Newsday, the Long Island newspaper, dated April 19, 2001.\nToday, the young men of Mr. bin Laden's jihad are again in combat, this time against American troops.\nThe end of their story has not yet been written, but the words of a Harkat recruit who fought against the Northern Alliance in an earlier battle may suggest one.\n''I was wounded,'' he wrote in a diary found in a Harkat house. ''Out of four of us, three of us were wounded and the fourth one, Brother Muhammad Siddiq, was martyred. . . . We were taken to the hospital, and there we said farewell to Brother Siddiq. We three are still in search of our home.''\nThe Jihad Files\nFuture articles will further examine documents left behind in Afghanistan by Islamic militants."}, {"text": "THE NEW SEASON/THEATER; Beckett and Brecht And Carol Burnett\n2002-09-08T05:00:00.000Z\nSeptember\nTHREE-CORNERED MOON -- Last year at this time, the director Carl Forsman and his tiny Keen Company gave us a charming restaging of John van Druten's 1943 play about wartime sexual mores, ''The Voice of the Turtle.''
