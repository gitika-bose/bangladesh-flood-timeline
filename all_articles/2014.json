[{"text": "The Floating Gardens of Bangladesh\n2014-11-18T15:25:47.000Z\nCHARBHANGURA, Bangladesh \u2014 Each year the brown waters of the Gumani river swell during the summer monsoon, creeping over the surrounding fields to flood Charbhangura, a village of 2,500 people in the Pabna district of northwest Bangladesh.\nFrom July to October the waters can rise at least 10 feet. The trunks of trees more than 30 feet away from the dry season riverbed show watermarks waist high. When the fields flood, the village\u2019s farmers have no work.\n\u201cThere is water all around,\u201d said Hafiza Khatun, 25, a mother of two whose family income used to vanish for six months of the year when her farm laborer husband had nothing to do. \u201cThere was no happiness.\u201d \nBut three years ago, Ms. Khatun was trained by Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha, a Bangladeshi nonprofit organization, to tend an unusual source of food and income: a floating farm with a duck coop, fish enclosures and vegetable garden moored by rope to the riverbank.\nFive to 10 women can share the structure, splitting about 130,000 taka, or about $1,700, a year. Shidhulai supplies seeds, fish and duck feed and other materials that cost about 10,000 taka. \nThis money goes a long way in rural Bangladesh, especially for villagers struggling to survive. Ms. Khatun, who has no education and bore the first of her two children when she was 15, previously earned nothing.\nClimate change threatens to worsen the severity and duration of floods in low-lying Bangladesh. \nFloating farms \u2014 and produce that can flourish in flood conditions \u2014 are a way to help Bangladeshis live with rising waters.\n\u201cThere is big demand for solutions for climate change-affected areas,\u201d said Mohammed Rezwan, the founder and executive director of Shidhulai.\nWith the extra income from selling eggs, fish and vegetables, Ms. Khatun started saving money in a bank for the first time, bought a bed to keep her and her family off wet ground in their dirt-floored home, and helps her husband support the family. \nDucks quacked loudly as Ms. Khatun gathered eggs in the coop, ushering some of them outside to the \u201cduck run,\u201d a stretch of water between fish enclosures. She had never raised ducks or fish before the training, Ms. Khatun said, but \u201cnothing has been very difficult.\u201d\nIn northern Bangladesh, agricultural land is regularly flooded as rivers are engorged by the annual Himalayan snow melt and monsoon rains. In one of the world\u2019s most densely populated countries, where 156 million people live in an area the size of Iowa, thousands are left with no way to earn a living. Many migrate to already overcrowded cities, contributing to urban blight.\nMr. Rezwan founded Shidhulai as a 22-year-old architecture graduate in 1998. That year, disastrous flooding in Bangladesh killed 700 people and left 21 million homeless. \nInitially, Mr. Rezwan focused on building schools on boats, and worked to ensure that thousands of children would not fall behind when roads were blocked by floodwaters. \nTo date, the nonprofit\u2019s fleet, which now numbers 22 schools, five health clinics and 10 libraries, has provided continuity of education and other services for more than 70,000 children in villages isolated by seasonal floods.\nFour years ago it started to also build floating farms for villagers, and particularly the landless poor, to help them eke out a living during the months of floods.\nSo far there are 40 floating farms that are worked by about 300 women: Mr. Rezwan has ambitious plans to create 400, to serve 3,000 women and their families in the next few years.\nHe also argues that the floating farm concept could help other riverine developing countries, as has been the case with floating schools. \u201cThey have the potential to be replicated around the world,\u201d he said. \nShidhulai\u2019s school boats have been copied in several other countries, including the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, Nigeria and Zambia.\nA floating farm measures about 56 feet long and 16 feet wide. The coop can house 100 ducks and is equipped with a small solar panel to power lights inside. It floats on empty oil drums, plastic containers and a bamboo platform. \nThe coop is attached to bamboo rods that make up two rows of fish enclosures where tilapia is farmed in blue plastic nets. The outer rails of bamboo support the garden. They hold old plastic jugs cut in half where villagers grow cucumbers, beans and gourds in soil and natural fertilizer. \nMr. Rezwan took his initial concept for the farms from floating gardens that had been used in southern Bangladesh for hundreds of years. Those gardens layered water hyacinths \u2014 a type of weed \u2014 over bamboo structures and topped the resulting artificial island with soil to grow vegetables.\nThe design had to be modified however, to suit local conditions. The southern model didn\u2019t work in the north, where heavier rains waterlogged the vegetable beds and it was difficult to create drainage. Water hyacinth was also less plentiful in the north. \nThe duck coop, originally built on a bamboo platform, now rests atop more-buoyant plastic oil drums \u2014 recycled and found materials are enthusiastically used alongside locally grown bamboo. \nVillagers can now build the entire structure for the equivalent of $260, which is covered by Shidhulai, Mr. Rezwan said."}, {"text": "In Bangladesh, a Vibrant Contemporary Scene\n2014-03-13T17:40:56.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Political turmoil and violent nationwide strikes regularly disrupted life in Bangladesh last year. But on a hot night in Dhaka, the capital, hundreds of people crowded into Dhaka Art Center for the opening of an exhibition of paintings by Rafiqun Nabi, an esteemed Bangladeshi artist famed for his newspaper cartoons. \nChildren with parents, young men, couples, elderly visitors and entire families crowded the center and spilled into its brick courtyard in Dhanmondi, a neighborhood known as Dhaka\u2019s thriving arts hub. Art lovers posed for photos next to an expansive painting featuring a jumble of geometric, blue-skinned men playing cards, blowing a flute and napping in the lee of a wooden boat.\nBoats and rivers are ubiquitous in Bangladesh, a river delta country between India and Myanmar, and were common motifs in Mr. Nabi\u2019s paintings. So were lively street scenes, such as a family of three on a bicycle.\nThe nonprofit Dhaka Art Center opened in 2009 as a venue for exhibitions, talks, classes, films and a new print-making studio. Mr. Nabi\u2019s paintings command as much as $20,000, but profit is not the center\u2019s main objective. \u201cIt is not a commercial gallery. We are for the people,\u201d said Nisar Hossain, a center member and a professor of fine art at Dhaka University. \u201cWe can expand art to the community.\u201d\nDhaka Art Center shows work by new artists, too, such as drawings by a young artist named Arham ul-Huq Chowdhury. The compact works shown a week after Mr. Nabi\u2019s exhibition creatively used calligraphy to illustrate Bengali proverbs, like one of a cat rendered in coils of elongated Bengali letters. \nBangladesh lays claim to a legacy of Bengali arts and culture shared by the neighboring Indian state of West Bengal, the birthplace of Rabindranath Tagore, the poet and Nobel laureate who wrote the national anthems of both India and Bangladesh. \nA contemporary arts scene began to grow in Bangladesh 20 years after a bloody war of independence separated the country from Pakistan in 1971. Since the 1990s, more artists have graduated from the country\u2019s arts academies and universities, and new art venues have sprouted up. Now art openings happen weekly in Dhaka\u2019s galleries, clustered mostly in Dhanmondi \u2014 though getting to them is a challenge in a city of seven million that is choked with traffic. \nIn spite of the momentum, artists and patrons are still trying to push contemporary art beyond the country\u2019s traditional notions. Some also strive to create an identity apart from grim scenes too easily associated with Bangladesh: cyclones, violent political protests, and bleak factories exemplified by the deadly collapse last year of the Rana Plaza building. \nFounded in 1986, the Bengal Foundation was one of the first private arts institutions in Dhaka. Today it hosts exhibitions, concerts and other cultural events at the Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts in Dhanmondi, as well as the sleek new Bengal Art Lounge in Gulshan, the diplomatic enclave.\nThe business magnate Abul Khair Litu started the foundation out of personal interest in the arts, and \u201cthe vision of projecting a culturally rich Bangladesh, rising above clich\u00e9d portraiture of a country steeped in flood and famine,\u201d as he wrote in a 2011 book by the Bangladeshi photographer Shahidul Alam. \nMr. Alam founded Drik, a photography agency and archive, in 1989 to use photography as a tool for social justice and to show Bangladesh in a different light. \n\u201cI wanted to ensure that the only identity of Bangladesh would not be an icon of poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a P.R. campaign, but the world has a very narrow understanding of this country.\u201d\nMr. Alam\u2019s photographs have appeared in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Pompidou Center in Paris and other museums around the world. After earning a doctorate in chemistry from the University of London \u2014 a useful degree for mixing darkroom chemicals, he noted \u2014 Mr. Alam stumbled into photography while hitchhiking in the United States with a borrowed Nikon. He was hooked and returned to Bangladesh in 1984. Eventually he founded Drik in his parents\u2019 home in Dhanmondi. Today, Drik\u2019s three-story building houses the agency, archives, a book publisher, and multimedia initiatives, along with galleries.\nDrik put Bangladesh on the map for photography, as did Pathshala, the photography school nearby that Mr. Alam founded in 1998. Pathshala has trained hundreds of Bangladeshi photographers, including award-winning photojournalists.\nSince 2000, Drik has hosted Chobi Mela, the largest festival of contemporary photography in Asia to be held every other year. In 2013, 130 international photographers converged in Dhaka for a week of talks and exhibitions. Some displays even took to the streets on bicycle carts. \u201cArt has been confined to experts for far too long,\u201d Mr. Alam said. \u201cSocial engagement is part of what we do.\u201d \nIn spite of Drik\u2019s prominence, Mr. Alam said that art in Bangladesh was associated primarily with painting. The Asian Art Biennale has been held at the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy in Dhaka for 30 years, yet photographs are still not accepted into the art fair. \nOthers agree that acceptance of contemporary art must be broadened and internationalized. The art collectors Rajeeb and Nadia Samdani started the annual Dhaka Art Summit in 2012 to showcase contemporary art by Bangladeshi and international artists with a more avant-garde bent. The second summit, this past February, attracted 250 artists from South Asia and international curators for three days of exhibits, talks and experimental films.\nThe Samdanis, both in their 30s, hope the event becomes a platform for the region and brings Bangladeshi contemporary art onto the global stage. They started collecting art in 2008 and their ultramodern home in Gulshan looks part-gallery, part-nightclub, with striking contemporary art displayed throughout the house.\nIn the lobby, a life-size sculpture of a corpse by the Pakistani artist Huma Mulji lies on the floor grotesquely clutching at the air. Ms. Mulji modeled the sculpture on bodies of the \u201cdisappeared\u201d found dumped in rivers in Pakistan. Upstairs, an outsize rack displays dozens of shiny metallic bras made of razor blades by the Bangladeshi arztist Tayeba Begum Lipi. Ms. Lipi\u2019s work of a bed frame constructed of razor blades was recently acquired by the Guggenheim Museum in New York. \nMs. Lipi is part of the Britto Arts Trust, a group in Dhaka founded by Bangladeshi artists in 2002 as an incubator for experimental work like video and installation art that remains largely alien to the city\u2019s traditional venues. \u201cWhen we started, galleries didn\u2019t give us space,\u201d recalled Mahbubur Rahman, one of Britto\u2019s six founders. \nBritto has gained ground since then. It hosts workshops every two years for local and international artists, and has a new arts space near Dhanmondi where Britto\u2019s 11 members work and exhibit. \nIn 2009, Britto also helped stage 1mile2, a display of films, public art and installations focusing on ecology over one square mile of Old Dhaka, the capital\u2019s chaotic historic district. For one day, works by 40 artists spotlighted the environmental and urban degradation so prevalent in Old Dhaka. Works included a life-size replica of a traditional wooden boat made of empty plastic bottles that carried passengers onto the black, fetid waters of the Buriganga River, and a photo installation depicting Dhaka\u2019s wild urban monkeys.\nMr. Rahman said that 15,000 people had viewed the show in a single day, including laborers who work and live in Old Dhaka. \u201cThey didn\u2019t understand what was going on, but they are very much curious and enjoying,\u201d he said.\nAlthough pockets of contemporary art are thriving in Dhaka, challenges remain. Bangladesh\u2019s fine arts academies and universities tend to neglect teaching the subject, and there is still more respect for older, traditional artists. \u201cNo one wants young people to get recognition,\u201d lamented Mr. Samdani of Dhaka Art Summit.\nArt patrons spoke of the divided, fragmented arts community in a country known for cutthroat politics. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity,\u201d said Giorgio Guglielmino, the Italian ambassador to Bangladesh and an avid collector who lectures on contemporary art. \u201cIf you want the country\u2019s art to emerge, they should put together forces.\u201d\nThose who attend art exhibitions in Dhaka seem oblivious to this infighting. Back at Mr. Nabi\u2019s exhibition at Dhaka Art Center, a 35-year-old banker named Sazzad Islam admired the paintings. Mr. Islam studied accounting at university. His fondness for art has grown by visiting Dhaka\u2019s galleries.\n\u201cWhen I get any time I try to go there,\u201d Mr. Islam said. \u201cDay by day, I myself feel devotion.\u201d"}, {"text": "Climate Report Details Flood Risk to Sites in Washington\n2014-09-17T02:48:32.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The nation\u2019s capital is likely to see record flooding by 2050, putting about $7 billion worth of property, three military bases and parts of the National Mall at risk as a result of climate change that is raising sea levels all over the world, according to a report released Tuesday by the research group Climate Central. \nThat is one of the group\u2019s more conservative estimates in a report titled \u201cWashington, D.C., and the Surging Sea.\u201d\nIn the worst case, the group draws an end-of-the-century picture of the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials as islands in a flooded Potomac River, and Fort McNair, the Washington Navy Yard and parts of Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling completely under water. \nScientists\u2019 warnings about the effects of climate change are not new, with predictions that melting polar ice will lead to a rise in sea levels that will lap around the edges of New York, turn Houston into a latter-day Venice and force millions of residents in low-lying nations like Bangladesh out of their homes.\nThe dangers to Washington are acute, the report said. Contrary to popular myth, the city was not built in a swamp, but it is in a flood plain, and its officials and engineers have tamed the wild Potomac. Those advances could be turned back as the seas rise, the report said. And that may affect the nation well beyond the District of Columbia\u2019s boundaries.\n\u201cThe monument area and the Mall are in some ways the soul of Washington, D.C., so to see those areas flooding, I think, will probably have an important emotional and cultural effect, as well as a physical effect,\u201d said Ben Strauss, director of Climate Central\u2019s Program on Sea Level Rise and the report\u2019s lead author. A sea-level increase of about four feet by the end of the century would most likely lead to at least one damaging flood more than eight feet above high tide, the study says. The current record of 7.9 feet was set in 1942.\nThe study\u2019s lowest estimate, which accounts for a rise in the sea level of just one and a half feet, predicts flooding more than six feet above high tide in just 16 years, akin to some of the most severe floods the city has seen. Just four floods have exceeded six feet since 1931.\n\u201cYou could go from a situation where you buy a home, it\u2019s never been flooded before in memory, it\u2019s a low flood risk,\u201d Mr. Strauss said. \u201cAnd by the time you pay off your mortgage, it\u2019s getting flooded every single year.\u201d\nThe group also released analyses of the risks facing Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, and some of the most troubling findings show how climate change will affect military installations, Mr. Strauss said.\nThe \u201clabyrinth of tidewater channels and creeks\u201d in the Norfolk, Va., area make the naval base there, the world\u2019s largest, especially vulnerable to climate change, Mr. Strauss said. Among the three states, Virginia\u2019s population is most at risk, with 107,000 residents living less than five feet above high tide, the researchers said. Maryland has the most property at that level, with more than $19.6 billion at stake."}, {"text": "Rising Seas + Dams + Aquifer Pumping = Delta Blues\n"}, {"text": "Borrowed Time on Disappearing Land\n2014-03-28T05:09:44.000Z\nDAKOPE, Bangladesh \u2014 When a powerful storm destroyed her riverside home in 2009, Jahanara Khatun lost more than the modest roof over her head. In the aftermath, her husband died and she became so destitute that she sold her son and daughter into bonded servitude. And she may lose yet more.\nMs. Khatun now lives in a bamboo shack that sits below sea level about 50 yards from a sagging berm. She spends her days collecting cow dung for fuel and struggling to grow vegetables in soil poisoned by salt water. Climate scientists predict that this area will be inundated as sea levels rise and storm surges increase, and a cyclone or another disaster could easily wipe away her rebuilt life. But Ms. Khatun is trying to hold out at least for a while \u2014 one of millions living on borrowed time in this vast landscape of river islands, bamboo huts, heartbreaking choices and impossible hopes.\nAs the world\u2019s top scientists meet in Yokohama, Japan, this week, at the top of the agenda is the prediction that global sea levels could rise more than three feet by 2100. Higher seas and warmer weather will cause profound changes.\nClimate scientists have concluded that widespread burning of fossil fuels is releasing heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet. While this will produce a host of effects, the most worrisome may be the melting of much of the earth\u2019s ice, which is likely to raise sea levels and flood coastal regions.\nSuch a rise will be uneven because of gravitational effects and human intervention, so predicting its outcome in any one place is difficult. But island nations like the Maldives, Kiribati and Fiji may lose much of their land area, and millions of Bangladeshis will be displaced.\n\u201cThere are a lot of places in the world at risk from rising sea levels, but Bangladesh is at the top of everybody\u2019s list,\u201d said Rafael Reuveny, a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University at Bloomington. \u201cAnd the world is not ready to cope with the problems.\u201d\nThe effects of climate change have led to a growing sense of outrage in developing nations, many of which have contributed little to the pollution that is linked to rising temperatures and sea levels but will suffer the most from the consequences.\nAt a climate conference in Warsaw in November, there was an emotional outpouring from countries that face existential threats, among them Bangladesh, which produces just 0.3 percent of the emissions driving climate change. Some leaders have demanded that rich countries compensate poor countries for polluting the atmosphere. A few have even said that developed countries should open their borders to climate migrants.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of global justice,\u201d said Atiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies and the nation\u2019s leading climate scientist. \u201cThese migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming. Millions should be able to go to the United States.\u201d\nRiver deltas around the globe are particularly vulnerable to the effects of rising seas, and wealthier cities like London, Venice and New Orleans also face uncertain futures. But it is the poorest countries with the biggest populations that will be hit hardest, and none more so than Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated nations in the world. In the Ganges Delta, made up of 230 major rivers and streams, 160 million people live in a place one-fifth the size of France and as flat as chapati, the bread served at almost every meal.\nA Perilous Position\nThough Bangladesh has contributed little to industrial air pollution, other kinds of environmental degradation have left it especially vulnerable.\nBangladesh relies almost entirely on groundwater for drinking supplies because the rivers are so polluted. The resultant pumping causes the land to settle. So as sea levels are rising, Bangladesh\u2019s cities are sinking, increasing the risks of flooding. Poorly constructed seawalls compound the problem.\nThe country\u2019s climate scientists and politicians have come to agree that by 2050, rising sea levels will inundate some 17 percent of the land and displace about 18 million people, Dr. Rahman said.\nBangladeshis have already started to move away from the lowest-lying villages in the river deltas of the Bay of Bengal, scientists in Bangladesh say. People move for many reasons, and urbanization is increasing across South Asia, but rising tides are a big factor. Dr. Rahman\u2019s research group has made a rough estimate from small surveys that as many as 1.5 million of the five million slum inhabitants in Dhaka, the capital, moved from villages near the Bay of Bengal.\nThe slums that greet them in Dhaka are also built on low-lying land, making them almost as vulnerable to being inundated as the land villagers left behind.\nMs. Khatun and her neighbors have lived through deadly cyclones \u2014 a synonym here for hurricane \u2014 and have seen the salty rivers chew through villages and poison fields. Rising seas are increasingly intruding into rivers, turning fresh water brackish. Even routine flooding then leaves behind salt deposits that can render land barren.\nMaking matters worse, much of what the Bangladeshi government is doing to stave off the coming deluge \u2014 raising levees, dredging canals, pumping water \u2014 deepens the threat of inundation in the long term, said John Pethick, a former professor of coastal science at Newcastle University in England who has spent much of his retirement studying Bangladesh\u2019s predicament. Rich nations are not the only ones to blame, he said.\nIn an analysis of decades of tidal records published in October, Dr. Pethick found that high tides in Bangladesh were rising 10 times faster than the global average. He predicted that seas in Bangladesh could rise as much as 13 feet by 2100, four times the global average. In an area where land is often a thin brown line between sky and river \u2014 nearly a quarter of Bangladesh is less than seven feet above sea level \u2014 such an increase would have dire consequences, Dr. Pethick said.\n\u201cThe reaction among Bangladeshi government officials has been to tell me that I must be wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s completely understandable, but it also means they have no hope of preparing themselves.\u201d\nDr. Rahman said that he did not disagree with Dr. Pethick\u2019s findings, but that no estimate was definitive. Other scientists have predicted more modest rises. For example, Robert E. Kopp, an associate director of the Rutgers Energy Institute at Rutgers University, said that data from nearby Kolkata, India, suggested that seas in the region could rise five to six feet by 2100.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that preparations within Bangladesh have been utterly inadequate, but any such preparations are bound to fail because the problem is far too big for any single government,\u201d said Tariq A. Karim, Bangladesh\u2019s ambassador to India. \u201cWe need a regional and, better yet, a global solution. And if we don\u2019t get one soon, the Bangladeshi people will soon become the world\u2019s problem, because we will not be able to keep them.\u201d\nMr. Karim estimated that as many as 50 million Bangladeshis would flee the country by 2050 if sea levels rose as expected.\nLosing Everything\nAlready, signs of erosion are everywhere in the Ganges Delta \u2014 the world\u2019s largest delta, which empties much of the water coming from the Himalayas. There are brick foundations torn in half, palm trees growing out of rivers and rangy cattle grazing on island pastures the size of putting greens. Fields are dusted white with salt.\nEven without climate change, Bangladesh is among the most vulnerable places in the world to bad weather: The V-shaped Bay of Bengal funnels cyclones straight into the country\u2019s fan-shaped coastline.\nSome scientists believe that rising temperatures will lead to more extreme weather worldwide, including stronger and more frequent cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. And rising seas will make any storm more dangerous because flooding will become more likely.\nBangladesh has done much to protect its population by creating an early-warning system and building at least 2,500 concrete storm shelters. The result has been a vast reduction in storm-related deaths. While Cyclone Bhola in 1970 killed as many as 550,000 people, Cyclone Aila in 2009 killed 300. The deadliest part of the storm was the nearly 10-foot wall of water that roared through villages in the middle of the afternoon.\nThe poverty of people like Ms. Khatun makes them particularly vulnerable to storms. When Aila hit, Ms. Khatun was home with her husband, parents and four children. A nearby berm collapsed, and their mud and bamboo hut washed away in minutes. Unable to save her belongings, Ms. Khatun put her youngest child on her back and, with her husband, fought through surging waters to a high road. Her parents were swept away.\n\u201cAfter about a kilometer, I managed to grab a tree,\u201d said Abddus Satter, Ms. Khatun\u2019s father. \u201cAnd I was able to help my wife grab on as well. We stayed on that tree for hours.\u201d\nThe couple eventually shifted to the roof of a nearby hut. The family reunited on the road the next day after the children spent a harrowing night avoiding snakes that had sought higher ground, too. They drank rainwater until rescuers arrived a day or two later with bottled water, food and other supplies.\nThe ordeal took a severe toll on Ms. Khatun\u2019s husband, whose health soon deteriorated. To pay for his treatment and the cost of rebuilding their hut, the family borrowed money from a loan shark. In return, Ms. Khatun and her three older children, then 10, 12 and 15, promised to work for seven months in a nearby brickmaking factory. She later sold her 11- and 13-year-old children to the owner of another brick factory, this one in Dhaka, for $450 to pay more debts. Her husband died four years after the storm.\nIn an interview, one of her sons, Mamun Sardar, now 14, said he worked from dawn to dusk carrying newly made bricks to the factory oven.\nHe said he missed his mother, \u201cbut she lives far away.\u201d\nImpossible Hopes\nDiscussions about the effects of climate change in the Ganges Delta often become community events. In the village of Choto Jaliakhali, where Ms. Khatun lives, dozens of people said they could see that the river was rising. Several said they had been impoverished by erosion, which has cost many villagers their land.\nMuhammad Moktar Ali said he could not think about the next storm because all he had in the world was his hut and village. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to support ourselves if we lost this,\u201d he said, gesturing to his gathered neighbors. \u201cIt is God who will help us survive.\u201d\nSurveys show that residents of the delta do not want to migrate, Dr. Rahman said. Moving to slums in already crowded cities is their least preferred option.\nBut cities have become the center of Bangladesh\u2019s textile industry, which is now the source of 80 percent of the country\u2019s exports, 45 percent of its industrial employment and 15 percent of its gross domestic product.\nSome areas of the globe are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and inhabitants are being forced to make stark changes in their lives.\nIn the weeks after the storm, the women of Dakope found firewood by wading into the raging river and pushing their toes into the muddy bottom. They walked hours to buy drinking water. After rebuilding the village\u2019s berm and their own hut, Shirin Aktar and her husband, Bablu Gazi, managed to get just enough of a harvest to survive from their land, which has become increasingly infertile from salt water. Some plots that once sustained three harvests can now support just one; others are entirely barren.\nAfter two hungry years, the couple gave up on farming and moved to Chittagong, Bangladesh\u2019s second-largest city, leaving their two children behind with Mr. Gazi\u2019s mother.\nMr. Gazi found work immediately as a day laborer, mostly digging foundations. Ms. Aktar searched for a job as a seamstress, but headaches and other slum-induced health problems have so incapacitated her that the couple are desperate to return to Dakope.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here for too long,\u201d Mr. Gazi said. \u201cIf we can save some money, then we\u2019ll go back. I\u2019ll work on a piece of land and try to make it fertile again.\u201d\nBut the chances of finding fertile land in his home village, where the salty rivers have eaten away acre upon acre, are almost zero.\nDozens of people gathered in the narrow mud alley outside Mr. Gazi\u2019s room as he spoke. Some told similar stories of storms, loss and hope, and many nodded as Mr. Gazi spoke of his dreams of returning to his doomed village.\n\u201cAll of us came here because of erosions and cyclones,\u201d said Noakhali, a hollow-eyed 30-year-old with a single name who was wearing the traditional skirt of the delta. \u201cNot one of us actually wants to live here.\u201d"}, {"text": "Can the Port Authority Save the Planet?\n2014-06-17T00:14:17.000Z\nTHIS has been a bad year for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, with scandals over a bridge closure and, most recently, a shady real estate deal. But the authority has a chance at redemption, if it is willing to move beyond its traditional mandate. Its model of interstate cooperation could do much more than prevent traffic jams; it could also play the leading role in managing the ecological health of the Hudson River estuary, and serve as an example for other coastal cities around the world facing complex environmental problems in a time of climate change.\nEstuaries exist where ocean tide meets freshwater from an incoming river. The nutrient-rich environment underwrites an enormous food supply that supports dense animal populations, from seals to frogs to wading birds. They have also long been attractive sites for urban development because of their prolific supply of natural resources, access to navigable water and capacity to absorb the waste produced by masses of people.\nDuring the last two centuries, urbanization has increasingly horned in on this territory. In 1800, a little more than 40 percent of the 25 largest cities in the world were situated along estuaries. Today, close to 70 percent of the planet\u2019s largest cities are found there.\nOne of the main ecological impacts has been eutrophication: a decline in water quality caused by an excess of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. Often, those nutrients come from synthetic fertilizer, but the human waste discharged from cities, especially developing ones, remains an important factor.\nIn the past, those nutrients found their way back to the land. Even today in the East Kolkata wetlands of India, sewage is recycled into vegetable patches and fish farms. But this kind of \u201cclosed-loop\u201d system is rare in modern cities wedded to real estate development rather than agriculture. Instead, nutrients are gushing into estuaries and resulting in harmful algal blooms that rob the water of oxygen, degrade marine habitat and limit the diversity of aquatic life.\nThat\u2019s what has happened in the Pearl River estuary, one of the most urbanized regions on the planet. Nutrient-rich sewage has caused harmful algal blooms, or red tide outbreaks, including one in 1998 that resulted in $32 million of damage to Hong Kong\u2019s fish farms.\nThe second main ecological impact of urban life is that it has expanded at the expense of wetlands. In New York Harbor, roughly 17,000 acres of marshland were filled in between 1953 and 1973. The region around Dhaka, Bangladesh, with its 15 million inhabitants, lost more than half of its wetlands between 1968 and 2001. The loss destroys the plant life and bivalves that filter polluted water on its way out of the estuary, and on which other organisms depend.\nAnd, finally, expanding into marshland and other low-lying ground has precipitated the problem of coastal flooding. A recent report projected that, by midcentury, average flood losses in the world\u2019s major coastal cities will rise to a stunning $52 billion as more people and property pile in along the coast.\nAll in all, urbanization has turned wetlands into one of the world\u2019s most threatened habitats; eutrophication has evolved into a global ecological problem as disturbing as climate change; and global warming is projected to raise the level of the sea and increase flooding.\nPolitical boundaries are of little use in dealing with these problems. It makes no sense for the City of New York to release an elaborate plan on its own \u2014 as the Bloomberg administration did after Hurricane Sandy \u2014 to address coastal flooding within the five boroughs without paying heed to the impact of what, say, building a levee there will do with respect to floods in New Jersey.\nWhat we need are port authorities. In the Western Hemisphere there are already 137 port authorities \u2014 from New York to Buenos Aires. And other cities around the globe have similar organizations. These authorities are typically concerned with transportation infrastructure, but they can be reformed and placed in charge of overseeing development at the intersection of land and sea.\nIf the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey can think holistically about transportation, it can certainly, with the right staffing, do the same for the environment. It has already taken some tentative steps in that direction, partnering with other agencies on localized wetlands restoration, for example. It needs to go further. Congress should merge it with the weaker but important Interstate Environmental Commission, another innovative agency that crosses state lines in the metro area to oversee air and water quality, and elevate the organization as the estuary\u2019s master planner.\nWith more than half the world\u2019s population now living in cities, and urban planners pressing for more density, we need a model of urban governance that can evaluate the effects of development on estuaries. An improved port authority could forge the way, instead of serving as a punching bag for commuters."}, {"text": "A Rotten Mango Crisis\n2014-07-05T18:30:03.000Z\nAS an apprentice anthropologist, I once had the misfortune of attempting to converse with the Indian critical theorist Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. Professor Spivak, who translated the work of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida and wrote the famous essay \u201cCan the Subaltern Speak?\u201d, was visiting Dhaka, Bangladesh, and I went to meet her. After patiently listening while I asked a series of dumb questions about discursive practice, she turned and said, cryptically, \u201cI came for the mangoes.\u201d\nAh, the mango. It may be a clich\u00e9d pitfall for the South Asian writer, but for this academic, famous for her impenetrable prose, the mango brought the esoteric down to earth. Ms. Spivak is regarded as one of the great minds of her generation, but in Dhaka, she was, like everyone else, there for the mangoes. \nIn Bangladesh, the obsession with the mango comes from its evanescence. The fruit\u2019s intense seasonality means that even the more prosaic varieties are available for only a few weeks of the summer. The most prized is the langra: Its floral, slightly sour flavor is more complex than the overly sweet chaunsa or Alphonso mangoes. Aficionados love the langra in part because it is almost impossible to catch at its peak \u2014 too green and your tongue will swell and itch; a few hours late and its flesh turns to mush.\nBut this year, the langra is nowhere to be found. The markets are empty.\nOn the roads that lead into Dhaka, the precious fruit lies rotting by the truckload. The reason: chemical poisoning. The langras are said to be contaminated with formalin, a strong solution of formaldehyde that is sprayed on the fruit to extend its life.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the mangoes. Earlier this year, the Institute of Public Health found that 47 of 50 food items tested were adulterated. Formalin is used to preserve both fruit and fish. Turmeric has been tainted with lead. Since June 18, the police have set up mobile formalin-detection units at checkpoints on the roads into the city. Thousands of tons of fruit have been confiscated.\nThe fruit industry is up in arms, claiming that the police are using faulty devices and crippling the industry. Last week, the fruit sellers\u2019 association went on strike, and their produce rotted in the warehouses of the port city of Chittagong. In the weeks leading up to the month of Ramadan, the tussle has been fierce, with demonstrations and counter-demonstrations taking place across Dhaka. And the langra has vanished.\nThe practice of spraying fruit with formalin is one problem, but more worrying is that the entire food chain is compromised \u2014 the soil itself contaminated by toxins that are almost impossible to eradicate. Bangladesh was born in the shadow of famine, and since independence in 1971, a series of government measures have put increasing pressure on farmers to keep the rice yields going up every year. This has meant intensive farming, extensive irrigation and the unchecked use of groundwater. The land has borne the cost of our need to climb out of famine.\nDhaka\u2019s brouhaha over contaminated fruit speaks to a growing chasm between the urban and the rural. This broken, congested city is where we have placed all our hopes for a better Bangladesh. The capital is where you will find the budding start-ups, the college graduates, the cellphone users, the social networkers \u2014 all the engines of economic growth. And as we become more removed from the traditional modes of food production, the agricultural hinterland is being treated as nothing more than the food source for a hungry city.\nThe great irony is that Bangladeshis romanticize the rural. The country, as the American anthropologist James Ferguson put it, provides \u201calternative moral images,\u201d a counterpoint to the complexities \u2014 the allure, as well as the danger \u2014 of rapid urbanization. The rural continues to act as a repository of our fantasies about national identity; our cultural touchstone is Rabindranath Tagore, the great bard of the pastoral in Bengali literature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The greatest compliment you can pay a Bangladeshi is to say she is \u201cmatir manush,\u201d a person of the earth.\nBut when we place checkpoints on the roads into our city, we are saying that we care only if urban citizens are poisoned; we couldn\u2019t care less if the contaminated fruit is consumed outside of Dhaka. Ms. Spivak may have used the mango as a way to express her rootedness, but a taste for mangoes reveals a person to be among the few who can afford them. The truth is, the fruit is grown by the rural poor and fed to the urban rich. To keep the city sated with mangoes, the crop must be abundant and beautiful. And for that, formalin must be involved.\nAs Ramadan approached and the langra disappeared, the fruit sellers and the state came to an agreement. The fruit sellers would end their strike so that the population could sit down to its dates and apples after a long day of fasting; the police agreed to look into obtaining new devices to test the levels of formalin in fruit.\nUnless, however, we think critically about the moral economy of food, about sustainability as well as growth, our food will be tainted. If the rationality of urbanism continues to dominate, we will merely be polishing the surface of a rotting core."}, {"text": "Bangladesh Inspections Find Gaps in Safety\n2014-03-11T13:43:50.000Z\nNearly a year after a factory building collapsed in Bangladesh, killing more than 1,100 workers, engineering teams sponsored by Western retailers have been rigorously inspecting that country\u2019s garment industry, resulting in at least two temporary closings because of safety problems.\nInspection reports on the first 10 factories were released Tuesday and found that some lacked adequate fire doors, did not have required sprinkler systems and had dangerously high weight loads on several floors.\nThe inspections were organized through the Bangladesh Accord Foundation, a group of 150 clothing brands and retailers from more than 20 countries that plans to inspect 1,500 Bangladesh garment factories by early September.\n\u201cOur inspection program is in full swing,\u201d said Brad Loewen, the group\u2019s chief safety inspector. \u201cIt\u2019s big news that we\u2019re in full flight.\u201d\nThe program has 38 teams of international engineers, who, with Bangladeshi engineers and technicians, plan to inspect 250 factories each month, doing fire, electrical and structural inspections on each.\nThe inspection reports released Tuesday found a lack of fire alarms and a need for better enclosure and maintenance of electrical wiring. The inspections, done in November and December, do not reflect any problems as severe as those that caused the collapse last spring of the Rana Plaza factory.\n\u201cThe inspection reports contain an unprecedented level of detail and set a new standard in transparency and credibility,\u201d said Jyrki Raina, general secretary of IndustriALL Global Union, a labor federation that helped set up the accord.\nThe inspectors found extensive fire safety problems at the Dragon Sweater factory in Dhaka. The report said the boiler and generator rooms as well as storage areas holding combustible materials were not separated from production areas using fireproof construction. The inspectors found that the exit stairs in the 18-story factory opened into areas used for storage on several floors and that the main exit stairway discharged inside the building, as did a rear exit stairway. The inspectors found a locked fire exit door on the 16th floor and numerous collapsible gates with locks, although they were not locked during the inspection.\nThe inspectors said Dragon\u2019s fire alarm system was mainly a manual alarm system that notified only individual floors. The report added, \u201cThe high-rise building is not provided with automatic sprinkler protection. The large occupant loads, heavy fuel loading, and anticipated extended egress times warrant sprinkler protection.\u201d\nDragon Sweater\u2019s website says its customers include Walmart and C&A.\nThe reports include photos with arrows pointing to specific safety problems, like cracks in beams.\n\u201cBy publishing reports and making them easily understandable with photographs, we help the workers and public understand these problems and see that they\u2019re fixable,\u201d said Alan Roberts, executive director of the accord\u2019s international operations. He said many safety repairs had already been made to the first factories inspected.\nSeparately, Walmart hired Bureau Veritas, a prominent monitoring company, to inspect Dragon Sweater and more than 200 other factories it uses in Bangladesh. Its inspections last April gave Dragon Sweater Cs for electrical and building safety, Walmart\u2019s second-worst grade, and a follow-up assessment in July gave it a B for electrical safety and C for building safety.\nThe accord\u2019s first wave of inspections focused on buildings with at least five floors that have multiple factories. Building owners are told in advance when the inspections will occur, and are asked to locate relevant documentation, said Joris Oldenziel, a spokesman for the accord. The inspection reports are sent to the factory owner, the Western brands that use the factory and worker representatives at the factory. The recipients were to come up with remediation plans, to be published on the accord\u2019s website within six weeks of the inspection, with the Western brands promising to help finance needed improvements.\n\u201cExits are always a big issue,\u201d Mr. Loewen said. \u201cUsually they have lockable gates across them \u2014 they have to be removed. The stairwells have to be separated from the factory floor with fire doors. It\u2019s very common that they need to install fire doors.\u201d\nAnother common problem was that many factories do not satisfy the accord\u2019s requirement that sprinklers be installed on every floor of a factory building that is 75 feet or higher.\nOne factory owner in Bangladesh praised the inspections, saying, \u201cNo doubt, they have gone through many details, very intensively.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is good. It can shake up the mind-set.\u201d He spoke only on the condition of anonymity, fearing other factory owners might get angry at him because many are dismayed with the accord and inspections.\nHe said this should improve factory quality and create a more level playing field among factories. He predicted that some factories could face major renovation expenses, since many do not have sprinkler systems at all.\nSoftex, a sweater maker that supplies the French retailer Auchan, temporarily closed this week after the accord\u2019s inspectors discovered serious structural problems, a move that resulted in the layoff of more than 3,000 workers. Labor unions criticized Softex for not paying the workers\u2019 wages while repairs are done, while Bangladeshi factory owners have urged the Western brands to help pay the wages.\nAt the Viyellatex factory, fire inspectors found that two of the three exit stairways discharged inside the building rather than outside. They found that large electrical equipment was not separated by fireproof construction and that the smoke detector system did not provide automatic alarm protection. Notification was done only by manual alarm.\nOn its website, Viyellatex says its clients include PVH, Hugo Boss, and Marks and Spencer.\n\u201cViyellatex is one of the best factories in Bangladesh, and it still had major problems, particularly fire and electrical,\u201d said Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a monitoring group based in Washington. \u201cIt indicates how widespread the problems are.\u201d\nIf an inspection uncovers critical problems, accord officials must notify the government of Bangladesh and request that the factory be closed. A panel of four engineers as well as government, business and labor leaders must meet within 48 hours to review the decision. Closed factories cannot be reopened unless the four engineers all agree.\nMost of the accord\u2019s signers are European brands, including H&M, Benetton and Inditex, but a few United States companies have joined, including Abercrombie & Fitch and PVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.\nThe inspectors found urgent structural problems at several factories. At Fashion Island, they found cracks in beams and urged, \u201cAll loads, including equipment, garments and personnel, at each floor level, including ground floor, are to be reduced.\u201d\nAt Grameen Knitwear, the inspectors found what they called \u201cuncontrolled heavy loading\u201d on the second and third floors and voiced concerns about \u201cthe stability system for lateral loading.\u201d At Rio Fashion Wear, the inspectors found heavy loads on the eighth floor, resulting in some cracking on the floor below.\nGap, Walmart, Target and 23 other North American retailers have formed a separate group that seeks to improve safety at apparel factories in Bangladesh.\nThat group, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, said it had inspected 365 factories of the 830 it said its members use in Bangladesh. It has not yet released inspection reports.\nLast December, Walmart released 202 factory safety assessment reports \u2014 less detailed than the ones released Tuesday \u2014 including those for Dragon Sweater. Kevin Gardner, a Walmart spokesman, noted that 68 percent of the factories Walmart had inspected overlap with factories used by members of the accord.\n\u201cAs we move forward, collaboration will be key to ensuring worker safety and effective, sustainable remediation,\u201d Mr. Gardner said. \" In fact, the alliance formed its safety standards together with the accord.\u201d"}, {"text": "Street Art Floods Nepal With Color\n2014-12-04T10:31:32.000Z\nLALITPUR, Nepal \u2014 With its drab shop fronts and wires hanging dangerously off electric poles, the town of Lalitpur, an extension of the Nepalese capital of Katmandu, would seem to have little going for it, aesthetically speaking.\nBut down Kupondole Road, just off the main drag of Lalitpur, is a riot of color. About 20 street paintings cover the walls and buildings for a one-mile, or 1.6-kilometer, stretch. One shows a Buddha-like figure listening to headphones; another depicts the Himalayas bathed in turquoise and mustard yellow.\nHeading back into Katmandu over the Bagmati Bridge, commuters are greeted by a huge multicolored mural of a red panda\u2019s face, and another long stretch of urban artwork that brightens up the street leading past nondescript government offices.\nStreet art in Nepal is on the rise, with vibrantly hued works appearing across the capital and Katmandu Valley, as local and international artists alike take advantage of the fact that there are no laws, at least not yet, against decorating buildings, fences, walls and gates.\nAnd like much of the street art that is done in other cities across the globe, Nepalese street art has a story to tell. Some artists like mixing religious symbols into their works, while others want to showcase the social problems that face the impoverished country.\nFor young artists hoping to break into Katmandu\u2019s small contemporary art scene, street art offers a way to get their work seen by a wider audience as well.\n\u201cI tried to get my work into a few galleries, but the problem is that they do not recognize you until you have done something as an artist,\u201d said Kiran Maharjan, a recent graduate from Kathmandu University\u2019s art school who is part of the street art collective Artlab. \u201cStreet art became a solution for me, playing the role of a gallery for the public.\u201d\nSince street art first started appearing in the Nepalese capital about four years ago, there have been a handful of group projects that have introduced the genre to local artists and the wider Nepalese community.\nKolor Kathmandu, a yearlong project that was funded by the Netherlands\u2019 Prince Claus Fund for the arts, organized Nepalese and international artists to paint 75 murals across the city from August to August, 2012-13. An iBook about the project is about to be released.\nArtlab, after producing a group of murals for a 2013 project they called Prasad (\u201cgracious gift\u201d in Sanskrit), started a wider and more encompassing project in October: a two-year street art venture of 10 workshops, 10 open-air galleries and four exhibitions in six cities across Nepal.\nThe proliferation of street art in the underdeveloped, grimy and rather chaotic capital of one of the world\u2019s poorest countries has encouraged international artists to come to the city to paint. Even backpackers passing through Katmandu are leaving their mark in hostel-heavy areas.\n\u201cWith these things it is about timing, and the environment was ready for it,\u201d said Bruno Levy, a New York-based street artist. Mr. Levy was one of the first from outside Nepal to come to Katmandu and paint works for his 2011 Bigfoot project, which included an art installation of a large papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 foot in Durbar Square, a Unesco World Heritage site.\n\u201cI think it takes a lot of people for something to take off, and it was a way of expression that fits for what has been happening in Katmandu,\u201d he said.\nThough religious murals in Nepal date back to the 11th century, street art in the Western sense did not really exist until around 2008, when Space Invader, a French street artist, came and painted a series of 20 pieces across the city.\nThe pieces joined the political slogans and campaign ads splashed on walls and buildings, covering the city and the wider Katmandu Valley in red script.\n\u201cPolitical parties used painters to come and do political slogans, something we got from Bangladesh,\u201d said Nischal Oli, who coordinates projects for the Siddhartha Arts Foundation, a nonprofit group in Katmandu. \u201cIt sort of gave fertile ground for street art to come out and provided the space to go out onto the streets to paint something without getting into trouble.\u201d\nA handful of artists began responding to all the red script that would pop up during election campaigns, in a country tired from a decade-long civil war and political turmoil.\n\u201cWhen I saw political walls, I got an idea to paint on top of the slogans,\u201d said Aditya Aryal, one of the founders of Artlab and one of Nepal\u2019s most influential street artists, who paints under the street name of SadhuX. \u201cI thought, I can do the same thing, but with an artistic agenda, not a political one, because that is actually vandalizing Katmandu.\u201d\nIn 2012, Mr. Aryal and a few art school friends from Kathmandu University founded Artlab, originally doing graphic designs on T-shirts, stickers and posters but also decorating city streets. Community involvement and teaching people about the power of expression through street art became an important part of the collective\u2019s work.\nFor the first Prasad Project, Artlab painted a handful of murals of well-known Nepalese, including the singer Narayan Gopal, the mountaineer Pasang Lhamu Sherpa and the acclaimed social worker Pushpa Basnet. With an estimated 1,500 Nepalese emigrating every day to find jobs overseas, the idea was to inspire young Nepalese to take pride in some of the country\u2019s modern heroes.\n\u201cIt was really amazing,\u201d said Romel Bhattarai, Artlab\u2019s managing director. \u201cThrough this project, we still believe that street art can do something, building a creative solution, if we do it in the right way, not just scribbling on the wall.\u201d\nThe second Prasad Project, funded mainly by the Danish Centre for Culture and Development, will feature community workshops on technique, like stenciling and basic letter design. Afterward, participants and Artlab artists will take to the streets and create open-air galleries to display their work. \u201cTheir project is to use street art as a medium to give voice to the youth and those from marginalized communities and teach them how street art has the potential to spread their message,\u201d Mr. Oli said.\nAn important part of Artlab\u2019s mission, he said, is to nurture the developing art scene. \u201cThey are not just trying to make artworks but to train a new generation of street artists,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that will create change.\u201d\nKolor Kathmandu also set out to show the power and reach of street art, with 26 Nepalese and 18 international artists taking part. They painted 75 murals to represent the 75 Nepalese districts. Each artist, who had to apply and be accepted in order to participate, was given a district to research and had to come up with murals that represented that area.\n\u201cNepal is poor, we have a hard time feeding our population and educating our masses,\u201d said Yuki Poudyal, who organized the project. \u201cBut artists contributing a little of themselves to the city and the country and making themselves heard is something positive.\u201d\nAbout 50 of the murals still exist \u2014 the rest have been painted over \u2014 and there are hopes to do a second version of Kolor Kathmandu in a few years.\n\u201cKolor Kathmandu was a great experience for me,\u201d said Daas, an American artist based in Japan who painted the large panda on Bagmati Bridge. \u201cI believe this style of street art projects is the future of street art \u2014 where things are more connected to the community and where the community is more involved in what is placed on their walls.\u201d\nThe genre in Nepal is not without controversy. In May the members of the French-based street art duo Outsiders Krew spent a month in Katmandu painting the front entry to the Hindu temple complex of Purohitghat, in the very poor Bainsighat district. Seb Toussaint, a member of Outsiders Krew, said the two artists were invited by the local sadhu, or holy man, to paint a mural on the facade of the 19th-century entrance.\nAt the time the local community was happy to have the vibrant mural. But a few months later a magazine article claimed that the artists had defaced the heritage site. A dispute ensued in the artistic community about street art and its role. In the end, the temple paintings were allowed to stand.\n\u201cI think it sparked an interesting debate, raising attention to this temple and this community, so that now they are going to fix the second floor and roof, which are in a really bad state,\u201d Mr. Toussaint said. \u201cSo if this is the power of art, then that is great.\u201d\nBecause the street art scene in Nepal is so young, a strong and unique style has not developed yet. Many believe it will come from a mix of traditional artistic traditions with Hindu influences and modern techniques.\n\u201cA lot of the art that was being done all felt the same stylistically, so some of the international street artists who came here were introducing styles that had not been seen there before,\u201d said Daas, who taught a number of young artists how to scale up their works by using a grid system. \u201cSo maybe it will give some ideas of how express themselves.\u201d\nSneha Shrestha, a street artist who founded Nepal\u2019s Children\u2019s Art Museum, agreed. \u201cFor Nepali artists in general, I have really struggled to find originality,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess it is part of the process of an up-and-coming art scene, where you learn from what you see.\n\u201cWe need to not continue in the same way in terms of what looks good versus really reaching inside and thinking, How can I make this unique to represent where I am from?\u201d"}, {"text": "Battling for a Safer Bangladesh\n2014-04-22T01:39:19.000Z\nAfter the Spectrum sweater factory collapsed in 2005, killing 64 workers, hardly anything changed to improve factory safety in Bangladesh.\nThen the Rana Plaza factory near Dhaka collapsed on April 24 last year, killing 1,129 workers in what was the worst disaster in garment industry history. And that happened just a few months after the Tazreen Fashions fire, which killed 112 Bangladeshi workers.\nReacting to public outrage, Western retailers and apparel brands began a major push to improve safety at the Bangladeshi factories they do business with. It involves a sprint to inspect hundreds of plants each month and a commitment to help correct any safety problems found \u2014 all with an eye to preventing another catastrophic collapse or fire.\nBut instead of joining forces, the Western brands have divided into two sometimes feuding camps \u2014 a result, some say, that detracts from the overall effort, which has otherwise won praise.\nOne group \u2014 the Bangladesh Accord for Fire and Building Safety \u2014 has more than 150 members, including many European brands like H&M, Carrefour and Mango, as well as 14 American companies. The other group \u2014 the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety \u2014 includes 26 companies, all of them American or Canadian, among them Walmart, Gap, Target and Kohl\u2019s.\nSome members of the American-dominated alliance say that their side has performed more inspections than the European-dominated accord, while some accord members assert that the alliance\u2019s inspections are less rigorous. Accord members say they work closely with labor unions and have extensive input from workers, while the alliance\u2019s members assert that the accord has not provided wages to workers who were laid off when their factory was temporarily closed after inspectors found serious problems.\nAdding to the tensions, 15 American universities, including Columbia, Duke, Georgetown and New York University, have \u2014 in a slap at the alliance \u2014 told licensees that produce goods bearing the universities\u2019 logos that they should join the accord, whose program they see as better.\nDespite these tensions, Dara O\u2019Rourke, an expert on workplace monitoring at the University of California, Berkeley, called the efforts in Bangladesh unprecedented. \u201cThe accord and the alliance are taking on the lowest end of a low-road industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to bring up the worst garment conditions in the world. What they\u2019re doing is really, really hard.\u201d\nA study released on Monday by New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business showed how hard. It said that a major problem with the accord and the alliance was that while they will inspect 2,000 of Bangladesh\u2019s more than 5,000 apparel factories, the more than 3,000 others generally have worse conditions \u2014 and middlemen often secretly send them orders from Western brands.\nEllen O. Tauscher, a former House member from California who is chairwoman of the alliance\u2019s board, said the Rana Plaza collapse \u201cchanged everything\u201d and forced companies to act. She added, however, that solving the problem of factory safety in Bangladesh is \u201ca very heavy lift.\u201d\n\u201cBangladesh has a history of corruption, of political turbulence,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where these businesses, instead of walking away, decided to do what is not typical for business. Most businesses spend most of their time trying to buy down risk. These businesses decided to take on risk. The question is, How do you do this in a way that makes material change quickly?\u201d\nThe accord has hired 110 engineers to inspect for unsafe electrical boxes, structural soundness and sprinkler systems \u2014 a new requirement for all Bangladeshi garment industry buildings 75 feet or taller.\nThe alliance has inspected 400 factories so far, and the European-dominated accord, 300. The alliance has set a goal of inspecting all of its members\u2019 630 Bangladeshi factories by July 10; the accord\u2019s goal is to inspect its 1,500 factories by late October.\nThe inspectors have found serious problems: buildings so overloaded that their columns had cracks, flammable fabric storage areas adjoining work spaces, fire stairways leading to the factory floor rather than outside the building. The cost of fixing the problems can be substantial \u2014 from several thousand dollars for a few fire doors to $250,000 for a sprinkler system.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found problems in every factory we\u2019ve inspected,\u201d said Brad Loewen, the accord\u2019s chief safety inspector. \u201cThere are lockable gates at 90 percent of the factories, and occasionally they\u2019re even locked when our engineers are there.\u201d\nAs a result of the accord\u2019s inspections, four factory buildings have been ordered temporarily closed for fear of collapse, while the accord has asked a government committee to close four others. Questioning the thoroughness of the alliance\u2019s inspections, some accord members ask why the alliance has had only one factory closed even though it has conducted more inspections.\nIan Spaulding, a senior adviser to the alliance, said that it had asked the Bangladeshi government to order four more factories closed because of serious structural problems. He said the alliance was blamed unfairly \u2014 partly because labor unions and a vocal university group, United Students Against Sweatshops, are constantly belittling it.\n\u201cWe need to do a better job as an organization telling our story,\u201d Mr. Spaulding said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fall victim to this tit-for-tat thing. The alliance isn\u2019t perfect, and the accord isn\u2019t perfect.\u201d\nSome alliance members fault the accord for not paying wages to the more than 2,500 workers at the Softex factory when it was closed in March after accord inspectors found structural problems that needed urgent attention. The alliance says that it has a $5 million fund to pay half the wages of Bangladeshi workers laid off in such a situation. (The factory owner is supposed to pay the other half.) Under the accord\u2019s rules, factory owners are supposed to pay all the lost wages, if they can.\nRezwan Selim, Softex\u2019s chief executive, asserted that his factory was closed without due process and that the accord was not being cooperative or professional. Mr. Selim said he took out a bank loan to pay the wages after the workers engaged in protests.\nRob Wayss, the accord\u2019s executive director for Bangladesh, said his group\u2019s exacting inspections had met with some resistance from factory owners. He said the accord had adhered to the letter of the law in closing plants and had pledged to help factory owners pay lost wages and finance needed safety improvements if they demonstrated that they could not afford those things themselves.\nMr. Wayss said one of the accord\u2019s signal achievements was allowing the public to see detailed inspection reports of factories, which include photos showing dangerous electrical boxes and cracks in columns.\n\u201cThis showed an unprecedented level of transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cThe purpose is to identify safety concerns and have people who work in the factory, people who own the factory and people who produce in the factory understand what needs to be fixed.\u201d\nThe alliance, worried about libel lawsuits and first getting the go-ahead from Bangladeshi authorities, has not made any inspection reports public.\n\u201cHopefully the accord\u2019s transparency will force the alliance to up its game,\u201d Professor O\u2019Rourke said.\nScott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a monitoring group and accord member, said many of the alliance\u2019s inspections piggybacked on inspections done earlier for Walmart, asserting that those inspections had not been rigorous enough.\nHe pointed to Walmart-sponsored inspections of the Dird Garments factory in September that gave B grades for structural and electrical safety. But when the accord\u2019s engineers inspected Dird this month, they found \u201curgent concerns,\u201d including \u201chighly stressed columns\u201d and dangerous overloading. They ordered the removal of loads from several floors and the emptying of the water tank on the roof.\nAlliance officials defended Walmart\u2019s inspections, saying they are made by structural and electrical engineers and not by compliance monitors, as they once were. After the Tazreen fire in 2012, Walmart increased the frequency and rigor of its inspections.\nKevin Gardner, a Walmart spokesman, said, \u201cBe assured, the factory safety inspections Walmart has undertaken in Bangladesh over the past year are comprehensive.\u201d\nAlliance officials say their engineers perform demanding inspections that often supplement those done earlier.\nUnhappy about the tit for tat, Ms. Tauscher said: \u201cThis is really not a competition between the alliance and the accord. This is about working together to change the lives of workers in Bangladesh.\u201d\nBut Professor O\u2019Rourke said the rivalry was undeniable. \u201cThere\u2019s one good aspect about the competition,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pushing both sides to raise the bar on what they\u2019re doing to improve safety.\u201d"}, {"text": "Two Groups Complete Inspections of 1,700 Bangladesh Garment Factories \n2014-10-14T00:37:34.000Z\nTwo big groups of retailers and apparel brands have completed a major step toward advancing garment-factory safety in Bangladesh: They have finished inspecting nearly 1,700 factories in that country.\nA European-dominated group \u2014 the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety, with 189 corporate members, including H&M and Carrefour \u2014 said on Tuesday that it had found more than 80,000 safety problems in the 1,106 factories it inspected.\nThe other \u2014 an American-dominated group, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety \u2014 completed inspections in July of the 587 factories that its 26 members, including Walmart, Gap and Target, use in that country.\nThe groups are working with Bangladeshi factory owners to promote safety and finance improvements, like fireproof doors or fire-sprinkler systems, that are required for garment factories 75 feet or taller in Bangladesh.\n\u201cWe have found safety hazards in all factories, which was to be expected,\u201d said Brad Loewen, the chief safety inspector of the Bangladesh Accord. \u201cThe safety findings have ranged from minor to significant.\u201d\nIan Spaulding, a senior adviser to the Alliance, said: \u201cInspections were the easy part. Now comes the hard part.\u201d\nThe Alliance estimated that it would cost $250,000 on average for safety improvements at each factory. Alan Roberts, the Accord\u2019s executive director for international operations, said the cost for some factories would be $1 million.\nAll that is needed at some sites is removing machinery and stored fabric from overloaded floors, while others will need sprinkler systems, automated alarm systems and the strengthening of support columns.\nLabor unions and consumer groups pushed apparel retailers to form these two efforts after the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed in Bangladesh in April 2013, killing 1,129 workers.\n\u201cThe reforms we are working so hard to achieve are long overdue,\u201d said Ellen Tauscher, a former congresswoman who is chairwoman of the Alliance\u2019s board. \nEarly on, several Accord officials criticized the Alliance, saying that its inspections would not be as rigorous as the Accord\u2019s. But Alliance officials noted this week that its inspectors asked a Bangladesh review committee to temporarily shut 17 of its 587 factories because of urgent safety problems \u2014 a higher percentage than for the Accord, which asked that 24 of its 1,106 inspected factories be temporarily shut, with four remaining permanently closed. \nThe Accord\u2019s members \u2014 mainly European, but including some American and Asian companies \u2014 use about 1,500 factories in Bangladesh. The group said that in addition to its 1,106 inspections, it would use 300 inspection reports the Alliance did for factories that produced for companies from both groups. In addition, the Accord said it had not yet inspected 100 factories that its company members listed toward the end of the initial inspection program.\nThe International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, will make low-interest loans available to Bangladeshi factory owners for safety improvements, so long as overseas customers of those factories guarantee the loans. \n\u201cThe bottom line is the vast majority of factory owners have been absolutely cooperative throughout,\u201d said Mr. Roberts of the Accord. \u201cThey see this as a benefit to their industry, as opposed to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, which thought the industry would be decimated by this.\u201d\nThe Bangladeshi government has a separate National Action Plan to inspect an additional 1,500 often smaller factories not used directly by Accord or Alliance members, but thus far only 400 of them have been inspected. Engineers from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology have inspected them, but with that effort going more slowly than planned, Bangladesh plans to ask companies to help complete those inspections."}, {"text": "3 Retailers Give Aid to Bangladesh Workers\n2014-03-28T23:14:31.000Z\nWalmart, Gap and Children\u2019s Place this week became the first three United States companies to contribute toward a $40 million fund for victims of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh last April, in which more than 1,100 workers died.\nThose retailers made their donations indirectly through BRAC USA, the North American affiliate of the Bangladeshi development organization BRAC, which announced that it had contributed $2.2 million to the Rana Plaza victims\u2019 fund thanks to contributions it had received from those companies and their affiliates.\nSixteen companies have contributed to the victims\u2019 fund, known as the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund, which aims to pay lost wages, medical bills and other compensation to the disaster\u2019s approximately 4,000 victims, including the injured, the families of the dead and unemployed survivors. Other contributors to the fund include El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, Inditex, Loblaw, Mango and Primark.\nWalmart said that it, along with the Walmart Foundation and Asda, a British supermarket subsidiary, had contributed $3 million to BRAC USA, one-third of which went to the Rana Plaza victims\u2019 fund. The Gap Foundation and Children\u2019s Place each gave $500,000 to BRAC USA.\nJan Saumweber, Walmart\u2019s vice president for responsible sourcing, said in a statement that, \u201cWhile we did not have production at Rana Plaza at the time of the building collapse, our contribution\u201d to the victims\u2019 fund \u201cunderlines our longstanding commitment to raise standards in our supply chain in Bangladesh.\u201d\nIrene Zeldenrust, the international coordinator of the Clean Clothes Campaign, a European anti-sweatshop group that pushed hard to create the victims\u2019 fund, estimated that the fund had commitments for $14 million of the $40 million sought. The International Labor Organization is overseeing the fund.\n\u201cThis is the first time Walmart has contributed to any compensation fund for loss of income and medical costs \u2014 that is a positive step,\u201d Ms. Zeldenrust said. \u201cBut this amount is pitifully low. We\u2019re hoping that they consider this just an initial contribution. It is a token amount considering Walmart is the largest retailer in the world.\u201d\nBoth Walmart and Children\u2019s Place denied having production in any of the five factories inside Rana Plaza at the time of the collapse. But labor groups had pressured Walmart and Children\u2019s Place to contribute to the fund because they had been linked to production there. Documents recovered after the collapse showed that a Canadian supplier for Walmart had used Ether Tex, a factory on the fifth floor, to make jeans for Walmart a year before the collapse. And customs documents showed that in the eight months before the collapse, the New Wave factory inside Rana Plaza had produced more than 120,000 pounds of clothing for Children\u2019s Place.\nGap was never linked to production at Rana Plaza. Bill Chandler, a Gap spokesman, said: \u201cRana Plaza underscores the need for government, factory owners, development organizations, labor groups and retailers to take action to improve the lives of garment workers. This week\u2019s donation by the Gap Foundation was just one action of many to see lasting change occur in Bangladesh.\u201d\nChildren\u2019s Place issued a statement saying that its \u201cdonation to aid the victims of the Rana Plaza tragedy is incremental to the company\u2019s ongoing work and contributions to realize a safer workplace for Bangladesh garment industry workers.\u201d\nMs. Zeldenrust said her group would campaign in France, Italy and Germany this week to press Benetton, Carrefour and other retailers to contribute to the fund. Primark, an Anglo-Irish, retailer has pledged more than $7 million to help Rana Plaza victims."}, {"text": "Bangladesh\u2019s Governing Party Wins Vote Amid Unrest\n2014-01-07T02:02:25.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladesh\u2019s governing party celebrated its victory in general elections on Monday, dismissing critics who said the vote\u2019s legitimacy was undercut by violence, low turnout and the absence of the country\u2019s main opposition force from the ballots.\nThe party, the Awami League, won 232 of the 300 seats in Bangladesh\u2019s new Parliament, about half of the victors unopposed. Partial results published by Bangladesh\u2019s Election Commission put the average turnout on Sunday at 39.8 percent, though that figure appeared to have been padded by an influx of pro-government activists who arrived at polling stations shortly before they closed.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina, receiving journalists in her home on Monday, put the blame on the main opposition force, the Bangladesh National Party, which boycotted the election and carried out a campaign to discourage turnout. Some observers had hoped that the poor results would force the warring parties to negotiate a new, more inclusive round of elections. But Mrs. Hasina took a tough tone\u00a0on Monday, saying she would not enter talks unless the opposition first renounced violence. \n\u201cToday, democracy is tainted by the blood of innocent people and soaked by the tears of burned people, who have fallen victim to the violent political program that is hitting the nation\u2019s conscience,\u201d she said. She added she had ordered the army to \u201ccurb any post-poll terrorism and violence with iron hands.\u201d \nAt least 22 people were killed on Sunday, in some cases when police officers opened fire on opposition activists. Another seven people were killed in clashes on Monday, Bangladeshi news media reported.\nAfter preventing it earlier, the authorities allowed a reporter from The New York Times to interview the opposition leader, Khaleda Zia, in the house where she has been confined since Dec. 29. Mrs. Zia called Sunday\u2019s vote a \u201cfarcical election\u201d and said she believed that turnout had been closer to 10 percent. \nShe said the Bangladesh National Party leaders were prepared to start negotiations immediately, after the government releases party workers who had been arrested in a pre-election crackdown. \u201cYes, we are ready to discuss, but first, they have to create a more congenial atmosphere\u201d she said. \u201cAll the senior leaders, they are in jail. I have so many workers, they are in jail. Other senior leaders, they are in hiding. They have to clear the atmosphere.\u201d\nIn the interview, Mrs. Zia also signaled some willingness to reconsider her party\u2019s ties with the banned pro-Islamic party Jamaat-e-Islami, as the government has demanded. \u201cWith Jamaat, it\u2019s not a permanent alliance,\u201d she said. Asked if she could end it, she said, \u201cAt this moment, I cannot, but when the time will come I will see.\u201d \nThe United States and Britain issued critical statements on Monday. A State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, urged both sides \u201cto find a way to hold as soon as possible elections that are free, fair, peaceful and credible, reflecting the will of the Bangladeshi people.\u201d \nThere was also some grumbling on the street. One of the country\u2019s most popular newspapers, Prothom Alo, printed in Bengali, published the headline \u201cFake Vote, Disgraceful Election,\u201d and an editorial cartoon showed Mrs. Hasina jubilantly running across a finish line while her rivals watched from a few feet away, tied to a tree. \n\u201cI am a citizen and voter of this country, and I have been deprived of voting, so I am not happy with these polls,\u201d Mohammad Minhaz, 28, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the newly elected government will be able to run the country smoothly for a long time.\u201d\nIn 1996, it was the Awami League that boycotted elections being held by the Bangladesh National Party. The party went ahead with them, but turnout was extraordinarily low, and Mrs. Zia, under pressure, held a new round of elections four months later. Dan W. Mozena, the American ambassador in Dhaka, said he was convinced that a similar solution was within reach. \n\u201cThis is a very sophisticated culture \u2014 they can devise quickly a way to weave themselves through this thicket so that they can come up with a way to hold free, fair, credible elections,\u201d he said.

His mother still breast-fed him. His family had six goats, access to fresh buffalo milk and a hut filled with hundreds of pounds of wheat and potatoes. The economy of the state where he lives has for years grown faster than almost any other. His mother said she fed him as much as he would eat and took him four times to doctors, who diagnosed malnutrition. Just before Vivek was born in this green landscape of small plots and grazing water buffalo near the Nepali border, the family even got electricity.\nSo why was Vivek malnourished?\nIt is a question being asked about children across India, where a long economic boom has done little to reduce the vast number of children who are malnourished and stunted, leaving them with mental and physical deficits that will haunt them their entire lives. Now, an emerging body of scientific studies suggest that Vivek and many of the 162 million  other children under the age of 5 in the world who are malnourished are suffering less a lack of food than poor sanitation.\nLike almost everyone else in their village, Vivek and his family have no toilet, and the district where they live has the highest concentration of people who defecate outdoors. As a result, children are exposed to a bacterial brew that often sickens them, leaving them unable to attain a healthy body weight no matter how much food they eat.\n\u201cThese children\u2019s bodies divert energy and nutrients away from growth and brain development to prioritize infection-fighting survival,\u201d said Jean Humphrey, a professor of human nutrition at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cWhen this happens during the first two years of life, children become stunted. What\u2019s particularly disturbing is that the lost height and intelligence are permanent.\u201d\nTwo years ago, Unicef, the World Health Organization and the World Bank released a major report on child malnutrition that focused entirely on a lack of food. Sanitation was not mentioned. Now, Unicef officials and those from other major charitable organizations said in interviews that they believe that poor sanitation may cause more than half of the world\u2019s stunting problems.\n\u201cOur realization about the connection between stunting and sanitation is just emerging,\u201d said Sue Coates, chief of water, sanitation and hygiene at Unicef India. \u201cAt this point, it is still just an hypothesis, but it is an incredibly exciting and important one because of its potential impact.\u201d\nThis research has quietly swept through many of the world\u2019s nutrition and donor organizations in part because it resolves a great mystery: Why are Indian children so much more malnourished than their poorer counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa?\nA child raised in India is far more likely to be malnourished than one from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe or Somalia, the planet\u2019s poorest countries. Stunting affects 65 million Indian children under the age of 5, including a third of children from the country\u2019s  richest families.\nThis disconnect between wealth and malnutrition is so striking that economists have concluded that economic growth does almost nothing to reduce malnutrition.\nHalf of India\u2019s population, or at least 620 million people, defecate outdoors. And while this share has declined slightly in the past decade, an analysis of census data shows that rapid population growth has meant that most Indians are being exposed to more human waste than ever before.\nIn Sheohar, for instance, a toilet-building program between 2001 and 2011 decreased the share of households without toilets to 80 percent from 87 percent, but population growth meant that exposure to human waste rose by half.\n\u201cThe difference in average height between Indian and African children can be explained entirely by differing concentrations of open defecation,\u201d said Dean Spears, an economist at the Delhi School of Economics. \u201cThere are far more people defecating outside in India more closely to one another\u2019s children and homes than there are in Africa or anywhere else in the world.\u201d\nNot only does stunting contribute to the deaths of a million children under the age of 5 each year, but those who survive suffer cognitive deficits and are poorer and sicker than children not affected by stunting. They also may face increased risks for adult illnesses like diabetes, heart attacks and strokes.\n\u201cIndia\u2019s stunting problem represents the largest loss of human potential in any country in history, and it affects 20 times more people in India alone than H.I.V./AIDS does around the world,\u201d said Ramanan Laxminarayan, vice president for research and policy at the Public Health Foundation of India.\nIndia is an increasingly risky place to raise children. The country\u2019s sanitation and air quality are among the worst in the world. Parasitic diseases and infections like tuberculosis, often linked with poor sanitation, are most common in India. More than one in four newborn deaths occur in India.\nOpen defecation has long been an issue in India. Some ancient Hindu texts advised people to relieve themselves far from home, a practice that Gandhi sought to curb.\n\u201cThe cause of many of our diseases is the condition of our lavatories and our bad habit of disposing of excreta anywhere and everywhere,\u201d Gandhi wrote in 1925.\nOther developing countries have made huge strides in improving sanitation. Just 1 percent of Chinese and 3 percent of Bangladeshis relieve themselves outside compared with half of Indians. Attitudes may be just as important as access to toilets. Constructing and maintaining tens of millions of toilets in India would cost untold billions, a price many voters see no need to pay \u2014 a recent survey found that many people prefer going to the bathroom outside.\nFew rural households build the sort of inexpensive latrines that have all but eliminated outdoor waste in neighboring Bangladesh.\nOne analysis found that government spending on toilets pays for itself in increased tax receipts from greater productivity, but the math works only if every member of a family who gets a toilet uses it.\n\u201cWe need a cultural revolution in this country to completely change people\u2019s attitudes toward sanitation and hygiene,\u201d said Jairam Ramesh, an economist and former sanitation minister.\nIndia\u2019s government has for decades tried to resolve the country\u2019s stubborn malnutrition problems by distributing vast stores of subsidized food. But more and better food has largely failed to reverse early stunting, studies have repeatedly shown.\nIndia now spends about $26 billion annually on food and jobs programs, and less than $400 million on improving sanitation \u2014 a ratio of more than 60 to 1.\n\u201cWe need to reverse that ratio entirely,\u201d Dr. Laxminarayan said.\nLack of food is still an important contributor to malnutrition for some children, and some researchers say the field\u2019s sudden embrace of sanitation has been overdone. \u201cIn South Asia, a more important factor driving stunting is diet quality,\u201d said  Zulfiqar A. Bhutta, a director of the Center for Global Child Health at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.\nStudies are underway in Bangladesh, Kenya and Zimbabwe to assess the share of stunting attributable to poor sanitation. \u201cIs it 50 percent? Ninety percent? That\u2019s a question worth answering,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Luby, a professor of medicine at Stanford University who is overseeing a trial in Bangladesh that is expected to report its results in 2016. \u201cIn the meantime, I think we can all agree that it\u2019s not a good idea to raise children surrounded by poop.\u201d\nBetter sanitation in the West during the 19th and early 20th centuries led to huge improvements in health long before the advent of vaccines and antibiotics, and researchers have long known that childhood environments play a crucial role in child death and adult height.\nThe present research on gut diseases in children has focused on a condition resulting from repeated bacterial infections that flatten intestinal linings, reducing by a third the ability to absorb nutrients. A recent study of starving children found that they lacked the crucial gut bacteria needed to digest food.\nIn a little-discussed but surprising finding, Muslim children in India are 17 percent more likely to survive infancy than Hindus, even though Muslims are generally poorer and less educated. This enormous difference in infant mortality is explained by the fact that Muslims are far more likely to use latrines and live next to others also using latrines, a recent analysis found.\nSo widespread housing discrimination that confines many Muslims to separate slums may protect their children from increased exposure to the higher levels of waste in Hindu communities and, as a result, save thousands of Indian Muslim babies from death each year.\nJust building more toilets, however, may not be enough to save India\u2019s children.\nPhool Mati lives in a neighborhood in Varanasi with 12 public toilets, but her 1-year-old grandson, Sandeep, is nonetheless severely malnourished. His mother tries to feed him lentils, milk and other foods as often as she can, but Sandeep is rarely hungry because he is so often sick, Ms. Mati said.\n\u201cWe all use the bathroom,\u201d she said.\nThe effluent pipe that served the bathroom building is often clogged. Raw sewage seeps into an adjoining Hindu temple, and, during the monsoon season, it flooded the neighborhood\u2019s homes. The matron of the toilet facility charges two rupees for each use, so most children relieve themselves directly into open drains that run along a central walkway.\nNo Indian city has a comprehensive waste treatment system, and most Indian rivers are open sewers as a result. But Varanasi, India\u2019s oldest and holiest city, is so awash in human waste that its decrepit condition became a national issue in recent elections. The city\u2019s sewage plants can handle only about 20 percent of the sewage generated in the city, said Ramesh Chopra of Ganga Seva Abhiyanam, a trust for cleaning the river. The rest sloshes into the Ganges or fetid ponds and pits.\nMillions of pilgrims bathe in the Ganges along Varanasi\u2019s ancient riverfront, but a stream of human waste \u2014 nearly 75 million liters per day \u2014 flows directly into the river just above the bathing ghats, steps leading down to the river. Many people wash or brush their teeth beside smaller sewage outlets.\nMuch of the city\u2019s drinking water comes from the river, and half of Indian households drink from contaminated supplies.\n\u201cIndia\u2019s problems are bigger than just open defecation and a lack of toilets,\u201d Dr. Laxminarayan said."}, {"text": "The Trouble With Rice\n"}, {"text": "Climate Change Deemed Growing Security Threat by Military Researchers\n2014-05-14T02:20:31.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The accelerating rate of climate change poses a severe risk to national security and acts as a catalyst for global political conflict, a report published Tuesday by a leading government-funded military research organization concluded.\nThe CNA Corporation Military Advisory Board found that climate change-induced drought in the Middle East and Africa is leading to conflicts over food and water and escalating longstanding regional and ethnic tensions into violent clashes. The report also found that rising sea levels are putting people and food supplies in vulnerable coastal regions like eastern India, Bangladesh and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam at risk and could lead to a new wave of refugees.\nIn addition, the report predicted that an increase in catastrophic weather events around the world will create more demand for American troops, even as flooding and extreme weather events at home could damage naval ports and military bases.\nIn an interview, Secretary of State John Kerry signaled that the report\u2019s findings would influence American foreign policy.\n\u201cTribes are killing each other over water today,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cThink of what happens if you have massive dislocation, or the drying up of the waters of the Nile, of the major rivers in China and India. The intelligence community takes it seriously, and it\u2019s translated into action.\u201d\nMr. Kerry, who plans to deliver a major speech this summer on the links between climate change and national security, said his remarks would also be aimed at building political support for President Obama\u2019s climate change agenda, including a new regulation to cut pollution from coal-fired power plants that the administration will introduce in June.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to lay out to people legitimate options for action that are not bank-breaking or negative,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.\nPentagon officials said the report would affect military policy. \u201cThe department certainly agrees that climate change is having an impact on national security, whether by increasing global instability, by opening the Arctic or by increasing sea level and storm surge near our coastal installations,\u201d John Conger, the Pentagon\u2019s deputy under secretary of defense for installations and environment, said in a statement. \u201cWe are actively integrating climate considerations across the full spectrum of our activities to ensure a ready and resilient force.\u201d\nThe report on Tuesday follows a recent string of scientific studies that warn that the effects of climate change are already occurring and that flooding, droughts, extreme storms, food and water shortages and damage to infrastructure will occur in the near future.\nIn March, the Pentagon\u2019s Quadrennial Defense Review, the agency\u2019s main public document describing the current doctrine of the United States military, drew a direct link between the effects of global warming \u2014 like rising sea levels and extreme weather patterns \u2014 and terrorism.\n\u201cThese effects are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad, such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability and social tensions \u2014 conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence,\u201d the review said.\nTuesday\u2019s report is an update of a report by the center\u2019s Military Advisory Board in 2007, the first major study to draw the link between climate change and national security. The report\u2019s authors said the biggest change in the seven years between the two studies was the increase in scientific certainty about global warming, and of the link between global warming and security disruptions.\nThe 2007 report also described climate change as a \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d or a problem that could enhance or contribute to already existing causes of global disruption. The 2014 report updates that language, calling climate change a \u201ccatalyst for conflict\u201d \u2014 a phrase intentionally chosen, the report\u2019s authors said, to signal that climate change is an active, driving force in starting conflict.\n\u201cIn the past, the thinking was that climate change multiplied the significance of a situation,\u201d said Gen. Charles F. Wald, who contributed to both reports and is retired from the Air Force. \u201cNow we\u2019re saying it\u2019s going to be a direct cause of instability.\u201d\nThe most recent scientific reports on climate change warn that increasing drought in Africa is now turning arable land to desert. The national security report\u2019s authors conclude that the slow but steady expansion of the Sahara through Mali, which is killing crops and leaving farmers starving, may have been a contributing force in the jihadist uprising in that African country in 2012. Since then, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has seized control of northern Mali and remains in conflict with the Malian government.\nThe report warns that rising sea levels in the United States imperil many of the Navy\u2019s coastal installations. Last week, the White House released a National Climate Assessment report citing Norfolk, Va., as one of the cities most vulnerable to damage by rising sea levels. Norfolk is home to the world\u2019s largest naval base as well as a nuclear submarine construction yard \u2014 all of which are vulnerable to destruction by rising sea levels, found in Tuesday\u2019s report.\n\u201cNorfolk is so big, it\u2019s so important to the Navy, it\u2019s important to Virginia for jobs, and it would go,\u201d General Wald said.\nA scientific report released this week found that global warming has contributed to the melting of a large section of a West Antarctica ice sheet, which could lead to a rise in sea level of 10 feet or more.\nSenator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a vocal skeptic of the established science that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming, scoffed at the idea that climate change is linked to national security threats.\n\u201cThere is no one in more pursuit of publicity than a retired military officer,\u201d he said of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cI look back wistfully at the days of the Cold War. Now you have people who are mentally imbalanced, with the ability to deploy a nuclear weapon. For anyone to say that any type of global warming is anywhere close to the threat that we have with crazy people running around with nuclear weapons, it shows how desperate they are to get the public to buy this.\u201d\nRear Adm. David Titley, a co-author of the report and a meteorologist who is retired from the Navy, said political opposition would not extinguish what he called the indisputable data in the report.\n\u201cThe ice doesn\u2019t care about politics or who\u2019s caucusing with whom, or Democrats or Republicans,\u201d said Admiral Titley, who now directs the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Pennsylvania State University."}, {"text": "Climate Signals, Growing Louder\n2014-04-01T02:14:00.000Z\nPerhaps now the deniers will cease their attacks on the science of climate change, and the American public will, at last, fully accept that global warming is a danger now and an even graver threat to future generations. \nOn Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group that since 1990 has been issuing increasingly grim warnings about the consequences of a warming planet, released its most powerful and sobering assessment so far. Even now, it said, ice caps are melting, droughts and floods are getting worse, coral reefs are dying. And without swift and decisive action to limit greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and other sources, the world will almost surely face centuries of climbing temperatures, rising seas, species loss and dwindling agricultural yields. The damage will be particularly acute in coastal communities and in low-lying poor countries \u2014 like Bangladesh \u2014 that are least able to protect themselves. \nThe report\u2019s conclusions mirrored those of a much shorter but no less disturbing report issued two weeks ago by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world\u2019s largest scientific society. Like the panel, the association declared that the world is already feeling the effects of global warming, that the ultimate consequences could be catastrophic, and that the window for effective action is swiftly closing.\nThe intergovernmental panel\u2019s report (a companion report later this month will discuss what governments should do) could carry considerable weight with delegates to next year\u2019s climate change summit meeting in Paris, at which the members of the United Nations will again try, after years of futility, to fashion a new global climate treaty. And together, the two reports could build public support for President Obama\u2019s efforts to use his executive authority to limit greenhouse gases, most recently with a plan issued on Friday to reduce methane emissions from landfills, agricultural operations and oil and gas production and distribution. \nThe methane strategy is one of several weapons in Mr. Obama\u2019s broader Climate Action Plan, announced last year, that seeks to reduce emissions by circumventing an obstructionist Congress by aggressively using his executive authority under the Clean Air Act and other statutes. The most important of these are two rules from the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 one already proposed, another in the works \u2014 that would regulate emissions from new and existing coal-fired power plants, the largest source of industrial carbon pollution. He has also promised to increase energy efficiency in appliances and buildings, and double renewable energy capacity on public lands by 2020. \nThe methane abatement plan is a welcome addition to that arsenal. Methane, a product of animal wastes and of decomposing material in landfills, and the main component in natural gas, contributes only about 9 percent of America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. And natural gas, as a fuel, is much cleaner than coal. But methane is a powerful atmospheric pollutant, 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide, and thus a major driver of global warming. \nThe burden for fulfilling the president\u2019s promise will fall on the E.P.A., which is charged with developing regulations to plug methane leaks in pipelines and in oil and gas production systems. Given everything we now know, public and congressional acceptance of these initiatives should be close to automatic. But, of course, it is not. Senator Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate Republicans, seeks to block the coal regulations. Industry groups are complaining in advance about methane regulations. \nSome of this may be attributable to public misunderstanding. A poll last year found that one-third of Americans believed that scientists disagreed on whether global warming was happening. These studies suggest virtually no disagreement. The hope among advocates is that the latest show of scientific solidarity will clear up any confusion about the causes and consequences of climate change and the need for action.

The first 3-D printed handgun. An \u201cOccupy Sandy\u201d sign made by grass-roots organizers in New York after Hurricane Sandy.\nThese are among the objects going on view this month at the Victoria and Albert Museum here in separate exhibitions that push the boundaries of museum collecting and design. \u201cRapid Response Collecting,\u201d which opened this past weekend, offers a new approach to how museums codify contemporary items as historical, while \u201cDisobedient Objects,\u201d which is to open on July 26, showcases material made by social movements worldwide.\nThe exhibitions operate like agents provocateurs inside the Victoria and Albert, Britain\u2019s pre-eminent applied art and design museum, challenging visitors to rethink their relationship to everyday objects and consider the human costs behind items from mass-produced clothing to electronic cigarettes. The exhibitions also prompt a reconsideration of the social history of other items in the museum\u2019s august collection.\n\u201cDesign isn\u2019t always about nice tables and beautiful chairs,\u201d Martin Roth, the museum\u2019s director, said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cAll those objects really belong to everyone, that\u2019s the amazing part of it, so what we\u2019re doing right now is to bring the discussion from outside the museum inside the museum.\u201d\nRapid-response collecting represents a new strategy for the museum. The objects are chosen by four curators hired last year in the contemporary architecture, design and digital department, with a mandate to bring items of timely relevance into the permanent collection quickly. The four discuss and vet the objects, looking for items that tell a larger story about our time. \nCorinna Gardner, the curator of contemporary product design and rapid-response collecting at the Victoria and Albert, said that there had always been \u201csomething of the country home\u201d about the museum, which is most famous for its William Morris textiles and its tea sets, and that the rapid-response initiative was a way to broaden the collection beyond work by professional designers. \n\u201cIt\u2019s about finding a way for us to act, for the museum, that\u2019s timely and in response to what\u2019s happening in the world around us,\u201d Ms. Gardner said. \u201cIt\u2019s about us looking outward to see how events, important things that happen, are articulated in the field of design, or how those objects are part of that change.\u201d \nThe first 12 items on view in what will be a continuing rotation \u2014 and can be found on the museum\u2019s public online database \u2014 include black cargo pants made for the Primark clothing brand at the Rana Plaza workshop in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which collapsed in April 2013, killing more than 1,100 people and generating outrage about working conditions in the garment industry. (Primark provided the pants for the exhibition and confirmed their provenance.)\nAlso on view is an Ikea stuffed wolf tossed last December by anti-government protesters at Leung Chun-ying, Hong Kong\u2019s most senior political official, whose nickname is the Wolf, and stilettos donated by the French shoemaker Christian Louboutin in various shades of \u201cnude\u201d to reflect the skin tones of different races.\nOne case holds the Liberator, the first 3-D printed gun, made in 2013 in Texas by Cody Wilson, a libertarian law student who posted the design for the gun on his website until the United States government ordered him to remove it. The gun, the curators write, \u201ctransforms the way we think about new manufacturing technologies and the unregulated sharing of designs online.\u201d\nBy adding mass-produced items into its permanent collection and calling attention to sweatshop conditions behind some products, the Victoria and Albert is also taking a stance on what items it considers historical \u2014 making rapid-response collecting inevitably political. But the curators say they aren\u2019t trying to be polemical. \n\u201cThe key thing is that we want the visitors to have the freedom of their imagination to draw their own conclusions about this object,\u201d Kieran Long, the museum\u2019s senior curator of contemporary architecture, design and digital, said about the 3-D gun. \nAs for the Primark pants, or a set of false eyelashes endorsed by the pop star Katy Perry and handmade by women in Indonesia, \u201cwhat I want the visitors to experience is the moment where they can take a position around a very complex issue like globalized manufacturing or the impact of technology on all our lives,\u201d Mr. Long added. \nOther museums are taking notice. \u00a0The Museum of Modern Art in New York included the 3-D gun in an online debate, \u201cDesign and Violence.\u201d Sebastian Chan, the director of digital and emerging media at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, in New York, called rapid-response collecting \u201ca bold move\u201d that \u201copens up a new way for the museum to engage the public in the social and political context of the designed products and services in the world around them.\u201d He added that when the Cooper Hewitt reopens in December after a renovation, it will have space for \u201cour own rapid-response initiatives and we will be watching the V&A\u2019s work closely.\u201d \nRapid response isn\u2019t the Victoria and Albert\u2019s only experiment in politically engaged collecting. \u201cDisobedient Objects,\u201d an exhibition of 99 items selected from protest movements over the past three decades will be on view until Feb. 1. Almost all of the items are on loan from participants involved in the movements and won\u2019t join the museum\u2019s permanent collection.\nThe show includes papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and cardboard puppets made by the Bread and Puppet theater in Vermont to protest the first Iraq war, buttons from the 1980s in solidarity with an imprisoned Nelson Mandela and \u201cSilence = Death\u201d posters from the AIDS activists Act Up.\nThey are also putting on view a balloonlike inflatable silver cobblestone, a symbol of protest since the 19th century that was made in 2012 and used in demonstrations from Berlin to Barcelona, turning interactions between protesters and the police into a kind of political theater.\nThe exhibition \u201cisn\u2019t a canon, or a final word,\u201d said Gavin Grindon, a visiting research fellow at the museum. \u201cIt\u2019s an invitation to start thinking about social movements.\u201d Mr. Grindon and Catherine Flood, a Victoria and Albert curator of prints, organized the show. \nThe curators have also created a blog, with downloadable \u201chow-to\u201d guides, showing instructions for making a shield in the form of a book and a tear-gas mask out of a plastic bottle. \nSome might balk at such a politically charged exhibition at a publicly funded institution, but the curators at the Victoria and Albert say the museum has had a long history of socially engaged collecting, and today they see part of its mission as exploring the design of social movements and the social history of everyday objects. \n\u201cIt\u2019s there, it\u2019s out in the streets, so why don\u2019t we discuss it in here?\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we think the same way. It doesn\u2019t mean that we support these kinds of movements.

But it has evolved since the 19th-century pandemics, which killed millions; the new work, by scientists at McMaster University in Ontario, creates the first chance to study the genome of the pandemic \u201cclassical\u201d strain and understand its roots. \nCholera experts at Harvard and Johns Hopkins praised the work, although they disagreed about what it proved about the disease\u2019s recent history.\nUnlike tuberculosis, smallpox and other ills that have plagued humans for millenniums, cholera is fairly modern. The first global pandemic began in 1817, on the fertile flood plain in what is now India and Bangladesh where the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers flow into the Bay of Bengal. \nPreviously, said Hendrik N. Poinar, an evolutionary geneticist at McMaster and a lead author of the study, scientists believed the deadly form of the Vibrio cholerae bacterium might have come into existence as far back as 50,000 years ago. The new research, published Wednesday by The New England Journal of Medicine, resets the \u201cmolecular clock\u201d by showing that it mutated faster than previously assumed, so the disease is clearly less than 5,000 years old, and may be only a few hundred years old.\n\u201cNarrowing it down like that is very interesting,\u201d Dr. Poinar said, because the Indian subcontinent became more arid 5,000 years ago and settlement of the river delta became possible.\nPresumably, the local, largely harmless waterborne Vibrio bacteria \u2014 which thrive there and in brackish estuaries all over the world \u2014 began adapting to human hosts around that time, ultimately developing the ability to make the proteins that open pores in cell membranes in the human gut, so that the cells\u2019 watery contents pour out. \nCholera diarrhea can cause a victim to lose up to five gallons of water a day, leading to rapid death from dehydration and electrolyte loss. The flow washes the bacterium\u2019s progeny out into the drinking water, often infecting new victims.\nOutbreaks probably stayed in the Bay of Bengal area until British ships arrived. In 1817, it began spreading from port to port. \nThe disease repeatedly devastated London; a famous moment in medical history came in 1854 when Dr. John Snow stopped a cholera outbreak in the Soho district by removing the pump handle on a contaminated well. \nSince 1817, seven pandemic waves of cholera have circled the globe; the second, which began in 1830, reached North America in the 1840s. The sixth began in 1961. By then, it had mutated into a new strain, known as El Tor, after the Egyptian city where it was first isolated in pilgrims from Mecca held in quarantine.\nUntil now, scientists had no samples from the first five pandemics to examine. The 1849 intestine samples, which were preserved in alcohol in glass jars and capped with waxed lead, were collected by Dr. John Neill, who worked at Philadelphia\u2019s Southeastern Cholera Hospital. The samples are now in the collection of the M\u00fctter Museum of medical history there. \nBecause the bacteria never enter the blood, cholera DNA cannot be recovered from skeletons. And because it is a warm weather disease, it is not found in victims buried in frozen ground. In 2005, the genome of the 1918 Spanish flu was recreated from DNA found in lung tissue from a victim buried in Alaskan permafrost.\nDr. Poinar\u2019s team removed postage-stamp-size bits of gut tissue and dissolved them. The result was a soup of human DNA snippets \u2014 probably from a male of African descent \u2014 along with DNA from every bacterium and virus in that man\u2019s gut. By fishing out the genes related to those in modern cholera, Dr. Poinar said his team was able to rebuild 96 percent of the genome.\nIt was similar to modern versions of the classical strain but had puzzling \u201cislands\u201d of genes that have since vanished and many more of the genes that code for the toxic protein that jams gut pores. Scientists believe the El Tor strain ultimately replaced the classical one because, while it also causes diarrhea, it is much less lethal \u2014 50 victims get mild cases for each serious one. More survivors means more carriers silently shedding the bacteria.\nJohn J. Mekalanos, a cholera expert at Harvard Medical School, said the new study was the first proof that the second pandemic was caused by the classical strain and powerful evidence that those before 1961 originated in South Asia.\nBut Rita R. Colwell, a cholera expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that was too sweeping a conclusion to draw from one Philadelphia sample. Mildly toxic vibrio bacteria live in many estuaries, including the Chesapeake Bay downstream from Philadelphia, and sometimes sicken people who ingest them. In theory, she said, the Philadelphia outbreak could have been caused by a local vibrio of the classical strain that temporarily mutated into a more dangerous form and then disappeared. \nDr. Mekalanos disagreed, saying vibrios like those in Chesapeake Bay are \u201ca different beast.\u201d\nRight now, there is no obvious practical use for the 1849 genome. Cholera vaccines protect against the modern El Tor strain.\nBut it might be useful, Dr. Poinar said, in knowing what to watch for when screening harmless vibrio for new mutations.\nDr. Mekalanos, who does research into viruses that attack vibrio bacteria, said he saw an intriguing area in the 1849 genome that might produce a bacterial defense against such viruses. \nTo overcome it, he said, \u201cI\u2019d like to know what it\u2019s targeting.\u201d"}, {"text": "Malnutrition: Starving Children Lack Crucial Gut Bacteria\n2014-06-09T18:35:47.000Z\nWhen children are starving, the bacteria that live in their intestines may determine whether they can be saved, scientists working in Bangladesh are reporting. And they say it may become imperative to find a way to give children bacteria as well as food.\nThe study, done by researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, was published by Nature last week.\nTrillions of bacteria in the human gut help digest food and produce vitamins, and they amount to \u201ca microbial organ within an organ,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey I. Gordon, an author of the paper. It takes up to about age 3 for a child to get all the species that seem to be needed, he said. \nBut stool samples showed that severely malnourished children often lack the needed species and do not acquire them even when they are fed nutrition-dense therapeutic foods like the peanut-based Plumpy\u2019Nut or lentil-based porridges for weeks. As a result, they may remain stunted and mentally handicapped although they are getting enough calories to live.\nDr. Gordon said researchers were dosing sterile mice with different human gut microbes, hoping to discover which functions each performs. The goal may be to produce a sort of bacterial soup for children. Fecal transplants, sometimes used to cure severe gut infections in adults, are now unthinkable for Bangladeshi infants, he said, because they would probably also contain dangerous pathogens. "}, {"text": "A Rotten Mango Crisis\n2014-07-05T18:30:03.000Z\nAS an apprentice anthropologist, I once had the misfortune of attempting to converse with the Indian critical theorist Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. Professor Spivak, who translated the work of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida and wrote the famous essay \u201cCan the Subaltern Speak?\u201d, was visiting Dhaka, Bangladesh, and I went to meet her. After patiently listening while I asked a series of dumb questions about discursive practice, she turned and said, cryptically, \u201cI came for the mangoes.\u201d\nAh, the mango. It may be a clich\u00e9d pitfall for the South Asian writer, but for this academic, famous for her impenetrable prose, the mango brought the esoteric down to earth. Ms. Spivak is regarded as one of the great minds of her generation, but in Dhaka, she was, like everyone else, there for the mangoes. \nIn Bangladesh, the obsession with the mango comes from its evanescence. The fruit\u2019s intense seasonality means that even the more prosaic varieties are available for only a few weeks of the summer. The most prized is the langra: Its floral, slightly sour flavor is more complex than the overly sweet chaunsa or Alphonso mangoes. Aficionados love the langra in part because it is almost impossible to catch at its peak \u2014 too green and your tongue will swell and itch; a few hours late and its flesh turns to mush.\nBut this year, the langra is nowhere to be found. The markets are empty.\nOn the roads that lead into Dhaka, the precious fruit lies rotting by the truckload. The reason: chemical poisoning. The langras are said to be contaminated with formalin, a strong solution of formaldehyde that is sprayed on the fruit to extend its life.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the mangoes. Earlier this year, the Institute of Public Health found that 47 of 50 food items tested were adulterated. Formalin is used to preserve both fruit and fish. Turmeric has been tainted with lead. Since June 18, the police have set up mobile formalin-detection units at checkpoints on the roads into the city. Thousands of tons of fruit have been confiscated.\nThe fruit industry is up in arms, claiming that the police are using faulty devices and crippling the industry. Last week, the fruit sellers\u2019 association went on strike, and their produce rotted in the warehouses of the port city of Chittagong. In the weeks leading up to the month of Ramadan, the tussle has been fierce, with demonstrations and counter-demonstrations taking place across Dhaka. And the langra has vanished.\nThe practice of spraying fruit with formalin is one problem, but more worrying is that the entire food chain is compromised \u2014 the soil itself contaminated by toxins that are almost impossible to eradicate. Bangladesh was born in the shadow of famine, and since independence in 1971, a series of government measures have put increasing pressure on farmers to keep the rice yields going up every year. This has meant intensive farming, extensive irrigation and the unchecked use of groundwater. The land has borne the cost of our need to climb out of famine.\nDhaka\u2019s brouhaha over contaminated fruit speaks to a growing chasm between the urban and the rural. This broken, congested city is where we have placed all our hopes for a better Bangladesh. The capital is where you will find the budding start-ups, the college graduates, the cellphone users, the social networkers \u2014 all the engines of economic growth. And as we become more removed from the traditional modes of food production, the agricultural hinterland is being treated as nothing more than the food source for a hungry city.\nThe great irony is that Bangladeshis romanticize the rural. The country, as the American anthropologist James Ferguson put it, provides \u201calternative moral images,\u201d a counterpoint to the complexities \u2014 the allure, as well as the danger \u2014 of rapid urbanization. The rural continues to act as a repository of our fantasies about national identity; our cultural touchstone is Rabindranath Tagore, the great bard of the pastoral in Bengali literature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The greatest compliment you can pay a Bangladeshi is to say she is \u201cmatir manush,\u201d a person of the earth.\nBut when we place checkpoints on the roads into our city, we are saying that we care only if urban citizens are poisoned; we couldn\u2019t care less if the contaminated fruit is consumed outside of Dhaka. Ms. Spivak may have used the mango as a way to express her rootedness, but a taste for mangoes reveals a person to be among the few who can afford them. The truth is, the fruit is grown by the rural poor and fed to the urban rich. To keep the city sated with mangoes, the crop must be abundant and beautiful. And for that, formalin must be involved.\nAs Ramadan approached and the langra disappeared, the fruit sellers and the state came to an agreement. The fruit sellers would end their strike so that the population could sit down to its dates and apples after a long day of fasting; the police agreed to look into obtaining new devices to test the levels of formalin in fruit.\nUnless, however, we think critically about the moral economy of food, about sustainability as well as growth, our food will be tainted. If the rationality of urbanism continues to dominate, we will merely be polishing the surface of a rotting core."}, {"text": "Enslaved Abroad, Oppressed at Home\n2014-10-29T11:58:08.000Z\nIn the last two months, more than 170 men, mostly Bangladeshis, have been rescued from human traffickers in the jungles of Thailand. Some of the men described how they had been offered work, but when they showed up, were drugged, tied up and dragged onto boats where they were beaten and starved. The news caused outrage among Bangladeshis, many of whom blamed their government for failing to protect its citizens. Others expressed dismay at the discovery that this kind of modern-day slavery still exists. \nThe fact that these men were so easily lured into bonded labor abroad is proof of the hopelessness of their lives at home. Although some of the men said that they had not known that they would be shipped to Thailand, most of them were ready to set sail into the unknown. They were desperate for work. \nI grew up in Bangladesh where, in every middle-class household, there\u2019s at least one live-in kajer meye \u2014 a maid or \u201cworking girl\u201d \u2014 often with one or two of her young children serving the family. She works from morning until night, sometimes for very little money, sometimes just for food scraps and basic lodging. \nIn our house she was called \u201cRahela\u2019s Ma,\u201d Mother of Rahela. My siblings and I grew up with her, seeing her every day: cooking, fetching water, combing our hair before school, washing our clothes in the backyard. We never thought it was odd that she did not have a name of her own. We saw Rahela, too, a snotty-nosed baby, sitting on the kitchen floor in oversize hand-me-downs from our family. She was always crying, as her mother was busy grinding turmeric and chiles, coriander and cumin, and arranging them on the spice holder that resembled an artist\u2019s palette.\nYears later, when I went back to visit, I was told that Rahela\u2019s mother had died. It was Rahela who now pounded the spices, her arms barely reaching the top of the grinding stone. She was 10 years old. \nThere are millions of child laborers in Bangladesh; 400,000 between the ages of 6 and 17 are domestic workers. While there have been many calls to protect the rights of these children, most of them remain, as Nishat Mirza of Save the Children, Bangladesh, says, \u201cinside the room, outside the law.\u201d \nRahela\u2019s relationship with my parents could be defined as one of bonded labor. Although my mother, along with tens of thousands of South Asians, would scream in denial, it is a form of slavery. \nLast year, the Global Slavery Index put Bangladesh 10th on the list of countries with the highest number of enslaved people; India ranked first and Pakistan third. The modern face of slavery can express itself in many forms: in the lives of domestic workers, bonded and forced labor in rural and urban areas, low-paying factory work, errand boys in offices, flower sellers at traffic junctions, tea boys in makeshift eateries and sex workers.\nIn Bangladesh\u2019s garment factories, the workers may not have been kidnapped or sold, but considering the hazardous circumstances in which they work, the long hours and the monthly wage of as little as $50, it is hard to know how to define this form of \u201cemployment.\u201d In April 2013, after more than 1,000 people perished in the rubble of the Rana Plaza factory building in the suburbs of Dhaka, the pope denounced as \u201cslave labor\u201d the conditions under which they had worked.\nHuman rights campaigners have long struggled to improve working conditions, but some attempts have backfired. In 1993, when Congress proposed the Child Labor Deterrence Act, which would have outlawed the importation of goods produced by child labor, tens of thousands of workers under the age of 18 in Bangladeshi garment factories were pre-emptively fired. Many had migrated to the city for work, and now found it difficult to return to their villages. Instead they ended up in sex work, and during the late 1990s, there was a significant rise in street-based prostitution in Dhaka.\nKabir Akon, a child rights campaigner who works for Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust, says that the complexity of class and caste is one of the main reasons it is so hard to improve labor conditions. The culture of dependence, and the old belief in fate or karma, that God made us this way, that some are borolok and some chhotolok\u2014 literally, big people and small people \u2014 perpetuates deep social divisions. In most Bangladeshi homes, domestic servants who work for practically nothing rarely complain; in fact there\u2019s a sense of gratitude and veneration toward the employer. And many such \u201cemployers\u201d argue that they are creating jobs for people who would otherwise be trafficked to the Middle East or Southeast Asia, like those men in Thailand. \nWe all know horror stories about maids in Saudi Arabia, scalded by boiling water, and men with mottled backs where they had been beaten. Surely they would have been better off with us, these Bangladeshi employers tell themselves. \nWe should be outraged over what happened to these Bangladeshi men in the Thai jungle. But we should also be mortified by the terrible indignity that they face in their own land, which is forcing many of them into a life of servitude abroad. \n  Lipika Pelham is a filmmaker and the author of the memoir \u201cThe Unlikely Settler.\u201d  "}, {"text": "Hidden Lives: Street Chef of Gulshan\n"}, {"text": "U.S. Initiative on Hunger Aids Millions, Report Finds\n2014-05-19T15:12:12.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 An Obama administration program set up to reduce chronic hunger and poverty has contributed to rising incomes for farmers around the world and has helped save millions of people from starvation, according to a report released Monday by the United States Agency for International Development.\nThe program, Feed the Future, was started by the agency four years ago after a rapid rise in global food prices. It has helped more than seven million small farmers increase crop production and has provided nutritious foods to 12.5 million children in countries hit hard by drought, war or poor development, the report said.\nIn addition, the United States government received more than $160 million in private-sector investment in 2013 to help farmers and small businesses increase their food production, the agency said, a 40 percent increase from 2012.\nThe program operates in 19 countries, mostly in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and has had the greatest success in Senegal, Bangladesh and Honduras, the report found.\nIn Senegal, efforts financed by the United States helped the country reduce its dependence on food imports, particularly rice. The country\u2019s rice imports fell more than 20 percent between 2008 and 2011.\nDespite the success of Feed the Future, Gawain Kripke of Oxfam said the program was not without its problems. For example, a report by Oxfam of two Feed the Future projects in Tanzania found that not all farmers were able to participate in them."}, {"text": "When Mother Nature Stops Being Maternal \n2014-11-13T22:38:56.000Z\nHumanity has an extraordinary talent for causing catastrophes; we are even likely, as many have suggested over the past century \u2014 to be responsible for the coming apocalypse. But really, we are second-rate. Take a look at the images of cataclysm at the American Museum of Natural History\u2019s exhibition opening on Saturday \u2014 \u201cNature\u2019s Fury: The Science of Natural Disasters\u201d \u2014 and see how immense the forces are that nature wields, how impossible it is to control them, how difficult it has been to predict their effects.\nThe exhibition examines just four phenomena \u2014 earthquakes (and associated tsunamis), volcanoes, tornadoes and hurricanes. All draw on primal forces. There is no avoiding them. They well up from beneath the ground or disrupt the barrier between earth and sky. They turn the human inconsequential. And they thrust into play extreme aspects of nature that the ancients considered fundamental elements: earth, air, fire and water. \nTheir destructive power is stunning. Look at the 2004 photo of vacationers in Thailand racing from a wall of water, a tsunami set off by a 9.3 magnitude earthquake that split a gash in the sea floor the length of California. Along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, it left some 230,000 dead.\nOr look at a display of ordinary artifacts that melted together when the entire city of St.-Pierre on Martinique was destroyed in 1902: 27,000 people were killed in two minutes as a cloud of hot gases and volcanic ash descended from an erupting volcano \u2014 a mild version of what Mount Vesuvius did in the year 79, when it buried Pompeii and Herculaneum. \nOr consider the mural-size aerial photograph of Greensburg, Kan., in 2007: It might be an empty planning grid for a new development, except it is littered with debris, including a wrenched, twisted stop sign on display. A tornado with 200-mile-an-hour winds leveled the town in less than 10 minutes.\nAnd these are not even the most cataclysmic examples. The deadliest earthquake on record, in China in 1556, killed about 830,000 people, many of whom lived in soft stone caves that collapsed. The worst natural disaster in the United States was a 1900 hurricane that killed 8,000 people in Galveston, Tex., while a notorious 1970 cyclone in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) left 500,000 dead.\nThis exhibition originated at the Field Museum in Chicago and has been supplemented with material from the American Museum of Natural History. (The New York curator is Edmond Mathez.) The show is not just a chronicle of disasters and damage. It wants to explain these phenomena. \nThus in one interactive exhibit you are asked to \u201cbuild your own volcano\u201d \u2014 only here the ingredients do not include the baking soda familiar from generations of elementary-school science-fair volcanoes. Here, we learn, two main variables affect a volcano\u2019s character and shape: gas (which is dissolved in magma and creates the pressure of the eruption) and silica (or \u201cgoo,\u201d as the museum puts it, which makes the magma viscous). Change the gas or goo levels and a large video screen shows that virtual volcano erupt, while also providing information about four volcano types (including an oozing \u201clava dome,\u201d like Mount Merapi in Indonesia, or a more classic \u201cstratovolcano,\u201d like Mount St. Helens in Washington State, which spewed 520 million tons of ash in 1980). \nThis simulation might seem to give volcanoes a manageable, manipulable character, but we also learn about Krakatoa, which erupted in 1883, blowing its Indonesian island to bits with a blast that could be heard 3,000 miles away, and causing 130-foot-high tsunamis that killed more than 36,000 people. That eruption sent a column of gas and ash 30 miles into the sky, cooling Earth\u2019s climate for four years (leading to summer snows in New England). It also colored northern skies red, which the exhibition suggests may account for the eerily colored sky in Edvard Munch\u2019s 1893 painting \u201cThe Scream.\u201d \nEarthquakes are far more dangerous and more difficult to anticipate. We know regions where earthquakes are more likely. (A video mapping 20th-century quakes shows how they take place on the boundaries of the planet\u2019s tectonic plates.) But there have also been earthquakes nowhere near plate boundaries. In 1811-12, for example, a series of rare \u201cintraplate\u201d earthquakes destroyed New Madrid, Mo., and caused damage over a region of 230,000 square miles in the center of the United States. \nSo how are we to react in the face of such variable risk, the exhibition asks? People live along the slopes of Vesuvius. Los Angeles straddles the San Andreas fault. Yellowstone National Park sits in the midst of a filled-in 35-mile-wide crater of an active supervolcano that last erupted 640,000 years ago, killing everything within hundreds of miles, and which continues to announce its vigor in the park\u2019s bubbling mud pots, fumaroles and hot springs. With volcanoes there is usually enough advance warning to avoid calamity. But not always: In September, the sudden eruption of Mount Ontake in Japan killed more than 50 people. \nHurricanes and tornadoes might seem a bit more on a human scale because they are manifestations of weather, rather than of Earth\u2019s roiling innards. That\u2019s an illusion. At least with tornadoes it is possible to avoid them: Owing to a confluence of continental wind movements, 75 percent of the world\u2019s tornadoes \u2014 an average of 1,300 a year \u2014 take place in Tornado Alley, which spans Kansas and seven other states. \nIn one display we are surrounded with filmed images of an Iowa tornado approaching and passing over us \u2014 a sequence captured by cameras in a conic-shaped probe we see here, designed by the storm researcher Tim Samaras, to stay planted in the tornado\u2019s path. The speed of the spinning debris (here, up to 125 m.p.h.) gives an idea of the tornado\u2019s winds. Unfortunately, Mr. Samaras, his son, and a colleague were killed by a storm they were trying to record in 2013. \nBut disasters are not completely in nature\u2019s hands. When it comes to hurricanes, the exhibition suggests, humans bear some responsibility for poor planning (New Orleans and Katrina) or lack of communication (as in the Galveston disaster). \nThere is also a touch-screen table map here of New York City demonstrating the effects of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Here was a storm that was expected, planned for \u2014 and it ultimately brought less than an inch of rain. Yet it was a disaster. Partly this was because of New York\u2019s 520-mile-long coastline \u2014 longer than the coasts of Miami, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco combined. But it was also because in some of the most damaged areas, an usually high tide coincided with a storm surge leading to extensive flooding. \nCoincidence, inadequate anticipation, complacent protection \u2014 such are the burdens of all these natural disasters. But the undropped shoe in the hurricane discussion, which is often invoked in the aftermath of such disasters, is human-caused climate change. No summary of data appears here, and in an introductory video, Mr. Mathez suggests that we don\u2019t know how much will change or what effects there will be; he says that uncertainty is itself a risk. A single panel addresses the issue, suggesting that because of rising sea levels and temperatures, \u201cmost climate models now project hurricane strength and number to increase by the end of the century.\u201d \nIt is, at any rate, helpful to be reminded of nature\u2019s powers; it can make us more realistic about our own. One discussion here also reminds us how many variations natural catastrophes can have. It is possible for storms to create a \u201cwaterspout,\u201d a \u201cvortex reaching from a thunderstorm cloud to the surface of a large body of water, drawing water up into the air.\u201d Such a waterspout could lead to \u201ca rare and bizarre phenomenon: raining animals.\u201d We see a reproduction of a 1555 French engraving in which fish descend from a storm.\nYet, presumably, most of us carelessly laughed during the recent \u201cSharknado\u201d films in which chomping sharks are propelled onto city streets by such waterspouts. Had I seen this exhibition first, I might have paid closer attention to a viewer\u2019s tweet that scrolled across the screen as I watched: The danger in making fun of a sharknado is that when a real one comes along, we won\u2019t take it seriously.

CAMPBELL\u2019S path to creating and running a volunteer organization began when he heard about the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\nHis response was something he had not seen coming. \u201cWhen I heard about it, I was overwhelmed,\u201d said Mr. Campbell, 72, a former technology executive. \u201cIn my gut, I knew I had to help.\u201d\nHe had never been to Thailand, and his experience as a volunteer had been limited to overseeing a United Way campaign in Buffalo.\nThe one-week visit Mr. Campbell had planned turned into a one-month stay, and a new way of life. Ten years later, he runs an organization, All Hands Volunteers, a nonprofit based in Mattapoisett, Mass., that has dispatched 28,000 volunteers to 45 global disaster zones from Indonesia to the Philippines, Peru, Bangladesh and Haiti, as well as to dozens of domestic sites hit by tornadoes, hurricanes and flooding, including Detroit and Long Island and Staten Island after Hurricane Sandy.\nThe work is varied: rebuilding houses, packing knapsacks with school supplies for children, debris removal and basic gutting and cleanup. In exchange, All Hands provides volunteers with tools, meals and communal living arrangements at no cost.\n\u201cNow I\u2019m a member of the Good for Nothing Club,\u201d said Mr. Campbell, who does not take a salary. \u201cWe want to do good \u2014 for nothing.\u201d\nBut sometimes the world does pay you back. On Tuesday, in Tempe, Ariz., Mr. Campbell is to receive a cash prize of $100,000 in recognition and support of his work.\nHe is one of this year\u2019s six winners of the Purpose Prize awarded to Americans 60 and older who have had an impact on the world. The award was created by Encore.org, a nonprofit organization that\u2019s building a movement to tap the skills and experience of those in midlife and beyond to improve communities.\nA common spine runs among all of the winners: \u201cAn increasing number of people over 60 want to leave a legacy and do something that makes their children proud,\u201d said Ann MacDougall, president of Encore.org. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking about what\u2019s going to be read at their funeral. Not that it\u2019s right around the corner, but they start thinking in those terms.\u201d\nNow in its ninth year, the Purpose Prize will award $100,000 each to two winners and $25,000 each to four others. \nCharles Irvin Fletcher, 76, a former microwave systems engineer, will receive this year\u2019s other six-figure prize. After retiring, Mr. Fletcher, a lifelong horse lover, spent five years and 5,000 hours volunteering at a therapeutic riding center in the Dallas area dedicated to equine therapy for children with disabilities.\n\u201cWhile the children enjoyed the ride, I didn\u2019t see any healing, and I thought more could be done and more should be done,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said.\nSo he researched ways to provide science-based equine therapy. He met with medical specialists to learn about brain development and created a network of experts.\nThen in 2001, he founded SpiritHorse International, a nonprofit based in Corinth, Tex., 30 miles north of Dallas. His ranch is now home to 31 horses and ponies, and is the headquarters for a worldwide network of 91 licensed therapeutic riding centers that serve children with disabilities in the United States, South America, Africa and Europe.\nAt Mr. Fletcher\u2019s ranch in Corinth, roughly 400 children with disabilities, some as young as nine months, receive free weekly riding sessions on ponies with names like Buttercup and Peter Pan. The riders have a variety of medical conditions, including autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and spina bifida.\nMore than 5,000 children have been helped through the network since the gates first opened.\n\u201cI believe that horses can feel spiritual messages,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said. \u201cThey can feel love. They can feel gratitude. They can feel approval, and they transmit those very simple feelings to the children.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThe reason this therapy works so well is that children with disabilities also have a very open spirit, and the horses sense it.\u201d\nThe Rev. Richard Joyner, 62, pastor of the Conetoe Baptist Church in rural North Carolina, who created the Conetoe Family Life Center, will receive a $25,000 Purpose Prize on Tuesday. The center uses its 25-acre garden to improve the health of the congregation members and to increase the members\u2019 high school graduation rates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy getting people in the South away from fried chicken and sweet tea,\u201d Pastor Joyner said.\nIn 2005, Pastor Joyner had faced too many funerals at his church of 300 congregants. In one year alone, 30 under the age of 32 had died. Most of the deaths were health-related, stemming from poor diet and no exercise, he said. His own sister and brother had died of heart attacks.\nSo he founded the center, which offers after-school and summer camp programs for children 5 to 18. The youths plan, plant and reap the produce, which, in turn, they peddle at farmers\u2019 markets, roadside stands and to local restaurants. They also maintain beehives to produce and supply honey to low-income neighbors. The income they earn goes to school supplies and scholarships.\nGetting involved with farming was not easy for Pastor Joyner. \u201cI was a sharecropper\u2019s son, and we experienced a lot of racism,\u201d he said. \u201cI never wanted to ever have anything to do with farming.\u201d\nBut that changed. \u201cThe eyes of the youth have helped me to see the land in a different perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cLand is the soul. Farming gives these youths, who are struggling, the power to grow something that impacts the health of their family.\u201d\nAs healthy eating and exercise have become routine, people in the community have lost weight, emergency room visits for primary health care have dropped by 40 percent, and the number of deaths has dwindled. The youth are enrolling in college and finding jobs.\nAs for Pastor Joyner, who runs five miles every other day and works in the garden, \u201cAfter being a preacher for 25 years, I never thought I would be doing something other than trying to get somewhere for a vacation at this age.\u201d\nThe other 2014 Purpose Prize winners who will receive $25,000 awards are:\n\u25a0 Dr. Pamela Cantor, 66, a child psychiatrist who runs an organization called Turnaround for Children in New York City. Her group helps schools counter the effects of poverty on student learning, reaching tens of thousands of children in low-performing public schools.\n\u25a0 Mauricio Lim Miller, 68, who founded the Family Independence Initiative in Oakland, Calif., which helps families in poverty. For example, families in the initiative have pooled their resources in 40 \u201clending circles\u201d worth $1.5 million that have helped them pay down debt, provide funds for education and start new businesses.\n\u25a0 Kate Williams, 72, who runs an employment program at LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired in San Francisco, which helps the blind find jobs. \nIn addition to the six winners selected from a pool of nearly 800 nominees, 38 Purpose Prize fellows will be honored for contributions to their communities. The awards are sponsored by the Atlantic Philanthropies, the John Templeton Foundation, Symetra Financial Corporation, the MetLife Foundation and the Eisner Foundation.\nMost of the winners tapped their own resources to start their endeavors, sometimes using credit cards or savings accounts \u2014 or, in one case, Social Security checks. Others raised money from personal connections.\n\u201cWe encourage people who want to move the needle to consider what interests and passions they already have and review their skills \u2014 those are more transferable than they think,\u201d Ms. MacDougall, Encore.org\u2019s president, said.\n\u201cSeek out a group whose mission you admire and see if there\u2019s a way to get involved by volunteering, joining a board or acting as a project adviser,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who have organized things, been in marketing or sales or have managed people are in demand.\u201d\nThe Purpose Prize recipients are free to use their jackpot any way they like. But don\u2019t expect to see them buying new cars or taking trips to the Caribbean. \n\u201cMy big reward is seeing these children improve,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said. \u201cI love watching a little boy with cerebral palsy, who can barely walk, trying to run to get to his pony.\u201d"}, {"text": "Sicilian Town on Migrants\u2019 Route Cares for the Living and the Dead\n2014-09-18T02:58:57.000Z\nPOZZALLO, Sicily \u2014 The 18 coffins were placed in two neat rows beneath the late-afternoon sun as the mayor and other dignitaries took their seats inside the hilltop cemetery. A Catholic vicar-general offered a homily. A Muslim imam unfurled a small rug and knelt in prayer, his singsong voice rising above the stone mausoleums toward the blue of the Mediterranean.\nThey had come to mourn strangers. Inside the coffins were the bodies of Africans who died in August, collected from the smuggler boats that were carrying them into Europe. Eight of the coffins bore small plaques that stated, simply, \u201cSconosciuto,\u201d or \u201cUnknown.\u201d\n\u201cThe opposite of love is not hatred,\u201d Msgr. Angelo Giurdanella said toward the end of his homily, \u201cbut indifference.\u201d\nNo one could accuse Pozzallo of indifference. This small Sicilian town, like Italy itself, has staggered its way through a skyrocketing migration crisis in the Mediterranean that has seen roughly 120,000 migrants rescued by Italian ships this year, almost triple last year\u2019s figure, while nearly 2,800 have died in shipwrecks or in transit, a fourfold increase. And more bodies may be coming. Rescuers are searching in the waters near Malta after reports this week that more than 750 people may have died in two shipwrecks in recent days.\nOver the past three years, Italian authorities have swung from a hard-line policy to \u201cpush back\u201d migrant vessels to Libya, to a search-and-rescue program to deliver them safely to Italian ports like this one. Migrants still keep coming.\nToday, Europe finds itself caught between a backlash at home against the rising numbers of migrants flooding the continent and international pressure to provide a humane response to a crisis that includes refugees from wars in the Middle East.\n\u201cIt is a river of people coming in,\u201d said Daniele Carrozza, who runs one of the many holding centers in Sicily that house migrants, among them several thousand unaccompanied minors. \u201cFor the next few years, we are going to have an exponential increase.\u201d\nUntil three years ago, Europe mostly acted to deter migrant boats, as Italian ships and those of Europe\u2019s border agency, Frontex, pursued the \u201cpushback\u201d tactics along the Libyan coastline. But the outbreak of the Arab Spring in 2011 changed the strategy, as well as public attitudes.\nWaves of refugees risking their lives to make passage to Europe stirred global sympathy. In response, Italy suspended the pushback operations, and then a landmark 2012 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights barred Italy from continuing the tactic.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have people fleeing war \u2014 young children, fathers, mothers \u2014 and drowning within sight of Europe,\u201d said Leonard Doyle, spokesman for the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t acceptable.\u201d\nAfter a shipwreck last October, in which more than 300 migrants died within a few hundred yards of the Italian island of Lampedusa, the government announced the creation of Mare Nostrum, the search-and-rescue program.\nWith Italian leaders loudly calling for help and money, European officials last month announced that Frontex would be expanded in November to include rescue efforts. But few details have been provided, even as Italian officials say the new initiative will allow Italy to end Mare Nostrum.\n\u201cThe Italian government is telling Italians that Mare Nostrum will be replaced,\u201d said Bruce Leimsidor, an expert on European asylum law at Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice. \u201cBut if you look at the statements by European officials, they are talking about supplementing. They are not talking about replacing Mare Nostrum.\u201d\nAlong the southeastern coast of Sicily, small cities have hurriedly opened holding centers, including an abandoned school in the port city of Augusta that now houses unaccompanied teenage boys. Many of them had left Gambia and Ghana, and even Bangladesh, to work as migrants in oil-rich Libya. But as Libya has steadily unraveled into anarchy and violence, they feared for their lives.\n\u201cThey can kill you at any moment, any second,\u201d said Ibrima, a 17-year-old from Gambia, who worked in Libya before paying smugglers to reach Italy in August.\nAsked why he had originally left Gambia, Ibrima lifted the back of his shirt to show a gruesome scar on his back. He said his father had two wives, and the second wife, jealous of Ibrima\u2019s mother, doused him with scalding oil.\n\u201cHere is now my country,\u201d he said of Italy. \u201cI want to stay here.\u201d\nOut on the commercial ports of Augusta and Pozzallo, the Italian naval frigates deliver newly rescued migrants almost every day.\nMigrants cling to suitcases or plastic bags bearing their remaining worldly possessions. A handwritten note, scrawled in Egyptian dialect on a torn cigarette pack, was discovered on the ground last week in Pozzallo as migrants filed off a ship. It was from someone initialed \u201cA\u201d to someone else initialed \u201cR.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to be with you,\u201d read the note. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare forget me. I love you very much. My wish is for you not to forget me. Be well my love. A loves R. I love you.\u201d\nOne man on the ship, Mohannad Sharouf, 38, an English teacher, had fled Swedea, in Syria, because he said he became a target of the security forces of President Bashar al-Assad. \u201cEven if the E.U. takes different measures, they can\u2019t stop immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Syria, I had my fianc\u00e9e, my family and friends. I had my whole life there. Do you think, had I a choice, I would have left?\u201d\nDown the coast in Pozzallo, another major processing point for incoming migrants, Mayor Luigi Ammatuna and his chief of staff, Virginia Giugno, now spend much of their time dealing with the bureaucratic and emotional tasks of migration.\nMr. Ammatuna has gone on Italian radio to debate immigration opponents, asking if they have ever seen what he sees every day. Ms. Giugno, who has two children, is now listed as the legal guardian of all the roughly 150 unaccompanied minors who have arrived in Pozzallo.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what mothers and fathers go through when they put an 11-year-old boy on a boat and say, \u2018Good luck,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cThey know they will never see them again, that they may die at sea.\u201d\nDeath has become one of the city\u2019s bureaucratic tasks. In July, the Navy rescued a wooden ship overcrowded with migrants. When the hatch was opened, Navy sailors discovered that 48 people inside the hull had suffocated. Pozzallo officials created a makeshift morgue by attaching refrigeration units to an empty room at the city\u2019s civil protection center. Bodies were also placed inside a refrigerated truck ordinarily used to transport freshly cut flowers.\nThe bodies from Monday\u2019s funeral arrived on a migrant boat in August. So many migrants have now been interred in Pozzallo that officials had to distribute some of the dead for burial at cemeteries in nearby towns such as Ragusa and Modica. The two men buried in Modica, Moussa Conde, 23, and Amadou Conde, 24, from Conakry, Guinea, may have been related.\nSicily has known suffering and deprivation, and once saw its own youth flee poverty to emigrate to better opportunities, in places including the United States. Monday\u2019s funeral in Pozzallo was held outdoors because there were too many bodies to fit into the cemetery\u2019s small chapel. A few dozen residents joined the officials, including Claudia Scala, 42, who felt compelled to come since the families of the migrants could not be there.\n\u201cThese people have nobody,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018At least they can have me.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nThe service was especially bittersweet for Vincenza Angieleri, 64. Her husband died working on an oil tanker that wrecked off the coast of North Carolina 37 years ago. Search crews never found his body.\n\u201cIt is a duty for people who live here to come to this funeral,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter the color of their skin. It saddens us that something like this happened in our village.\u201d"}, {"text": "Manzur's Lonely End\n2014-05-04T22:51:38.000Z\nOne of my father\u2019s older brothers, Manzur Anam, died last week. He was in his early 70s, and though the medical reasons for his death were many, it was loneliness that killed him.\nThere is a prevailing sense that the old in places like Bangladesh age with their large extended families around them, and that age gives them power, respect and status. It is in the West, we have been told, where they disrespect their elders and abandon them to nursing homes. But while the aging population in Bangladesh may have enjoyed some measure of security in the past, dramatic changes in the social fabric \u2014 rapid urbanization, mass migration and a focus on the nuclear family \u2014 have heralded a transformation in the way we regard and treat our old.\nMy uncle lived in Dhaka\u2019s modern architectural convention: the apartment building built on the site of an old family estate. He came home from work every day and sat on one corner of his 1950s green sofa and ate dinner in front of the television. On Fridays, he played a regular poker game he\u2019d begun with friends 40 years ago.\nIn the servants\u2019 quarters lived his housekeeper, Lucky, a young woman who looked after him with efficiency and tenderness in his last days (he was estranged from both his wife and his son). In the rest of the apartment building were the extended family \u2014 the sons of my father\u2019s other three brothers, and their wives and children. His nephews (my cousins) dutifully kept vigil at his bedside through several long illnesses.\nYet, there was no one, in the end, to hear my uncle cry out when he fell from his bed. It was Lucky who discovered him the morning after his stroke, lying helpless on the floor where he\u2019d fallen.\nBangladesh self-identifies as a young country with an old culture. The nation itself is only 43 years old; we refer to ourselves as a young democracy, an emerging economy, a nascent political culture.\nEven our anxieties are those of a nation whose young dominate the national agenda: With a median age of 24, we worry that, if they are not educated and provided with employment, the young men will become radicalized, the young women will marry too early. At the same time, we fetishize a past in which the family unit was large and capacious enough to absorb the needs of all generations.\nSo how will Bangladesh cope with its aging population? The number of seniors is set to rise sharply, largely because of improved health care. It is estimated that nearly 44 million Bangladeshis \u2014 23 percent of the projected population \u2014 will be over the age of 60 by 2050. This demographic shift will force us to think critically about aging, what the anthropologist Lawrence Cohen calls \u201cthe body in time.\u201d\nWe still revere the old in the ways we always have, by referring to an old person as the head of the family. As the eldest man of his generation, we treated my uncle like the patriarch he was.\nYet he aged alone and out of sight. This is because while the aging body as a symbol retains power, the aging individual is more and more a person whom it is possible to neglect. He is relegated to his subdivision of the family property, his illness sanitized by the new hospitals we are grateful to have throughout the city, his solitary life witnessed only by the people paid to look after him.\nFor Bangladeshis like me, living far from home, the question of what will happen to our aging parents is a pressing one. For the hundreds of thousands of migrants who leave Bangladesh every year to work abroad, there are parents who are left behind, often to look after grandchildren. Those families back home are the ones who have to cope with the alienation of being left behind.\nWhat is pressing for a middle-class family is all the more challenging for a poor one. In \u201cdevelopment speak,\u201d there is a category of people in Bangladesh who are referred to as the ultra poor \u2014 the bottom 10 percent, who live without income or resources. The old and the disabled make up a disproportionate number of the ultra poor; even the aid packages designed to help them are sometimes ill-suited to their needs. There are means-tested state pension programs for older people in Bangladesh, but bureaucracy and poor access mean that enrollment is far lower than it should be.\nFor Bangladesh to address the impending demographic shift, we must first admit that we are no longer a society that has automatic safety nets for the old, that the fantasy of better aging is just that \u2014 a fantasy rooted in our denial of how old people are actually treated. We must then go about the hard work of creating new systems that address the challenges we are about to face.\nWe need better nursing care, more palliative care in hospitals, and national health care initiatives aimed at the older population. Development programs and nationally funded pension plans must be made more accessible. Most important, we need to help older people form their own communities in order to reduce the crippling loneliness and isolation of aging.\nMy uncle\u2019s funeral, or qulkhwani, was attended by more than 300 people. Friends and colleagues commented on his sense of humor: It appeared that he had laughed with his friends when they told stories of their happier, fuller families, hiding the shame of his own isolation behind a quick wit and a ready smile. Few were privy to the reality of his last days.\n\u201cIt is ironic,\u201d my mother wrote to me, later that day, \u201cthat a man so beloved should have died alone.\u201d\n Tahmima Anam is a writer and anthropologist, and the author of the novel \u201cA Golden Age.\u201d "}, {"text": "A Long History of Exploitation in the Cotton Industry\n2014-12-25T00:26:36.000Z\nThe fires and building collapses that killed hundreds of garment workers in countries like Bangladesh in recent years serve as a tragic reminder of the millions in developing countries who labor in wretched conditions. These workers, however, are not the garment or cotton industry\u2019s first victims. \nA book published earlier this month \u2014 \u201cEmpire of Cotton: A Global History\u201d by Sven Beckert, a history professor at Harvard \u2014 describes in vivid detail how the industrialization of cotton contributed to slavery, the destruction of American Indian cultures and famines in British India. And while the parallels between the 18th century and 19th century and the present are inexact, the reader can\u2019t help but think that cotton, for all its many uses, still exacts a human cost. \nHigh school history class is good at teaching us the positive elements of this past. Older textbooks described how breakthrough innovations like the cotton gin and the steam engine fueled the industrial revolution and helped make cheap consumer goods widely available for the first time. New books like \u201cEmpire of Cotton\u201d and \u201cThe Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism\u201d by Edward Baptist offer gripping and more nuanced stories of economic history.\nMr. Beckert explains how the emergence of a textile industry in England contributed to wars against American Indian tribes in the South and fueled the slave trade. American Indians were forcibly removed from territory their ancestors had long inhabited because those fertile lands were needed to grow cotton to supply mills in Manchester and Liverpool. Hundreds of thousands of slaves were shipped across the Atlantic Ocean and moved within the United States to sow and harvest the plant.\nLater, when the Civil War disrupted cotton production in the United States, British and other European capitalists turned to countries like India and Egypt that were already growing the plant along with food crops. Assisted by colonial administrators, industrialists cajoled farmers to switch to growing only cotton, subjecting farmers to trade volatility for which they were ill prepared and greatly diminishing the food supply. \n\u201cIn 1877 and again in the late 1890s, Berar, as well as northeastern Brazil, witnessed the starvation of millions of cultivators as cotton prices fell while food grain prices rose, putting food out of reach of many cotton producers,\u201d Mr. Beckert writes, referring to a province in British India. \nThen, as now, people who benefitted from the status quo said that ending the human exploitation that made cotton so profitable would cause broader economic harm. In 1858, Senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina warned on the Senate floor that \u201cEngland would topple headlong and carry the whole civilized world with her, save the South. No, you dare not make war on cotton. No power on earth dares to make war upon it. Cotton is king.\u201d\nIn more recent times, Western retailers have resisted taking responsibility for improving working conditions in clothing factories in developing countries in large part because doing so would raise the cost of making cheap T-shirts. Some companies like Walmart have contributed only modestly to compensation funds for workers who died in fires and building collapses in factories where their clothes were made. Their lame excuse is that they did not authorize production in those specific factories and should not have to pay for the choices and mistakes of their contractors and subcontractors.\nIt\u2019s true, of course, that for poor Bangladeshis, Cambodians and others who make today\u2019s clothes, these jobs offer an escape from poverty and subsistence farming. But the callous disregard that factory owners, large Western clothing companies and government officials have shown for worker safety in pursuit of profits bears more than a passing resemblance to the historic injustices committed in the name of King Cotton.\nCompanies like Walmart, Gap and H&M and the government of Bangladesh have recently committed to making factories safer. But that effort, begun only after the collapse of Rana Plaza and the loss of more than 1,100 lives in April 2013, will require years of hard work. History will surely judge the clothing industry and political leaders harshly for waiting so long to act."}, {"text": "The Challenges of Running Responsible Supply Chains\n"}, {"text": "Man Arrested at Kennedy in Killing of Landlord\n2014-01-08T18:19:09.000Z\nA Bangladeshi man wanted in connection with the killing of a Brooklyn businessman was arrested on Wednesday at Kennedy Airport, the New York Police Department said.\nThe man, identified as Rasel Siddiquee, was a tenant in a building owned by the victim, Mahuddin Mahmud, who was killed with a sword, the police said.

You may fear job loss or emotional loss, but you probably don\u2019t fear that somebody is going to slash your throat, or that a gang will invade your house come dinnertime, carrying away your kin and property. We take a basic level of order for granted. \nBut billions of people live in a different emotional landscape, enveloped by hidden terror. Many of these people live in the developing world.\nWhen we send young people out to help these regions, we tell them they are there to tackle \u201cpoverty,\u201d using the sort of economic designation we\u2019re comfortable with. We usually assume that scarcity is the big challenge to be faced. We send them to dig wells or bring bed nets or distribute food or money, and, of course, that\u2019s wonderful work.\nBut as Gary A. Haugen and Victor Boutros point out in their gripping and perspective-altering book, \u201cThe Locust Effect,\u201d these places are not just grappling with poverty. They are marked by disorder, violence and man-inflicted suffering. \n\u201cThe relentless threat of violence is part of the core subtext of their lives, but we are unlikely to see it, and they are unlikely to tell us about it. We would be wise, however, to not be fooled \u2014 because, like grief, the thing we cannot see may be the deepest part of their day.\u201d \nPeople in many parts of the world simply live beyond the apparatus of law and order. The District of Columbia spends about $850 per person per year on police. In Bangladesh, the government spends less than $1.50 per person per year on police. The cops are just not there.\nIn the United States, there is one prosecutor for every 12,000 citizens. In Malawi, there is one prosecutor for every 1.5 million citizens. The prosecutors are just not there.\nEven when there is some legal system in place, it\u2019s not designed to impose law and order for the people. It is there to protect the regime from the people. The well-connected want a legal system that can be bought and sold.\nHaugen and Boutros tell the story of an 8-year-old Peruvian girl named Yuri whose body was found in the street one morning, her skull crushed in, her legs wrapped in cables and her underwear at her ankles. The evidence pointed to a member of one of the richer families in the town, so the police and prosecutors destroyed the evidence. Her clothing went missing. A sperm sample that could have identified the perpetrator was thrown out. A bloody mattress was sliced down by a third, so that the blood stained spot could be discarded.\nYuri\u2019s family wanted to find the killer, but they couldn\u2019t afford to pay the prosecutor, so nothing was done. The family sold all their livestock to hire lawyers, who took the money but abandoned the case. These sorts of events are utterly typical \u2014 the products of legal systems that range from the arbitrary to the Kafkaesque. \nWe in the affluent world live on one side of a great global threshold. Our fundamental security was established by our ancestors. We tend to assume that the primary problems of politics are economic and that the injustices of the world can be addressed with economic levers. When empires like the Soviet Union collapse, we send in economists with privatization plans instead of cops to help create rule of law. When thuggish autocracies invade their neighbors we impose economic sanctions. \nBut people without our inherited institutions live on the other side of the threshold and have a different reality. They live within a contagion of chaos. They live where the primary realities include violence, theft and radical uncertainty. Their world is governed less by long-term economic incentives and more by raw fear. In a world without functioning institutions, predatory behavior and the passions of domination and submission blot out economic logic. \nThe primary problem of politics is not creating growth. It\u2019s creating order. Until that is largely achieved, life can be nasty, brutish and short. \nHaugen is president of a human rights organization called the International Justice Mission, which tries to help people around the world build the institutions of law. One virtue of his group is that it stares evil in the eyes and helps local people confront the large and petty thugs who inflict such predatory cruelty on those around them. Not every aid organization is equipped to do this, to confront elemental human behavior when it exists unrestrained by effective law. It\u2019s easier to avoid this reality, to have come-together moments in daytime. \nPolice training might be less uplifting than some of the other stories that attract donor dollars. But, in every society, order has to be wrung out of exploitation. Unless cruelty is tamed, poverty will persist.

Given the clandestine nature of the people-trafficking trade, \u201cwe definitely believe the number is much higher,\u201d Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in Geneva.\nAn estimated 53,000 people tried to cross the Bay of Bengal by boat from July 2013 to this June, the agency said, a more than 60 percent increase over the previous 12 months, continuing an exodus that appears to have taken off after intercommunal violence erupted in Myanmar in 2012, driving tens of thousands of Rohingyas into primitive camps. Some 40 percent of the boat passengers interviewed by United Nations staff members after reaching Thailand and Malaysia were under the age of 18.\nA collection of stories from a recent trip focusing on a Muslim minority who are confined to camps and villages. UPDATED June 20: Nicholas Kristof responds to readers\u2019 questions.\nAn unknown number died when their boats foundered at sea, but survivors interviewed by the United Nations also reported deaths from illness, the heat, a lack of food and water and ferocious beatings meted out by crew members. Some went missing after being forced by traffickers to jump into the sea as they neared the coast of Thailand.\nFor many, reaching land brought new peril. Those arriving in Thailand reported being packed in pickup trucks at night, sitting or lying on maybe 20 people, and being ferried to rough camps concealed in jungles or plantations where they were kept, sometimes for months, behind wooden fences and left to sleep on plastic sheeting.\nSome faced demands for even more money, in addition to what they already had spent on the boat journey. \u201cThose who could not pay would be beaten and detained for long periods,\u201d Mr. Edwards said, citing information collected by a new office the refugee agency has set up for monitoring \u201cirregular maritime movements.\u201d\nSome camp dwellers lost sensory abilities and mobility as a result of beriberi caused by malnutrition. The state of those Rohingyas who reached Malaysia from the camps attested to the harsh conditions, the refugee agency said. Two people died in a hospital within a week of making contact with agency staff members, and another 144 showed symptoms of beriberi in the first half of the year.\nMore than 7,000 people are known to be in detention, including more than 5,000 in Australia or the camps it set up in Nauru and Papua New Guinea as part of a policy to deter asylum seekers. Australian authorities intercepted nine boats with a total of more than 400 people aboard in the first half of the year, returning seven of the boats to Indonesia and one back to Sri Lanka."}, {"text": "Carlos Ginzburg: \u2018The Forgotten Vintage\u2019\n2014-09-11T21:34:09.000Z\nThe early days of Conceptual Art seem long ago and far away.

For one of the earliest pieces, done for the Museum of Modern Art in Buenos Aires in 1971, Mr. Ginzburg fenced in a vacant lot near the museum with tall wooden hoardings and put up signs advertising an \u201cunexpected aesthetic experience\u201d behind the walls.\nTo have the experience, however, visitors were required to enter the museum, which was on the ninth floor of a high-rise, locate a particular window and look out, only to find the single word \u201cTierra\u201d \u2014 \u201cEarth\u201d \u2014 written large on the ground in the lot below.

Calling himself simply Traveling Artist in various Asian cities (the capitals of Thailand, Bangladesh and Indonesia) in 1979, he had local people pose in cartoonish portrait masks of President Jimmy Carter.\nA year later, he took pictures of tourist sites in and around Mexico City, pairing the images with travel guide descriptions of the sites, the words (mostly in French) making the places sound far more charismatic than they appear in the bland black-and-white images.

But those days may be ending.\nThe government reported this week that consumer prices for apparel rose 0.6 percent in 2013. That is hardly rampant inflation, but it was the third consecutive year that apparel prices increased. Before 2011, those prices had risen in only two of the previous 13 years.\nThe long stretch of falling apparel prices was largely attributable to an era of cheap imports, as China emerged from economic isolation to become the world\u2019s largest exporter. That emergence damaged the apparel industries in all major industrial countries, but it was a boon to living standards for consumers, who were left with more money for other purchases.\nIn 1987, apparel accounted for 5.4 percent of all personal consumption spending in the United States. By 2009, that figure was down to 3.1 percent. In 2012, the year for which data is available, the figure had recovered a little, to 3.2 percent.\nWhat may have marked the end of the era came in 2010, when unfavorable weather reduced cotton production in all three of the world\u2019s largest producers \u2014 China, India and the United States. India briefly banned exports, and prices began to rise. In early 2011, the price of cotton briefly reached $2.19 a pound, compared with less than 70 cents at the beginning of 2010. \nThe price of cotton was back under $1 by the end of 2011, but that move helped to push American apparel inflation to 4.6 percent in 2011, the highest figure since 1990 and well above the overall inflation rate of 3 percent. It was the first time since 1991 that apparel prices had risen more than the overall inflation rate. \nThe apparel inflation rate fell to 1.8 percent in 2012, a small amount over the inflation rate, and to 0.6 percent in 2013, well below the overall 1.5 percent rate.\nThis week\u2019s report showed that apparel prices fell in December, as they always do during holiday sales. But the decline of 2.3 percent for the month was the smallest such dip in December in eight years \u2014 perhaps an indication that clothing retailers were more successful at avoiding deep discounts than they were in previous years. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics concluded, apparel prices were up 0.9 percent from November.\nChina remains a force for deflation in the world, but perhaps less than it was. With wages rising, it has lost some of its business in inexpensive apparel production to other countries, including Vietnam and Bangladesh. China provided a record 19.4 percent of American imports in the 12 months through November, but that figure is no longer rising at a rapid rate.\nOver the last 27 years \u2014 since the end of 1986 \u2014 American apparel prices have risen only 17 percent. The weakest prices have been in children\u2019s clothing, an area where (parental) buyers may be particularly price-sensitive. The figures indicate that boys\u2019 clothing prices rose a scant 1 percent over the period, while girls\u2019 clothing prices declined 6 percent. Men\u2019s clothing prices rose more rapidly than women\u2019s, but shoes, up 29 percent over the period, rose more rapidly than any category of clothing."}, {"text": "Paperback Row\n2014-08-01T14:49:29.000Z\nSUBTLE BODIES,  by Norman Rush.

But many still hark back to the wave of Indian restaurants that opened in the 1970s and \u201980s, offering a homogenized derivative of the meaty cuisines of Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Indian state of Punjab \u2014 from which the majority of their owners hail. And like the wave of Chinese food before it, Indian food was often made bland for American palates, with a handful of dishes from a few regions becoming ubiquitous.\nBut it is possible to experience Indian food in its unadulterated form at four New York outposts of Indian chains. During the three years I worked as a journalist in India, I obsessed over sampling different regional cuisines, and in the course of my exploration ate at all of the flagship locations of these Indian chains. In the New York outposts, authenticity is paramount \u2014 evidenced by their predominantly Indian clientele.\nSeemingly every connoisseur\u2019s favorite South Indian restaurant is Saravana Bhavan. Its philosophy is to make affordable food that tastes exactly like it does in its flagship location in Chennai \u2014 a vegetarian cafeteria known as a \u201chotel.\u201d The chain, which has restaurants in more than a dozen countries with Indian expatriate populations, has blessed New York with two no-frills locations, in Murray Hill and on the Upper West Side.\nThough Saravana Bhavan serves great dosas and idlis \u2014 traditional South Indian snacks made from a rice-based batter \u2014 the lunch thali, a sort of Indian smorgasbord, is where the action is: a half-dozen or so spicy vegetarian curries served with two types of yogurt (plain curd and vegetable raita) to help temper the heat.\nMumbaikars were giddy about the April opening of a Murray Hill outpost of Kailash Parbat, a South Mumbai institution that is famous for its vegetarian chaat, or street snacks, many of which have their origins in the Sindh region, which is now part of Pakistan.\nThe original Kailash Parbat is not much more than a tattered counter separating steaming snacks from a swarm of hungry locals. It\u2019s famous for its samosas, chole bhature \u2014 a chickpea curry served with fried discs of savory dough \u2014 and pav bhaji, a sort of sloppy Joe with spicy vegetable filling. The New York location does pitch-perfect versions of these and other dishes I loved at the original Mumbai spot, and their pav (white buns of Portuguese origin that are a key element of many Indian snacks) are actually better than the ones found in Mumbai, because they manage to retain all of the good traits of the original in a better-quality product. And their mango lassis, made from the pulp of superior Indian mangoes, are alone worth the trip.\nAnother recent addition is the slightly more upscale Moti Mahal Delux, which opened on the Upper East Side in 2012, by the restaurateur Gaurav Anand, who grew up in New Delhi eating the meat-centric Mughlai food at the New Delhi cafeteria of the same name. \u201cI loved their butter chicken, lamb chops and black dal. They were unbelievable, but I could never make them the same way,\u201d said Mr. Anand, who was inspired by the popularity of Saravana Bhavan.\nMr. Anand and his chefs trained at the branch of Moti Mahal Delux in the South Extension neighborhood of New Delhi \u2014 the best of the Indian locations \u2014 where they learned to replicate those three dishes using Moti Mahal\u2019s signature spice mixture, which now flavors the food at his New York restaurant. Perhaps more crucially, he cooks with Amul butter, the salty brand ubiquitous in Indian restaurants and households.\nPerhaps the most authentic of the New York outposts of Indian chains is Anjappar, in Murray Hill \u2014 and not only for its food. The low-ceilinged, somewhat frayed venue is reminiscent of the original nonvegetarian cafeterias in Chennai, known as \u201cmilitary hotels,\u201d supposedly because they catered to soldiers who were more likely meat eaters. Anjappar specializes in food from the region known for its peppery meat curries, Chettinad, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.\nAnjappar has restaurants spread throughout the Indian diaspora, and the New York spot, opened in 2012, might not look like much, but its South Indian thalis showcase some of the spiciest, richest and most distinctive dishes in \u201cCurry Hill,\u201d as the neighborhood is sometimes called for its abundance of Indian restaurants. Anjappar serves them with laccha parathas \u2014 flaky, gloriously greasy flatbreads common in the south of India. \u201cThe smell and flavor of the food here takes me back to India,\u201d said Hari Ganapathy, a regular whose roots are in Tamil Nadu. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as good as Mom\u2019s.\u201d"}, {"text": "2014: The Year in Interactive Storytelling, Graphics and Multimedia\n2014-12-29T18:59:20.000Z\n"}, {"text": "Pledges of Allegiance\n2014-05-08T20:53:42.000Z\nTen days after 9/11, self-professed \u201cTexas loud, Texas proud\u201d Mark Stroman walked into a Dallas mini-mart, pulled out a gun and asked the brown man working behind the counter where he was from. The hesitation in the clerk\u2019s reply was enough to unleash Stroman\u2019s hatred for Muslims, whom he referred to as people with \u201cshawls on their face.\u201d Stroman pulled the trigger, but his victim, Raisuddin Bhuiyan, an enterprising immigrant from Bangladesh \u2014 and a Muslim, indeed \u2014 would survive. The other two victims from the fortnight\u2019s vigilante shooting spree, immigrants from India and Pakistan, would not. So begins Anand Giridharadas\u2019s \u201cThe True American,\u201d a richly detailed, affecting account of two men bound, as it turned out, by more than just an act of violence.\nBhuiyan\u2019s misfortune served as an introduction to certain stark realities of American life: The day after being admitted to the hospital, he was asked to leave. The injury was serious, yes, but he was told he would be fine. What Bhuiyan didn\u2019t know was that, without insurance, the hospital assessors saw bills mounting that weren\u2019t going to be paid. They saw a \u201cfledgling immigrant and gas station clerk,\u201d Giridharadas writes, and assumed he wouldn\u2019t be good for the money. One of the many satisfying twists of this trauma-filled book is that he would be. Another is the conclusion Bhuiyan comes to about American debt: that it \u201ccontradicted those attributes of the republic for which he had left\u201d Bangladesh. In America, debt \u201cbound you to history, and kept you who you were, and replaced the metaphor of the frontier with that of a treadmill.\u201d\nWith Stroman identified and apprehended, the tale begins its tack toward deeper emotional waters. The author\u2019s questioning, compassionate account of the trial and subsequent sentencing opens us to the possibility that Stroman \u2014 despite his rabid racism, his swastika tattoo and passion for Hitler, despite his avowed and continued pride in having killed \u201cArabs\u201d \u2014 is not just a monster. He is also the product of a cycle of poverty and neglect, with a mother who once told him she had been $50 short of having the money required to abort him; a young charge turned over to a state system of detention and incarceration from which he sought, at times with great heart, to escape. Giridharadas\u2019s ability to initiate the reader into this humane perspective serves him well for the book\u2019s narrative centerpiece, which begins once a jury sentences Stroman to death for murdering one of his other victims.\nBhuiyan, after leaving behind a promising career as a Bangladeshi Air Force officer in order to toil behind mini-mart counters and, later, at a local Olive Garden \u2014 where he learns to become an expert at suggesting wine pairings to customers, despite, as a practicing Muslim, not drinking alcohol himself \u2014 decides that the inauspicious American welcome will not be a deterrent to fulfilling his American dream. Once healed enough to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, he\u2019s reminded of a promise he made to his Lord as he lay behind the counter on that fateful day, covered in his own blood: \u201cIf you give me my life back today, I will . . . dedicate my life for others.\u201d\n\u201cOthers\u201d comes to mean, for a time at least, Mark Stroman. Inspired by a message of mercy he found in the Quran and in tales of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s life, Bhuiyan defines a course of action as unlikely as it is inspiring: He will work to have his attacker spared from death row. It is a great strength of Giridharadas\u2019s telling that Bhuiyan can often seem as inspired by himself as he is by his mission, and that the message of Islam\u2019s inherent mercy comes to seem more important to him than the humanity of the man who so clearly denied Bhuiyan his own.\nJust as Bhuiyan finds in his faith a transformative and inspirational power, Stroman\u2019s confrontation with inevitable death effects a similar change. Moved by Bhuiyan\u2019s work on his behalf, tormented by his years on death row \u2014 days so lacking in human contact, a fellow prisoner went insane, pulled his own eye out and ate it \u2014 Stroman begins to find a version of love and empathy. He is profoundly moved by a passage from Viktor E. Frankl\u2019s \u201cMan\u2019s Search for Meaning\u201d: \u201cA man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the \u2018why\u2019 for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any \u2018how.\u2019 \u201d As with Bhuiyan\u2019s mission, one is left to wonder about how much of Stroman\u2019s change is calculated self-presentation, a tension that only strengthened this reader\u2019s engagement with the material.\nA story that could have told itself, and bluntly \u2014 with the march to mercy and forgiveness as inevitable as the orchestral swells in an issues-driven Hollywood weepie \u2014 becomes something more expansive. Giridharadas seeks less to uplift than illuminate. And the unexpected connections he draws can be remarkable: Bhuiyan, a victim of what the author aptly calls \u201can American version of tribal law,\u201d reaches back into his own tribal Islamic background to \u201cseek support for showing Stroman forgiveness.\u201d Elsewhere, Giridharadas writes of the music playing on Dallas\u2019s countless country music radio stations, music each man would have listened to, hearing with decidedly different ears the same reminders: \u201cTo stay simple no matter how fortune blessed you; never to forget your God; to distrust the temptations of the corrupting metropolis; to live for family; to grow better than you used to be.\u201d\nBhuiyan, Stroman. Extremes along the continuum of American identity, each an example with much to tell us about who we are. The one, an immigrant who, by dint of pluck and abilities, comes to embody some of the best of our nation\u2019s values, as well as a trace of that unseemly, self-\u00adpromoting daemon so central to the American self. The other, born and raised in Texas, defined by the narrow creed of his love for motorcycles and guns and naked women, reveals the costs of a nation beholden to ruthless competition and relentless individualism, a society that winnows out the less capable, the more damaged, and where festering rage seeks a violent discharge. Which of these men is the \u201ctrue American\u201d of the title? That there is no simple answer to that question is Giridharadas\u2019s finest accomplishment. "}, {"text": "A Duel and a Duet as Flamenco and Kathak Face Off\n2014-11-06T14:46:52.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 Israel Galv\u00e1n is the maverick of the flamenco world, a brilliantly talented, ground-breaking artist who combines the almost tragic seriousness of his art with an absurdist sense of its possibilities. Akram Khan, the kathak-trained British choreographer, is known for his fusion of that north Indian classical form with a more contemporary physical idiom, and for his collaborations with artists (Juliette Binoche, Sylvie Guillem, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui) from other dance traditions and disciplines.\n\u201cTorobaka,\u201d a flamenco-kathak encounter between these two men, is another such collaboration for Mr. Khan, but a departure for Mr. Galv\u00e1n, until now a proudly solo performer. The piece, which opened this week at Sadler\u2019s Wells after a June premiere in Grenoble, France, is simply presented. Five musicians are arrayed behind a circle of deep pink light that demarcates the dancers\u2019 performance area. (The lighting, by Michael Hulls, is of an exquisite, deep-toned simplicity throughout.) It suggests a bullfighting ring or an arena, and it\u2019s no surprise that at the start, Mr. Khan and Mr. Galv\u00e1n enter from each side and face off as if about to duel.\nTheir first movements \u2014 arms flung into the air, rapid freeze-frame stances \u2014 are accompanied by sharp percussive sounds. Then Mr. Galv\u00e1n lets out a guttural roar (Mr. Khan peers incredulously into his mouth, defusing the macho posturing), and the two men begin a foot-stamping duel. The connections between flamenco and kathak are immediately apparent. Both deploy powerful, rhythmic footwork; both use the arms and upper body with elaborate, sinuous beauty. Both are forms of music-making as well as dance in their rapid tattoos of the feet and clapping of hands.\nThe program notes for \u201cTorobaka\u201d (the name is drawn from \u201ctoro\u201d for bull and \u201cvaca\u201d for cow, the two animals sacred to each tradition) suggest their shared heritage is the result of Romany migration from India to Spain in the 14th and 15th centuries. But there are significant differences between the forms, too. Flamenco is implacable, abstract, self-absorbed. Kathak is witty, storytelling, full of facial expression and mime-like gesture.\nThese subtleties get lost in \u201cTorobaka,\u201d which works best when Mr. Khan and Mr. Galv\u00e1n finally perform a long duet in the final section of the piece. Suddenly, there is a real thrill to the confrontation of their movement styles, and to their borrowings from one another. Moving mostly in sync, they embrace, whirl away from one another, duel with their feet, then slow their bodies into elegant, curving shapes. In one fine passage, Mr. Galv\u00e1n stands behind Mr. Khan, his arms writhing sideways so that they look like a many-armed Shiva. In another, as the percussive music mounts in intensity, they whirl wildly with the liquid yet precise, rapidly changing arms of kathak, then slow into Buster Keaton-like slapstick fighting poses.\nIt takes a long time to get there. Most of the piece is taken up by solo sequences from Mr. Galv\u00e1n and Mr. Khan, punctuated by a passage in which the musicians (David Azurza, B. C. Manjunath, Bobote, Christine Leboutte, Bernhard Schimpelsberger) get center stage. The music, an unexpected mix of Spanish folk song, ragas, Middle Eastern-sounding sonorities and percussive beat, is occasionally combined with counting in Spanish, a nod to the kathak \u201cbols\u201d that playfully mark the musicianship and rhythmic skills of the dancer.\nThere is nothing wrong with watching Mr. Galv\u00e1n or Mr. Khan dancing alone. Both are masters of their art, Mr. Galv\u00e1n a particularly eccentric one. His flamenco is a form in which any part of the body (even the teeth) can be used as a rhythm generator, and in which he emits raucous cries and shrieks as his heeled feet pound the floor with almost laughable speed. But he is also precise, even stylized; although he often seems to be improvising \u2014 at moments, he even appears to be vogueing \u2014 he always appears utterly in control of every tiny shift of weight, every gestural decision.\nMr. Khan, barefoot and wearing ankle bells (all the performers are dressed simply in black trousers and tunics), is a more elusive presence. His whirling, stamping movement can seem boneless, an eddy of whiplashing curves, as his feet stamp out nuanced rhythms. But the specificity of kathak is sacrificed to spectacle; we don\u2019t see the art of abhinaya, the subtle facial expressions and gestures that are an essential element of the form, nor do we enjoy the narrative pleasures that characterize it.\nThe attempt to find a meeting point in these dance forms is a fascinating but only intermittently successful one in \u201cTorobaka.\u201d Much of the piece feels slightly remote (perhaps those closer to the stage might have had a different experience); only in the final encounter do sparks fly and boundaries seem to dissolve. \n Torobaka.  Israel Galv\u00e1n and Akram Khan. Sadler\u2019s Wells, London. Through Nov. 8. "}, {"text": "Rise in Bigotry Fuels Massacre Inside Myanmar\n2014-03-01T23:43:27.000Z\nDU CHEE YAR TAN, Myanmar \u2014 Under the pale moon of Jan. 13, Zaw Patha watched from her bamboo house as Mohmach, 15, her eldest child, was dragged from the kiosk where he slept as guardian of the family business.\nThe men who abducted the boy struck him with the butt of a rifle until he fell to the dirt path, she said in an interview, gesturing with a sweep of her slender arms. Terrified, she fled into the rice fields. She assumes he is dead.\nThree doors away, Zoya, dressed in a black abaya, showed the latch on her front door that she said armed men had broken as they stormed in and began beating her 14-year-old son, Mohamed. She has not seen him since.\nThe villagers\u2019 accounts back up a United Nations investigation, which concluded that the attack on Du Chee Yar Tan that night resulted in the deaths of at least 40 men, women and children, one of the worst instances of violence against the country\u2019s long-persecuted Rohingya Muslims. They were killed, the United Nations says, by local security forces and civilians of the rival Rakhine ethnic group, many of them adherents of an extreme Buddhist ideology who were angered by the kidnapping of a Rakhine policeman by some Rohingya men. \nMyanmar\u2019s government, intent on international acceptance and investment, has steadfastly denied the killings occurred in the village, a collection of hamlets spread across luxuriant rice fields close to Bangladesh and a five-hour ferry ride up the languid Kaladan River from the state capital, Sittwe. The country\u2019s human rights commission called the news \u201cunverifiable and unconfirmed.\u201d\nThe United Nations findings, however, have become emblematic of the increasing violence against Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya, an estimated 1.3 million people who are denied citizenship under national law. \nThe world organization\u2019s report \u2014 presented to the government by the United Nations and United States but not made public \u2014 documents the initial discovery of the massacre by five Muslim men who sneaked into the area after the attack. They found the severed heads of at least 10 Rohingya bobbing in a water tank. Some of those were children\u2019s.\nOne of the men said he was so rattled, and concerned his eyes were playing tricks in the darkness, that he put his hands in the tank to confirm through touch what he thought he saw. \nThe killings are a test for Myanmar\u2019s government, which has done little to rein in radical Buddhists, even as it pursues broad economic and political reforms of policies created by its former military leaders. The government has backed severe restrictions imposed by local authorities on Muslims\u2019 freedom of movement and deprivation of basic services in Rakhine State, where most Rohingya live. \nThe bloodletting is also a challenge for Western governments that have showered economic aid and good will on Myanmar in the hope of winning the fealty of the resource-rich fledgling democracy. Those countries have mostly kept their concerns about the treatment of the Rohingya quiet in the hope, diplomats said, of persuading the government to change its stance. \nOn Friday, the crackdown on the ethnic minority continued, when the government ordered Doctors Without Borders, the Rohingya\u2019s main health care provider, to stop providing its services to them. One of the group\u2019s offenses, according to a government official, was the hiring of too many Rohingya. \nSince 2012, many Rohingya, a long-reviled group in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, have been herded into miserable camps they are not allowed to leave, even for work. Those still allowed to live in villages like Du Chee Yar Tan are at the mercy of the local authorities, many of whom are inspired by an extremist Buddhist group whose monks have used the nation\u2019s new freedoms to travel the countryside on motorbikes preaching hatred of Muslims. \nThe latest carnage is a major embarrassment for the government, which has just assumed an important position as the annual chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \nIn a sign of the sensitivity, a visit to the village to assess the conflicting reports about the night of Jan. 13 was cut short when local police officers briefly detained two New York Times reporters and a photographer. \nIn response to a major 2012 spasm of violence in Sittwe that included the firebombing of homes and left an estimated 300 dead, most of them Muslims, President Thein Sein said most Rohingya were in Myanmar illegally, despite their having lived there, in some cases, for generations. His solution: The United Nations should help deport them.\nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel peace laureate and opposition leader, is rarely asked at home about discrimination against the Rohingya because it is broadly accepted in Myanmar. \nShe has defended her lack of action to the foreign news media, saying that taking sides could further exacerbate tensions, an explanation that even her Western supporters believe is calculated to avoid offending voters ahead of elections next year. \nThough there have been attacks on other Muslim groups elsewhere in Myanmar in the past two years, the animosity toward the Rohingya is especially combustible. Many of them were brought to the country from India in British colonial times, and many ethnic Burmese despise them as illegal intruders from what is now Bangladesh.\nAbout 140,000 displaced Rohingya whose homes were destroyed in two major attacks in 2012 now live in more than two dozen camps around Sittwe, a dilapidated trading center. Largely dependent on assistance from international humanitarian groups, which are often harassed by the local authorities, the Rohingya remain trapped in the camps that foreign aid workers call the world\u2019s largest outdoor jails. \nThe presidential spokesman, U Ye Htut, said in a telephone interview that plans last year for \u201cresettlement and rehabilitation\u201d of those in the camps were suspended because the \u201cBengalis did not agree and threw stones,\u201d using a term common in Myanmar for the Rohingya, indicating the belief that they belong in Bangladesh. \nOf the 18 townships in Rakhine State, seven have already barred Muslims from using their clinics, foreign aid workers said. And a report released last week by Fortify Rights, a group that specializes in the Rohingya, chronicled a pattern of discrimination by officials that is intensifying as local authorities appear increasingly desperate to drive the group out. A dozen leaked documents dated from 1993 to 2008 showed the government\u2019s efforts to slow the growth of the Rohingya population, including a requirement for official permission to marry and limits on the number of children couples can have. The presidential spokesman, Mr. Ye Htut, dismissed the findings as \u201ca one-sided view of the Bengali.\u201d\nAs a way out of the bleak camps, nearly 80,000 Rohingya men, women and children last year took perilous sea journeys run by smugglers to Thailand and on to Malaysia or north to Bangladesh. Some drowned in capsized boats, and many were detained in Thailand, said Chris Lewa, the director of the Arakan Project, a human rights group. \n\u201cThe risk seems worth it to them,\u201d she said.\nConstrained Lives\nMuhamed Fourhkhat, 54, and his family have it better than most in the camps and the villages around Sittwe. They have managed \u2014 in a vastly reduced way \u2014 to replicate the lives they had as the scions of a well-to-do Rohingya quarter in Sittwe that flourished with markets, a primary school for Muslim and Buddhist children, a mosque and a monastery.\nIn the town, the family lived on the top stories of two concrete buildings laid with polished teak floors, and worked downstairs at their hardware business. The land had been passed down through his great-grandfather, Mr. Fourhkhat said.\nThe properties were burned by a mob, backed by Rakhine security forces, in June 2012, he said, and bulldozed by the government a few months later. So was every other structure in the neighborhood.\nOn a recent day, the neighborhood was an empty stretch of land overgrown with weeds and littered with plastic bags waving in the wind. An eerie silence has settled over what, by many accounts, was once a friendly marketplace that served both Rakhine and Rohingya.\nMr. Fourhkhat has never returned, though he could probably bribe a police officer to get there for a short visit. \u201cWhy would I?\u201d he asked, pointing out that his beard, touched with henna, gave him away as a Muslim. \u201cIf I went,\u201d he said, making a cutting gesture across his neck, \u201cyou would find my dead body there.\u201d\nHe has built a new, if less sturdy, home of bamboo in a Muslim village that sits astride the camps inside a security perimeter that is designated by the Rakhine government as a place Rohingya can live. \u201cI have never lived in bamboo before,\u201d he said. \nMr. Fourhkhat\u2019s son, Shwe Maung Thani, 28, is a graduate of Sittwe University in biology, getting his diploma before the state expelled all Rohingya students from the school. He has rarely sneaked out of the camp, but tried twice to get his sick mother to a hospital. \nShe died in January after receiving inadequate medical care, he said. \nThe only Rohingya doctor in Rakhine State \u2014 Dr. Tun Aung, trained before a citizenship law in 1982 disqualified Rohingya for medical school \u2014 was jailed after the June 2012 violence. He remains in prison, convicted of inciting violence, despite requests from the United States government for his release, an American official said.\nA Longtime Fear\nThe Rakhine people, a group of about 2.1 million who are fiercely proud of their ancient kingdom, known as Arakan, are fearful of the Rohingya based on \u201can acute sense of demographic besiegement,\u201d according to a recent article by Kyaw San Wai, a Myanmar citizen who is a senior analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. It is a feeling shared by many Buddhists across Myanmar.\nGiven the lack of a census since 1983, the demographics are imprecise. It is generally accepted by Myanmar and international officials that about 89 percent of the roughly 55 million people in Myanmar are Buddhist and 4 percent are Muslim. The Rohingya are a subset of those Muslims, making the Buddhists\u2019 fear of being overwhelmed seem irrational though it is nonetheless real, the experts say.\n\u201cAmong Burmese Buddhists, there is a widespread belief that Buddhism will disappear in the future,\u201d Mr. Wai wrote.\nWhile there is little chance of Muslims taking over the nation, they are enough of a presence here in Rakhine to make their presence felt politically.\nIn the 2010 general election, the central government allowed the Rohingya to vote despite their lack of citizenship, and the results were too close for comfort, said Khaing Pyi Soe, a senior member of the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party. The Rakhine candidate in Sittwe won 52 percent of the vote, and the Rohingya candidate 48 percent. Mr. Khaing Pyi Soe and other officials say the Rohingya must not be allowed to vote next year because with many young Rakhine leaving the impoverished region for work elsewhere, the results would be reversed.\nIn the weeks before the attack on Du Chee Yar Tan, monks from the radical Buddhist movement called 969 visited a town nearby. The monks \u2014 who are at least tolerated by the national government, if not admired by some officials \u2014 have stirred anti-Muslim sentiment throughout parts of Myanmar.\nThere was no formal connection between the appearance of the monks and the killings, experts said, but their hate speech has increasingly infected the sloganeering of Rakhine civilians. Now, they say, even moderate Rakhine feel it would be too dangerous to stand up for reconciliation.\nThe United Nations and the United States have kept up the pressure on Myanmar about the killings in Du Chee Yar Tan, and Myanmar\u2019s government, which has already conducted two fast inquiries, has ordered another and included a Muslim on the panel, though not a Rohingya Muslim. \nOne factor may complicate its investigation: The United Nations report on the attack said nearby villagers reported that in the hours immediately afterward, they saw Rakhine security forces ferry 20 bodies to surrounding hills, probably to cover up the murders. Immediately after the slaughter, 22 wounded and traumatized villagers sought help at rural clinics run by Doctors Without Borders, the group said.\nSome were women traumatized by the horrors they witnessed, according to aid workers familiar with the cases; others sought treatment for wounds. \nAt least some villagers have drifted back to check on their belongings. Zaw Patha, whose son was dragged from the kiosk, found that the goods he guarded had been looted and her cows stolen.\nRed liquid signifying blood was splashed on a school not far from her house, a warning to stay away.\n\u201cTo an extent, I understand the worry of the Rakhine about Rohingya population growth in an area next to Bangladesh,\u201d said the international aid worker. \u201cBut at the same time, you can\u2019t get rid of 1.3 million people.\u201d"}, {"text": "Old Forecast of Famine May Yet Come True\n2014-04-01T21:57:25.000Z\nMight Thomas Malthus be vindicated in the end?\nTwo centuries ago \u2014 only 10 years after a hungry, angry populace had ushered in the French Revolution \u2014 the dour Englishman predicted that exponential population growth would condemn humanity to the edge of subsistence.\n\u201cThe power of population is so superior to the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race,\u201d he wrote with alarm.\nThis was, we now know, wrong. The gloomy forecast was soon buried under an avalanche of progress that spread from England around the world. Between 1820 and the year 2000 the world\u2019s population grew sixfold. Economic output multiplied by more than 50.\nNonetheless, Malthus\u2019s prediction was based on an eminently sensible premise: that the earth\u2019s carrying capacity has a limit. On Monday, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provided a sharp-edged warning about how fast we are approaching this constraint.\n\u201cIn many cases, we are not prepared for the climate-related risks that we already face,\u201d Vicente Barros, co-chairman of the panel and professor emeritus of climatology at the University of Buenos Aires, said in a statement.\nThe list of present damages outlined by the United Nations panel \u2014 melting ice caps and rising sea levels, stressed water supplies, heat waves and heavy rains \u2014 underscored the risk if humanity does not figure out how to curb the use of fossil fuels that have provided the lifeblood for economic development since the time of Malthus.\nBut what most stood out in the report from the panel, which gathers every few years to produce a synthesis of mainstream science\u2019s take on climate change, was that it rolled straight into Malthus\u2019s territory, providing its starkest warning yet about the challenge imposed by global warming on the world\u2019s food supply.\nThe panel\u2019s past report in 2007 had concluded: \u201cGlobally, the potential for food production is projected to increase with increases in local average temperature over a range of one to three degrees Celsius.\u201d\nBut the new report is much more pessimistic about the prospect of extra grain production in the globe\u2019s temperate zones, where more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase the rate of photosynthesis, raising yields, and warmer weather would lengthen the growing season.\nFaster photosynthesis will help weeds more than cereal crops, while the accumulation of ozone and high temperatures would reduce yields of all the major grains, according to the report.\nThis would be bad enough if demand for food were to remain constant. It won\u2019t. Studies suggest that feeding more than nine billion people in 2050 will require 70 percent more calories than the world\u2019s population consumes today, according to Craig Hanson, director of food, forests and water programs at the World Resources Institute.\nIndeed, the panel calculates that food demand is rising at a pace of 14 percent per decade. But it estimates that climate change is already reducing wheat yields by 2 percent each decade \u2014 compared with where they would be in the absence of climate change \u2014 and corn yields by 1 percent.\n\u201cThis is a wake-up call for the agriculture sector,\u201d Mr. Hanson said. \u201cClimate change is a food security issue. It\u2019s not just an environmental issue.\u201d\nThe climate panel\u2019s findings do not quite endorse the Malthusian idea that famine will spread practically everywhere. But a world with a more unstable food supply is likely to be a more volatile place. And those most exposed, of course, will be the world\u2019s poor.\nRecent experience suggests that the productivity of farmland won\u2019t decline gradually as the world grows warmer. World food prices stopped their long secular decline around 2007 and have been on a roller-coaster ride since. More volatile weather patterns promise to bring sharp disruptions to agricultural production that can cause spikes in food prices.\n\u201cThere is a rigorous correlation between food price spikes and urban unrest,\u201d said Andrew Holland, who studies climate change at the American Security Project, a research group in Washington. \u201cThere was a food price spike in 2008, and you can see unrest spread throughout Africa. And there\u2019s a relatively clear line that leads from the food price spike in 2010 to unrest in the Middle East and the Arab Spring.\u201d\nInstability spreads easily. When rice prices jumped in 2007, big producers like India and Vietnam banned exports to protect their domestic markets, while importers like Bangladesh, Nigeria and Iran went out on the market to hoard as much grain as they could. The combination wreaked havoc in commodity markets.\nSince then big food importers, like China, Saudi Arabia and South Korea, have tried to insulate themselves from future food shortages by buying or leasing agricultural land in places like Sudan, Madagascar and Uzbekistan. The strategy is still to be tested in a situation in which Africa or Central Asia were to suffer itself shortages of grain.\n\u201cI have run some war game scenarios,\u201d Mr. Holland said. \u201cThe tendency becomes very quickly for a country to look after its own interests.\u201d\nStill, there are good reasons to take prophesies of doom with more than a pinch of salt. Ecological Cassandras have consistently underestimated humanity\u2019s capacity to invent ways around constraints, using resources more efficiently and switching from scarcer commodities to more abundant ones.\nIn \u201cThe Population Bomb,\u201d published in 1968, the noted Stanford ecologist Paul R. Ehrlich wrote \u201cin the 1970s the world will undergo famines \u2014 hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.\u201d In \u201cThe End of Affluence,\u201d written six years later, he forecast \u201ca genuine age of scarcity\u201d by 1985.\nToday, Professor Ehrlich is perhaps best known for his bet with the economist Julian L. Simon \u2014 a committed believer in the power of human ingenuity \u2014 who in 1980 challenged Mr. Ehrlich to choose any five commodities and accurately predicted that Mr. Ehrlich\u2019s basket would be cheaper 10 years later, not scarcer and more expensive.\nIndeed, the climate panel suggests a variety of ways in which countries could adapt to a changing climate. Farmers could breed new species to better resist heat and drought. Water harvesting techniques could be used to delay evaporation. Rotation of crops could help improve yields.\nThe United Nations panel reported that a survey of various studies concluded that adapting crop management could raise yields of wheat, rice and maize from 15 to 18 percent compared with doing nothing.\nChanges in demand and logistics could also help cope with scarcer food. Mr. Hanson pointed out that fully one-quarter of the food produced in the world today is wasted \u2014 by either poor storage and transport infrastructure in developing countries or wasteful consumers in the rich world.\nBut for all the evidence of humankind\u2019s ability to adapt to its environmental constraints, it would be reckless to assume that ingenuity will arrive just in time to pull us from the brink.\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank that is skeptical about global warming, 13 years ago created the Julian L. Simon Memorial Award to celebrate his \u201cvision of man as the ultimate resource.\u201d But Mr. Simon got lucky, too. Had the bet extended for 30 years rather than 10, it would have gone to Mr. Ehrlich."}, {"text": "Filling Stomachs to Open Minds on Immigration\n2014-07-31T01:04:34.000Z\nSTOCKHOLM \u2014 Last year, when Ebba Akerman, 31, was teaching Swedish to immigrants in the suburbs of this city, she ran into one of her students on the train and asked him whether he enjoyed living in her country.\nShe found the answer deeply disturbing. The man shrugged, saying his life here was not much different from the one he had left behind in Afghanistan.\nIt became clear to her that most of her students, living in neighborhoods packed with immigrants, had virtually no contact with native Swedes.\nIn the months that followed, Ms. Akerman decided to try to change that, calling herself the minister of dinners in charge of the Department of Invitations and using Facebook and Instagram to try to bring individual Swedes and immigrants together for a meal, something like a dating service.\n\u201cWe let people into our country, but not into our society,\u201d Ms. Akerman said on a recent Friday night. She was chopping vegetables, two picnic tables already set up end to end in the backyard of her leafy apartment complex, a stretch of Indian fabric serving as a giant tablecloth. \u201cI finally decided that I had to do something. I could be the connector.\u201d\nAt first, her idea did not get much traction, she said. A lot of Swedish people clicked the \u201clike\u201d button on Facebook, but few stepped up to welcome anyone into their homes. But after several television appearances and news articles about her efforts, the project seemed to take off. Ms. Akerman is now juggling a backlog of about 800 people who want to participate in a dinner.\nThe immigrants are mostly eager and flexible, she said. The Swedish are more inclined to pick a date two months down the road.\nHer Department of Invitations is hardly the stuff of Match.com or eHarmony. Though the project has brought Ms. Akerman a measure of fame in this small country, she said she was still just one young woman with a paper calendar trying to get people together in her spare time. With an easy laugh and a relaxed manner, she waves away any notion that she should worry about common interests or ages. She just asks people whether they have any food allergies and when they are available.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cAny two people should be able to find something to talk about for one dinner.\u201d\nMost of the encounters have been a success, she said, though there have been some bumps along the way, including no-shows, cancellations and some extreme shyness. One immigrant guest arrived hours late, bringing a collection of groceries, including yogurt and milk, as an apology. Others got lost and had to be rescued, not understanding that house numbers are consecutive.\n\u201cAbout 8 p.m. on the night of one of these dinners, if my phone has not rung, I say, \u2018Phew,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.\nLike many European countries, Sweden has seen support for anti-immigrant parties grow in recent years as it has struggled to integrate a record number of arrivals. Many of them have been steered to large apartment complexes on the outskirts of the cities, which have few, if any, Swedes living in them. About one-fifth of Sweden\u2019s population was born either abroad or from two immigrant parents, up from about 11 percent in 2000. The new arrivals come mostly from areas that have experienced conflict, including Afghanistan, the Balkans, Ivory Coast, Somalia and Syria.\nPolls indicate that many Swedes support immigrants and asylum seekers. But a growing minority blames them for crime and worries about the costs associated with getting them settled. The immigrants, too, have vented frustration at being marginalized. In one suburb of Stockholm last year, riots broke out after allegations of police brutality.\nMs. Akerman, who has a master\u2019s degree in sustainable utilization and, like many young Swedes, has often interrupted her studies to travel the world, hardly thinks that her project will solve Sweden\u2019s problems, though she hopes that many more dinners will take place before the next elections in September. \nBut the get-togethers are perhaps a start, she said, an opening that has the potential to enlighten everyone involved. \u201cI was traveling to these neighborhoods to teach, and I realized that at the end of these commuter lines, it was so interesting \u2014 a treasure box in Stockholm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut most Swedes never see that.\u201d\nBringing people together for a meal also offered a way to eliminate any differences between them in social or economic status. \u201cThe encounters that my students have had with Swedes were not really between equals,\u201d Ms. Akerman said. \u201cBut when you sit down to eat at the same table, that goes away. It\u2019s very basic.\u201d\nOn a recent evening, Ms. Akerman was feeding about a dozen people, including a middle-aged couple from Bangladesh who had brought a chicken dish, a recent arrival from Cameroon with her two children, a Swedish marketing expert, the mother of one of Ms. Akerman\u2019s friends and a young Swedish doctor in training, all of whom had been early participants in her project. All told stories of good times and miscues.\nThe marketing expert, Henrik Evrell, said he had served spaghetti Bolognese, the most Swedish dish he knew, to his guest from Ivory Coast. At first they had trouble communicating because his guest\u2019s Swedish was so poor. But soon they discovered that they both spoke French and loved the same Ivory Coast musicians. After eating, they spent the rest of the evening in front of a computer, taking turns pulling up music on Spotify that each thought the other would like. \n\u201cIt was really easy in the end,\u201d said Mr. Evrell, who believes Ms. Akerman should start a foundation and continue her matchmaking full time.\nBecky Faith, who moved from Cameroon to Stockholm 18 months ago, said she had invited a Swedish couple, Jenny and Olaf, over to her house, making fish, potatoes and salad for them. The young couple \u2014 he is a nurse, and she works in a store \u2014 brought some children they were babysitting. \u201cIt was great,\u201d said Ms. Faith, who said she had discovered that some Swedes are shy, but that once they get over that, they \u201care very nice.\u201d\nAt Ms. Akerman\u2019s house, however, some cultural strains were visible immediately. One of the Swedish guests brought her large dog to the event, which prompted Ms. Faith\u2019s children and two young Pakistani women to cower in a corner.\nFatima Haroon, one of the women, tried to be brave, saying such large dogs were often used by the police in her country. "}, {"text": "Climate Study Puts Diplomatic Pressure on Obama\n2014-04-01T02:17:23.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A sweeping new study on the effects of climate change \u2014 which the report says is already disrupting the lives and livelihoods of the poorest people across the planet \u2014 creates a diplomatic challenge for President Obama, who hopes to make action on both climate change and economic inequality hallmarks of his legacy.\nThe report, published this week by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, concludes that the world\u2019s poorest people will suffer the most as temperatures rise, with many of them already contending with food and water shortages, higher rates of disease and premature death, and the violent conflicts that result from those problems.\nCountries like Bangladesh and several in sub-Saharan Africa that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change say the report strengthens their demand for \u201cclimate justice\u201d \u2014 in other words, money, and plenty of it \u2014 from the world\u2019s richest economies and corporations, which they blame for the problem.\nThose countries and nongovernmental organizations point to a 2009 pledge by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to create a $100 billion annual climate fund for poor countries by 2020. The World Bank justified such an expenditure in a 2010 report concluding that it would take up to $100 billion a year to offset the ravages of climate change on poor countries. \nClimate policy experts say that the United States, as the world\u2019s largest economy, would be expected to provide $20 billion to $30 billion of that annual fund.\nThat puts Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, who has been working aggressively behind the scenes to forge a United Nations climate change treaty in 2015, in a tough position.\nBut both men know there is no chance that a Congress focused on cutting domestic spending and jump-starting the economy will enact legislation agreeing to a huge increase in so-called climate aid. Since 2010, the Obama administration has spent about $2.5 billion a year to help foreign countries adapt to climate change and adopt low-carbon energy technology. \nIt will be a stretch even to continue that level of spending. Many Republicans, who control the House and have a chance to gain the Senate this fall, question whether climate change is real.\n\u201cIf the White House actually wants something like this, it should begin by building support among congressional Democrats, but \u2014 at this point \u2014 I don\u2019t see any real signs of support from House or Senate Democratic leaders at all,\u201d said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio.\nVulnerable nations, emboldened by the new United Nations report, are demanding more, not less, from the United States.\nRonald Jean Jumeau, the United Nations ambassador from the island nation of Seychelles, and a spokesman for the Alliance of Small Island States, compared the proposed fund with the amount of money Congress approved after Hurricane Sandy. \n\u201cWe know that $100 billion is not going to be enough,\u201d Mr. Jumeau said. \u201cAfter Sandy, Congress voted for $60 billion in recovery for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut \u2014 for one storm. It shows you how much $100 billion is going to cover.\u201d\n\u201cThe science is getting better, and it tells us things are getting worse for us,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the money is not coming.\u201d\nThe window is starting to close on Mr. Obama\u2019s ability to broker a treaty that could significantly reduce greenhouse gas pollution in time to avoid the most disastrous effects of climate change. This fall, at the United Nations General Assembly, world leaders will meet to put offers on the table for a climate change pact, a mix of commitments to cut fossil fuel pollution at home and provide money to poor countries to adapt. A few months later, at a two-week summit meeting in Lima, Peru, they will negotiate a draft of a final treaty that is set to be signed next year in Paris and take effect in 2020.\nSome areas of the globe are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and inhabitants are being forced to make stark changes in their lives.\nDiplomats say the new report has increased pressure on governments to reach a climate deal. \n\u201cBy underscoring impacts and vulnerabilities, the report makes clear the urgency for strong action to reduce emissions and build greater resilience,\u201d said Todd D. Stern, the State Department\u2019s chief climate change negotiator. \nIn a speech in London last fall, Mr. Stern made clear that there was no chance that the United States would finance most of any climate adaptation fund with taxpayer dollars. \u201cThe fiscal reality of the United States and other developed countries is not going to allow it,\u201d he said. Mr. Stern and others say the bulk of that money will have to come from private investors and corporations.\nNongovernmental organizations say that relying chiefly on the private sector will not be enough, especially as food supplies grow short. \u201cThe scientists could not have been more clear, particularly in the area of food security,\u201d said Timothy Gore, an analyst for Oxfam, the antipoverty group. \u201cThere is no government that\u2019s going to be able to stick around very long if the price of bread keeps going up, if they can\u2019t feed their people.\u201d \n\u201cI challenge anyone in the U.S. government to explain how the private sector is going to invest in what\u2019s needed on the ground, like funding farmers in the Sahel region facing crop loss from changing rainfall patterns,\u201d Mr. Gore said, referring to the area of Africa just south of the Sahara.\nHanging over the coming negotiations will be the specter of the failed 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Vice President Al Gore promised in those talks that the United States would act on climate change, only to have the Senate refuse to ratify that treaty. At a 2009 climate summit meeting in Copenhagen, Mr. Obama promised that Congress would soon pass a sweeping climate change bill. Just months later, the bill died in the Senate.\nMr. Obama is now trying to bolster his credibility on the issue by flexing his executive authority and acting without Congress. His administration is moving ahead with aggressive new Environmental Protection Agency regulations to reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. At talks around the world, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Stern have sought to persuade other nations that, this time, the United States will be able to keep its commitments, since they do not require action from Congress. \nThe United States\u2019 inability to offer more substantial aid to countries that did little to cause global warming will probably remain a major sticking point with developing nations, including India and China. \nStill, Connie Hedegaard, the European Union commissioner for climate action, said she hoped that could eventually be overcome: \u201cI think the $100 billion mark can be reached. It was understood in Copenhagen that it had to be a mix of public and private money. I think vulnerable groups \u2014 families in Bangladesh or the Philippines \u2014 don\u2019t care whether a dollar coming their way is public or private.\u201d"}, {"text": "In India, Latrines Are Truly Lifesavers\n"}, {"text": "Strolling Along East London\u2019s Fournier Street\n2014-10-15T04:00:00.000Z\nA walk down a narrow passageway in the Spitalfields district, where 17th-century Huguenots meet immigrant laborers and contemporary artists \u2014 and time seems to misbehave.\nIn \u201cThe London Nobody Knows,\u201d a documentary made in 1967 and presented by the Hollywood actor James Mason, several minutes are given over to Fournier Street, a short, battered row of old merchants\u2019 houses in the district of Spitalfields in East London. A long sequence shows tramps drinking whisky and a purple liquid (denatured alcohol) from glass bottles, and fighting chaotically outside a defunct synagogue.\nWearing a tie and tweed cap, the aging British movie star cuts an elegant, elegiac figure in the slum. The place was on its knees. By the mid-1960s, most of old Spitalfields had been gutted and turned into sweatshops for Bangladeshi garment workers, the last in a succession of poor immigrants and refugees going back to French Huguenots in the 17th century who had come to the neighborhood to work with cloth. No one lived there by choice. Two art students were renting the floor of a house on Fournier Street for 16 pounds a month \u2014 the cheapest rooms they could find in London. At night, the drunks hollered up at them in the dark. George Passmore looked out in disbelief as the film crew wandered past. \u201cYou probably think I\u2019m mad,\u201d he said to Gilbert Proesch, his fellow student and collaborator, \u201cbut I think James Mason just walked past the window.\u201d\nThat was a long time ago. Gilbert & George, who practice as a single artist, are in their 70s now, and famous around the world. Fournier Street, where they own two townhouses and a run of studios behind, is also changed. When I visited on a recent summer afternoon, the street looked immaculate, a postcard of competing restorations: intricate doorways, smart brickwork and weatherboarded attics. (Houses worth \u00a34,000 in the 1960s fetch \u00a32.5 million these days.) There was a low buzz of neighborly expectation in the air. The artists\u2019 latest show was opening that evening at the White Cube gallery in Bermondsey and half the street seemed to be going.\nIt was the first time I had been back in several years. My wife used to live on Fournier Street, in an informal colony of actors, artists and photographers. They lived in one of the largest houses, Number 27, which was rented out to them at a benevolently cheap rate by a rubber plantation executive in Malaysia named Henry Barlow who is also an expert on moths. Before then, I hadn\u2019t known what the street was called, even though I had walked it many times. Two blocks of brown and plum-colored townhouses, it is one of the city\u2019s small but indispensable thoroughfares \u2014 a blood vessel near the heart. It connects the great, and once-again expanding, financial district around Liverpool Street to the curry houses of Brick Lane and ephemera of the now fashionable East End. The monumental white spire of Christ Church Spitalfields, one of London\u2019s finest baroque churches, designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, stands on the corner, inviting you into the slanting corridor behind.\nAnd once you are inside, time misbehaves. The ordinary sequence of past, present and future doesn\u2019t seem to hold. It\u2019s not just that Fournier Street is old, although of course it is. The street was built back in the 1720s, long before the bulk of 19th-century and Victorian London was laid out, so it has subtly different proportions, an unusual, preindustrial aspect. More apparent is the accelerated passing of eras, the torrent of urban lives that has gone through such a narrow place. In their time, the 34 houses of Fournier Street have been French, Irish, Jewish, West Indian, Bangladeshi, gay, Protestant, Muslim, rich, poor, threadbare, glorious; home to atheists, artists, hedge fund managers, bookmakers, pharmacists, silk weavers, taxi companies and movie stars. Since James Mason\u2019s film, the abandoned synagogue, which was a Nonconformist chapel in the 18th and 19th centuries, has become a mosque. A sundial, dating from the 1740s, is mounted high on the wall. \u201cUmbra sumus,\u201d reads the inscription. We are shadows.\nRodney Archer, a former actor and drama teacher, has lived at Number 31 since 1979. In the hallway, he showed me the bricked-up doorway that used to connect to the house next door. The first residents of Fournier Street were Huguenots, Protestant exiles from France, and they liked to be able to move around out of sight. We went into the garden, where the edges of a 19th-century garment workshop were still visible on the bricks. I sat on a bench and looked up past grapevines and the backs of houses to the white steeple of the church rising behind. \u201cThe view there is unchanged since 1726,\u201d he said.\nMr. Archer caught the first wave of gentrifiers in Spitalfields. They were led by Mariga Guinness, the daughter of a German prince and the estranged wife of an heir to the brewing fortune. In the early 1970s, she moved into a white stucco house on nearby Elder Street, which she did up by hand and where she threw parties for politicians, musicians and property developers. Mr. Archer first came to Fournier Street around then to drink with artists; he still remembers the dark walls, the sense of a lost townscape. When his mother broke her hip and announced that she was coming to live with him, he decided that the only place they could afford a house big and interesting enough to share was here. The house they found belonged to an Indian cab stand. Some turquoise paint remains on the windowsill, a memento. \u201cA lot of people came here because they loved the architecture,\u201d Mr. Archer told me. \u201cI must say I was drawn by the roughness.\u201d\nAt the age of 40, he took a job as a manual laborer at an architectural restoration firm and learned to work with his hands. When he got up for work at 6 each morning, the lights at Gilbert & George\u2019s across the road were already on. In the garden, Mr. Archer reminisced about the neighborhood\u2019s other pioneers \u2014 like Dennis Severs, an eccentric from Escondido, Calif., who lit his house with candles and shared it with a fictional 19th-century family called the Jervises \u2014 and the gradual disappearance of the Jewish tailors and furriers, and the West Indians and the Bangladeshis who sewed in industrial workshops crammed into pine-paneled living rooms. \u201cIt\u2019s all like ghosts,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, the street . . . is packed with people that most of the people now don\u2019t know, and never knew.\u201d Everybody knows Mr. Archer, though. The other day, hearing that he was unwell, Sandra Esquilant, the publican from the Golden Heart on Commercial Street, sent him a bowl of watercress soup from St. John Bread and Wine, a local restaurant, on a tray carried by a waiter. The artist Tracey Emin, who lives a few doors down, came by with flowers.\nI left Mr. Archer to get ready for the opening, and walked back up to Number 5. It used to be the Market Cafe, serving breakfast at 3 a.m. and lunch at 7 a.m. for the drivers and traders at Spitalfields vegetable market, but is now Town House, an antiques shop and cafe with rooms upstairs available to rent. Fiona Atkins bought the building in 2000 and has traced the history to the 1760s, when she believes it was owned by a partnership of Irish and Huguenot weavers. Last year, she commissioned a local artist to paint a map of the neighborhood as it was then, and has put it up in a small outbuilding, encouraging people to pin the names of families that used to live there in the 18th and 19th centuries. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much people have loved it,\u201d she said. The map was bristling with pins. \u201cThey have loved it.\u201d\nThe Huguenots are Fournier Street\u2019s talismans, its elves. They started arriving in large numbers in London in the 1680s, and were quickly making its finest silk garments. They weaved figures from life, working in bright, steamy attics \u2014 sealed with paper to keep in the moisture \u2014 that teemed with dahlias, auriculae, tulips and caged songbirds. Over the centuries, they have become idealized artisans, known for their scholarship as well as their craft. Huguenot Spitalfields was a place of mathematics societies, of amateur historians, of entomologists and poets. It was also a place of flashy decorating, which is why the houses on Fournier Street, inside and out, are pattern books of early Georgian ornament \u2014 of red dressed bricks and curved sash windows, of monogrammed drain heads and smooth-fitting shutters. In the largest houses, the stairwells are joiner\u2019s poems of raking architrave, barley twist, corbel and column-newel. In the attics, there is always room for a loom. Long, low windows beckon in the London light.\nBut it is a delicate business, reaching back to the 18th century. There are practical difficulties. Beautiful as they are, Fournier Street\u2019s houses are flimsy constructions, many held together by surreptitious slips of steel. There is a social pressure in conservation, too. Fournier Street is a place where the houses and gardens nudge up against each another and people confide about their fragile, sloping ceilings. Not everyone wants a neighbor on the doorstep with a jar of hand-mixed paint. Keira Knightley, who bought a house on the street in 2012, reportedly sold it again in 2013. (\u201cShe passed by one day,\u201d recalled Mr. Archer, \u201clooking rather like Virginia Woolf when she was young.\u201d)\nThere are also larger questions of honesty and fairness. With a history as crowded as Fournier Street\u2019s, aesthetic decisions can become political. The long, true story of Spitalfields has been of poverty and decline, of streets thick with the damaged and the desperate. \u201cYou will find the poor weavers and their families crowded together in vile, filthy and unwholesome chambers,\u201d wrote John Thelwall, a local poet, as early as 1795. Reckoning with centuries of hard living means choosing details to enhance, but also chapters to forget, colors to paint over.\nLate in the afternoon, I drank a lassi with Bidhan Goswami, who works at Number 39, the Bangladesh Welfare Association, which has provided free legal advice and lobbied on behalf of the community since 1964. It is the last trace of the Bangladeshi era on the street. Inside, filing cabinets were crammed into 18th-century fireplaces and candles rested on dead light switches. Mr. Goswami spoke of the \u201cgentle threat, the silent threat\u201d of gentrification and conservation erasing the less picturesque aspects of the street\u2019s working past. \u201cThose who sacrificed themselves to make Fournier Street actually Fournier Street are being pushed out,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, the money man will take it over.\u201d Mr. Goswami likes to listen out for the walking tours that now take tourists past his office window. \u201cI think, Yes, I am part of the history as well.\u201d\nWhen I used to stay on Fournier Street, I saw Gilbert & George a handful of times \u2014 giving out tea to the drunks at dawn, stepping out for walks. We only spoke once, when they told me off for littering. A few days after their show opened, we walked through Number 12 and sat in one of the studios that runs behind their two townhouses. It used to belong to their tailor Mr. Lustig \u2014 \u201c \u2018Mr. Happy,\u2019 in German,\u201d said George. The name prompted a recitation of the vanished craftsmen who used to make their suits. \u201cThen we had Mr. Chaplain,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cThen we had . . .\u201d \u201cMr. Simons,\u201d said George, \u201cwho lived across the road.\u201d \u201cThen we had David London.\u201d \u201cLevenberg,\u201d completed George. \u201cJewish tailors from around here. . . . They all retired to play golf in Portugal.\u201d\nThe works in the artists\u2019 new show, \u201cScapegoating,\u201d depict the collision of symbols of contemporary London. Small, bomblike canisters of laughing gas, of the sort favored by clubbers; double-decker buses; women in niqabs. The artists\u2019 central and unmistakable concern is the rise of conservative Islam \u2014 and its attendant homophobia \u2014 on the streets where they have lived and worked for half a century. Gilbert & George have had their front doors kicked in. Young Muslim men interrupt their photo shoots. Spitalfields is a \u201choly place\u201d now, the men say. Taxi drivers mutter their disapproval. \u201cTo which, of course, there is no reply,\u201d said George. \u201cHorrific, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nThe pictures are urgent and uncomfortable. \u201cWe want our Art to bring out the Bigot from inside the Liberal,\u201d runs a slogan on the wall of the exhibition, \u201cand conversely to bring out the Liberal from inside the Bigot.\u201d As so often in their work, Fournier Street is presented as a claustrophobic backdrop of railings, shutters and doors. \u201cIt is an amazing background,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cIt is so enclosed, so narrow. It creates, like, an atmosphere, like going into a room.\u201d \u201cWe are not the artists to travel to Tunisia for inspiration, you know,\u201d said George.\nTalking to the artists, it struck me that there was no trace of the other tensions \u2014 around change, around gentrification, around race \u2014 that I had picked up on in other conversations on Fournier Street. The artists do not want orderly history. A flat sense of time, without perspective, suits them fine. \u201cWe believe in the past, present and future being all together,\u201d said George. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe . . . in modern. We don\u2019t think there is such a thing.\u201d The Huguenots fled religious extremism. John Wilkes, of Wilkes Street, fought for a free press. Spitalfields used to be famous for its rent boys and prostitutes. Now there are conservative mullahs, and covered-up women, who disdain the way the artists live.

Arthur, the vice president, ascended to the presidency after the death of President James A. Garfield. Mr. Arthur was inaugurated in his own home.\nSeeking to reduce its backlog, the commission had been seeking to eliminate from its calendar 94 structures, including 123 Lexington, that have languished on its agenda for five years or more without a vote on whether to grant them landmark protection. Developers welcome the proposal. While the properties could still be reconsidered, preservationists say that the process of placing them on the calendar in the first place can take years. The commission had been expected to vote on its plan for the structures on Tuesday but delayed action because of an outcry from opponents. The fate of 123 Lexington remains unclear.\nSince 1944, the rowhouse has probably been best known as the site of Kalustyan\u2019s, a spice store and deli, which attracts a lot more cooks than history buffs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something important to us,\u201d said Aziz Osmani, a 56-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh, who is one of the owners, \u201cbut for people who don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\nWilliam Fernandez, a 78-year-old retired accountant who has lived in a third-floor apartment with his wife for 40 years, said few people were aware of the building\u2019s history besides the tenants. As for the lobby plaque, he said, \u201cThis is No. 3; the others were stolen.\u201d\nFederal Hall near the New York Stock Exchange is the site most associated with presidential inaugurations, but the original building where George Washington actually took his oath of office in 1789 was razed in 1812.\nMr. Arthur was at home in his second-floor library at 10:35 p.m. on Sept. 19. 1881, with Police Commissioner Stephen B. French, District Attorney Daniel G. Rollins and Elihu Root, a lawyer whom Arthur would name the federal prosecutor in New York, when he learned that Mr. Garfield had died from gunshot wounds that had been inflicted by a disgruntled office seeker on July 2.\nCabinet members wired Mr. Arthur \u201cto take the oath of office as president of the United States without delay.\u201d Mr. Arthur was a Republican stalwart, but the first judge who could be rounded up at that hour was a Democrat, John R. Brady, a New York State Supreme Court justice.\nAfter importuning reporters to stop ringing his doorbell, the new president met with well-wishers and finally went to bed.\nExpectations for Mr. Arthur\u2019s presidency were not high. The New York Times, accusing him of rank cronyism, editorialized shortly after the shooting that he was \u201cabout the last man who would be considered eligible\u201d to succeed Mr. Garfield. That assessment was tempered somewhat following Mr. Garfield\u2019s death, when The Times allowed: \u201cHe is a much better and broader man than the majority of those with whom his recent political career has been identified.\u201d\nAnd, indeed, Mr. Arthur defied expectations by championing, among other things, Civil Service reform, which reduced the influence of party leaders in doling out government jobs.\nThe Constitution does not specify who should administer the oath, but, just to be sure, Mr. Arthur was sworn in again by the chief justice of the Supreme Court after returning to Washington two days later for the first time since Mr. Garfield\u2019s shooting.\nThe number of inaugurations does not guarantee fame, however. A recent study led by Henry L. Roediger III, a professor of psychology at Washington University in St. Louis, found that only 7 percent of college students remembered Mr. Arthur at all."}, {"text": "Online Trail Leads to Arrest of Indian as Man Behind Posts Backing the Islamic State\n2014-12-13T17:29:10.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Police in Bangalore, India, arrested on Saturday the man accused of being behind @ShamiWitness, the Twitter handle of a fervent and widely followed English-language supporter of the Islamic State extremist group.\nThe authorities had been on the hunt for the man, Mehdi Masroor Biswas, since Channel 4 news in Britain broke the improbable story of a clean-shaven Indian executive who it said lived a double life: spending his hours off from his food company far from any Middle Eastern battlefield cheering on the Islamic States\u2019 advances and trying to rally Muslims from around the world to its jihadi cause.\nThe police said Mr. Biswas, 24, would be charged with multiple offenses, including waging war against Asiatic states.\nAs the police closed in on him, Mr. Biswas gave a panicky interview to an Indian newspaper saying that his comments in interviews with Channel 4 had been misconstrued and that his email had been hacked.\nIn a news conference, the Bangalore police commissioner, M. N. Reddy, said that Mr. Biswas had returned to the original story he had given to Channel 4 in Britain, which had tracked him down.\nPublicly espousing violent or radical views is a serious offense in India and can be punished with life in prison. The country\u2019s long history of religious violence \u2014 including the assassination of the country\u2019s founding father, Mohandas K. Gandhi \u2014 has made the authorities particularly sensitive to radical speech.\nMr. Biswas, who is from West Bengal near the border with Bangladesh, worked the food company by day but posted complimentary updates on Twitter about the activities of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, by night, said Mr. Reddy, the police commissioner.\n\u201cHe was particularly close to the English-speaking terrorists of ISIS and became a source of incitement and information for the new recruits trying to join,\u201d Mr. Reddy said. The rise and fall of @ShamiWitness, whose Twitter account has since been deleted, illuminates the role of volunteer sympathizers in the global spread of the Islamic State\u2019s message.\nThe Islamic State has become known not only for its brutal methods of pursuing its goals, but also for its often-sophisticated social media campaign, regularly releasing photo reports, audio messages and professional-quality videos glorifying the group\u2019s activities. But analysts say its message is also magnified by an informal network of supporters who may have no official link to the group.\nChannel 4 said it had found the man behind the @ShamiWitness account by first finding the name of a former Twitter account he had run, and then using that name to search other social media sites until it found a Facebook page belonging to a man named Mehdi.\nAsked in a telephone interview by the channel whether he supported the Islamic State\u2019s methods, which have included mass executions of captive soldiers and videotaped beheadings of journalists and aid workers, the channel said Mr. Biswas replied, \u201cMostly.\u201d\nHe also said that he would like to join the jihadists, but could not.\n\u201cMy family needs me here,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents, they are basically dependent on me.\u201d\nIn interactions with Indian reporters, Mr. Biswas\u2019s father said that his son was being framed."}, {"text": "For Biggest Cities of 2030, Look Toward the Tropics\n2014-07-11T14:11:33.000Z\nREALLY big cities used to be primarily in rich countries. But as the world has urbanized, that has changed.\nThe United Nations this week released its estimates of population in the largest cities \u2014 or \u201curban agglomerations\u201d as the organization calls them because the areas do not necessarily conform to city boundaries \u2014 and found that just eight of the 30 largest cities were in countries that the World Bank defines as high income.\nThat compares with 20 of the top 30 in 1950, the first year for which the United Nations has data. By 2030, the organization projected, only four of the 30 largest cities will be in nations now viewed as high income. Those are Tokyo and Osaka in Japan and New York and Los Angeles in the United States. Of those, only one, Tokyo, will be in the Top 10. That area, which now has 37.8 million people, is expected to remain the world\u2019s largest, but to decline to 37.2 million by then.\n\u201cMany countries are urbanizing at lower levels of development\u201d than in the past, said John R. Wilmoth, the director of the population division of the United Nations. As people leave the countryside because of decreasing need for agricultural workers, he said, the important question will be whether cities have an industrial economy that can provide jobs and an infrastructure that can allow the new residents to live in acceptable conditions.\nHe said that it was easier and less expensive to provide such services as housing, health care, education, electricity and clean water to urban residents than to a similar number of people living in rural areas. But, noting the slums surrounding some cities in poor countries, he added that it was much more difficult to accomplish that after those slums grow.\n\u201cIt is much better if the planning takes place before they arrive,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, this report is something of a wake-up call.\u201d\nNew York, which in 1950 was the largest urban area in the world, with 12.3 million residents, now has 18.6 million but ranks only ninth. In 1950, New York and Tokyo, with 11.3 million people, were the only areas with more than 10 million people. Now, there are 28 such areas, many of them in developing countries. \nTwo of them \u2014 Dhaka in Bangladesh and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 are in countries that the World Bank considers to be low income, meaning that the country\u2019s gross national product is less than $1,046 per person. Eight more are in countries with per capita figures under $4,126, making them lower-middle income according to the World Bank. Those eight include three from India and one each from Egypt, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Philippines.\nAs recently as 1980, areas with more than a million people accounted for 13 percent of the world\u2019s population. Now, the figure is 22 percent, and the United Nations forecasts that will rise to 27 percent by 2030.\nThe increasing urbanization has meant that a greater proportion of those living in large urban agglomerations are in the tropics, including 11 of the 30 largest areas in the world. Of the 1.5 billion people who now live in areas with at least one million people, 35 percent are in the tropics \u2014 defined as being between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. In 1970, when only 406 million people were concentrated in areas with more than a million people, just one-fifth of them were in the tropics.\nThat calculation does not count S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, the fifth largest urban area in the world, as being in the tropics, because its center is just south of the Tropic of Capricorn. But much of the population of the region lies north of the line, and the Brazilian government classifies the region as tropical. If S\u00e3o Paulo were counted as tropical, the tropical share this year would rise to 36 percent."}, {"text": "In New Home, Bronx Dance Academy Seeks to Step Up Its Presence\n2014-04-27T18:51:52.000Z\nArthur Aviles knows how to balance. He can jump onto a pedestal, strike a loose-limbed pose then leap to the ground. Once upon terra firma, he confronts an even more delicate balance: how to ensure the future of his group, the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, as it settles into a new home and a new neighborhood and \u2014 he hopes \u2014 attracts new audiences and backers.\nAfter 14 years in Hunts Point, where he and Charles Rice-Gonzalez, a fellow founder, were at the vanguard of a migration of artists who reinvigorated the area, the group was priced out of its space in the historic Banknote Building. Without missing a beat, it landed in an even more historic location last year, a Gothic Revival stone chapel on the grounds of St. Peter\u2019s Episcopal Church in Westchester Square.\nKnown for throwing festivals that focus on gender, race and sexual orientation, Mr. Aviles and Mr. Rice-Gonzalez are looking to the future with an eye toward engaging their neighbors, who hail from everywhere from the Caribbean to South Asia.\n\u201cWe begin from the stage,\u201d Mr. Aviles said. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking Bangladeshis to come to us if we don\u2019t engage their culture. If we\u2019re in the area, the engagement has to go beyond just ourselves and our own.\u201d\nActually, it begins below the stage. In a cool basement with a low ceiling, long sheets of paper line the walls. Written on one are words and arrows outlining the themes and challenges of running a small nonprofit arts group. On another is a calendar with performance dates and funding deadlines. It is a different but vital choreography that groups like this must master to survive.\nThe Bronx Academy began in the late 1990s in Hunts Point, originally inside a local community center. Mr. Aviles approached the owner of the Banknote Building about using vacant space for a performance, which evolved into a long-term, low-rent lease. Their first show relied on the kindness of friends, whose donations included a parquet dance floor, lights and a sound system.\nIts tenure in the area made it a cultural anchor, as the building\u2019s owner, the Blauner family, carved out 600-square-foot studios for a variety of other artists.\n\u201cWe ended up renting the whole floor to artists,\u201d said Gail Blauner, whose father bought the building in the 1980s. \u201cBut they were the beginning of the art community in my building,\u201d she added, referring to the academy.\nThe Blauners sold the building in 2007 to an investment group led by Taconic Investment Partners, which promoted it as a mecca for creative types. But the real estate market soured, rents rose and almost all the artists left. The building will soon house New York City\u2019s Human Resources Administration as a major tenant.\nThe Bronx Academy held on until last year, when the group decided it had to move; apart from not being able to afford a rent increase, it needed a long-term lease to assure its supporters that it was sustainable. A partner of Taconic\u2019s put the academy in touch with St. Peter\u2019s, whose chapel had once housed a theater group.\n\u201cWe needed somewhere to land and figured this could be the place,\u201d said Mr. Rice-Gonzalez, the Bronx Academy\u2019s executive director. \u201cWith a five-year lease, that gave us breathing room to go on with our programs and be able to plan.\u201d\nThe academy\u2019s new home puts it a short walk from the future headquarters of the Bronx Council on the Arts. It is a strategic fit, said Bill Aguado, the council\u2019s former executive director who gave the Bronx Academy its first major grant to move into the Banknote.\n\u201cThe council\u2019s building was always thought of as one of the anchors for the arts and economic development in the area,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving Charles and Arthur move there adds another major arts organization. It\u2019s the perfect community, largely middle-class homeowners, Latino, Indian and African-American and white. If you want to build audiences, you have to go where there is a potential for earned income.\u201d\nA chance to appeal to those neighbors will come in May, when the group stages its \u201cBoogie Down Dance Series.\u201d It is something the academy takes seriously as standard bearers for an art form that gave the borough its nickname.\n\u201cYou think about the Bronx and you think about dance,\u201d Mr. Aviles said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Boogie Down Bronx. No other borough refers to itself in that way, talking about movement and culture. We are known in the world as the Boogie Down. When you come to the Bronx, you got to get down, move your body and get funky.\u201d\nAnd, maybe get paid, just like Money Making Manhattan."}, {"text": "Reducing Carbon by Curbing Population\n2014-08-05T22:04:31.000Z\nRemember the population explosion?\nWhen population was growing at its fastest rate in human history in the decades after World War II, the sense that overpopulation was stunting economic development and stoking political instability took hold from New Delhi to the United Nations\u2019 headquarters in New York, sending policy makers on an urgent quest to stop it.\nIn the 1970s the Indian government forcibly sterilized millions of women. Families in Bangladesh, Indonesia and elsewhere were forced to have fewer children. In 1974, the United Nations organized its first World Population Conference to debate population control. China rolled out its one-child policy in 1980.\nThen, almost as suddenly as it had begun, the demographic \u201ccrisis\u201d was over. As fertility rates in most of the world dropped to around the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman \u2014 with the one major exception of sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 population specialists and politicians turned to other issues.\nBy 1994, when the U.N. held its last population conference, in Cairo, demographic targets had pretty much been abandoned, replaced by an agenda centered on empowering women, reducing infant mortality and increasing access to reproductive health.\n\u201cSome people still regret that; some applaud it,\u201d said Joel E. Cohen, who heads the Laboratory of Populations at Rockefeller University in New York. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need demographic goals but we need forward thinking.\u201d\nWell, concerns about population seem to be creeping back. As the threat of climate change has evolved from a fuzzy faraway concept to one of the central existential threats to humanity, scholars like Professor Cohen have noted that reducing the burning of fossil fuels might be easier if there were fewer of us consuming them.\n\u201cPopulation wouldn\u2019t be the whole story but it could make a big difference,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\nAn article published in 2010 by researchers from the United States, Germany and Austria concluded that if the world\u2019s population reached only 7.5 billion people by midcentury, rather than more than nine billion, in 2050 we would be spewing five billion to nine billion fewer tons of carbon dioxide into the air.\nThis alone would deliver 16 to 29 percent of the emission reductions needed over the next four decades to keep the global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above that of the late 19th century, the threshold scientists predict could lead to severe disruptions to the climate.\nSlower population growth could bring other benefits. The World Resources Institute has been looking into how the world will feed itself in 2050 without busting the carbon budget.\nOn current demographic and economic projections, food production would have to increase 70 percent by 2050. \u201cPopulation growth is responsible for about one-half of increased food consumption,\u201d said Tim Searchinger of the World Resources Institute. \u201cThe other half comes from higher incomes and richer diets.\u201d\nMuch of the expected population growth is set in stone, but sub-Saharan Africa, expected to add 1.2 billion people by 2050 on top of its current 900 million, is an exception.\nIf fertility in sub-Saharan Africa slowed more rapidly than projected \u2014 declining to 2.1 children per woman in 2050 from 5.4 today \u2014 feeding the most undernourished region in the world would be a lot easier.  And sparing African forests and woodlands from even greater deforestation would substantially reduce the amount of carbon entering the atmosphere.\nFor all the benefits of slower population growth, population policies remain a highly touchy subject.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, rich nations\u2019 support for population control in poor countries smacked of just another form of colonialism. Coercive population control \u2014 like India\u2019s forced sterilizations, which were abandoned after they led to the collapse of Indira Gandhi\u2019s government in 1977, or China\u2019s one-child policy, which remains in place \u2014 is now widely considered a blatant violation of human rights.\nEven China\u2019s one-child policy is undergoing re-examination in Beijing because of the skewing of the country\u2019s sex ratio \u2014 countless pregnancies have been aborted and millions of girls have been killed or left to die by parents who had hoped for a boy \u2014 and the tearing of the traditional safety net from so many elderly Chinese being forced to rely on only one child for support. Economists at the International Monetary Fund have even welcomed Africa\u2019s fast-rising population as an opportunity to increase its pace of economic growth.\nPopulation growth is only one factor \u2014 and not necessarily the most important one \u2014 contributing to global climate change. Over the course of the 20th century, emissions of carbon dioxide grew 180 percent faster than the population in poor countries and 60 percent faster than the population in rich ones. Shifting the world economy into more sustainable energy sources and away from fossil fuels is still the most promising strategy.\n\u201cThere is a strong case to be made that the world faces sustainability issues whether it has nine billion people, seven billion people or four billion people,\u201d said John Wilmoth, who directs the United Nations Population Division. \u201cNobody can deny that population growth is a major driving factor, but in terms of the policy response, what are you going to do?\u201d\nYet there are ways to make a difference on the population front that do not depend on coercive governments straying into people\u2019s bedrooms.\nAccess to education is critical. Across human history, fertility rates have fallen when it has made economic sense for families to have fewer children. Education \u2014 especially of girls \u2014 has played a powerful role in expediting the decline.\nAcross much of the developing world, more educated women have fewer children, and their offspring are more likely to survive. The spread of public education was accompanied by plummeting fertility rates in such disparate places as Brazil and Iran.\nThe other obvious tool is access to reproductive health. In the developing world, 222 million women have an unmet need for modern contraception, according to one study. Providing them with it, at a relatively small cost of $4 billion a year, could prevent 54 million unintended pregnancies.\nThese are hardly new ideas. The U.N. population conference in Cairo 20 years ago suggested pretty much this approach.\nBut we are not there yet. Out of every 1,000 children born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, 99 die before the age of 5. In Nigeria, it is 123. A third of the girls in Mali are not enrolled in elementary school. Neither are 60 percent of Liberian girls.\nBy contrast, 95 percent of Guatemalan girls are enrolled in elementary school, as are 97 percent of Cambodian girls. In Bangladesh and Bolivia, among the poorest countries outside Africa, only about 40 of every 1,000 children die before they reach 5 years old.\nDuring the General Assembly next month, the United Nations plans to hold a meeting to mark the anniversary of the Cairo conference. And it is organizing another to discuss new commitments to mitigate climate change. Perhaps delegates will notice the connection."}, {"text": "Today in Small Business: Don\u2019t Turn Left\n"}, {"text": "At Mocha Hookah in Brooklyn Heights, Tasting Mint, Orange and Home\n2014-09-05T20:54:50.000Z\nNew York is famously the melting pot. But in reality, maybe the city is more like a Middle Eastern meze platter: varied tastes and colors neatly and randomly assembled to please a range of tastes. This is the case at Mocha Hookah, a 24-hour hookah bar and cafe on Atlantic Avenue, and probably the only public place to smoke a water pipe in the heart of brownstone Brooklyn. There, on a recent Wednesday night, three friends huddled around an iPhone, drinking milkshakes and blowing sweet smoke from a burbling glass carafe. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no drama here,\u201d said Melissa Melendez, a student with cheek studs and a smattering of tattoos. Ms. Melendez learned about Mocha Hookah from her older half brother. \u201cHe\u2019s half Palestinian, half Puerto Rican,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cThat\u2019s hot, right?\u201d Meghan Santos, 21, said enthusiastically. After a pause she asked, \u201cAnybody want cheese fries?\u201d \nAt Mocha Hookah, the eclectic cuisine is part of the draw. In addition to meze plates and traditional Yemeni dishes like lamb ghallaba, the menu includes gelato, cappuccino, even bubble tea. \nAll of these items populate the table tops, around which sit a mix of first-generation Arab-American 20-somethings, Yemeni men in their 50s, yuppies on a date and fashionable real estate agents. \nStill, the place feels very much like a traditional hookah bar on the West Bank or in Algiers. There is no alcohol, and the mounted televisions are tuned to Al Jazeera and spicy Arabic music videos. There\u2019s also a dark and smoky back room, where regulars (mostly men) watch movies and chat in Arabic. \nA co-owner, Ammar Sulaiman, 34, whose family is from Yemen, said the cafe appealed \u201cto the guys who want to feel like they\u2019re back at home.\u201d Before Mocha Hookah, \u201cthey\u2019d go to Bay Ridge or Astoria,\u201d he said, but that is too far. At another banquette, Bangladeshi Uber drivers played a high-speed Bengali board game called Ludo. They come in almost every day and sit for hours. A 23-year-old waitress named Layla exhaled thick smoke clouds from her own hookah. \u201cThose guys always tell me they\u2019re not coming back,\u201d she said. \u201cI tell them, \u2018If I slapped you in the face, you\u2019d be back tomorrow.\u2019\u00a0\u201d \nLayla approached the table. She was dressed in her typical work uniform: a black hijab and a long-sleeve, floor-length jilbab, and she was chewing the requisite waitress gum. After taking the order, she teased one of the players about his accent. The whole table laughed. \n\u201cWe can play and chill as long as we want,\u201d said Hassan Uddim, 33, not looking up from the board. \nThey were smoking molasses-soaked mint herbs packed in a scooped-out orange. Like all of the flavors at Mocha Hookah, theirs was a purely herbal concoction \u2014 no tobacco, no nicotine. Just as important was the natural coal, which sat on the tinfoil-covered orange. Many hookah bars use chemically treated discs. They light quickly, but aficionados say they grill your lungs.\nAfter taking the drivers\u2019 orders, Layla delivered milky Yemeni tea to two African-American real estate agents wearing hijabs and statement jewelry. (They asked not to be identified, because their friends might not approve of their smoking.) As they sipped the sweet drink, the women discussed the changing neighborhood, lamenting how big chains were taking over. \nThey considered Mocha Hookah a victory for old Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s like the African-American barber shop,\u201d one woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a congregation spot. We like our Trader Joe\u2019s, but we need some place to call home.\u201d"}, {"text": "Workers at N.Y.U.\u2019s Abu Dhabi Site Faced Harsh Conditions\n2014-05-19T01:40:16.000Z\nABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 The strike had entered its second day when construction workers at Labor Camp 42 got word that their bosses from the BK Gulf corporation had come to negotiate. Mohammed Amir Waheed Sirkar, an electrician from Bangladesh, scrambled down the stairs to meet them. But when he got to the courtyard, he saw the truth: It wasn\u2019t the bosses who had come. It was the police.\nThey pounded on doors, breaking some down, and hauled dozens of men to prison. Mr. Sirkar was taken to a Dubai police station, where officers interrogated him. After a while, new officers arrived. That\u2019s when things got rough. \n\u201cThey beat me up,\u201d he said through an Urdu interpreter, \u201casking me to confess I was involved in starting the strike.\u201d Others were slapped, kicked, or beaten with shoes, a special indignity in Arab culture. \nAfter nine days in jail, Mr. Sirkar was deported, as were hundreds of other workers.\nThe forceful response was typical for the United Arab Emirates, where strikes are illegal and labor conditions grim, but most of the men who went on strike last October were working on a project that originated in America: a large new campus for New York University.\nFacing criticism for venturing into a country where dissent is not tolerated and labor can resemble indentured servitude, N.Y.U. in 2009 issued a \u201cstatement of labor values\u201d that it said would guarantee fair treatment of workers. But interviews by The New York Times with dozens of workers who built N.Y.U.\u2019s recently completed campus found that conditions on the project were often starkly different from the ideal. \nVirtually every one said he had to pay recruitment fees of up to a year\u2019s wages to get his job and had never been reimbursed. N.Y.U.\u2019s list of labor values said that contractors are supposed to pay back all such fees. Most of the men described having to work 11 or 12 hours a day, six or seven days a week, just to earn close to what they had originally been promised, despite a provision in the labor statement that overtime should be voluntary. \nThe men said they were not allowed to hold onto their passports, in spite of promises to the contrary. And the experiences of the BK Gulf strikers, a half dozen of whom were reached by The Times in their home countries, stand in contrast to the standard that all workers should have the right to redress labor disputes without \u201charassment, intimidation, or retaliation.\u201d\nSome men lived in squalor, 15 men to a room. The university said there should be no more than four.\n\u201cNot happy,\u201d Munawar, a painter from Bangladesh who only gave one name declared, speaking in limited English. Back home, he said, they have lives, families. \u201cCome here,\u201d he concluded, \u201cnot happy.\u201d\nN.Y.U. Abu Dhabi is a bold undertaking, matching the ambitions of one of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations with those of America\u2019s largest private university. It is also one of the most closely watched of a growing number of experiments in academic globalization. N.Y.U.\u2019s president, John Sexton, has called the outpost, an entire degree-granting institution, \u201can opportunity to transform the university and, frankly, the world.\u201d\n\u00a0But Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, is an unlikely setting for a university built on the American model. Academic freedom is unheard-of, criticizing government is a crime and an employment system known as kafala leaves millions of immigrant workers tethered to the companies that sponsor their visas. \nN.Y.U. has said the campus will be built and run as a \u201ccultural free zone,\u201d where the university\u2019s core values prevail, from the treatment of workers to the protection of scholarly inquiry. The university says that its efforts to ensure humane living and working conditions have been unprecedented.\nTold of the laborers\u2019 complaints, officials said they could not vouch for the treatment of individual construction workers, since they are not employees of the university but rather of companies that work as contractors or subcontractors for the government agency overseeing the project. Those companies are contractually obligated to follow the statement of labor values. \nTo help monitor the situation, an engineering firm, Mott MacDonald, has been on hand to interview workers and prepare annual reports. The latest, released last month, noted some challenges, including a single contractor who fell behind on one month\u2019s wages, but concluded, \u201cOver all, there is strong evidence confirming the N.Y.U.A.D. project is taking workers\u2019 rights seriously.\u201d \nThe report made no mention of the BK Gulf strike, or the strikers\u2019 demands for more pay. \nMott MacDonald declined to discuss its report. John Beckman, N.Y.U.\u2019s chief spokesman, said in a recent email that university officials were not aware of any unrest and were \u201cworking with our partners to have it investigated.\u201d \nLuxury Next Door\nN.Y.U. Abu Dhabi rises just to the northeast of the city\u2019s busy downtown, on a vast sun-baked expanse called Saadiyat Island. The island, whose name means \u201chappiness\u201d in Arabic, is being developed as a world-class culture destination, with outposts of the Louvre and the Guggenheim Museum that, like its neighbor, were paid for by Abu Dhabi\u2019s ruler, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan. \nThe broad slope of a lacy dome is just now coming into view on the Louvre\u2019s site. The Guggenheim is still just a building-size hole, with a skeleton crew of workers pumping out water. But both museum projects have attracted unwelcome attention from human rights groups. In March, members of Gulf Labor, a group of artists and writers, unfurled protest banners in the Guggenheim\u2019s New York home to call attention to working conditions in Abu Dhabi. \nRichard Armstrong, the Guggenheim\u2019s director, said it was committed to fair labor standards and noted that \u201cthe Guggenheim Abu Dhabi is not yet under construction.\u201d \nN.Y.U.\u2019s construction is now complete. When the undergraduate program, which has so far been operating out of temporary facilities, holds its first graduation on Sunday at the new campus, former President Bill Clinton will be on hand to usher N.Y.U. into the next phase of its life as a \u201cglobal network university.\u201d\nThe visa cancellation for a Bangladeshi worker from New York University\u2019s Saadiyat Island campus, one of hundreds sent home because of \u201crefusal to work\u201d last October. The men, employees of the BK Gulf company, went on strike, which is illegal in the United Arab Emirates.\nA vast majority of the roughly 6,000 people who built that campus have been housed in large labor camps. Security guards keep visitors from entering those camps, but N.Y.U. officials say the conditions there are excellent, with what are described as \u201con-site leisure facilities\u201d and \u201ca wide range of recreational pursuits.\u201d \nThe company Munawar works for, City Falcon, housed him, along with a few dozen other laborers, in a small tenement building in the city\u2019s business district. \nJust a few blocks up the street are the modern buildings that have served as N.Y.U.\u2019s temporary campus; a few blocks in the other direction is the stunning ultraluxury hotel where the university has staged cultural events. \nInside City Falcon\u2019s squalid quarters, the bedrooms are so crowded that the men must sleep three to a stack \u2014 one on the upper bunk, one on the lower bunk and one below the lower bunk, separated from the floor by only a thin pad for a mattress. In the space between the beds, the men pile cauliflower, onions and 75-pound sacks of Basmati rice to cook after working all day and washing the construction dirt from their clothes. Tangles of exposed wiring hang down from the ceiling, and cockroaches climb the walls. \nIn the smaller of the two rooms in this apartment, where the only window is covered over, more than a dozen men share a space of barely 200 square feet. They drape towels down from the bed above them to eke out a tiny realm of privacy. \nThe men who live there, like millions of other South Asian laborers in Abu Dhabi, came for one reason: to earn money for their families back home. One City Falcon employee, a soft-spoken man with a boyish face, is helping support five brothers. Another supports four children, ages 6 to 14. Others have toddlers they have never met. \nTwo Emiratis chat at a restaurant on the 74th floor of the Jumeirah at Etihad Towers hotel in Abu Dhabi. By law, every business in the United Arab Emirates, except those in specially designated \u201cfree zones,\u201d must be at least 51 percent owned by Emiratis.\nTwo Emiratis chat at a restaurant on the 74th floor of the Jumeirah at Etihad Towers hotel in Abu Dhabi. By law, every business in the United Arab Emirates, except those in specially designated \u201cfree zones,\u201d must be at least 51 percent owned by Emiratis.\nTourists walk up the stairs of the Emirates Palace hotel. The city has grown at a dizzying pace fueled by profits from the oil industry. Recently Abu Dhabi has begun to try to diversify its economy, with an eye toward a future in which oil might play a smaller role.\nOn Yas Island, Abu Dhabi\u2019s entertainment center, the Formula One track is a major attraction. Every Tuesday night, from 6 to 9, the track opens to cyclists and joggers. A predominantly expatriate crowd gathers for some exercise and social contact.\nEmiratis make up only 15 percent of the population of the U.A.E.; the other 85 percent are immigrants from around the world who come to work but who do not attain citizenship.\n\u00a0\nOne painter said he was promised a base pay of 1,500 dirham a month, or $408. After he arrived, he said, he found out it would be 700 dirham, about what other Saadiyat Island construction workers have been reported to make. \nOvertime boosts that to 1,000 dirham, or $272. But food costs more than a third of that. Cellphones, the men\u2019s lifeline to the world they left behind, take another cut. And the annual raises they were promised have not materialized. Even working 11 hours a day, six days a week, they struggle to send home much more than $100 a month.\nThat is how the numbers work on paper; in reality they are far worse. Almost all of the several dozen workers interviewed, working for a variety of companies and living at a half-dozen labor camps, said that a recruiter back home charged them about a year\u2019s wages to land them the jobs. (Recruitment fees are widespread in the U.A.E., despite being officially illegal; Human Rights Watch calls them \u201cthe single greatest factor in creating conditions of forced labor.\u201d)\nThe City Falcon workers, like all the men interviewed, said they were not allowed to keep their own passports. A group of laborers in a nearby apartment who had recently finished installing furniture on the Saadiyat Island campus said they were not even allowed to hold their own bank cards. To get cash they have to ask the man they called the \u201cowner\u201d: the recruiter who brought them over from Bangladesh, who sleeps in the room with them.\nAttempts to reach City Falcon managers were not successful. \nBK Gulf, the company whose workers went on strike last October, said it was \u201cobliged by confidentiality clauses to make no comment whatsoever without the express permission of our client.\u201d Mubadala, the government entity overseeing the construction of the N.Y.U. campus, said it would not comment on any aspect of the project.\nChallenging the System\nBy laying out its standards for labor in a country with no tradition of workers\u2019 rights, N.Y.U. took on a considerable challenge \u2014 one that many companies in the region are content to ignore. Sustaining the academic freedom that is a core value of its New York campus will pose a similar challenge. In both cases, the challenge is made more complex by the fact that the university is in effect a guest of the ruling family, which has not only paid for the 21-building campus and for generous tuition subsidies, but also has contributed the first of what are expected to be several $50 million donations to N.Y.U. as a whole.\nIn recent years, the United Arab Emirates, which has been accused of torturing political prisoners, has intensified its crackdown on dissent. And though neighboring Qatar, which is preparing for the 2022 World Cup, recently announced reforms to the kafala system, in U.A.E. it remains firmly in place.\nOn some of the labor protections that N.Y.U. set forth, including a ban on child labor and a requirement that workers get free transportation to their job sites, The Times\u2019s reporting turned up no violations. \nMargaret Bavuso, the executive director of campus operations for N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi, said she had worked closely with contractors and the government of Abu Dhabi to ensure better conditions than laborers in the U.A.E. could otherwise expect. \u201cThe government has become much, much more responsive in the time that we\u2019ve been here,\u201d she said, citing among other things new rules to ban outdoor work during the hottest hours of the hottest months. \nShe is especially proud of the university\u2019s safety record, achieved in part through a program that rewards workers who notice potential hazards. According to the university, only one worker has died, and its accident rate \u2014 0.03 accidents per 100,000 work hours \u2014 was far lower than at other large-scale construction jobs, including Olympic Park in London, which had a rate of 0.16. \nAt one of the recent safety awards ceremonies, Ms. Bavuso said, Al Bloom, the vice chancellor of N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi, addressed thousands of laborers who had come from countries like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal. Ms. Bavuso says he told them: \u201cAll of you have worked so very hard on this project. Your children are benefiting from the work that you do on this project. There is no reason that those children, as they get educated in your country, that they can\u2019t apply to go to school here. And just think about how exciting it would be for them to attend a school that you built.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nMr. Beckman, the N.Y.U. spokesman, disputed that some workers are not paid a living wage. \u201cWages on the N.Y.U.A.D. project are designed to place workers at the top of the range in their respective categories,\u201d he said. \nBut in a separate interview, Ms. Bavuso said that beyond setting forth the broad principle of fair compensation, N.Y.U. does not actually monitor what the construction companies pay their workers, nor should it. \u201cWe\u2019re not involved in the negotiation of the contracts that the partners are doing, just as they\u2019re not in the negotiation of the contracts that we\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a relationship with our partners, and so we have to trust that what they\u2019re coming up with are the reasonable wages on their end.\u201d \nN.Y.U. officials said that no complaints had been raised about the treatment of the security guards, cafeteria cooks and secretaries who staffed N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi\u2019s temporary location while its permanent campus was being built. Over the years, 19 of them were identified as having paid a recruitment fee, and they were reimbursed, officials said. \nAs for the men who were building the new campus \u2014 who outnumber those nonconstruction staff members by about 30 to 1 \u2014 Ms. Bavuso drew a distinction. Construction workers who \u201cwere recruited for this job,\u201d she said, are treated with the same protections as the university\u2019s own staff. But that is not possible, she said, for a worker brought over by a construction company and moved from site to site.\nThe construction workers, however, did not describe having been recruited for any particular job site. They say they were recruited by manpower agencies or by construction companies that, like most large contractors, have people stationed at several job sites. The men might spend five months on one project, two years on another, just going where they are sent. \nStuck in Limbo\nWith major construction at N.Y.U. now concluded, most workers have moved on to other job sites. Those who were arrested for striking are back in their home countries. \nRamkumar Rai and Tibendra Kota, two Nepali men who worked for a contractor, Robodh, on the N.Y.U. site (for months, in Mr. Rai\u2019s case; years, in Mr. Kota\u2019s), are still in limbo. \nFrom a certain perspective, both were success stories. They got promotions. They got raises. They made decent money. But during their last six months on the university site, their employer fell behind on wages. And then in February 2013, their jobs came to an end.\nSince then they have asked many times for their back pay, and have even gone to the company\u2019s headquarters in Dubai, where they say they got a meeting with someone who introduced himself as the chief executive. But they have gotten only tiny sums of cash, and a request that they not pursue the matter in labor court. \nIt has been 16 months since they were last paid, during which time their work visas expired; even if they decided to give up the fight, they would face stiff exit fines at the airport. They could not afford to fly themselves home anyway: Over the course of more than a year without pay, they have racked up more than $1,000 in debt at the local grocery. So they stay, and they wait. \nJayaprakash Punathil, an assistant general manager at Robodh, said he was not aware of any outstanding payments. \nSaid Mr. Rai: \n\u201cThey keep saying, \u2018We\u2019ll send the money; we\u2019ll send it,\u2019 but they don\u2019t.\u201d \n\u201cThere\u2019s no work; there\u2019s no money: It\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving done so much work, to have no money: It\u2019s so painful.\u201d"}, {"text": "Death Stalks Muslims as Myanmar Cuts Off Aid\n2014-05-03T01:44:07.000Z\nSITTWE, Myanmar \u2014 By the time the baby girl was brought to the makeshift pharmacy, her chest was heaving, her temperature soaring. The supply of oxygen that might have helped was now off limits, in a Doctors Without Borders clinic shut down by the government in February.\nA hospital visit was out of the question; admission for Rohingya Muslims, a long-persecuted minority, always requires a lengthy approval process \u2014 time that the baby, named Parmin, did not have. In desperation, the pharmacy owner sent the family to the rarely staffed Dapaing clinic, the only government emergency health center for the tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims herded into displaced people\u2019s camps. Although it was just 4 p.m., the doors were shuttered.\n\u201cWe became like crazy people, running everywhere,\u201d the child\u2019s grandmother, Daw Mu Mu Lwin, said. With no good choices left, the family returned to the pharmacy, where Parmin died, untreated, three and a half hours later, cradled in her grandmother\u2019s arms.\nThe baby\u2019s death was part of a rapidly expanding death toll and humanitarian crisis among the Rohingya, a Muslim minority that Myanmar\u2019s Buddhist-led government has increasingly deprived of the most basic liberties and aid even as it trumpets its latest democratic reforms.\nThe crisis began with the government\u2019s expulsion of Doctors Without Borders, one of the world\u2019s premier humanitarian aid groups and the lifeline to health care for more than a million Rohingya increasingly denied those services by their own government. But the situation has grown more dire in recent weeks, as local Buddhist officials began severely restricting other humanitarian aid to the camps and the rest of Rakhine State, where tuberculosis, waterborne illnesses and malnutrition are endemic.\nSome aid workers fear they are being kept away so there are fewer witnesses to rampant mistreatment and occasional bloodletting; the doctor\u2019s group was expelled from Rakhine State after caring for victims of a violent assault on a Rohingya village that the government denies ever happened.\nThe scope of the government crackdown is serious enough that it has inspired at least some rebukes from world leaders after near silence even as Myanmar\u2019s government ignored violence by local Buddhists in 2012 that left hundreds of Muslims dead and drove many others into the displaced people\u2019s camps. Loath to criticize the government as it moves the country away from a military dictatorship, international leaders also fear losing out in an international scramble for Myanmar\u2019s business, and allegiance.\nThe Obama administration \u2014 which has been eager to keep strategically positioned Myanmar away from China \u2014 weighed in when the president admonished Myanmar\u2019s leaders during his recent Asian tour, saying: \u201cMyanmar won\u2019t succeed if the Muslim population is oppressed.\u201d\nAnd Tomas Ojea Quintana, who was the United Nations representative responsible for human rights in Myanmar until March, says the government\u2019s obstruction of humanitarian aid \u201ccould amount to crimes against humanity.\u201d\nEven those foreign aid workers who have been able to return to work in recent days, do so amid heightened security fears. State government officials recently allowed a radical Buddhist monk to preach for 10 days in the region, stirring up passions among Buddhists. After the visit by the monk, Ashin Wirahtu, radical Buddhists ransacked the facilities of more than a dozen aid and U.N. agencies, including the Red Cross, forcing more than 300 foreign aid workers to evacuate.\nTwo battalions of riot police officers, and a Myanmar Army division remained in their barracks.\nWith most foreign aid workers gone, it is impossible to accurately assess the number of deaths caused by the absence of lifesaving medical services; the government fails to keep or share health records. Aid workers, however, say they see the evidence of a building crisis.\n\u201cFor sure the deaths are accelerating,\u201d said Dr. Liviu Vedrasco, the head of the health care cluster for the World Health Organization in Myanmar.\nOne indicator of the seriousness of the situation: Doctors Without Borders had sent about 400 emergency cases every month to local hospitals. In March, fewer than 20 people got referrals required by the government, according to W.H.O.\nSome of the only aid currently being provided is food rations from the World Food Program, which has been allowed to deliver rice and oil to the camps, a move some aid agencies say they believe is aimed at averting the bad publicity that could come with mass starvation. Even before the slashing of other aid, though, the World Health Organization reported that the food program was not sufficient to prevent malnutrition in the camps in Rakhine State or to stop the chronic acute malnutrition in northern areas of Rakhine State where many other Rohingya live.\nAt a temporary clinic set up by wealthy out-of-state Muslims after Doctors Without Borders was banned, U Maung Maung Hla, a volunteer medical assistant, surveyed the women clustered on the floor in front of him, holding emaciated babies. The children, he said, needed more than the one-time ration of vitamins he was offering.\n\u201cThese children are only being fed rice,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these conditions continue, all the babies will die.\u201d\nThe Rohingya, denied citizenship, have long been outcasts in Myanmar, formerly called Burma. Many in the Buddhist-majority country believe the Rohingya should go to Bangladesh, even though many are not from there, or come from families that have been in Myanmar for generations.\nThe camps outside Sittwe, where more than 100,000 of the 1.3 million Rohingya in Myanmar live, were set up after the 2012 burning of the Rohingya neighborhoods in the town, a dilapidated trading center on the Bay of Bengal. Aid workers say the camps, where tight security prevents people from leaving, even to work, have become little more than sprawling prisons.\nUntil Doctors Without Borders was chased out of the region, some of the few people who got to leave the camps were the desperately ill, bound for the town\u2019s hospital. Now, even few of the sick leave.\nIn response to the recent international criticism, the Myanmar government spokesman, Ye Htut, this week told a radio network that \u201cthere is no state-sanctioned discrimination against Muslims.\u201d He also said there was no \u201coutbreak of disease\u201d in the camps because Myanmar\u2019s Ministry of Health had stepped in to provide health care, sanitation and water.\nBut Dr. Vedrasco of the World Health Organization noted that Myanmar was ranked second to last \u2014 just above Sierra Leone \u2014 in the organization\u2019s list of medical services, and could not fulfill its promises.\nFive government mobile medical teams were sent to Sittwe at the end of March, but they were barely seen.\nIn the camps, the deaths often occur behind closed doors, in the cramped rooms of the bamboo rowhouses built by the United Nations. Other people die in the small mom-and-pop pharmacies where desperate families like Parmin\u2019s go as a last resort.\nSome of the most desperate cases are women with complicated pregnancies. Prenatal care is scarce, resulting in high numbers of precarious births.\nThese days, most pregnant women are reluctant to go to Sittwe General Hospital until it is too late, put off by the elaborate series of permissions needed, and by fear. As violence has increased, many Rohingya believe they will never emerge from the 14-bed ward set aside for them that used to be the prison ward.\nZhara Katu, 20, was one of many too frightened to go to the hospital. In pain and pregnant with twins, she instead chose the government-run Dapaing clinic. A Burmese doctor determined the babies had died and recommended she go to the Sittwe hospital for an urgent operation.\nShe went home instead.\nTwo days later, she returned to the clinic but was so ill, she was transferred to the hospital. Her father, Abdullah Mi, a scrawny, weather-beaten man, was terrified. \u201cI worry that the Rakhine will kill her there,\u201d he said.\nHis daughter survived the procedure to remove the babies, but died in the hospital a week later of maternal sepsis, a very serious condition that Dr. Vedrasco said could have been alleviated with earlier care.\nBy the last week of April, some aid workers for international agencies were trickling back to the camps, but reported facing conditions far less than the \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d declared by the national Ministry of Home Affairs.\nA new emergency coordinating committee established to oversee foreign assistance was dominated by two Rakhine Buddhist community leaders who demanded approval rights over their aid operations, a memo from the aid workers to the United Nations said. The memo said the committee \u201cis failing absolutely in its role to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance in Rakhine.\u201d\nIt also urged the United Nations to take a more aggressive stance with the government, saying \u201cthere is a sense among nongovernmental organizations that at times the U.N. advocacy could have been more robust.\u201d\nSometimes, wondrously, camp medicine works.\nOne of the busiest men in the camps is Chit San Win, who once worked as a medical assistant in Sittwe, and is now a popular amateur doctor racing from call to call on his motorcycle.\nHe arrived at one call recently to find 4-year-old Roshan Bebe, lying unconscious, her head gushing blood after a motorcycle knocked her over. He came equipped with a medical kit he totes in a shopping bag \u2014 bandages, a few ointments, needle and thread.\nAs he cleaned and stitched the gaping wound, Mr. Chit San Win said he was concerned about internal bleeding that could prove fatal, but the child\u2019s mother refused to try the government hospital.\nA few days later the girl was sitting up, eating and talking, and Mr. Chit San Win declared \u201ca miracle.\u201d\nThere was no such happy ending for Nur Husain, 27.\nOn a recent day, he traveled to the same pharmacy where Parmin died. He slumped in a chair in the withering heat, gasping for air and running a temperature of 104 degrees. U Maung Maung Tin, one of the pharmacy owners, called a doctor 400 miles away, and on that advice injected Mr. Husain with four drugs.\nTwo hours later, the muscular young man was dead.\nIt was unclear precisely what killed him, according to a Western doctor who reviewed the four medicines, which are commonly prescribed for asthma. But almost certainly, proper monitoring and the oxygen ordinarily administered by Doctors Without Borders could have saved him, said the doctor, who declined to be named because he did not oversee the case.\nMr. Husain\u2019s boss at a rudimentary bakery called him a \u201cdynamic\u201d man, who held one of the few steady jobs in the camp, earning two dollars a day as manager. His wife, Roshida Begum, says she has no idea how she will now feed her two small children, and a third who is on the way.\nThe family buried Mr. Husain in a sandy plot on the shore of the Bay of Bengal within sight of tall, slender coconut trees etched against the blue sky. His shallow grave site, fenced with fresh bamboo, was surrounded by rows and rows of other graves dug in recent months."}, {"text": "Win a Trip in 2015\n"}, {"text": "Lax U.S. Guidelines on Ebola Led to Poor Hospital Training, Experts Say\n2014-10-16T01:05:20.000Z\nMany American hospitals have improperly trained their staffs to deal with Ebola patients because they were following federal guidelines that were too lax, infection control experts said on Wednesday.\nFederal health officials effectively acknowledged the problems with their procedures for protecting health care workers by abruptly changing them. At 8 p.m. Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued stricter guidelines for American hospitals with Ebola patients.\nThey are now closer to the procedures of Doctors Without Borders, which has decades of experience in fighting Ebola in Africa. In issuing the new guidelines, the C.D.C. acknowledged that its experts had learned by working alongside that medical charity.\nThe agency\u2019s new voluntary guidelines include full-body suits covering the head and neck, supervision of the risky process of taking off protective gear, and the use of hand disinfectant as each item is removed.\nSean G. Kaufman, who oversaw infection control at Emory University Hospital while it treated Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, the first two American Ebola patients, called the earlier C.D.C. guidelines \u201cabsolutely irresponsible and dead wrong.\u201d\nSpeaking by phone from Liberia, where he was training workers for Samaritan\u2019s Purse, the medical charity that Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol worked for, Mr. Kaufman said he had warned the agency as recently as a week ago that its guidelines were lax.\n\u201cThey kind of blew me off,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see they\u2019re changing them, but it\u2019s late.\u201d\nMelissa Brower, a C.D.C. spokeswoman, said the agency was \u201ctaking a hard look at our recommendations and may be making changes.\u201d\nDr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., expressed regret about his agency\u2019s initial response to the first Ebola case in Dallas.\n\u201cIn retrospect, with 20/20 hindsight,\u201d he said a few hours before his agency tightened its guidelines, \u201cwe could have sent a more robust hospital infection control team and been more hands-on with the hospital from Day 1.\u201d\nSome major hospitals, aware of the inadequacy of the older C.D.C. guidelines, have followed more stringent standards in training their staff. But many \u2014 including Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where two nurses were infected by a dying patient \u2014 have not.\nThe Doctors Without Borders guidelines are even stricter than the new C.D.C. directives in that they require full coverage of the torso, head and legs with fabrics that blood or vomit cannot soak through, along with rubber aprons, goggles or face shields, sealed wrists and rubber boots. Doctors and nurses wear two sets of gloves, including long outer ones that strap or are taped to the gown; janitors wear three sets.\nAs they undress in choreographed steps, Doctors Without Borders workers wash their hands with chlorine solution eight times and are sprayed with a chlorine mist. Most important, all personnel disrobe only under the eyes of a supervisor whose job is to prevent even a single misstep.\nRisky procedures like blood sampling are kept to a minimum.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the C.D.C. poster,\u201d said a Doctors Without Borders representative who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she did not want to be named criticizing the agency, and who was referring to C.D.C. guidelines before they were changed on Tuesday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say anywhere that it\u2019s for Ebola. I was surprised that it was only one set of gloves, and the rest bare hands. It seems to be for general cases of infectious disease.\u201d\nNational Nurses United, the country\u2019s largest union and professional association of nurses, with 185,000 members, criticized the C.D.C. on Wednesday for taking so long. Worse, the union said, many hospitals ignored even the lax guidelines because they were voluntary.\nFor example, the union said, nurses at the Texas hospital complained that the protective gear the hospital issued left their necks exposed \u2014 and they were told to wrap their necks with medical tape.\n\u201cThey were learning infection control on the fly,\u201d said DeAnn McEwen, chief of infection control for the union. \u201cThat\u2019s no substitute for planning.\u201d\nNurses United called for federal and state laws making C.D.C. guidelines mandatory.\nWhile Dr. Frieden has been criticized for arguing that almost any American hospital can handle Ebola patients and critics have demanded that all Ebola patients go to special isolation units, that debate is somewhat misguided, experts said.\nThe isolation units \u2014 which have filtered air, double doors and negative pressure \u2014 were built to prevent the spread of airborne diseases like SARS and tuberculosis.\nThe greater Ebola danger is large amounts of blood, vomit or diarrhea splashing caregivers. That is prevented by training, proper protective gear, rigorous cleaning and close supervision, specialists said.\nEbola victims resemble cholera victims in some ways.\nIn Bangladesh, which trains doctors all over the world in cholera treatment, hospitals do not place cholera patients on padded mattresses with bedpans. They usually lie on rubber sheets stretched across bed frames with holes cut so diarrhea can run out into buckets. \nDoctors Without Borders personnel place buckets or chamber pots under patients. Its protocols require cleaning pools of fluid not by mopping, but by spraying them with chlorine and then throwing large absorbent cloths over them. Like doctors, janitors work in pairs, watching over each other.\nAll infected materials are immediately burned, sometimes in a field right behind the hospital. Reusable rubber items like aprons and boots are cleaned with detergent and bleach. One important Doctors Without Borders step \u2014 chlorine sprays \u2014 could be dangerous inside hospitals because it would make corridors slippery.\nA step considered vital \u2014 which the new C.D.C. guidelines now include \u2014 is having a sharp-eyed \u201csite supervisor\u201d constantly watching for errors.\n\u201cThe buddy system works for getting dressed, but not for getting undressed,\u201d said Dr. William Fisher II, a critical care specialist from the University of North Carolina who worked in a Doctors Without Borders center in Guinea this summer and said he was now designing training for the C.D.C.\nDoctors go into wards feeling fresh, he explained. But they emerge an hour later exhausted, sweating and sometimes shaking from a close call, like one he had when a patient grabbed his mask.\nIn the exit area, he said, \u201cthere was someone in charge whose sole focus was helping you get undressed safely.\u201d\n\u201cYou stood in front of them and did nothing until they said so,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t care if it was your first time or your 800th time. I was exhausted and emotionally drained. I looked forward to it.\u201d\nInitial Doctors Without Borders training takes two to five days, followed by three to six weeks of supervised work.\nThe nurses\u2019 group, which is unfamiliar with those protocols, sent a letter to the White House on Wednesday demanding the adoption of the standards used by the University of Nebraska Medical Center with some enhancements.\nThat hospital is a designated isolation center, and its guidelines resemble those of Doctors Without Borders in some ways. A recent update to them called for head and neck hoods and the wiping of rubber clogs with bleach. The nurses\u2019 union also demanded hazardous materials suits and powered air-purifying respirators.\nThose can be cumbersome and claustrophobic, and the Nebraska guidelines treat them as recommended, not as standard."}, {"text": "Eye-for-an-Eye Incivility\n2014-05-05T01:38:33.000Z\nThe botched Oklahoma execution of Clayton Lockett has called our continued use of the death penalty in this country back into question. In many ways, the death penalty is an abhorrent attempt to sate an irrational cultural bloodlust, rooted in vengeance and barbarism and detached from data.\nTo be sure, Lockett was no angel. He was convicted of first-degree murder for shooting a young woman, Stephanie Neiman, and watching as accomplices buried her alive. And according to The Associated Press: \n\u201cIn addition to the murder charge, Lockett was found guilty of conspiracy, first-degree burglary, three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, three counts of forcible oral sodomy, four counts of first-degree rape, four counts of kidnapping and two counts of robbery by force and fear. The charges were after former convictions of two or more felonies, according to the court clerk\u2019s office.\u201d\nThose sentenced to death have often, like Lockett, been convicted of heinous, nearly unspeakable crimes. But is state-sponsored eye-for-an-eye justice truly a mark of a civilized society? How do we not, as a culture, descend to the same depravity of the person who takes a life \u2014 or multiple lives \u2014 when, as citizens of a state or country, we, in turn, take the murderer\u2019s life? Do our haphazard attempts to rid the world of evil imbue us with it?\nLockett\u2019s execution was by all accounts a gruesome affair, as he gasped and writhed on the gurney, a vein collapsed and he suffered a heart attack. According to NewsOK:\n\u201cLockett grimaced and tensed his body several times over a three-minute period before the execution was shielded from the press. After being declared unconscious 10 minutes into the process, Lockett spoke at three separate moments. The first two were inaudible, however the third time he spoke, Lockett said the word \u2018man.\u2019 \u201d\nHow does a death like this pass constitutional muster, with our guarantee against \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d even for a person convicted of administering cruel and unusual punishment?\nWhen President Obama was asked on Friday about the Oklahoma execution, he repeated his belief that capital punishment should be an option in some cases but pointed out:\n\u201cThe application of the death penalty in this country, we have seen significant problems \u2014 racial bias, uneven application of the death penalty, you know, situations in which there were individuals on death row who later on were discovered to have been innocent because of exculpatory evidence. And all these, I think, do raise significant questions about how the death penalty is being applied. And this situation in Oklahoma I think just highlights some of the significant problems there.\u201d\nAnd not only are there application and misapplication issues, the death penalty is also a tremendous drain on resources. \nProf. Jeffrey A. Fagan of Columbia Law School has argued that \u201ceven in states where prosecutors infrequently seek the death penalty, the price of obtaining convictions and executions ranges from $2.5 million to $5 million per case (in current dollars), compared to less than $1 million for each killer sentenced to life without parole.\u201d\nOur continued use of the death penalty does not put us in good company. According to a 2014 report from Amnesty International, \u201conly nine countries have continuously executed in each of the past five years \u2014 Bangladesh, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, U.S.A. and Yemen.\u201d\nUnfortunately, the death penalty is part of this country\u2019s blood memory, a memory we are having a hard time shaking. According to a morbidly fascinating chart published last week by Time magazine and derived from data collected by M. Watt Espy, John Ortiz Smykla and the Death Penalty Information Center, America has executed 15,717 people since 1700, most of them hanged. The peak year for executions was 1935 with nearly 200 people put to death, mostly by electrocution. In 2014, 20 people have been put to death, all by lethal injection.\nEven steps toward remedying the problems with the death penalty raise questions. As Professor Fagan put it, \u201cAs states across the country adopt reforms to reduce the pandemic of errors in capital punishment, we wonder whether such necessary and admirable efforts to avoid error and the horror of the execution of the innocent won\u2019t \u2014 after many hundreds of millions of dollars of trying \u2014 burden the country with a death penalty that will be ineffective, unreasonably expensive and politically corrosive to the broader search for justice.\u201d\nWe are standing on the graves of the executed, and it is not a morally elevated position. "}, {"text": "A Vast Migration Tragedy\n2014-12-17T11:29:22.000Z\nGENEVA \u2014 Amid the multitude of World War II horrors, few tug at mankind\u2019s conscience like the voyages of refugee boats whose passengers died fleeing war, mass murder and genocide: the schooner Mefkure, sunk in 1944 on the Black Sea, taking over 300 lives, or the Struma, with almost 800 fatalities in those same waters two years earlier.\nThen there was the notorious St. Louis, which in 1939 left Hamburg for Havana, with more than 900 German refugees aboard. They were forced back to Europe after Cuba, the United States and Canada all balked at letting them land. We now know hundreds of those returnees perished in the war.\nYet those tragedies pale in comparison with what is happening today. In 2014 more migrants have died traveling \u2014 nearly 5,000 \u2014 than there were passengers and crew on those three voyages.\nMigrants can die by the hundreds, most recently in September, when as many as 500 lives were lost off the coast of Malta. But they also die by the tens and dozens, almost daily, disappearing into the waters of the Mediterranean and Red Seas, the Caribbean, the Gulf of Aden and the Bay of Bengal.\nOur group, the International Organization for Migration, has data showing that 2014 will be the deadliest year for migrants on record. Our final figures, to be published later this month, will more than double the 2,378 deaths we reported last year. In the Mediterranean alone this year, some 3,400 migrant men, women and children have drowned \u2014 a fivefold increase over 2013. Altogether, the number of migrant deaths in 2014 on land and at sea stands at 4,868.\nWill 2015 be even worse? It well could be, unless we commit to making changes in how we view migration \u2014 and how we manage it.\nFirst, let\u2019s take stock. Migration is not a catastrophe, nor is it an invasion. Often, it isn\u2019t even an emergency. It is, as throughout history, an inevitability. People move to improve their lives, whether that means access to a better food supply or simply a better chance of surviving conflict. The International Organization for Migration calculates that at least 232 million people now live outside the borders of their homelands. Yet only a fraction of that population is fleeing distress, what we consider \u201cdesperation\u201d migration.\nSecond, we must acknowledge the many factors behind the migration surge. Demography is the biggest. For the most part, migration is a byproduct of the quadrupling of the human population over a single century, an unprecedented event in the life of our species.\nRising global consumption means rising international labor demand, which offers citizens of poor countries the prospect of rising family incomes. That spurs reunification migration for many families or, in cases of individuals, yearnings from youths looking abroad for new careers, better education or simply a Facebook account to connect with peers who\u2019ve already migrated to new lives.\nThat\u2019s part of another \u201cpull\u201d factor: communication. Advances in technology do not only spread news of opportunities faster than ever before around the globe. They also speed cash to those entrepreneurs, legal and otherwise, who move migrants and put those new opportunities within reach.\nThat leads to the third task before us: rediscovering our compassion. Sadly, mass migration has led to a cruel irony: the rise of unprecedented anti-migrant sentiment worldwide. Certainly countries have a right, indeed an obligation, to control their borders. And, yes, economic downturns make migrants easy scapegoats for unemployment or depressed wages. Throw in post-9/11 security concerns, and it\u2019s not difficult to understand why indifference to migrants\u2019 hardships has led to hostility, fear and resistance to their arrival.\nBut that\u2019s merely an explanation \u2014 and one that we no longer can accept.\nIncreasingly, we see that policies that criminalize migration invite lethal consequences. Migrants unable to find safe, legal means of travel will turn to some of the planet\u2019s most vicious criminal gangs for relief, which often leads to recklessness, even murder.\nAt Lampedusa, Italy, last year I watched as 366 corpses were prepared for burial, victims of unscrupulous criminals in Libya who were willing to stuff migrants into unsafe vessels bound for Europe. A year later the tragedy has only worsened, with more horrific incidents of drowning. Often the passengers themselves realize how unsafe the crafts are and refuse to board. Often they are battered into submission, tortured and then forced out to sea.\nAt the International Organization for Migration we have heard of nearly identical crimes taking place off the coasts of Bangladesh and Thailand, and recently have chronicled the rising tide of death on routes connecting the Horn of Africa with the Arabian Peninsula.\nHistory reminds us that closing our hearts to the misfortunes of others is a recipe for disaster. Sadly that is what\u2019s happening in many parts of the world, with avoidable and tragic consequences for migrants seeking safety."}, {"text": "Go West, Young People! And East!\n2014-03-15T18:30:02.000Z\nI\u2019M delighted to announce that the winner of my 2014 \u201cwin-a-trip\u201d contest is ...\nOh, hang on. Maybe I should first exhort students to travel on their own \u2014 and cite Utah.\nUtah may well be the most cosmopolitan state in America. Vast numbers of young Mormons \u2014 increasingly women as well as men \u2014 spend a couple of years abroad as missionaries and return jabbering in Thai or Portuguese and bearing a wealth of international experience.\nMore than 130 languages are spoken daily in commerce in Utah, according to the University of Utah, and that\u2019s one reason it sometimes tops the Forbes list of best states to do business. The state is a center for trade and for global companies.\nAmerican universities should also be sending people abroad, but they are still quite insular. The number of Americans studying abroad has tripled over the last 20 years, but, still, fewer than 10 percent of college students study overseas during undergraduate years. Three times as many foreigners study in America as the other way around.\n(A shout-out goes to Goucher College in Baltimore, which requires students to study abroad. Others should try that.)\nAll young Americans should learn Spanish \u2014 el idioma extranjero de mayor importancia en los Estados Unidos \u2014 partly because growing numbers of seniors will finance retirement by moving to cheaper countries like Mexico, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Yet it makes no sense to study Spanish on a college campus when it is so much cheaper and more exhilarating to move to Bolivia, study or get a job and fall in love with a Bolivian.\nIt\u2019s also more effective. I have a one-question language test that people who have lived abroad do better on than those who studied in a classroom. Try my test yourself: In a foreign language you\u2019ve studied, how do you say \u201cdoorknob\u201d?\nAs you\u2019re looking blank and thinking of those four wasted years studying French (poign\u00e9e de porte) or Spanish (pomo), consider this joke: If someone who speaks three languages is trilingual, and a person who speaks four languages is quadrilingual, what is a person called who speaks no foreign language at all?\nAnswer: An American.\nOne of the aims of higher education is to broaden perspectives, and what better way than by a home stay in a really different country, like Bangladesh or Senegal? Time abroad also leaves one more aware of the complex prism of suspicion through which the United States is often viewed. If more Americans had overseas experience, our foreign policy might be wiser.\nThat\u2019s partly why I started my win-a-trip contest. I wanted to encourage American students to engage more with the world and with the issue of global poverty. So I\u2019m pleased to announce that my win-a-trip winner, from the University of Notre Dame, is ... But wait! First, a personal aside.\nI took a gap year myself after high school and worked on a farm near Lyon, France. I stayed with the Vallet family, picked and packed fruit, and discovered that red wine can be a breakfast drink. That led to further travel as a university student. I slept on the floor of Indian temples and rode on the tops of Sudanese trains, and the experiences changed me by opening my eyes to human needs and to human universals.\nGap years are becoming a bit more common in the United States and are promoted by organizations like Global Citizen Year. Colleges tend to love it when students defer admission to take a gap year because those students arrive with more maturity and less propensity to spend freshman year in an alcoholic haze.\nHere\u2019s a suggestion: How about if colleges gave students a semester credit for a gap year spent in a non-English-speaking country?\nThere\u2019s a misconception that gap years or study-abroad opportunities are feasible only for the affluent. There are lots of free options (and some paid ones) at idealist.org, which lists volunteering opportunities all over the world. It\u2019s also often possible to make money teaching English on the side.\nSo go west, young men and women! And go east! Y al norte y al sur!\nBack to my win-a-trip contest: I\u2019m delighted to announce that my winner is Nicole Sganga, a 20-year-old from Long Island and the University of Notre Dame. Nicole is a junior majoring in political science and film and has already worked for CBS News in Washington and London.\nI\u2019m not sure yet where we\u2019ll travel for our reporting together on neglected issues. Perhaps Congo. Maybe Myanmar. I welcome your suggestions on my blog, nytimes.com/ontheground, for places to go and themes to cover.\nThanks to the Center for Global Development for helping screen applications, and to all the students who applied.

We\u2019re Not No. 1!\n2014-04-03T00:47:31.000Z\nWe in the United States grow up celebrating ourselves as the world\u2019s most powerful nation, the world\u2019s richest nation, the world\u2019s freest and most blessed nation.\nSure, technically Norwegians may be wealthier per capita, and the Japanese may live longer, but the world watches the N.B.A., melts at Katy Perry, uses iPhones to post on Facebook, trembles at our aircraft carriers, and blames the C.I.A. for everything. We\u2019re No. 1!\nIn some ways we indisputably are, but a major new ranking of livability in 132 countries puts the United States in a sobering 16th place. We underperform because our economic and military strengths don\u2019t translate into well-being for the average citizen.\nIn the Social Progress Index, the United States excels in access to advanced education but ranks 70th in health, 69th in ecosystem sustainability, 39th in basic education, 34th in access to water and sanitation and 31st in personal safety. Even in access to cellphones and the Internet, the United States ranks a disappointing 23rd, partly because one American in five lacks Internet access.\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing that for a country that has Silicon Valley, lack of access to information is a red flag,\u201d notes Michael Green, executive director of the Social Progress Imperative, which oversees the index. The United States has done better at investing in drones than in children, and cuts in social services could fray the social fabric further.\nThis Social Progress Index ranks New Zealand No. 1, followed by Switzerland, Iceland and the Netherlands. All are somewhat poorer than America per capita, yet they appear to do a better job of meeting the needs of their people.\nThe Social Progress Index is a brainchild of Michael E. Porter, the eminent Harvard business professor who earlier helped develop the Global Competitiveness Report. Porter is a Republican whose work, until now, has focused on economic metrics.\n\u201cThis is kind of a journey for me,\u201d Porter told me. He said that he became increasingly aware that social factors support economic growth: tax policy and regulations affect economic prospects, but so do schooling, health and a society\u2019s inclusiveness.\nSo Porter and a team of experts spent two years developing this index, based on a vast amount of data reflecting suicide, property rights, school attendance, attitudes toward immigrants and minorities, opportunity for women, religious freedom, nutrition, electrification and much more.\nMany who back proposed Republican cuts in Medicaid, food stamps and public services believe that such trims would boost America\u2019s competitiveness. Looking at this report, it seems that the opposite is true.\nIreland, from which so many people fled in the 19th century to find opportunity in the United States, now ranks 15th. That\u2019s a notch ahead of the United States, and Ireland is also ahead of America in the category of \u201copportunity.\u201d\nCanada came in seventh, the best among the nations in the G-7. Germany is 12th, Britain 13th and Japan 14th.\nThe bottom spot on the ranking was filled by Chad. Just above it were Central African Republic, Burundi, Guinea, Sudan and Angola.\nProfessor Porter notes that Arab Spring countries had longstanding problems leading to poor scores in the \u201copportunity\u201d category. If that\u2019s a predictor of trouble, as he thinks it may be, then Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and Iran should be on guard. None do well in the category of opportunity.\nIn contrast, some countries punch well above their weight. Costa Rica performs better than much richer countries, and so do the Philippines, Estonia and Jamaica. In Africa, Malawi, Ghana and Liberia shine. Bangladesh (no. 99) ranks ahead of wealthier India (no. 102). Likewise, Ukraine (no. 62) outperforms Russia (no. 80).\nChina does poorly, ranking 90th, behind its poorer neighbor Mongolia (no. 89). China performs well in basic education but lags in areas such as personal rights and access to information.\nAll this goes to what kind of a nation we want to be, and whether we put too much faith in G.D.P. as a metric.\nOver all, the United States\u2019 economy outperformed France\u2019s between 1975 and 2006. But 99 percent of the French population actually enjoyed more gains in that period than 99 percent of the American population. Exclude the top 1 percent, and the average French citizen did better than the average American. This lack of shared prosperity and opportunity has stunted our social progress.\nThere are no quick fixes, but basic education and health care are obvious places to begin, especially in the first few years of life, when returns are the highest.\nThe arguments for boosting opportunity or social services usually revolve around social justice and fairness. The Social Progress Index offers a reminder that what\u2019s at stake is also the health of our society \u2014 and our competitiveness around the globe.

Surveillance\n2014-02-17T03:04:22.000Z\nFour journalists who revealed the National Security Agency\u2019s vast electronic data mining operation were among the winners of the George Polk Awards in Journalism for 2013, announced on Sunday by Long Island University, which administers the prizes.\nIn all, 30 reporters representing 15 news organizations were recognized in 13 categories. Reporters from The New York Times won three of the awards, as did reporters from The Washington Post.\n\u201cIn the tradition of George Polk, many of the journalists we have recognized did more than report news,\u201d said John Darnton, the curator of the Polk Awards, referring to the CBS News correspondent who was killed while covering the civil war in Greece in 1948. \u201cThey heightened public awareness with perceptive detection and dogged pursuit of stories that otherwise would not have seen the light of day.\u201d\nThe four winners who disclosed the N.S.A. surveillance were Glenn Greenwald, Ewen MacAskill and Laura Poitras of The Guardian and Barton Gellman of The Washington Post. Their articles, which won the Polk Award for national security reporting, were based on documents leaked by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden.\nJim Yardley of The New York Times won for foreign reporting for documenting unsafe conditions and low wages in the garment industry in Bangladesh \u2014 and clothing manufacturers\u2019 close political connections there \u2014 after a building collapse killed more than 1,100 factory workers.\nEli Saslow of The Washington Post won the Polk Award for national reporting for articles about food-stamp recipients that the Polk judges called \u201can indelible portrait of American poverty.\u201d\nShawn Boburg of The Record of northern New Jersey won in the state reporting category for articles in September on lane closings at the George Washington Bridge. The Polk judges said his articles set the stage for subsequent disclosures about the involvement of aides to Gov. Chris Christie. \nAndrea Elliott of The New York Times won the Polk Award for local reporting for \u201cInvisible Child,\u201d a five-part series focusing on a girl named Dasani, one of 22,000 homeless children in New York City.\nThree reporters for The Washington Post \u2014 Rosalind Helderman, Laura Vozzella and Carol Leonnig \u2014 won for political reporting for exposing the relationship between Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia and a political patron. Mr. McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were indicted after he left office in January on charges of taking $165,000 in loans and gifts.\nTwo entries that looked into treatment of the mentally ill shared the award for medical reporting. One, by Meg Kissinger of The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, looked at the Milwaukee County mental health system in articles the Polk judges called \u201ca definitive study of a system that barely functions.\u201d The other entry, by Cynthia Hubert and Phillip Reese of The Sacramento Bee, looked at a Las Vegas psychiatric hospital\u2019s practice of discharging patients. Their articles said that the hospital put the patients, sometimes heavily medicated, on Greyhound buses bound for other cities and that many of them were later arrested in connection with serious crimes.\nFour reporters for The New York Times \u2014 Frances Robles, Sharon Otterman, Michael Powell and N. R. Kleinfield \u2014 won the award for justice reporting for articles that said that Detective Louis Scarcella, who handled some of Brooklyn\u2019s most notorious crimes in the 1980s and 1990s, had used false confessions and coercive tactics.\nThe sports reporting award went to Tim Elfrink of The Miami New Times for stories about the anti-aging clinic Biogenesis that suggested ballplayers like Alex Rodriguez had taken banned substances from the clinic.\nThe award for business reporting went to four reporters from the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative journalism group: Alison Fitzgerald, Daniel Wagner, Lauren Kyger and John Dunbar. Together they wrote a three-part series that said regulators and prosecutors had failed to hold major Wall Street figures accountable for decisions that contributed to the financial crisis in 2008.\nMatthieu Aikins, a freelance journalist, won the award for magazine reporting for articles in Rolling Stone. The Polk judges said he had \u201cdeveloped convincing evidence\u201d that a U.S. Army Special Forces unit had executed 10 civilians outside a base in Afghanistan.\nThe award for network television reporting went to a team from the public-television program \u201cFrontline\u201d \u2014 Michael Kirk, Jim Gilmore, Mike Wiser, Steve Fainaru and Mark Fainaru-Wada. They concluded that physicians working for the National Football League dismissed independent medical research and demeaned the researchers in an effort to hide information about players\u2019 concussions and the brain disorder chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\nNoah Pransky of WTSP-TV in Tampa, Fla., won the award for local television reporting. He discovered that a small change in a Florida state policy \u2014 reducing the time a yellow light took to change to red to less than the federally recommended minimum \u2014 had cost drivers millions in fines. \nPete Hamill won the Polk career award. Mr. Hamill is a veteran tabloid columnist, author and novelist who was briefly the editor of The New York Post in 1993 and The Daily News in 1997.\nThe winners are chosen by a committee of Long Island University faculty members, alumni and journalists. The awards will be presented at a luncheon at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan on April 11."}, {"text": "Advocates for Workers Raise the Ire of Business\n2014-01-16T23:22:43.000Z\nAs America\u2019s labor unions have lost members and clout, new types of worker advocacy groups have sprouted nationwide, and they have started to get on businesses\u2019 nerves \u2014 protesting low wages at Capital Grille restaurants, for instance, and demonstrating outside Austin City Hall in Texas against giving Apple tax breaks.\nAfter ignoring these groups for years, business groups and powerful lobbyists, heavily backed by the restaurant industry, are mounting an aggressive campaign against them, maintaining that they are fronts for organized labor.\nBusiness officials say these groups often demonize companies unfairly and inaccurately, while the groups question why corporations have attacked such fledgling organizations.\nThe United States Chamber of Commerce issued a detailed report in November criticizing what it calls \u201cprogressive activist foundations\u201d that donate millions of dollars to these groups, which are often called worker centers. The business-backed Worker Center Watch has asked Florida\u2019s attorney general to investigate the finances of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. That group sponsored a protest last March in which more than 100 workers marched 200 miles to the headquarters of Publix supermarkets to urge it to pay more for tomatoes so farmworkers could be paid more.\nA prominent Washington lobbyist, Richard Berman, has run full-page ads attacking the Restaurant Opportunities Center, accusing it of intimidating opponents. He has even set up a separate website, ROCexposed.com, to attack the group.\nThe Restaurant Opportunities Center is one of the nation\u2019s largest worker centers, sponsoring repeated protests inside Capital Grille restaurants and winning sizable settlements from famous chefs. The group even infiltrated the National Restaurant Association\u2019s lobbying day on Capitol Hill, learning about the association\u2019s goals and strategies.\nBusiness groups argue that worker centers should face the same strictures as labor unions under federal law, including detailed financial disclosure, regular election of leaders and bans on certain types of picketing. Business groups say worker centers act like unions by targeting specific employers and pushing them to improve wages.\nRegarding the Restaurant Opportunities Center, Scott DeFife, an executive vice president at the National Restaurant Association, said: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to have it both ways. They\u2019re a union and not a union. They\u2019re organizing workers but not organizing workers. They have a history of tactics unions couldn\u2019t get away with.\u201d\nBusiness groups say they have grown far more concerned about these new organizations since Richard L. Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s president, announced last March that organized labor would work closely with these groups, many of which were formed to help immigrant workers whom unions had long overlooked. \u201cFor the employer community, it\u2019s a question of what does this grow into,\u201d said Glenn Spencer, executive director of the Chamber\u2019s Workforce Freedom Initiative, which commissioned the study on foundation funding. \u201cJudging from Trumka\u2019s remarks, organized labor sees a lot of potential in this model.\u201d\nAccording to that study, millions of dollars have flowed to worker centers from 21 foundations. From 2009 to 2012, it found, the Marguerite Casey Foundation gave $300,000 to the Southwest Workers Union and $300,000 to the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. The Ford Foundation gave $717,000 to the National Domestic Workers Alliance, $1.15 million to the New Orleans Workers Center for Racial Justice and $2.4 million to the Restaurant Opportunities Center.\nMr. Berman, who receives millions of dollars from business to fight unions and oppose a higher minimum wage, acknowledges that he is using a hammer to prevent these groups from growing far more powerful and troublesome.\n\u201cThere\u2019s quite a range of activity among worker centers,\u201d said Mr. Berman, whose lobbying firm has spawned numerous spinoff nonprofits, including the Center for Union Facts. \u201cThey have yet to reach the point of being a long-term problem. We\u2019re trying to stay ahead of the curve.\u201d\nSaru Jayaraman, a co-founder of the Restaurant Opportunities Center, has repeatedly strategized to get under the industry\u2019s skin. Her group does an annual dining guide, giving a thumbs down to restaurants it says treats employees poorly by, for instance, avoiding paid sick days.\nThe group enraged one of New York\u2019s top chefs, Daniel Boulud, by demonstrating outside his Daniel restaurant with a 12-foot-tall inflatable cockroach, asserting that the restaurant\u2019s Hispanic and Bangladeshi employees faced discrimination when they applied to become waiters. Her group reached a confidential settlement with Mr. Boulud. After a similar protest against Mario Batali\u2019s Del Posto restaurant in Manhattan, he reached a settlement that called for paying $1.15 million over misappropriated tips and unpaid overtime and included new policies on promotions and paid sick days.\nBecause of its in-your-face tactics and numerous successes, the restaurant group has faced many attacks from business.\n\u201cIt\u2019s flattering,\u201d Ms. Jayaraman said. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re attacking us is a sign that they feel threatened. That\u2019s what happens when you challenge the industry to do the right thing.\u201d\nGreg Asbed, co-founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, noted that numerous companies had signed onto his group\u2019s far-reaching \u201cFair Food Program\u201d to improve pay and working conditions. The group announced on Thursday that Walmart had joined the program, which calls for paying a penny more per pound for Florida tomatoes. But Mr. Asbed criticized some attacks leveled by business as \u201cMcCarthy-era tactics.\u201d \u201cAttacking workers who are fighting poverty wages, sexual harassment and other problems in the food industry is doing a disservice to those companies that are working to prepare the industry for the challenges of the 21st century,\u201d he said.\nThe chamber questions not just the millions that foundations are giving worker centers but also the image that they run on a shoestring budget.\nBut worker center leaders say they need foundation funding to get off the ground and keep operating. Some foundations viewed the chamber\u2019s report as a brushback pitch intended to discourage them from giving.\nIn a statement, the Ford Foundation said: \u201cGrowing numbers of workers are finding themselves in low-wage jobs with limited resources to support a family and move up the economic ladder. The foundation\u2019s support for worker centers is one part of our effort to help more hard-working people climb out of poverty and achieve economic security.\u201d\nIndustry officials say that when the Restaurant Opportunities Center negotiated with Mr. Batali about promotions and other policies after suing him, those negotiations resembled collective bargaining. But in 2006, the general counsel\u2019s office of the National Labor Relations Board concluded that ROC was not a labor organization under federal law, finding that it was not engaged in a pattern of dealing with specific employers.\nMs. Jayaraman said her group was not bargaining, but instead seeking injunctive relief to settle a lawsuit. Mr. Berman, the lobbyist whom the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d once called \u201cDr. Evil,\u201d has mounted a multipronged offensive against worker centers. He is hitting not just ROC and the Immokalee coalition, but also the recent fast-food strikes and Black Friday protests at Walmart, which have strong union backing. \u201cThey put on a costume and call themselves something other than a union,\u201d Mr. Berman said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing Potemkin-village unionization.\u201d He declined to disclose his sources of funding.\nJanice R. Fine, a labor relations professor at Rutgers, said one should distinguish between efforts like the Walmart protests, which were largely organized by a labor union, and worker centers, which are generally independent of unions.\n\u201cBusiness groups have this notion that unions have created worker centers as front groups, that they are creatures of these big institutions,\u201d Professor Fine said. \u201cThe idea that they are sort of offspring of organized labor is just wrong. They were often set up because of a vacuum left by the labor movement. There was often downright hostility between them.\u201d"}, {"text": "A Chic Idea for China\u2019s Green-Minded Set\n"}, {"text": "Income Gap, Meet the Longevity Gap\n2014-03-15T21:30:40.000Z\nFairfax County, Va., and McDowell County, W.Va., are separated by 350 miles, about a half-day\u2019s drive. Traveling west from Fairfax County, the gated communities and bland architecture of military contractors give way to exurbs, then to farmland and eventually to McDowell\u2019s coal mines and the forested slopes of the Appalachians. Perhaps the greatest distance between the two counties is this: Fairfax is a place of the haves, and McDowell of the have-nots. Just outside of Washington, fat government contracts and a growing technology sector buoy the median household income in Fairfax County up to $107,000, one of the highest in the nation. McDowell, with the decline of coal, has little in the way of industry. Unemployment is high. Drug abuse is rampant. Median household income is about one-fifth that of Fairfax.\nOne of the starkest consequences of that divide is seen in the life expectancies of the people there. Residents of Fairfax County are among the longest-lived in the country: Men have an average life expectancy of 82 years and women, 85, about the same as in Sweden. In McDowell, the averages are 64 and 73, about the same as in Iraq.\nThere have long been stark economic differences between Fairfax County and McDowell. But as their fortunes have diverged even further over the past generation, their life expectancies have diverged, too. In McDowell, women\u2019s life expectancy has actually fallen by two years since 1985; it grew five years in Fairfax.\n\u201cPoverty is a thief,\u201d said Michael Reisch, a professor of social justice at the University of Maryland, testifying before a Senate panel on the issue. \u201cPoverty not only diminishes a person\u2019s life chances, it steals years from one\u2019s life.\u201d\nThat reality is playing out across the country. For the upper half of the income spectrum, men who reach the age of 65 are living about six years longer than they did in the late 1970s. Men in the lower half are living just 1.3 years longer. \nThis life-expectancy gap has started to surface in discussions among researchers, public health officials and Washington policy makers. The general trend is for Americans to live longer, and as lawmakers contemplate changes to government programs \u2014 like nudging up the Social Security retirement age or changing its cost-of-living adjustment \u2014 they are confronted with the potential unfairness to those who die considerably earlier. \nThe link between income and longevity has been clearly established. Poor people are likelier to smoke. They have less access to the health care system. They tend to weigh more. And their bodies suffer the debilitating effects of more intense and more constant stress. Everywhere, and across time, the poor tend to live shorter lives than the rich, whether researchers compare the Bangladeshis with the Dutch or minimum-wage workers with millionaires.\nBut is widening income inequality behind the divergence in longevity over the last three decades? Would an economy with a narrower gap between the haves and the have-nots lead to stronger life-expectancy gains, from the richest to the poorest? Might the expansion of insurance through the Affordable Care Act help close the gap? And might the policies that Congress is contemplating to ameliorate poverty \u2014 like raising the minimum wage \u2014 have a further effect on life spans, too?\nThose are questions that researchers armed with reams of data on mortality, poverty, health, social spending and income are struggling to answer. \n\u201cThe gaps continue to widen between the communities with the highest life expectancy and the lowest,\u201d said Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle, which produces the county-level life-expectancy figures. \u201cThere is nothing in sight that suggests that the 25-year trend is going to stop.\u201d\n\u201cWould that be different if the income inequality were reduced?\u201d he added. \u201cIf you took a 30-year view, then yes. There does seem to be that long-run relationship between community income and these life-expectancy outcomes.\u201d\nLiving in Fairfax is different than living in McDowell. \nIn Fairfax, there are ample doctors, hospitals, recreation centers, shops, restaurants, grocery stores, nursing homes and day care centers, with public and private entities providing cradle-to-grave services to prosperous communities. \nThe federal government, especially security and military contracting, drives the economy. While cutbacks \u2014 through sequestration and reduced military spending \u2014 have slowed the rate of growth in recent years, the government nonetheless provides a steady base on which the region has flourished over the last decades. Currently, the local unemployment rate is just 3.6 percent; the national rate is 6.7 percent. \n\u201cWe aren\u2019t like Beverly Hills or some other place with lots of multimillionaires,\u201d said Stephen S. Fuller, the director for the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, in Fairfax County. \u201cBut we have more workers per household than just about any metro area in the country. We have more people working, and more people working in every age cohort.\u201d\nThe jobs tend to be good jobs, providing health insurance and pensions, even if there is a growing low-wage work force of health aides, janitors, fast-food workers and the like. \u201cIt\u2019s a knowledge-based work force,\u201d Mr. Fuller said. \u201cAnd we have an economy built on services, technology-intensive services.\u201d\nSocial services \u2014 judged against those of poorer counties \u2014 are stellar, too. The local government, which runs some of the best public schools in the country, also offers its older citizens services as varied as rides to senior centers and \u201ccare and enrichment consultations\u201d for those looking to adopt a pet rabbit. \nA retired home-health nurse, Tena Bluhm, heads the local Commission on Aging. \u201cWe were seeing a big change in demographics,\u201d she said, \u201cwith the boomers aging and a trend where folks, as they aged, wanted to stay in this area.\u201d \nOn a cool weekday morning, John McGinnis, 57, emerged stiffly from a shallow pool at a public indoor facility, where there were also gleaming squash courts, a golf course and three bored-looking lifeguards. A water-exercise instructor had led him and nine others through a series of gentle movements with pool noodles.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had six back surgeries,\u201d he said, shuffling toward an oversized hot tub after the class. \u201cThis is a lifesaver.\u201d\nOn a sunny weekend afternoon, 350 miles away, Chea Lockwood, a registered nurse with the Commission on Aging in McDowell County, visited Melissa Courtner, 38, who lives in one of McDowell\u2019s few high-rises, a bare-bones facility for disabled and elderly residents.\nCoal miners still dig into and blast off the tops of steep Appalachian hills. But the industry that once provided thousands of jobs is slowly disappearing, and the region\u2019s entrenched poverty has persisted. The unemployment rate is 8.8 percent, down from more than 13 percent in the worst of the recession. The current number would be even higher if more residents hadn\u2019t simply given up looking for work.\nAs incomes have diverged between the country\u2019s richest counties, like Fairfax County, Va., and its poorest ones, like McDowell County, W.Va., so have the life expectancies of their residents.\nGovernment assistance accounts for half of the income of county residents. Social workers described shortages of teachers, nurses, doctors, surgeons, mental health professionals and addiction-treatment workers. There is next to no public transportation. Winding two-lane roads, sometimes impassable in snow and ice, connect the small population centers of trailers, small homes and the occasional minimart. \u201cIt\u2019ll take you an hour to drive 15 miles,\u201d Ms. Lockwood said. \nMs. Lockwood has lived in McDowell County long enough to be widowed twice, and on this morning she first checked on two older patients in the housing project, cheerfully going through a checklist of questions. \u201cIs your health aide on time?\u201d \u201cDo you need help washing that pretty hair of yours?\u201d \nShe checked in on Ms. Courtner, whom she had seen for her first evaluation earlier in the week. \u201cI\u2019m going to steal your man,\u201d Ms. Courtner said with a whoop as Ms. Lockwood entered the room. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t have him!\u201d Ms. Lockwood said, reaching down to hug Ms. Courtner in her wheelchair before sitting down on a coffee table to talk.\nMs. Courtner\u2019s medical problems started early. She dropped out of high school and started smoking and drinking at 16. She had a stroke at 21, leaving her with partial paralysis. She has multiple sclerosis and bipolar disorder. A fistula, only partially repaired, makes a colostomy bag necessary. \nShe is unable to work, she said, so she manages with disability payments and food stamps. Before moving into her housing unit, she lived in a shed without plumbing or electricity on the property of her parents, who are also disabled.\nMany people have similar stories. Ms. Lockwood notes that other residents have multiple woes: \u201cDiabetes. Obesity. Congestive heart failure. Drug use. Kidney problems. Lung conditions from the mines.\u201d Problems often start young and often result in shorter lives, she said. Earlier that day, she handed me a list of recent funerals with about half highlighted in yellow; they signified that the deceased was under 50.\nSince the 1980s, \u201csocioeconomic status has become an even more important indicator of life expectancy.\u201d That was the finding of a 2008 report by the Congressional Budget Office. But dollars in a bank account have never added a day to anyone\u2019s life, researchers stress. Instead, those dollars are at work in a thousand daily-life decisions \u2014 about jobs, medical care, housing, food and exercise \u2014 with a cumulative effect on longevity. \n\u201cWhy might income have an effect on morbidity or mortality?\u201d said David Kindig, an emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and an expert in longevity issues. \u201cWe have these causal pathways, through better jobs, better health insurance, better choice of behaviors, he added. On top of that, \u201cthere\u2019s the stress effects of poverty and low educational status.\u201d \nAs such, the health statistics for Fairfax and McDowell are as striking as their income data. In Fairfax, the adult obesity rate is about 24 percent and one in eight residents smokes. In McDowell, the adult obesity rate is more than 30 percent and one in three adults smokes. And the disability rate is about five times higher in McDowell. \nIn both counties, food availability matters. There are only two full-size grocery stores in McDowell; minimarts and fast-food restaurants are major sources of nutrition. \u201cWe don\u2019t have gyms or fitness centers,\u201d said Pamela McPeak, who grew up in McDowell getting creek water to flush her family\u2019s toilet. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to buy Cheetos rather than apples.\u201d She now runs a nonprofit program that provides tutoring and helps high school students get into college. \nEducation is also correlated with longevity, as it is with income and employment. Educated individuals are much more likely to work, and much more likely to have higher incomes. In McDowell, about one in 18 adults has a college degree; in Fairfax, the share is 60 percent. \nFinally, and perhaps most powerfully, researchers say that a life in poverty is a life of stress that accumulates in a person\u2019s very cells. Being poor is hard in a way that can mean worse sleep, more cortisol in the blood, a greater risk of hypertension and, ultimately, a shorter life.\nAs southern West Virginia has foundered, northern Virginia has flourished. But do the two counties\u2019 diverging life expectancies relate to their diverging economic fortunes? And might that be true across the country?\nIt is hard to prove causality with the available information. County-level data is the most detailed available, but it is not perfect. People move, and that is a confounding factor. McDowell\u2019s population has dropped by more than half since the late 1970s, whereas Fairfax\u2019s has roughly doubled. Perhaps more educated and healthier people have been relocating from places like McDowell to places like Fairfax. In that case, life expectancy would not have changed; how Americans arrange themselves geographically would have.\n\u201cThese things are not nearly as clear as they seem, or as clear as epidemiologists seem to think,\u201d said Angus Deaton, an economist at Princeton. \nFurther, there is nothing to suggest that, for a given individual, getting a raise in pay or moving between counties would mean outliving her peers.\n\u201cThe statistical term is the ecological fallacy,\u201d Mr. Kindig said. \u201cWe can\u2019t apply aggregate data to an individual, and that\u2019s underappreciated when you\u2019re looking at these numbers.\u201d But, \u201chaving said that, I still think that the averages and the variation across counties tells us a lot,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to let the perfect be the enemy of the good here.\u201d\nDespite the statistical murk, many epidemiologists, economists and other researchers say that rising income inequality may be playing into the rising disparity in health and longevity. \u201cWe can\u2019t say that there is no effect, just because we don\u2019t have clear methods to test the effect,\u201d said Hui Zheng, a sociologist at Ohio State University.\nIn particular, changes in smoking and obesity rates may help explain the connection between bigger bank accounts and longer lives. \u201cRicher people and richer communities smoke less, and that gap is growing,\u201d said Dr. Murray at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. \nMr. Zheng has also posited that inequality, by socially disenfranchising certain groups and making them distrustful of public systems, may have a long-range effect on health. \nTo some extent, the broad expansion of health insurance to low-income communities, as called for under Obamacare, may help to mitigate this stark divide, experts say. And it is encouraging that both Republicans and Democrats have recently elevated the issues of poverty, economic mobility and inequality, But the contrast between McDowell and Fairfax shows just how deeply entrenched these trends are, with consequences reaching all the way from people\u2019s pocketbooks to their graves."}, {"text": "Sprinting Over the Dirt, With a Robot on the Hump\n2014-12-26T18:39:10.000Z\nABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Not long after sunrise one recent morning, a camel race here began, as they all do, with two starts. First, there was the expected opening: About a dozen camels pressed their noses against a dangling metal barrier, and when a man in a sparkling white robe gave the signal, the gate lifted and the herd surged forward, necks bobbing and humps hopping as spindly legs galloped off into the fog.\nA beat later came the second wave. As the camels sprinted toward their first turn at Al-Wathba racetrack, a fleet of sport utility vehicles, five or six wide, shifted into gear and zoomed after them, tailing the animals on the paved roads that flanked both sides of the soft dirt track. To the uninitiated, it looked like a presidential motorcade locked in a low-speed chase with a pack of Bedouins. To the more familiar, it was simply camel racing, modernized.\nInside one of the vehicles, Hamad Mohammed watched the action from the passenger seat. Mohammed, who works for an Emirati sheikh and trains numerous camels, was tracking his entry, Miyan, while a friend navigated through the glut of semidistracted drivers circling the 3.7-mile track. Miyan broke from the starting line and quickly pulled away from the typical jumbling. She settled on an inside position and churned along, flanks heaving beneath green silks.\nThe car was quiet, save for the thundering tones of the radio announcer calling the race from a van about 15 feet away, also following the camels. As the race neared its midpoint, Mohammed picked up a walkie-talkie, leaned his face against the window and began to make a clucking sound.\nIt was not a word \u2014 not in Arabic or any other language \u2014 but more of a murmur, a throaty noise like one might use to coax a hesitant dog. Mohammed made the sound over and over, and Miyan, who was at least 20 yards away, responded, surging forward a bit.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Mohammed said softly to his friend. \u201cThe robot is working.\u201d\nFrom Children to Robots\nSports are important in this region, both in the U.A.E. \u2014 where big-money sponsorships and high-end events happen in everything from cricket and soccer to rugby and golf \u2014 and in other countries, like Qatar, which will host the 2019 track and field world championships and the 2022 World Cup. Yet while much of the action here is geared toward outsiders, there is at least one aspect of sporting life that remains primarily a locals\u2019 game.\nCamel racing, in one form or another, has been part of Arabian culture for generations, with some historians tracing races to the seventh century. Camels are viewed as magnificent creatures here \u2014 there are even camel beauty pageants \u2014 and racing is seen as a unifying activity, a sport that brings together people of all backgrounds, whether royals or paupers, businessmen or laborers.\ntranscript\nVisitors to the Al Wathra racetrack at the Abu Dabi may notice a few differences from tracks elsewhere in the world: first - there are camels instead of horses,... second - there\u2019s no betting allowed,... and third...  ...the jockeys here are robots.\n\nRobot Jockeys first found their way to the track more then a decade ago when the United Arab Emirates ended the practice of owners using young children, most of them bought or taken from Africa and Southeast Asia, to ride their camels.\n \nIn their place are robots, though they are not desert droids who can wash and feed and groom a camel.  These robots are fashioned from parts you can buy in your local hardware store and can generally only do two things: let the owner talk to the camel;... and let the owner whip the camel.\n \nThe typical robot body is made from a modified electric drill, a keyless entry clicker like you\u2019d use with a car, a folded sponge to serve as the robot\u2019s head, and a plastic sheath wrapped in cotton that becomes the robots whip.  There are also customized riding silks in the owner\u2019s color of choice.\n \nWith the robots in the saddle, the camels break into a run as the gate it lifted. Seconds later a fleet of SUV\u2019s takes off after them, with each camel\u2019s owner riding in the passenger seat so that he can clearly see his animal and use the robot to talk to him. The owners also use their clickers to activate their whips as the camels run towards the finish.\n \nAfterword, the camels who finished first, second and third received a traditional honor of having their necks coated in a saffron glaze, before everyone, robots included, heads home.\n \nFrom the Al Wathba racetrack I\u2019m....\nRacing in the U.A.E. became more organized in the 1980s and \u201990s, when Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the first president of the federation, oversaw construction of several racetracks. As races became more competitive and prize money grew, many camel owners began to use lightweight children as jockeys, some as young as 2 or 3, importing them from countries like Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan. Falls and critical injuries were common. Trading, bartering and kidnapping of child jockeys, as well as accusations of physical and sexual abuse, were frighteningly frequent, too. At one point, it was estimated that 40,000 child jockeys were being used across the Persian Gulf.\nThe horrors of that human trafficking left a scar for the sport that lingers even now, 12 years after the practice was officially banned in the U.A.E. Some owners said quietly that they still might prefer to have human jockeys \u2014 though none would say so publicly \u2014 but a majority, perhaps recognizing the troubling perception of having children ride animals that stand 6 feet tall and can run up to 40 miles per hour, unabashedly praised the technology now widely used instead: robots.\nEarly models of the robots, which were first produced in 2003, were cumbersome and weighed as much as 30 pounds. The camels generally did not respond well to them, and owners were put off by the difficulty of obtaining them.\nIn the years since, the production of the robots has become more local and more streamlined. Now, camel owners can go to numerous shops or markets in the U.A.E. to buy robots and accessories, which can even include deluxe silks (the robots are made to actually look like tiny jockeys). The latest version of the robot weighs only a few pounds.\nOne shop, located a quick ride (or, alternately, a leisurely stroll on a camel) from the racetrack in Dubai, advertised its wares with a display of robots in various colors outside the front door. Inside, two Pakistani men, who gave their names as Raheem and Jameel, worked at tables strewn with tools, bolts and power drills.\nThe Dewalt power drill is the heart and lungs of the modern robot jockey; shop workers like Raheem and Jameel order the drills in bulk and use them, and their rechargeable batteries, to construct the core of each robot. Remote-entry clickers (the kind used for cars) combine with long ribbons of plastic wrapped in cotton to make a spinning whip that can be activated from afar, and walkie-talkies allow the owner to speak to the camel from a trailing S.U.V. \nTailored silks and a spongy head of sorts complete the robot, which can cost less than 2,000 dirhams, or around $500, for a generic model. The robots sit on molded metal saddles when they race.\nRaheem estimated that he and Jameel could make 10 to 20 robots a day, though not all of their customers ask for a full device. The shop also handles repairs, and Salim Ali, a camel owner in Dubai, said that the robots could last for several years if taken in \u201cfor regular checkups.\u201d \nNader Al Jabri, an owner from Oman, said that he often shopped for robot parts in the U.A.E. because of the high quality of production there. He entered the shop in Dubai on a recent afternoon and began negotiating the price of a whip with Raheem, who was asking for about $10.\nAfter a friendly back-and-forth, Al Jabri departed with the whip and a smile. Raheem and Jameel went back to work. \u201cThere are always more to make,\u201d Raheem said.\nRace Day\nThe waiting area behind the starting line of a camel racetrack is a gathering of characters walking every which way, some dressed in robes, some dressed in slacks, some leading camels, some talking to \u2014 or, really, for \u2014 robots.\nThere are owners, trainers, training riders and handlers. Very rarely are there fans or tourists. When Mohammed and his friend tracked Miyan that morning, they did so in front of an empty grandstand at Al-Wathba. This is not uncommon, since betting on camel racing in the U.A.E. is not allowed. So unless a particularly big race is being contested \u2014 one season-ending race has a first-place prize of 1 million dirhams, or about $272,000 \u2014 the interested parties, including sheikhs, generally prefer to watch the events on television.\nA lack of attendance, though, does not equate to a lack of passion. Owning a camel is an honor in many Gulf countries, and there are laws about how much tax a camel owner must pay (it depends, in part, on how many camels he or she owns). Camels can also be used to pay a woman\u2019s dowry \u2014 prices vary \u2014 or as collateral in a trade of goods or services.\nBuying camels at an auction \u2014 the S.U.V. carrying Mohammed had pamphlets from old auctions littered on the floor \u2014 requires heavy research (much as buying a thoroughbred does), and sale prices for camels can range from as little as $2,700 to about $815,000.\nFeeding, training and housing a camel costs around $275 per month, according to Saeed Fayed al Zarie, a trainer in Dubai who oversees about 40 camels that are mostly kept in a camel community (a collection of low-ceilinged barns) near the track.\nEvery day, Zarie wakes up at 4 a.m. and feeds the camels, who rouse and begin their walk to training by about 6 a.m. The camels train until around 9 a.m., then walk back to the barns, eat again and nap until the midafternoon. Then it\u2019s another training session, then more food, and they are back asleep not long after 5 p.m., their bellies full with the nine pounds of food, much of it barley, that they eat each day.\nOn a race day, the camels line up in the area behind the starting line and wait for their race, kneeling in the sand while their trainers saddle them with the robot jockey and double-check the whip and walkie-talkie. The length of the race depends on the age of the camels, but unlike the action at a horse track, the racing is nearly continuous. There are no lulls, no breaks between races. As soon as one group crosses the finish line, another gathers at the start; then the gate is lifted and the next race begins.\nDuring the race, the soundtrack is a mix of car horns \u2014 owners beep at their camels for reasons they struggle to articulate \u2014 and loud thwacks, which are the sounds made by the robot whips smacking against the camels\u2019 hindquarters. Watching Miyan, Mohammed waited until the race was about two-thirds through before he began to use the whip, alternating between throaty murmurs via the walkie-talkie and remotely enabled pops to the rear.\nMiyan began to fade. As the camels made the final turn, Mohammed pressed the whip button a few times and made desperate squawks into the receiver, but there was no kick, no burst. \nHe and his friend sighed. Miyan lumbered on, a bit of foam frothing her lips as she bounced to the finish.\n\u201cI am disappointed,\u201d Mohammed said. \u201cThis is very average.\u201d\nMiyan came in seventh, good for about $2,500. After she crossed the finish line, handlers removed her robot and saddle \u2014 selected camels and their equipment are tested after races to ensure no drugs or artificial substances were used \u2014 and led her back through a gate. If she had finished in one of the top three places, her head and neck would have been rubbed with golden saffron, a sacred spice, as a show of honor. On this day, she simply went to the waiting area to cool down.\nMohammed and his friend idled in the S.U.V., discussing Miyan\u2019s race and groaning about her performance. After a few moments, the friend hit the gas and Mohammed sat back in his seat.\nThere was another race beginning, another opportunity. The gate lifted. The camels bolted from the start line. The engines thundered and the S.U.V.s lurched forward, their horns beeping and their tires squealing as they chased the robots through a thin layer of early-morning fog."}, {"text": "Getting the Jump on Mosquitoes\n2014-04-01T20:18:57.000Z\nThwack! Bitten. Again. \nOh, the perils of vacationing in mosquito territory. These little bloodsuckers have made a meal of me around the globe, and I\u2019ve longed for a definitive guide to repelling them. What really works? When and where are extra precautions necessary? \nI turned to scientists who study mosquito behavior to find out. They took a break from investigating neurons and odor receptors to offer travel advice, including whether to spend money on botanical repellents and why it might be wise to forgo that glass of wine. \nRepelling mosquitoes isn\u2019t just a matter of avoiding unsightly, itchy bumps. Mosquitoes spread some of the world\u2019s most deadly diseases. Malaria alone kills about a million people a year, according to the World Health Organization.\n\u201cMosquitoes are able to seek out a human being like a guided missile,\u201d said Anandasankar Ray, a scientist at the University of California, Riverside.\nIt helps to know your enemy in order to conquer her (yes, her \u2014 only female mosquitoes bite). To that end, let\u2019s briefly consider the situation from the mosquito\u2019s point of view. \nAs it turns out, you play a part in her raison d\u2019\u00eatre. She bites you, explained Dr. Ray, because she requires material from your blood to produce her eggs. Imagine a mosquito flitting about when suddenly she encounters a little cloud of carbon dioxide. This plume is one of many coming out of your mouth as you lounge poolside in Rio with a caipirinha. Special sensors allow the mosquito to detect the plume, a sign that a living vertebrate is near. \nAs she draws close to the source, her sensors pick up odors emitted from your skin. These odors, many of which are produced by bacteria in your skin, help the mosquito determine that you\u2019re not a horse or a dog but a human \u2014 her favorite meal. She homes in on you, possibly aided by infrared radiation coming off your warm body.\n\u201cAlmost like in the \u2018Predator\u2019 movies,\u201d Dr. Ray said.\nThen \u2014 zap! \u2014 she pierces the nape of your neck, extracting the drops of blood necessary for the creation of her progeny. \nBut back to you and your needs. \nTAKING COVER To protect yourself, you must know where and when the mosquitoes that carry debilitating diseases \u2014 malaria, filariasis, yellow fever, dengue \u2014 bite. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re in Central America, South America, Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia \u2014 all of these places that are the most beautiful travel destinations, it\u2019s really a concern,\u201d said Leslie B. Vosshall, a scientist at Rockefeller University in New York who works with flies, mosquitoes and humans to study how odor is processed and perceived.\nDengue and yellow fever are primarily spread by Aedes aegypti, mosquitoes that live in tropical and subtropical areas \u2014 though they are increasingly found in urban areas \u2014 including Africa, Asia, North America, the Caribbean and Latin America (pay attention, World Cup travelers). This species bites during the day. Feeding typically spikes a couple of hours after sunrise and late afternoon, said Dr. Ray, whose findings about mosquito receptors, published last year in the journal Cell, could eventually help control disease transmission. \nEach year about 50 to 100 million people get dengue fever, a viral infection that often requires hospitalization and can develop into deadly hemorrhagic fever, according to the W.H.O. There is no vaccine and no cure. Bed nets, said Dr. Ray, are a must. \nAedes aegypti can also transmit the chikungunya virus, which causes fever and joint pain. Chikungunya has hit Asia, Africa, India, Europe and the Americas (and into the eastern Caribbean this winter), according to the W.H.O. While there is no cure, most patients recover, though joint pain can persist for months or years. \nAnother species, Culex, may carry lymphatic filariasis, an infection that can result in elephantiasis. Places most at risk include Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Nepal, Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania. Culex mosquitoes can also carry West Nile virus, found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America and West Asia. These mosquitoes prefer birds but will bite humans, too. In the evening you may see them on the walls of your hotel room. \n\u201cThey will try and descend on you while sleeping,\u201d Dr. Ray said. Use a bed net. \nAnopheles gambiae, mosquitoes that can spread malaria, often bite at dusk and late at night, Dr. Ray said. The W.H.O. says travelers are at risk of malaria infection in 99 countries, mostly in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Yet unlike dengue and chikungunya, malaria can be prevented, even treated, with medication. \nWHAT WORKS, WHAT DOESN\u2019T \u201cThe gold standard of insect repellency continues to be DEET,\u201d Dr. Ray said. Developed by the Army in 1946, DEET is a chemical that can melt your nail polish. That said, the Environmental Protection Agency does not consider it to be a health concern if it is used infrequently and properly. (The agency\u2019s DEET toxicity study is at  epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/0002fact.pdf.) \n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that it\u2019s the most effective skin repellent on earth,\u201d Dr. Vosshall said.\nDEET is sold in concentrations from less than 5 percent to 100 percent. Wearing long sleeves and pants will reduce the amount you need to use. Still, covering up (even in clothing with built-in repellent) is not foolproof. \u201cIf they\u2019re very desperate,\u201d Dr. Vosshall said, mosquitoes will \u201cbite through jeans.\u201d \nAn alternative is Avon Skin So Soft with picaridin, a synthetic version of piperine, the active component of black pepper. (Unlike DEET, it won\u2019t dissolve plastics.)\nWhat about natural botanical repellents that rely on plant extracts?\n\u201cIt smells better and it doesn\u2019t melt your sunglasses,\u201d Dr. Vosshall said. But \u201cthe scientific evidence that those things work is weak to nonexistent.\u201d\nSome travelers swear by slapping on a vitamin B patch or eating garlic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably going to repel your friends but it really wouldn\u2019t have an effect on mosquitoes,\u201d Dr. Ray said. \nYet certain unconventional techniques can help, like taking showers (mosquitoes are drawn to sweat that has been on your skin for a while, Dr. Ray said) and, for reasons that remain unclear, avoiding alcohol. \n\u201cWhen people drink alcohol they become attractive to mosquitoes,\u201d he said. (And you thought that only worked on other humans.) \nThere are also spatial repellents, which you should buy if you are vacationing in a country with mosquito-borne diseases and your accommodations do not have window screens. The safest of these repellents release a low amount of insecticide, like ThermaCELL lanterns, which use butane cartridges to heat mats saturated with repellent that then rises into the air. The effect of long-term exposure, however, is not clear. The OFF! clip-on mosquito repellent battery-powered fan also circulates repellent (the active ingredient is metofluthrin, which is a neurotoxicant). This will work if, for example, you\u2019re camping and clip it inside your tent, said Dr. Ray, but not necessarily outdoors on a breezy day. \nCitronella candles and oils \u201cwork somewhat,\u201d he said. So does having someone around whom mosquitoes find irresistible.\n\u201cMany different groups have tested this idea that some people are more attractive than others and it\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d Dr. Vosshall said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t exactly know why.\u201d \nIN THE FUTURE DEET has been the go-to solution for more than 70 years, but that\u2019s changing. Last year, Dr. Ray and his colleagues revealed that they had discovered possible chemical substitutes for DEET that also have a milder smell, like that of grapes or sandalwood. Such findings will likely \u201clead to brand new, safer and more pleasant and perhaps more affordable mosquito repellents over the next two years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hopefully in four or five years we\u2019ll find a DEET substitute that wouldn\u2019t need to be spread all over your skin and could perhaps be used as a perfume or an after-shave.\u201d \nEau de Aedes aegypti? Here\u2019s hoping. "}, {"text": "Communist Leader in India Stands Firm as His Party Shrinks\n2014-05-14T13:49:57.000Z\nAGARTALA, India \u2014 This finger of land wrapped around Bangladesh is the last refuge for many of India\u2019s most endangered species, including the pygmy hog, the white-bellied heron and, perhaps most critically, the dyed-in-the-wool Communist.\nChief Minister Manik Sarkar of Tripura State is one of India\u2019s last Communists with political power, and he is a fine specimen of this disappearing species. He wears simple cotton tunics, leads blood donation drives and has a nearly empty personal bank account. His wife, perhaps even more beloved than he, goes to market by rickshaw.\nBut Mr. Sarkar\u2019s isolation will probably become even more acute after the votes are officially counted on Friday in India\u2019s national elections. For the first time, Communists are likely to win fewer than 16 seats in the national Parliament, possibly as few as 10. That would be a showing so disastrous in a body of 543 elected seats that many analysts are predicting their eventual extinction in a land that has been such fertile ground for Marx, Lenin and Stalin that these were once popular first names.\n\u201cLeft-wing politics are alive and well in India, but true Communism will soon die out,\u201d said Dilip Simeon, an author and a former Maoist guerrilla. \u201cAnd they have only themselves to blame.\u201d\nCommunism\u2019s looming disappearance stems from Indians\u2019 deep attachment to parliamentary democracy, the Communist Party\u2019s failure to embrace Indian nationalism and a culture that distrusts dogma, said the historian Ramachandra Guha, author of \u201cIndia After Gandhi.\u201d\nBut some also blame India\u2019s failure to create a large industrial sector, the natural wellspring for Communist organizing efforts. Nearly 90 percent of workers toil in the cash-based \u201cinformal sector,\u201d where enterprises are small and jobs so fitful that unionization drives are nearly impossible.\n\u201cThe one big reason for Communism\u2019s decline is the irrelevance of the industrial working class as a political factor,\u201d said Ajoy Bose, an author and commentator. \u201cIndian manufacturing is in a terrible state.\u201d\nCommunism\u2019s redoubt here in Tripura, however, remains robust. The road from the airport into Agartala, the capital, is lined with red Soviet hammer-and-sickle flags planted every 15 feet. The party has 50 of 60 seats in Tripura\u2019s Legislative Assembly, and it has controlled the state government for 31 of the last 36 years \u2014 including an unbroken streak of victories since 1993.\nPart of Communism\u2019s success in Tripura has to do with the fecklessness of its opposition, a branch of the Indian National Congress party whose corruption and incompetence from 1988 to 1993 were so profound that people speak about it as if they had survived a shipwreck.\n\u201cThe opposition here is discredited, disorganized and so corrupt that it has no trust amongst the people,\u201d said Sekhar Datta, the longtime Tripura correspondent for The Telegraph, a newspaper in Kolkata, formerly Calcutta. \nDespite a period of rising incomes, a tide of economic discontent helped make Narendra Modi the prime minister-elect.\nBut Mr. Sarkar\u2019s efficient administration and unimpeachable honesty have also been important factors. In just one example, Tripura ranked first last year among Indian states in its implementation of a national rural jobs program. The state has done such a good job exploiting its natural gas reserves that Tripura now sells surplus power, and residents are almost never without electricity, a rarity in India. Roads are surprisingly good, many city landmarks have been rebuilt, and literacy levels are among the nation\u2019s highest.\nSome political ineptitude and venality persists. Samar Acharjee, a Tripura Communist leader, took a video of himself last year lying on a bed of cash he said he earned building toilets for the poor. In a state where two-thirds of residents live in poverty, such a selfie was not well received. The party expelled him.\nMr. Sarkar has been a Communist since his teenage years, and he speaks in a nearly lost dialect of C.I.A. conspiracies, reactionary forces and false consciousness. But nobody pays much attention to such talk, Mr. Datta said. And Mr. Sarkar delivers his Communist sermons with such cheerful ingenuousness that they come across like a G-rated rap song.\nMr. Sarkar surrenders his salary to the party, which recently raised his monthly stipend to $117 from $83. He lives in a modest house provided by the state and lists a shelf stuffed with books as his most valuable possession. In a country awash in political corruption, his monkish existence is remarkable.\n\u201cMy party has taught me to lead a simple life, and I have followed that credo since the beginning,\u201d Mr. Sarkar said in an interview.\nSudip Roy Barman, a member of the Indian National Congress and the leader of the opposition in the Tripura Legislative Assembly, said that the stories of Mr. Sarkar\u2019s relative poverty are overblown: Mr. Sarkar\u2019s leather sandals must have cost at least $50 and his rimless glasses $100.\n\u201cAnd even if he is remaining clean, he has surrounded himself with thieves,\u201d Mr. Barman added.\nOther critics say that while Mr. Sarkar is genuinely poor, he has ensured that almost everyone else in the state is as well.\n\u201cThey believe if people get rich, they won\u2019t be Communists anymore,\u201d said Jayanta Debnath, managing editor of a widely read local news website.\nMr. Sarkar agreed that great wealth is not a Communist interest. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to create millionaires or billionaires,\u201d he said. But he denied that he wanted to keep anyone impoverished. \u201cWe want to see that people do not starve.\u201d\nOn a steamy evening with just a ceiling fan to cool him, Mr. Sarkar showed no sign of discomfort. His white kurta appeared freshly pressed, and a gold pen sparkled in a shirt pocket. He blamed multinational corporations for Communism\u2019s looming collapse in India, saying they had used media companies to sully the reputation of Communists.\n\u201cIndia\u2019s market is important, and they want in,\u201d Mr. Sarkar said. \u201cSo they have attacked the party in its last bastions.\u201d\nBut he vowed to depend upon the party until the end. After all, it still pays him $117 a month."}, {"text": "In Torrent of Rapes in Britain, an Uncomfortable Focus on Race and Ethnicity \n2014-11-01T19:36:39.000Z\nROCHDALE, England \u2014 Shabir Ahmed, a delivery driver for two takeout places, did not have to go looking for young girls. Runaways and rebellious teenagers would show up at the restaurants, often hungry and cold. He slipped them free drinks and chicken tikka masala. \u201cCall me Daddy,\u201d he would say.\nBut soon, Mr. Ahmed, a father of four, would demand payback. In a room above one of the restaurants, according to testimony and evidence in later legal proceedings against him, he would play a pornographic DVD and pass around shots of vodka. Then, on a floor mattress with crumpled blue sheets and kitchen smells wafting from below, he raped them, and later forced them into sex with co-workers and friends, too.\nThe girls were too scared of him to talk. And when they did, no one believed them. Once, a 15-year-old got so drunk and upset that she smashed a glass counter. Mr. Ahmed and his colleagues did not hesitate to call the police. After she was released, she was coerced into sex four or five times a week, sometimes with half a dozen men at a time, in apartments and taxis around Rochdale, a town in northwest England near Manchester. \nThe police and other agencies were alerted more than 100 times over six years to the possibility that something very wrong was happening before Mr. Ahmed, now 61, was arrested and charged as the leader of a sexual exploitation ring that involved eight men of Pakistani descent and one Afghan. In May 2012, he was given a 19-year prison sentence for raping and abetting rape in a case involving at least 47 girls, all of them white. \nMr. Ahmed showed no remorse. He called the judge a \u201cracist bastard,\u201d the girls \u201cprostitutes\u201d and blamed white Britons for \u201ctraining\u201d their daughters in drinking and sexual activity at a young age.\nThe recent revelations that at least 1,400 teenage and preteenage girls had been sexually exploited over 16 years by so-called grooming gangs in another northern English city, Rotherham, stunned the nation because of the sheer scale of the abuse. And it put an uncomfortable spotlight on issues of race, religion and ethnicity in an increasingly multicultural nation: Nearly all of the rape suspects are Pakistani men, and nearly all of the victims are white.\nBut the problem and the slow law-enforcement response are not limited to Rotherham, where evidence files are said to have gone missing and no charges have been filed since the release two months ago of an independent report documenting the widespread abuse. (Only one case in Rotherham, involving three teenage girls, had been prosecuted.) In nearby Sheffield, a local official has accused the police of ignoring data she passed along over the past decade, including addresses where she said abuse was taking place and names of those suspected of abuse.\nThe police and prosecutors say they are now pursuing cases more aggressively across the country, including in Manchester, where about 180 suspects are under investigation. Simon Bailey of the Association of Chief Police Officers last month spoke of \u201cmany more Rotherhams to come.\u201d\nMr. Ahmed is a rare example in such a case of someone who has been charged, tried and convicted of rape. His case sheds light on how grooming gangs work and how they have contributed to a broader pattern of sexual abuse of children involving British celebrities, politicians, private schoolteachers and clergymen.\nMr. Ahmed\u2019s case and a handful of others prosecuted since 2010, including in Rochdale and in Keighley in the north and in Oxford in the south, followed the same template: Mostly Asian men were found to have groomed mostly white British girls between the ages of 12 and 18, getting them to use alcohol or drugs and then forcing them to have sex, either for personal gratification or for trafficking and prostitution.\nIn a country already fiercely debating issues of immigration and national identity, the cases have prompted anti-Muslim demonstrations by far-right groups and some soul-searching generally. Why do British-Pakistani men figure so prominently? Were they deliberately targeting white girls and staying away from their own community? Did police and local officials turn a blind eye for fear of being accused of racism, losing votes among immigrant groups or stoking the kinds of tensions that have unleashed periodic rioting in other British towns?\nNazir Afzal, a Pakistani-Briton who is the chief crown prosecutor in charge of sexual crime, said the recent cases were not primarily about race. \u201cIt\u2019s not the ethnicity or religion of the abusers that defines them; it\u2019s their attitude toward women,\u201d Mr. Afzal said in a recent interview. \u201cThese men will abuse the girls and women who are the most accessible to them, regardless of their religion or the color of their skin.\u201d\nMr. Ahmed, he pointed out, was separately convicted of 30 counts of child rape of a Pakistani girl, a case that resulted in a 22-year prison sentence later in 2012 but that received much less media attention. Mr. Ahmed plans to appeal at the European Court of Justice, his lawyer, Naila Akhter, said.\nOver the last two years alone, Mr. Afzal\u2019s office has dealt with sex offenders from 25 countries and victims from 64. Nearly nine of every 10 convicted sexual abusers in Britain are white men, he said, and by far the most common pattern of child sexual abuse takes place not just within the same community but within the same home.\nIn online grooming, the fastest-growing form of abuse, with victims first contacted online, there appears to be no clear racial pattern, either.\nBut Mr. Afzal, who was the prosecutor in the Rochdale case after overturning a decision by his predecessor not to take the case to court, said that in the type of child sexual exploitation known as localized or on-street grooming, men of Pakistani heritage feature prominently.\nWhite men are still the largest group at 49 percent of known offenders in this category, according to a 2012 study by the Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner, which identified 2,409 victims over a 14-month period across England even before the Rotherham report was published. But at 33 percent, \u201cAsian men\u201d \u2014 most commonly referring to Pakistanis, Indians, Bangladeshis and Afghans \u2014 were disproportionately represented, given that they represent just over 7 percent of the population.\nOne reason, officials, scholars and community workers suggest, is practical rather than cultural: Nighttime industries like taxi-driving and takeout restaurants have been at the heart of many grooming networks, offering points of contact with vulnerable girls far away from parental supervision.\nPakistanis work in disproportionate numbers in both. In the Rochdale case, eight of the nine perpetrators drove taxis or worked at two takeout restaurants. (One taxi company in Rochdale said it now provides white drivers on request.)\n\u201cThe victims are often desperate for warmth, transport, food and sometimes drugs and alcohol,\u201d said Ray McMorrow, a health specialist for the National Working Group, a charitable network based in Derby. \u201cThey gravitate toward these men who then take advantage of them.\u201d\n\u201cThere are anecdotes of the girls being racially stereotyped as white sluts or white trash, but it\u2019s hard to say how much of that is racism and sectarianism and how much is classic sexual offender behavior belittling the victims,\u201d he said.\nOthers suspect a cultural misogyny rooted in a very patriarchal Muslim society in which men exert high levels of control over women. \u201cThis could give rise to a culture in which it is more acceptable to treat women and girls with contempt,\u201d said Sue Berelowitz, Britain\u2019s deputy children\u2019s commissioner.\nMr. Afzal recalls listening to Mr. Shabir in Rochdale during the trial. \u201cHe would ask: \u2018What am I doing here? I have done nothing wrong,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Afzal said. \u201cHe said he was doing what everyone else was doing.\u201d\nWith the police looking the other way and more and more men getting involved in the abuse, there was a culture of permissibility, Mr. Afzal said.\nA powerful culture of shame and honor surrounding premarital sex, including rape, among some Asian Muslims, may also have skewed the victim statistics. Honor and shame certainly proved an effective tool when Mr. Shabir blackmailed his Asian victim into silence during a decade of regular abuse. \u201cYou are damaged goods,\u201d he would tell her, threatening to force her into marriage if she spoke up, Mr. Afzal recalled. Asian victims of sexual abuse are three times less likely to come forward than white victims, he said, citing Home Office data.\n\u201cThey fear not just their rapists,\u201d said Shaista Gohir, chairwoman of the Muslim Women\u2019s Network U.K. \u201cThey fear their own community and their own family: They fear honor crime, forced marriage and being shunned and ostracized for bringing shame to their family.\u201d\nTaking the cultural dimension of grooming seriously without overstating it is difficult, said Ms. Berelowitz, the deputy children\u2019s commissioner.\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t ignore patterns that could alert us to victims and perpetrators that might otherwise be hidden and that might be linked to faith and ethnicity,\u201d Ms. Berelowitz said. \u201cBut if we think the stereotype of the Asian abuser and the white victim is all that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d"}, {"text": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera\n"}, {"text": "Immigrants Welcome Here\n"}, {"text": "A Spiritual Legacy Endures in Healthy Eating\n2014-04-25T17:43:59.000Z\nSEATTLE \u2014 I ordered the California omelet. It was fresh and capably cooked, with ample, bright green slices of avocado. The service was cheery and efficient. Were it not for the video of an older Bangladeshi immigrant performing heroic acts of strength that was playing on a loop on a flat-screen television, I would have remembered Silence-Heart-Nest, in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle, as just an above-average vegetarian brunch spot.\nBut there was that video of Sri Chinmoy, the spiritual master who died in 2007 at the age of 76, hinting that Silence-Heart-Nest was run by disciples of his school of meditation. And then, when you looked around, you noticed the pamphlets by the door, inviting the public to introductory meditation classes.\nAnd on the restaurant\u2019s website, one can find links to about 20 other vegetarian restaurants around the world, including in New York; San Diego; Heidelberg, Germany; and Canberra, Australia \u2014 all run by followers of Mr. Chinmoy, whom they remember as an athlete of otherworldly physical prowess. They extol their teacher\u2019s philosophy, which married meditation to the practices of art, literature and above all vigorous exercise. A 1996 article about the group in Outside magazine carried the jokey headline, \u201cBless You, Sir, May I Jog Another?\u201d\nThe staff at Silence-Heart-Nest would not give their names and were unwilling to be interviewed, but I found some of Mr. Chinmoy\u2019s other followers, of whom, one of them told me, there are about 7,000 in the world. In mid-April, over 1,000 convened in New York City for one of their semiannual conventions. I reached several of them before they left for New York, and in phone interviews, they helped fill in a picture of a small but enduring spiritual tradition that finds one of its expressions in the healthy meals the followers serve.\nPradhan Balter, 65, owns Victory\u2019s Banner, a vegetarian restaurant in Chicago. He began following Mr. Chinmoy when he was 21, and he entered through the gateway of yoga practice.\n\u201cI was doing hatha yoga,\u201d Mr. Balter said. \u201cThat is often a portal of entry into the more meditative kind. You go to yoga class, and they\u2019ll do a little meditation afterward. I took my interest to spirituality in general, the spiritual aspects of yoga.\u201d Eventually, his interest in meditation led him to search for a teacher to help him on his path.\n\u201cI finally encountered Sri Chinmoy,\u201d Mr. Balter said, \u201cand he passed my test for being a genuine teacher. I decided to invest three months with him.\u201d The three months turned into a lifetime.\nMr. Balter said that his teacher never told him to open a restaurant, and he pointed out that all the Chinmoy-affiliated restaurants are owned by individuals, not by any umbrella group. But when he was unhappy as a chiropractor, he did consult Mr. Chinmoy about his career direction.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Guru, I don\u2019t think I should be a chiropractor anymore,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Balter recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018What will you do?\u2019 I said, \u2018Open a restaurant,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Very good, very good.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nNatabara Rollosson, who like a number of Mr. Chinmoy\u2019s students lives in Queens, where the teacher himself resided, said Mr. Chinmoy\u2019s teachings were unique in their focus on the heart, rather than the mind, as the center of meditation.\n\u201cUsing your mind to quiet your mind \u2014 that\u2019s like asking a 4-year-old child to discipline herself,\u201d Mr. Rollosson said. \u201cBut focusing your spiritual practice in your heart, the center of your being, if you put your attention there, you are accessing the quieter space inside yourself. And that helps clear the mind.\u201d\nSo where does the vegetarianism come in? It, too, is an aid to meditation, according to Mr. Rollosson.\n\u201cAs we consume meat, meat carries the aggressive nature of animal, and we are trying to evolve beyond that animal nature,\u201d he said. \u201cFruits and vegetables have a more mild quality to them. So the vegetarianism helps you have a clearer meditation, because the agitation from the meat manifests in agitated thoughts as you try to clear your mind.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Rollosson, 45, began studying with Mr. Chinmoy more than 20 years, ago, he \u201chated running,\u201d he said. But soon after he began using Mr. Chinmoy\u2019s meditation techniques as a young man in Seattle, he discovered a facility for exercise. One night, he ran around a lake with a three-mile circumference \u2014 \u201cthen ran around it again, then again, a total of almost nine miles,\u201d he said. Since then he has run two New York marathons in times of under three hours.\nDuring his lifetime, Mr. Chinmoy, who was born Chinmoy Kumar Ghose and came to the United States in 1964, was known for sponsoring multistage ultra- and ultra-ultramarathons. He ran, too, but videos circulated by Mr. Chinmoy\u2019s devotees often focus on showboating feats like standing under a platform with a follower \u2014 or a celebrity, like Eddie Murphy or Susan Sarandon \u2014 perched atop, and lifting them a few inches in the air.\nMr. Balter, the former chiropractor, said that because he treated Mr. Chinmoy\u2019s legs and sat with him constantly, he knew for a fact that his master needed only a couple hours of sleep a day. \u201cAnd at 4:30 in the morning, he\u2019d be out at the tennis court,\u201d Mr. Balter said.\nMr. Chinmoy also performed various esoteric acts of what might be called cerebral endurance, like writing 360 poems in 24 hours. But today, his legacy is found less in athletic contests, although they still go on, or in his many extant watercolors and poems than in the classes and businesses run by his followers.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a monastic institution, in the sense that you join and are supported somehow,\u201d said Kusumita P. Pedersen, a 68-year-old professor at St. Francis College in Brooklyn, who started studying with Mr. Chinmoy in 1971. \u201cSo a restaurant is one way to make a living while serving your local community. You get to know people, and if you are feeding people, you are caring for them. And eating together creates community.\u201d\nDr. Pedersen explained that students were not required to work in the restaurants. What is more, she said, they sometimes start other enterprises, like health food stores or silk-screening businesses.\n\u201cIn Britain, there are three stores called Run and Become, which sell running shoes and other gear for running,\u201d Dr. Pedersen said, citing an example of one of the businesses. \u201cQuite different from a restaurant.\u201d"}, {"text": "\u2018Empire of Cotton,\u2019 by Sven Beckert\n2014-12-31T16:16:46.000Z\nThe history of an era often seems defined by a particular commodity. The 18th century certainly belonged to sugar. The race to cultivate it in the West Indies was, in the words of the French Enlightenment writer Guillaume-Thomas de Raynal, \u201cthe principal cause of the rapid movement which stirs the Universe.\u201d In the 20th century and beyond, the commodity has been oil: determining events from the Allied partitioning of the Middle East after World War I to Hitler\u2019s drive for Balkan and Caspian wells to the forging of our own fateful ties to the regimes of the Persian Gulf. \nIn his important new book, the Harvard historian Sven Beckert makes the case that in the 19th century what most stirred the universe was cotton. \u201cEmpire of Cotton\u201d is not casual airplane reading. Heavy going at times, it is crowded with many more details and statistics (a few of them repeated) than the nonspecialist needs. But it is a major work of scholarship that will not be soon surpassed as the definitive account of the product that was, as Beckert puts it, the Industrial Revolution\u2019s \u201claunching pad.\u201d \nMore than that, \u201cEmpire of Cotton\u201d is laced with compassion for the millions of miserably treated slaves, sharecroppers and mill workers whose labors, over hundreds of years, have gone into the clothes we wear and the surprising variety of other products containing cotton, from coffee filters to gunpowder. Today some 350 million people are involved in growing, transporting, weaving, stitching or otherwise processing the fibers of this plant. \n\u201cUntil the 19th century,\u201d Beckert explains, \u201cthe overwhelming bulk of raw cotton was spun and woven within a few miles from where it was grown.\u201d Nothing changed that more dramatically than the slave plantations that spread across the American South, a form of outsourcing before the word was invented. These showed that cotton could be lucratively cultivated in bulk for consumers as far afield as another continent, and that realization turned the world upside down. Without slavery, he says, there would have been no Industrial Revolution. \nBeckert\u2019s most significant contribution is to show how every stage of the industrialization of cotton rested on violence. As soon as the profit potential of those Southern cotton fields became clear in the late 1780s, the transport of slaves across the Atlantic rapidly increased. Cotton cloth itself had become the most important merchandise European traders used to buy slaves in Africa. Then planters discovered that climate and rainfall made the Deep South better cotton territory than the border states. Nearly a million American slaves were forcibly moved to Georgia, Mississippi and elsewhere, shattering many families in the process. \nThe search for more good cotton-\u00adgrowing soil in areas that today are such states as Texas, Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma was a powerful incentive to force Native Americans off their traditional lands and onto reservations, another form of violence by the \u201cmilitary-cotton complex.\u201d Beckert\u2019s coinage seems not far-fetched when he points out that by 1850, two-thirds of American cotton was grown on land that had been taken over by the United States since the beginning of the century. And who structured the bond deal for the Louisiana Purchase, which made so much of that possible? Thomas Baring of Britain, one of the world\u2019s leading cotton merchants. \nBeckert practices what is known as global or world history: the study of events not limited to one country or continent. The perspective serves him well. For it was not just in the United States that planters\u2019 thirst to sow large tracts with cotton pushed indigenous peoples and self-sufficient farmers off their land; colonial armies did the same thing in India, West Africa and elsewhere. When he talks about the rise of late-19th-century American Populism (driven in part by the grievances of small cotton farmers), he also mentions parallel movements in India, Egypt and Mexico. And it was not only white Southerners who were responsible for the harsh regime of slave-grown cotton: merchants and bankers in the North and in Britain lent them money and were investors as well. With sons strategically stationed in cities on both sides of the Atlantic, the Brown family \u2014 patrons of the Museum of Natural History in New York and the corporate ancestors of Brown Brothers Harriman \u2014 owned more than a dozen Southern cotton plantations \u00adoutright. \nBeyond violence, another major theme of \u201cEmpire of Cotton\u201d is that, contrary to the myth of untrammeled free enterprise, this expanding industry was fueled at every stage by government intervention. From Denmark to Mexico to Russia, states lent large sums to early clothing manufacturers. Whether it was canals and railways in Europe or levees on the Mississippi, governments jumped in to build or finance the infrastructure that big cotton growers and mills demanded. Britain forced Egypt and other territories to lower or eliminate their import duties on British cotton. \nBeckert has a larger ambition, however, than just telling the story of cotton; he wants to use that commodity as a lens on the development of the modern world itself. This he divides into two overlapping phases: \u201cwar capitalism\u201d for the stage when slavery and colonial conquest prepared the ground for the cotton industry, and \u201cindustrial capitalism\u201d for the period when states intervened to protect and help the business in other ways. This makes \u201cEmpire of Cotton\u201d read a bit like two books combined, with one of them incomplete. Cotton\u2019s story Beckert more than fully tells, but his analysis of capitalism really requires a bigger-picture scrutiny of other industries as well. And here, his two categories are not so easily separated. For example, we no longer go to war over cotton, but would America have spent hundreds of billions of dollars fighting in Iraq if that country had no oil?\nAbout the history of cotton itself, Beckert is on firmer ground. Today, a \u201cgiant race to the bottom\u201d by an industry always looking for cheaper labor has shifted most cotton growing and the work of turning it into clothing back to Asia, the continent where it was first widely used several centuries ago. And violence in different forms is still all too present. In Uzbekistan, up to two million children under 15 are put to work harvesting cotton each year \u2014 just as the mills of St. Petersburg, Manchester and Alsace once heavily depended on child labor from poorhouses and orphanages. In China, the Communist Party\u2019s suppression of free trade unions keeps cotton workers\u2019 wages down, just as British law in the early 1800s saw to it that men and women who abandoned their ill-paid jobs and ran away could be jailed for breach of contract. And in Bangladesh, the more than 1,100 people killed in the notorious collapse of the Rana Plaza building in 2013 were mostly female clothing workers, whose employers were as careless about their safety as those who enforced 14- or 16-hour workdays in German and Spanish weaving mills a century before. A long thread of tragedy is woven through the story of the puffy white substance that clothes us all. "}, {"text": "Obama Success, or Global Shame?\n2014-05-31T19:17:00.000Z\nMRAUK U, Myanmar \u2014 AS we hiked on a bamboo bridge over a river, past a police checkpoint, by water buffalo, over abandoned rice paddies, and past a hamlet where 28 Muslim children had been hacked to death, word raced ahead of us. Farmers poured out to welcome us from two besieged villages that for two years have been mostly cut off from the world.\nOne man, a teacher who spoke a bit of English, thrust a handwritten letter in my hands. Puzzled, I asked him whom he had written the letter for. He explained that he had drafted it in hopes that a foreigner might visit some day and transmit news of the villagers\u2019 suffering.\n\u201cMany people are by violent wound died,\u201d the letter recounted in painstaking English. \u201cNow our Rohingyas many people are homeless. We do not have home, food and living very difficulty. Now we are to the cage prison sent.\u201d\nThe villagers are Rohingya, a dark-skinned Muslim minority that is deeply resented by the Buddhist majority in Myanmar. For decades, Myanmar persecuted the Rohingya and left them stateless, and in the last few months the authorities have amplified the crimes against humanity \u2014 yet the global reaction has been largely indifference.\nSince violent clashes in 2012, the Rohingya have been confined to quasi-concentration camps or to their villages, denied ready access to markets, jobs or hospitals. This spring, the authorities expelled the aid group Doctors Without Borders, which had been providing the Rohingya with medical care. Orchestrated violent attacks on the offices of humanitarian organizations drove many aid workers away as well and seemed intended in part to remove foreign witnesses to this ethnic cleansing.\nI\u2019m on my annual \u201cwin-a-trip\u201d journey, in which I take a university student \u2014 this year it\u2019s Nicole Sganga of Notre Dame \u2014 on a reporting trip (she\u2019s blogging at\u00a0nytimes.com/ontheground). We wanted to reach remote villages where Rohingya live, where nobody has much idea what is happening, so we set off by vehicle and then by foot.\nWhat we found is dangerous tension and some malnutrition, but by far the biggest problem is medical care. More than one million Rohingya are getting little if any health care, and some are dying as a result.\nIn the village of Zeezar, we met a young mother, Saida, 20, whose 10-day-old baby was sickly and losing weight. The baby needed a doctor, but aid workers aren\u2019t allowed in the village, and Rohingya aren\u2019t allowed to leave freely.\nIn theory, Saida can get a pass to go through checkpoints and visit a clinic. In practice, that sometimes means paying bribes and inevitably means passing the homes of people who have been accused of murdering Rohingya with impunity: For her, it\u2019s terrifying. So she gambled that her baby would recover on her own.\nIn one Rohingya internment camp, we met Thein Maung, 46, who has AIDS and used to get antiretroviral medicines from Doctors Without Borders to keep him alive. Now he has no source of medication, and he feels his health fading.\nAnother man, Amir Hussein, had his arm broken two years ago by a Buddhist mob. No doctor was available to set the bone, so his left arm now dangles grotesquely and uselessly at an odd angle.\nRohingya children are also denied an education. In one village we visited, parents had set up a free informal school taught by a 17-year-old village girl whose own education had been stalled.\nPresident Obama, in his address a few days ago at the United States Military Academy at West Point, cited Myanmar as one of the administration\u2019s diplomatic successes. It\u2019s true that Myanmar has made tremendous political gains in recent years \u2014 the permission I received to report here is testimony to that \u2014 and there is much to admire about the country\u2019s progress toward democracy. But let\u2019s not make excuses for a 21st-century apartheid worse even than the system once enforced in South Africa. As Human Rights Watch has documented, what has unfolded here constitutes ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\nLikewise, another watchdog group, Fortify Rights, cites internal Myanmar documents and argues that a pattern over the years of killings, torture, rape and other repression amounts to crimes against humanity under international law.\nWeighed against such abuses, Obama\u2019s criticisms of Myanmar have been pathetically timid. Because he is hugely admired here, Obama has political capital to pressure the government that he has not used. Indeed, the United States and other countries have often even avoided the word Rohingya, effectively joining in the denial of a people\u2019s identity. That\u2019s a failed policy, for this deference has led Myanmar to tighten the screws on the Rohingya this year.\nThe Rohingya gave us the names of some Buddhists who they said had been leaders in slaughtering Muslims, and we visited one of these men they named. A 53-year-old farmer, he denied any involvement in the violence, but it was an awkward, tense conversation, partly because the Buddhists are angry at aid groups and journalists for (as they see it) siding with Muslims. Their narrative is that Muslim terrorists from Bangladesh are invading the country, overpopulating so as to marginalize the Buddhists, and then being coddled by foreigners.\nThe extremists back up this absurd narrative with intimidation. My Buddhist driver, who sported a nationalist tattoo, was willing to take me into Rohingya camps and villages and had no fear of assault by Muslims. But he was terrified of going to some hard-line Buddhist areas, for fear that we would be assaulted as Muslim sympathizers.\nWhen the authorities found out that we were wandering in the hills, they sent a team of police officers armed with automatic weapons to find and \u201cprotect\u201d us. They need to start protecting the Rohingya as well.\nLook, I\u2019ve seen greater malnutrition and disease over the years \u2014 in South Sudan, Niger, Congo, Guinea \u2014 but what\u2019s odious about what is happening here is that the suffering is deliberately inflicted as government policy. The authorities are stripping members of one ethnic group of citizenship, then interning them in camps or villages, depriving them of education, refusing them medical care \u2014 and even expelling humanitarians who seek to save their lives.\nThat\u2019s not a tragedy for one obscure ethnic group; it\u2019s an affront to civilization. Please, President Obama, find your voice."}, {"text": "Browsing Boutiques Without Taking the Trip\n2014-06-11T23:45:02.000Z\nBrowsing the boutiques and bazaars of a foreign city is one of the many pleasures of travel. It\u2019s also becoming easier to do from your couch.\nFor years the web has allowed retailers like Anthropologie, Shop Latitude and Cost Plus World Market to sell products from around the globe to anyone at any time. Plenty of Etsy shops do the same. But increasingly, expatriates and frequent travelers are proffering regional specialties \u2014 Berber wedding blankets from Morocco, silk scarves from India, pillows from Peru \u2014 through their personal websites and blogs, providing a level of interaction, even customization, that better approximates the experience of shopping in a local boutique. (Note: Return policies vary; vintage items are often nonrefundable.) Some sites are also committed to fair trade practices or have donated a portion of their profits to charity.\nHere are some of the less widely known virtual markets that I\u2019ve shopped or browsed when I can\u2019t steal away. You won\u2019t find a lot of inventory, but you will find distinct, handcrafted gems that just might transport you.\nBEYOND MARRAKECH\nFor those unable to comb Morocco\u2019s souks for leather pouffs, vintage Beni Ouarain and Azilal carpets and Moroccan wedding blankets, there\u2019s Beyond Marrakech, a blog and online boutique by Danielle Donker. Ms. Donker grew up in the Netherlands and London, but these days she lives amid Berber villages with her husband in Morocco\u2019s Ourika Valley, where they run a guesthouse with river views. In 2010, after nearly 15 years of collecting textiles and Berber carpets, Ms. Donker began selling them online.\n\u201cAt a certain point my private collection was really large and I discovered that it was not so much the fun of having the pieces but finding them and giving them new life by cleaning and repairing them,\u201d she said in an email. Now she hunts for merchandise in weekly markets and the bazaar in Marrakesh. The carpets she offers are made by various Berber tribes, including the Beni Ouarain. She also sells Azilal carpets from the High Atlas Mountains and Boucherouite carpets, or rag rugs, found in villages close to her home. \u201cEven though it has become a small business, I only purchase the things that I personally like as if I am still collecting for myself,\u201d she said.\nEverything on her blog is handmade. Most of it is vintage. \u201cIn my opinion a vintage carpet or wedding blanket cannot be copied,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is impossible to give a newly handmade piece the \u2018soul\u2019 of a vintage item which was generally made by women for the use in their own household.\u201d\nThe items online (and more) can be seen in person at her guesthouse, should you be lucky enough to be in Marrakesh. Recently, a 136-by-93-centimeter (about 4 \u00bc by 3 feet) wedding blanket was $305.\nInformation: beyondmarrakech.blogspot.com.\nFLEAING FRANCE\nSimone Bernard peppers this blog about her life in Provence with photographs of her treasure hunts through boutiques and markets there and in Paris. Her virtual \u201cbrocante,\u201d as she calls it, is modest.

New merchandise, including the leather and wool boots made by a father-son cooperative in Morocco (starting at $150), arrives about three or four times a month.

Recent stops included Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan. Kenya is next on his list, despite numerous governments\u2019 warnings about terrorism \u2014 he wants to see Maasai warriors on the plains.\n\u201cHow mind-blowing is that?\u201d said Mr. Brown, a British native who works in the oil and gas industry. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I want to see it. But I do want to see it and I will see it.\u201d\nIn his own way, Mr. Brown represents the hearty spirit of modern international travelers. A resilient group, they continue to explore, visit and wander, defying headlines, regional strife and, in some cases, common sense.\nThis past summer, travelers faced myriad horrific images: videos of beheadings, the aftermath of a plane mysteriously disappearing from the sky and continued violence in the Middle East, to name a few. Logically, it was a good summer to stay home and remodel the backyard.\nYet more people traveled abroad this summer than a year earlier, with the number of international passengers up 5.5 percent in July, according to the International Air Transport Association. In the first six months of the year, 517 million tourists visited a foreign land, an increase of 22 million from a year earlier, the World Tourism Organization said.\nOn one level, the growth in air traffic simply reflects improving economies around the world, industry analysts say. But clearly, some other element is in play, driving people to travel despite peril around the world.\nModern travelers are managing their fears better than their squeamish predecessors, psychologists say.\n\u201cPeople are increasingly finding ways to deal with it,\u201d said Elaine Iljon-Foreman, a clinical psychologist based in Britain, who often works with travelers who fear to fly. \u201cWe are living in times of threats, but it\u2019s about how we manage it and how we decide not to allow this to limit our freedom.\u201d\nBelkis Santos is certainly nothing like the adventurous Mr. Brown. She is a retired educator living in Chicago, who likes to travel with her daughter or small groups.\nBut like Mr. Brown, she has not let the headlines deter her from traveling around the world. Ms. Santos\u2019s recent itinerary included lengthy trips to South Africa and South America, and she lives part time in Panama.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to die, you\u2019re going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t read and they don\u2019t know and they are afraid of everything.\u201d\nThe instant availability of research, data and reviews on almost any topic has changed the psyche of travelers, experts say. More than ever before, people can gather information on their own to assess the perceived risk.\nPaul Johnson, 43, author of a luxury travel blog, is no danger seeker. But he is part of a vast network of bloggers and information sites, which made it easier for him to hop on a plane recently to destinations such as Lithuania and South Africa.\nWhen it comes to concerns, \u201cI think it does naturally seep into your consciousness,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cBut people need to look into the detail. It boils down to education and your ability to educate yourself about a destination.\u201d\nThe availability of information also provides a coping mechanism for the anxiety associated with travel in tumultuous times, experts say. Modern travelers can create a wall between their own experiences and television images.\n\u201cEvents are happening to other people,\u201d said Robert Bor, a British specialist in aviation psychology. \u201cThey distance themselves from world events. It\u2019s appalling stuff, but it\u2019s out there.\u201d\nBy all accounts, those anxiety levels should be at an all-time high. The act of traveling itself is more stressful and annoying than ever, surveys suggest, with the initial hours of an international trip already providing a harrowing journey of lengthy security checks, grumpy attendants, overbooked flights and frequent delays.\n\u201cMost of it is quite unpleasant,\u201d Mr. Bor said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously coping and managing that experience. We\u2019re adapting.\u201d\nData shows that the international travel phenomenon is not limited to one region or one sector. Despite new communication technologies and tight budgets, global business travel spending is expected to hit a record $1.18 trillion in 2014, a 6.9 percent increase from 2013, according to Global Business Travel Association. \nOver all, the Americas, Europe and Asia all reported increases in arrivals of 5 percent to 8 percent over the previous year, according to World Tourism Organization data. \nThe biggest increases in visitors were in Southeast Asia and Northern Europe, but travelers did not completely avoid hot spots. More than 160,000 people visited Israel as tourists in August, according to government data \u2014 a 32 percent decline from a year earlier, but still a sizable group of travelers who were willing to ignore the recent violence in Gaza.\nPim Ruig, a travel consultant in Los Angeles, booked a couple this year for a honeymoon in Thailand, shortly before a military coup there in May. She offered to cancel the trip, but the couple stuck to their plan. \u201cThey were \u2018We\u2019re 100 percent going,\u201d\u2019 said Ms. Ruig, who was born in Thailand.\nMs. Ruig finds clients receptive to detailed information from her friends and relatives in Thailand, offering the pros and cons of the situation. Clients \u201care totally willing to listen,\u201d Ms. Ruig said. \u201cThey are dying to go. They want to see something exotic.\u201d \nThis streak of independence is part of a well-documented shift taking place in travel habits, as people look for a different type of experience, something beyond the mass tourist destinations, said Douglas Quinby, director of research for PhoCusWright, a market research firm that tracks the travel industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just travelers who want to see Paris,\u201d Mr. Quinby said. \u201cThey want to have a different type of experience than the bus tours their parents took.\u201d\nLudmila Yamalova-Davis, 39, who was born in the Soviet Union, grew up in the United States and now is based in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, has vacationed in Iran, Thailand and Bangladesh in recent years with her husband, Glen. Traditional destinations no longer interest her.\n\u201cThe whole draw is not staying at another nice hotel or eating at another nice restaurant,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole attraction of travel is to experience something different.\u201d\nMs. Yamalova-Davis has traveled to remote regions in Pakistan and braved tensions to explore old villages in northwest and central Iran in search of what she calls \u201cauthentic\u201d destinations, untouched by Starbucks franchises and other Western influences. \u201cThey\u2019re getting harder to find,\u201d she added.\nAt a certain point, the rewards of travel outweigh the risks for many people, experts say. Travelers want to take the trip; they need to take the trip.\n\u201cWe are wired to be explorers,\u201d said Dr. Alice Boyes, a Las Vegas-based author who writes about anxiety. \u201cThe broader goals are more important than the anxiety. People manage anxiety with the purpose of the trip.\u201d\nEfforts to determine the actual benefits of travel have produced volumes of research papers and debate, but few specific answers. Some studies suggest the benefits of travel are not necessarily long lasting. Like an adrenaline rush, the relaxation of the trip quickly fades.\nBut there are long term effects, the ability to break away from daily life and experience new cultures, that are harder to measure.\n\u201cThe thing that does last is the memories, the experiences, the emotional development,\u201d said Ms. Iljon-Foreman, the clinical psychologist. \u201cMemories are building up and are a quality that lasts.\u201d\nTravel industry executives fear that the patience of the resilient traveler may be tested further and numbers could start to decline.\n\u201cThe risks that could derail this trajectory\u201d cannot be ignored, International Air Transport Association said in its recent report. \u201cThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa, weakness in the eurozone, hostilities in Eastern Ukraine and instability in the Middle East loom large.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s not going to stop Mr. Brown, who says the compulsion to travel is in his blood.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s innate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you either are born with it or you learn it at an early age.

Germany generates as much electricity as two nuclear power plants with the gas produced by decaying plant matter and animal slurry. Near San Francisco, a landfill extracts enough energy from its stewing garbage to power 300 trucks on their daily runs.\nAround the world, both household-run operations and industrial-scale facilities are using centuries-old technology to extract a fuel known as biogas from crop waste, manure, kitchen scraps and even sewage.\nProponents cite the multiple benefits of harnessing biogas, such as reducing emissions of the powerful climate-warming gas methane, cutting waste streams and saving the lungs of those in poor countries who would otherwise burn wood or other smoky fuels indoors. After biogas is extracted from organic material, a rich fertilizer remains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially the lowest technology on the planet, but it really works well. Long term, it is going to come, and it\u2019s going to be big,\u201d said Chris Somerville, director of the Energy Biosciences Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s very inexpensive.\u201d\nHistorians say the Assyrians may have used biogas to heat bath water, and Marco Polo noted in the 13th century that the Chinese extracted energy from covered sewage pots. Gas from sewage treatment powered some English streetlights in the 1890s.\nWhen organic matter \u2014 anything from kitchen scraps and farm cuttings to sewage and manure \u2014 decays with no oxygen present, either in nature or under controlled conditions in a sealed tank, it ferments, emitting methane and carbon dioxide. That mixture, if released, is a potent contributor to climate change. But if it is burned instead, it creates energy, just like natural gas.\nIn recent years, significant growth in biogas use has come mainly in countries where governments, seeking new clean energy sources and other benefits, like a reliable, domestic supply of gas, have offered financial incentives and logistical support. With Germany and China, both major biogas users, now pulling back or refocusing efforts, though, continued expansion is not a sure thing.\nGermany, a world biogas leader, encouraged the fuel\u2019s greater use as part of a huge national effort to shift to renewable energy. Since 2000, the government has offered guaranteed payments to facilities feeding clean power, from biogas and other sources, into electricity grids.\nNow, nearly 8,000 biogas plants process specially grown crops, animal slurry, and agricultural plant waste, combusting the resulting gas to generate electricity, and also capturing and distributing heat. Some purify the gas into biomethane, which has the same chemical makeup as natural gas, and pump it into gas distribution grids, to be used by households or at filling stations for vehicles equipped to run on compressed natural gas. Revenue from that energy production has become a steady income source for many farmers.\nAny fuel that can replace natural gas is particularly appealing for Germany, which is increasingly nervous about its dependence on Russia for its supplies. And burning gas of any kind for power is useful as the country seeks to increase the share of electricity provided by solar and wind, whose unpredictability can be a problem.\n\u201cWe have a lot of peaks and valleys,\u201d said Manuel Maciejczyk, a general manager of the 4,800-member German Biogas Association. Gas-fired plants \u201care able to start and stop their production when there is demand for electricity.\u201d Officials are encouraging biogas producers to expand storage and increase power capacity so they will be better able to shoulder that backup role, he said.\nBiogas now provides 4.6 percent of Germany\u2019s electricity, Mr. Maciejczyk said. In August, though, the government, struggling with rising electricity costs, modified the rules governing the sector and cut the rate guaranteed to larger producers, moves that Mr. Maciejczyk said would hit the industry hard. German manufacturers are now looking to the export market, hoping to build biogas plants in countries like France, Brazil, Thailand and China, he said.\nChina, scrambling to meet exploding energy demand, relies on biogas for about 10 percent of its total natural gas use, said Xia Zuzhang, an energy access specialist for the Asian Development Bank, citing official figures.\nBeijing started promoting the use of basic, backyard biogas production for rural families in the 1930s, said Mr. Xia, author of a report on Chinese biogas published by the International Institute for Environment and Development in London.\nOfficials saw the sealed tanks, known as digesters, as a way to improve sanitation, provide energy to rural dwellers and reduce breathing problems caused by burning wood and dung indoors.\nFor households with a farm animal or two, the combination of manure, human waste and plant material is enough to create a steady supply of clean-burning cooking gas, usually via a pipe that runs directly into the kitchen.\nMore than 42 million Chinese households currently have such setups, Mr. Xia said. But officials have slowed efforts to add more home-based digesters, as rural residents have migrated to cities, electrification has reached almost everywhere and village markets sell alternative fuels like propane, he said.\nNow China is more focused on bringing biogas production to the industrial-scale cattle, pig and chicken farms whose effluent waste poisons land and rivers. \u201cThere are tens of thousands of units under operation on large farms,\u201d Mr. Xia said. \u201cPeople eat a lot of meat, so the amount of animal waste is very huge, so these biogas plants are not enough.\u201d\nHe said that many were poorly run, and that officials should push to improve existing operations before adding more.\nNepal, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Cambodia make more limited use of small-scale digesters, as do African countries including Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Uganda and Kenya, Mr. Xia said. Feedstocks can include farm waste like the husks left over after rice is milled.\nThe United States is also exploring the use of biogas, though natural gas prices depressed by the shale gas boom make it harder for the fuel to compete on cost.\nIn Brooklyn, the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant mixes food waste with sludge to generate biogas, and it plans to starts purifying the fuel so it can be pumped into New York\u2019s natural gas grid. National Grid, the company managing the purification facility, says it will be ready in 2016 and could provide enough gas to heat 5,200 homes.\nNational Grid, which supplies natural gas for New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, said that, with $7 billion in infrastructure investment, biogas could supply a quarter of those states\u2019 natural gas demand, excluding that used by power plants. Doing so would have the same climate benefit as taking three million cars off the road, the company said.\nLandfills, where decaying garbage emits methane, are another source. More than 600 American landfills capture that pollutant and use it to produce energy, the Environmental Protection Agency reports. At the Altamont Landfill, east of San Francisco, for example, the gas is converted into a liquid that fuels 300 garbage trucks. Dairy farms are also big methane emitters, and therefore a major potential biogas contributor.\nThere is talk in the United States of creating a network of natural gas filling stations for trucks, infrastructure that could easily be used for biogas as well. \u201cIf the fracking boom can pay for that,\u201d said Heather Youngs, a senior fellow at the Berkeley Energy and Climate Institute, \u201cbiogas can inherit that and green it.\u201d"}, {"text": "A New Band of Fashion Brothers\n2014-10-15T22:05:55.000Z\nEver since Henry Sands Brooks bequeathed his Manhattan clothing store to his sons, who renamed it Brooks Brothers in 1850, the label seemed to have a lock on men\u2019s wear brands started by brothers. Until now.\nA new band of fashion brothers is emerging from the halls of Parsons, Montreal showrooms and less formal training grounds, and staking a claim in the growing men\u2019s luxury fashion market.\nFrom Brooklyn, Ariel and Shimon Ovadia followed their father into the garment business with a line of preppy men\u2019s wear called Ovadia & Sons sold at high-end retailers like Barneys and Mr Porter. Likewise, Sammy and Liam Fayed, whose father owns a famed British shirtmaker, are behind Bespoken, an upscale outfitter with a downtown outlook, which is based on the Upper East Side.\nNot everyone was born into fashion. Matthew and Alex Orley grew up in Michigan, where their parents were in manufacturing and real estate, but they were entranced by men\u2019s apparel at a young age and started their luxe knitwear brand, Orley, with the help of younger siblings. And the Canadian brothers who started Want Les Essentiels de la Vie were marketing executives before they were designers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively nascent movement in American fashion,\u201d said Bruce Pask, formerly the men\u2019s fashion director at T: The New York Times Style Magazine and now the men\u2019s fashion director at Bergdorf Goodman. Unlike in Italy, where major brands like Armani, Etro, Ferragamo and Missoni are owned and operated by generations of families, he said, North American fashion brands are comparatively younger and have not traditionally mixed business and family.\n\u201cMost of the brands are young or emerging designers, and I think that the fashion business in general requires such a broad skill set \u2014 a designer has got to function as creative director, business manager, publicist \u2014 it just makes sense for a familial or sibling partnership,\u201d Mr. Pask added. \u201cBeyond that, you have these other intangibles that family members hopefully innately provide: emotional support and encouragement.

After high school, they worked full time with their dad, who was by then licensing his children\u2019s clothes to giant retailers like Walmart. A chance meeting with Ralph Lauren in 2009 at his East Hampton store, however, inspired the brothers to dream bigger and start their own line.\nThe Ovadia brothers began by dissecting the shirts they owned and obsessing over details like collar width and sleeve length. \u201cEven the buttons we use are not what you would normally find,\u201d Shimon said. \u201cWe use enamel instead of horn.\u201d\nTheir first collection came out in 2010 and generated strong buzz among men\u2019s fashion blogs.

During high school, they worked at competing clothing stores in Franklin, Mich., an affluent suburb of Detroit. While both were at New York University, they interned at different labels, including Rag & Bone.\nBut after Alex graduated from Parsons the New School for Design in 2011, the brothers decided to form their own knitwear label, Orley. \u201cWe always wanted to work together,\u201d Alex said. \u201cWe both were interested in creative fields and how that manifests in something physical.\u201d\nWith financial help from two younger siblings, the brothers released their first collection in 2012, including a red crew-neck sweater with a tie-dye swirl. Fashion blogs picked up the brash designs, as did boutiques like Fivestory in New York and Union in Los Angeles. The next season, Orley had an order from Bergdorf and was a finalist in the Vogue/CFDA Fashion Fund.\nMatthew, 28, oversees the business end, calling Italian factories at 4 a.m., while Alex, 27, does the sketching. And when the brothers disagree, Matthew\u2019s wife, Samantha, who is the label\u2019s third partner, steps in. \u201cSam is the tiebreaker,\u201d Alex said. \u201cThankfully, she takes my side just as much as she takes Matthew\u2019s.

They ironed their collared shirts, knotted their ties and piled into their cars. Their destination was the Islamic Center of San Diego, where they were to be initiated into the country\u2019s first Muslim fraternity, Alpha Lambda Mu, named for three letters that start several chapters of the Quran: Alif Laam Meem.\nAfter the morning prayer, Fajr, the 13 pledges recited a passage from the Quran, then listened attentively as their adviser applied the Islamic values of loyalty, sincerity and brotherly forgiveness to daily life on campus. Finally, the young men pronounced their goals for the coming semester: Rumzi Khan, a computer science major who founded the chapter, vowed to pray more. Several science majors promised to double down on their studying. Samer Abusaleh, a junior in economics, pledged to be more consistent with his Quran reading. He also wanted to work on his six-pack, and not the kind usually associated with Greeks. There was nothing typical about this initiation, which ended over plates of carrot cake pancakes and huevos rancheros at a 1950s-style pancake house. No beer pong. No hazing. None of the raucousness that characterizes frat life.\nAlpha Lambda Mu was founded just a year ago by Ali Mahmoud, a junior biology and sociology major at the University of Texas, Dallas, as a national fraternity for Muslim college students. Mr. Mahmoud, who is seeking university recognition and a house for his chapter, hosted the first formal rush this fall: 40 students showed up, and half were offered bids. A total of 24 members now make up the Texas chapter.\nMr. Mahmoud, whose parents emigrated from Egypt before he was born, says he founded the frat to offer Muslim students the chance to express both sides of their identity, the American and the Muslim, at a time when \u201cmore and more of us identify strongly with both.\u201d\nThe directive is for spiritual students to have more fun, and convivial ones to incorporate more spirituality in their lives. Mr. Mahmoud\u2019s guidebook stipulates that chapters organize events every semester. Some are to be purely social, others to teach life skills, encourage volunteer work and enrich members with Islamic culture.\nAnd so the Texas chapter set off in November on a wilderness retreat, with canoeing and cozy campfires on which to roast halal marshmallows, and an imam for lectures and prayers. The new Cornell chapter, which has eight members, threw an all-night party in November. In accordance with Islamic teachings, it was alcohol-free and men only (although chapters are permitted to hold some coed social events, like movie screenings). Two dozen attended the party. They prayed together, downed pizza, played games and crashed in sleeping bags on the floor of the event room the university had lent them.\nMembers of the San Diego chapter, which started up in the fall, have visited a Halloween haunted house, learned to change a tire, spent a morning plucking debris from a beach in La Jolla and handed out water bottles to the homeless. The members meet twice a month in one another\u2019s apartments to discuss spiritual texts, and they try to gather for at least one of the day\u2019s five calls to prayer. (Mr. Khan had scheduled the chapter\u2019s weekly meeting for 6 a.m. to coordinate with Fajr, but after much griping he moved it to 9 p.m.)\nThe San Diego chapter, whose members are majoring in intense science, business or tech fields, has already lost four pledges, casualties of part-time jobs and grueling study schedules. Nadir Masood, a senior economics major from the San Francisco Bay Area, had been excited about the fraternity at first. But a 20-hour-a-week job at a clothing store and three high-level classes \u2014 two in chemistry \u2014 gave him little time for sleep, let alone socializing. \u201cIt was a good idea, a good concept to bring the brothers together,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I just didn\u2019t have time.\u201d\nStill, the idea is gaining traction. Students at Penn State, San Diego State and the University of Florida are hoping to start chapters in the fall.\nWITH YOUNG MUSLIMS demanding support, acceptance and greater understanding of a culture that many Americans seem to know little about, the arrival of Alpha Lambda Mu may be less an anomaly than a sign of the times. Researchers who study the ebb and flow of immigrant assimilation say that recent interest in a fraternal identity makes a kind of symmetrical sense.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised it took this long,\u201d said Brian Calfano, an associate professor of political science at Missouri State University who has conducted extensive research on Islamic and American identities. \u201cThe fraternity itself is a hallmark of the modern American college experience,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, these students are saying: \u2018We want to live out our identity. We want to be protected within our group. But we also want to exercise our capacity to enjoy our college life.\u2019\u201d\nSometimes referred to as the post-9/11 generation, Muslim-American college students say they have long struggled with the prejudices and suspicions that have come with the West\u2019s unsettled relationship with the Arab world. This has led them to explore more thoroughly their dual identity, and to strive to show the world who they are and how they want to be perceived, said Lori Peek, the author of \u201cBehind the Backlash: Muslim Americans After 9/11.\u201d \u201cThe formation of a fraternity represents a really thoughtful reflection on their part,\u201d Dr. Peek said. \u201cIt moves these students out of the private sphere and into a more public space where they are effectively spanning two cultures.\u201d\nTwo reports by the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies indicate that an evolution has indeed occurred. In 2009, 40 percent of Muslim Americans ages 18 to 29 said they were thriving, the lowest percentage in that age group. By 2011, 10 years after the terrorist attacks, that number had risen to 65 percent.\nAlpha Lambda Mu, or Alif Laam Meem, was founded a year ago as a national fraternity for Muslim students, with the first chapter at the University of Texas, Dallas.\nAlpha Lambda Mu, or Alif Laam Meem, was founded a year ago as a national fraternity for Muslim students, with the first chapter at the University of Texas, Dallas.\nThe Dallas chapter held its first formal rush this fall.

The fraternity directive is to combine the spiritual with the social.\nMr. Mahmoud\u2019s guidebook stipulates that chapters organize events every semester. Some are to be social, others to teach life skills and enrich members with Islamic culture. During Rush Week, Texas pledges and members gathered for S\u2019mores and a group talk about the quest for American-Muslim identity.\nPledges who were extended an invitation into the fraternity gathered with members for sushi in Frisco, Tex.\nPledges at the University of California, San Diego, chapter of\u00a0Alpha Lambda Mu went through their initiation ceremony at the Islamic Center of San Diego this past fall.\nNadir Masood and Quazi Afsar Hossain prayed inside the Islamic Center of San Diego on the group\u2019s initiation day. Members try to gather for at least one of the day\u2019s five calls to prayer.\nMembers waited for a table at Snooze, a restaurant in San Diego\u2019s Hillcrest neighborhood, after undergoing their initiation ceremony.\nThe hope is that Alpha Lambda Mu will serve as a networking tool, helping members land jobs, secure promotions and stay connected well past graduation, in the way traditional fraternities support and assist their alumni.\nA member read a prayer off a cellphone. San Diego members meet twice a month in their apartments to discuss spiritual texts.\nOnly 1.4 percent of American college freshmen are Muslim, according to a Higher Education Research Institute survey in 2012, up from 0.9 percent in 2005. But with growing interest in Islam, more campuses are providing prayer spaces and cultural centers. In 1999, Georgetown became the first university to hire a full-time imam. In recent years, Yale, Princeton and Northwestern have brought in Muslim chaplains.\nThe Muslim Student Association, founded in 1963, is the voice of this movement and now has more than 200 affiliated chapters in the United States. It has pushed for greater awareness about Islamic culture and helps members procure scholarships and internships. The group has generated controversy as well. The chapter at the University of California, Irvine, was suspended for the 2010 fall semester after members protested a campus speech by the ambassador to Israel. And in 2012 the organization made headlines, and elicited sympathy, amid reports that the New York City Police Department had surreptitiously monitored chapters at Yale, Columbia and other East Coast campuses.\nFraternity organizers have close ties to their M.S.A. chapters. But Alif Laam Meem, they say, is not political. \u201cThis is about having a strong bond with people,\u201d said Hares Sadat, the San Diego frat\u2019s adviser. \u201cI think that\u2019s the difference.\u201d\nMR. KHAN AND THE PLEDGES recently gathered at a frozen yogurt shop a few minutes from campus. In sweatpants, hoodies and sneakers, they talked about why the fraternity idea appealed to them and about \u201csahaba,\u201d the Arabic word for companions.\n\u201cCompanions are very valuable in Islam,\u201d said Haroon Masood, who is majoring in neuroscience and physiology. \u201cThey keep you in check. We believe your character is strongly influenced by who you hang out with.\u201d\nShortly after arriving at college, Mr. Masood, who is Pakistani-American, said he realized how tricky it was to navigate the campus social scene and still stay faithful to his Islamic roots. Not only were fraternities out, but most parties, too, because so many of them included drinking, which is prohibited by his religion. At the onset of his freshman year, Siyam Hossain, a Bangladeshi-American majoring in economics, found himself playing the dreary role of \u201cD.D.,\u201d or designated driver, babysitting drunken friends. \u201cI was with my non-Muslim friends and I had to automatically take the role,\u201d he said.\nMr. Khan found himself in that position one freshman weekend, too, tending to an inebriated roommate for hours. \u201cHe was in the bathroom yelling, \u2018Rumzi, save me,\u2019\u201d he said. The next weekend, Mr. Khan decided to turn Friday and Saturday nights into his gym time.\nChallenging them further,the pledges say, is the need to constantly explain to other students what they can and cannot do, the no-drinking, the no-pork, the fasting and the praying. \u201cYou can feel like maybe they are judging you,\u201d Mr. Hossain said. \u201cAnd they feel like maybe you are judging them.\u201d\nAnd then there are the deeper reasons for wanting to bond. The pledges share a collective understanding of what it means to straddle cultures. They easily switch in conversation from Xbox games and 49ers football to the importance of praying and challenges of fasting during Ramadan on a campus brimming with fast-food outlets.

Malaysia, his final destination, was tantalizingly close.\nBut under the towering trees of a rubber plantation, the smuggler who had brought Abdul Musid, a 30-year-old from Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya Muslim minority, this far made a new demand: Pay more or be left behind. When Mr. Musid pleaded that he had no more money, the smuggler kicked him in the groin and left him for dead.\nA villager found Mr. Musid and brought him to the hospital here for treatment, doctors said, after the other captives in the smugglers\u2019 camp, also Rohingya men from Myanmar, fled with their jailers before a raid by the Thai authorities.\nViolence by the Rakhine ethnic group, driven by an extreme Buddhist ideology, has led tens of thousands of Rohingya to flee in the last 18 months through smuggling rings that pledge to take them to Malaysia, a Muslim country that quietly accepts the desperate newcomers.\nThailand is the way station where the Rohingya, denied citizenship in Myanmar by national law, arrive on fishing boats converted to human cargo vessels. If they have money to pay unscrupulous brokers, they leave quickly for neighboring Malaysia.\nBut those who cannot afford to pay languish in smugglers\u2019 camps hidden in the jungle across southern Thailand, or in the abysmal detention cells of the Thai immigration authorities.\nDespite Thailand\u2019s long history of absorbing refugees from conflicts in nearby countries like Vietnam and Cambodia, as well as members of other ethnic groups from Myanmar, the country has declined to grant the Rohingya temporary shelter or basic services. The government refuses to assess their requests for asylum, human rights groups say, instead subjecting them to detention so harsh that some die in custody. Arguments by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that Thailand should treat the Rohingya like other refugees have failed to convince the Thai government, the agency said.\nInstead, the government has authorized what it calls \u201csoft\u201d deportation of the Rohingya: moving them out of detention cells, placing them in wooden boats at the southern port of Ranong, and sending them out into the Andaman Sea. There, they are picked up again by smugglers who, human rights groups charge, are often in league with Thai officials. Those who cannot pay ransom for passage to Malaysia are finally forced into indentured servitude on Thai plantations and fishing vessels, rights groups say.\nThe Thai government would like Myanmar to accept the Rohingya as citizens, said Maj. Gen. Thatchai Pitaneelaboot, the commander of immigration in Songkhla, in southern Thailand, whose detention cells are filled with the refugees. Barring that, he said, \u201cthey come here illegally, without permission, and we have to deport them.\u201d\nA Merciless Journey\nMany Rohingya, having lost their livelihoods in the violent attacks on their communities, feel they have little choice but to flee Myanmar, formerly Burma. They are easy prey for the well-oiled smuggling networks run by Thais, Malaysians and the Rohingya themselves, some of whom start the smuggling chain in the villages and displaced camps of Rakhine, the northern state where most of the 1.3 million Rohingya in Myanmar live.\nMore than 2,000 Rohingya are believed to be missing at sea, presumed drowned, since June 2012, when the violence against them first erupted in Rakhine, said Chris Lewa, coordinator of the Arakan Project, a human rights group specializing in the Rohingya. In all, about 80,000 Rohingya have left Myanmar by sea since then, Ms. Lewa said.\nThe people who perish in the camps are usually those unable to pay the brokers who demand $2,000 for their release to Malaysia, Thai immigration officials said.\nDesperation drives the Rohingya to flee Myanmar, but the perilous journey leaves many in equally dire straits. Increasing numbers have arrived in Malaysia with paralysis caused by chronic malnutrition and physical abuse during long confinement in the smugglers\u2019 camps in Thailand, according to the United Nations refugee agency in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital.\nIn an interview at the hospital where he was recovering from his wounds, Mr. Musid said he left Myanmar after Rakhine Buddhists seized his farmland and he struggled to make ends meet as a fisherman. Two Rohingya brokers persuaded him that life was better in Malaysia and said that for $600, they would get him there.\nHe had no hope of raising such a large sum, but with a down payment of $35, he agreed to a deal that would allow him to pay the rest of the money once he got work in Malaysia.\nSoon after, he boarded a small wooden craft that took him and many others to a trawler waiting in international waters off the coast of Bangladesh.\nAfter five days at sea with little water or food, the boat landed somewhere on the southern coast of Thailand. The group spent two days or so in a makeshift jungle camp, and then Mr. Musid was crammed with about 20 men into the back of a pickup truck.\nWhen the road trip ended near the Malaysian border about 10 hours later, he said, five of the men, so weakened by the hardships of the previous weeks, were dead.\nHe was then detained in a warehouse with other Rohingya as brokers badgered him for money for the final leg of the trip to Malaysia, despite the deal he had struck to pay once he arrived. He told them he had no money and no relatives who could send any.\nAs the camp was hastily disbanding, Mr. Musid said, his handler again demanded money and handed him a cellphone to call someone in Malaysia.\nWhen Mr. Musid said he did not have anyone to call, the smuggler attacked him. The wound to his groin was so deep it became severely infected after he was left on the jungle floor, said Dr. Bancha Thiptirapong, who treated him at the hospital.\nOthers did not survive the ordeal. In the village of Chalung near here, five men were recently buried in unmarked graves. Their deaths were caused by sepsis, hospital certificates said, diagnosed after they were found abandoned, the most able-bodied Rohingya having left a smugglers\u2019 camp.\nNo Good Choices\nEmbarrassed by deaths in the camps and reports of officials\u2019 selling Rohingya from immigration centers into smuggling rings, the Thai immigration authorities recently invited reporters to inspect camps that officers had raided, visits designed to show that Thailand was acting against the smugglers.\nOn sloping ground amid a plantation near Songkhla, on the border with Malaysia, 531 Rohingya had been kept like animals in open-air pens made from wooden poles lashed together with bicycle chains.\nIslamic head caps, scraps of tarpaulin, a broken flashlight and scattered rice grains near the ashes of a fire attested to the grim makings of the camp. A raised wooden platform served as a jerry-built watchtower from which overseers had monitored the inmates, each worth thousands of dollars either in ransom for their freedom or as indentured laborers.\nIt was from a camp like this in southern Thailand that Fortify Rights, a human rights organization that researches ethnic groups in Myanmar, recorded a conversation between a Rohingya broker, his two Rohingya captives and a Rohingya businessman in Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar, who was trying to secure the freedom of the captives, his nephews.\nIn the conversation, the man in Yangon, who used the alias Khin Maung Win and agreed to be recorded in December by Fortify Rights as a way to expose the smuggling, first chided his nephews.\n\u201cI tried to stop you many times, to tell you not to leave this way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are lucky you didn\u2019t drown in the sea. Ninety percent of the people died in the sea.\u201d\nHe then haggled over the price of freedom for the young men, Ula Mya and Foyas, offering to pay 10,000 Malaysian ringgits, about $3,000, instead of the asking price of 13,000 ringgits.\nThe broker refused. \u201cThe Thai boss bought them from Thai immigration,\u201d he said.\nLater, in a telephone interview arranged by Fortify Rights, Khin Maung Win said that he had wired the 13,000 ringgits to a Malaysian bank account and that his nephews were now in Malaysia, where Foyas works on a construction site.\nFrom Malaysia, Foyas said in a telephone interview that he had spent six months in an immigration detention cell near the border before being handed over to the smugglers\u2019 camp from which his uncle bought him and Ula Mya their freedom.\nLife in the camp was terrifying and the two meals a day scanty, he said, adding that the smugglers had punished a man who tried to escape by amputating four fingers on his right hand.\nAsked about the charge that Thai immigration officials had sold Foyas and Ula Mya to smugglers, General Thatchai, who was installed as commissioner of immigration in Songkhla five months ago as a new face, said he would investigate. \u201cIf I find any officer involved in the smuggling, I will punish him,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough evidence, only rumor.\u201d\nSugarcoated Deportation\nAt the port of Ranong this month, General Thatchai organized a \u201csoft\u201d deportation intended to show that while Thailand was acting in its own interests by not keeping the Rohingya for long periods, it was not sending them back to Myanmar, where they would be persecuted.\nSeventy Rohingya, wearing orange life jackets issued by the Thai authorities, were loaded onto three small wooden boats at a jetty just three miles from Myanmar, on the other side of the water.\nOne of the men wiped away tears as he boarded, clutching a cellophane-wrapped pack of noodles and palm sugar and about $7 in Thai currency, a parting gift from the Thais. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where we are going,\u201d one said.\nThe boats set off in the afternoon light, and when the cameras turned away, the Rohingya looked tense and afraid.\nIn this case, they would land in a remote Myanmar fishing village away from government authorities, but in a zone patrolled by smugglers. It was highly likely, General Thatchai said, that some would fall prey again. \u201cAbout 20 percent will be back with the smugglers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAbout 80 percent will be back with the smugglers,\u201d countered Chutima Sidasthian, a Thai journalist who writes frequently about the Rohingya for the online news agency Phuketwan.\nFive days later, five of the men sent off from Ranong were back with smugglers in Hat Yai, said Abdul Kalam, president of the Rohingya Association of Thailand, a group that provides social services.\nMr. Musid\u2019s future looked particularly bleak.\nAfter nine days in the hospital, immigration officers took him to the crowded detention center at Songkhla under General Thatchai\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cHe has no relatives in Malaysia,\u201d Mr. Kalam said. \u201cThere is nothing to do.\u201d\nThere was little doubt, said Matthew Smith, the executive director of Fortify Rights, that Mr. Musid would be taken from the detention cell and put through the \u201csoft\u201d deportation exercise.\nFrom there he would again be caught in a web of smugglers, who, when they discovered that Mr. Musid had no way to pay for his freedom, would resort to their final disposal tactic.\nThose without money are sold as cheap labor onto fishing boats that work the Gulf of Thailand, Mr. Smith said, a long, hard servitude that makes the dream of Malaysia ever more distant."}, {"text": "An Inaugural Pageantry, With Verse, Song and Surprise Meetings\n2014-01-02T04:06:38.000Z\nThere were grandmothers in fur coats, construction workers with gripes about low pay, and friends and former co-workers with memories of basketball games and protests.\nSome 1,300 guests as diverse as New York itself snaked through City Hall on Wednesday after Bill de Blasio was sworn in as the city\u2019s 109th mayor. Mr. de Blasio, basking in a symbol of what he promised would be an open government, greeted them for more than three hours, offering thanks, pictures, and a lot of hunched-over hugs.\nHe stood in the ornate Governor\u2019s Room, its walls lined with portraits of revered New York figures.\n\u201cAll of the paparazzi want to see you,\u201d he told a small girl with big red glasses who wished him a happy New Year.\n\u201cI can never underestimate how much you helped me,\u201d he told a pastor who had given him public-speaking tips during the campaign.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in this together,\u201d he said to a family from Brooklyn who had come for a picture with him.\nMr. de Blasio gave a particularly long embrace to Marcia Smith, his boss in the administration of David N.

Before long, he would be off to a more relaxing setting: Gracie Mansion, his new home, for a private party with his staff.\nFace to Face\nA familiar face greeted Mr. de Blasio and his family when their subway car pulled into the station across the street from City Hall: Michael R. Bloomberg, private citizen.\nBy chance, the they had arrived on the platform at the same time.\nThe mayor and his predecessor shook hands and embraced. \u201cHow does it feel to be a free man?\u201d Mr. de Blasio asked.\nMr. Bloomberg greeted Mr. de Blasio and his family, then turned back to the new mayor and offered a lesson, should he enjoy another inauguration someday: \u201cYou never forget your first one.\u201d\nWith that, Mr. Bloomberg was ready. \u201cO.K., what\u2019s now?\u201d he said to Diana Taylor, his longtime companion.\nThe former mayor turned, walked off, and left the de Blasios on the platform. \u2014 NATE SCHWEBER\nDe Blasio\u2019s Playlist\nAs Mr. de Blasio took the stage just before noon, a D.J. known as M.O.S., perched in a booth beside the City Hall stage, unfurled a fitting mix to welcome him: \u201cBoy From New York City,\u201d \u201cEmpire State of Mind,\u201d \u201cNative New Yorker.\u201d\nAnd \u201cRoar\u201d by Katy Perry.\n\u201cThis music,\u201d Representative Carolyn Maloney exclaimed happily before the ceremony. \u201cYou\u2019d never hear this with Giuliani or Bloomberg.\u201d\nAmong the crowd of lawmakers, power players and other ticketholders looking to keep warm, persistent toe-tapping, and even the occasional full body sway, could not be missed. There were songs decades old (\u201cGlory Days\u201d by Bruce Springsteen, \u201cOnce in a Lifetime\u201d by Talking Heads), relatively new (\u201cGet Lucky\u201d by Daft Punk, \u201cTreasure\u201d by Bruno Mars) and forever funky (\u201cI Wish\u201d by Stevie Wonder, \u201cBrick House\u201d by the Commodores).\nAs the assembled dignitaries greeted one another on stage \u2014 to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Way You Make Me Feel\u201d \u2014 Timothy Wilkins, 49, and Catherine Powell, 48, rose from their seats in a fit of gyrations. \u201cWe think this is de Blasio\u2019s personal playlist,\u201d said Mr. Wilkins, a fund-raiser for the mayor.\nThe D.J., whose name is Masud Semple, had performed at an event for Mr. de Blasio before the election. Mr. Semple, 34 and raised in Queens, said that while he had not been given instructions about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tastes, \u201cThe vibe and energy that I got from him and just hearing him speak, I kind of had an idea of the stuff he\u2019d probably like.\u201d \u2014 MATT FLEGENHEIMER\nDueling Brothers\nIt is not easy to win an election.

Stringer, the new comptroller, raised his left hand, his older son, Max \u2014 whom his wife, Elyse Buxbaum, was holding on her hip \u2014 squirmed and seemed to register a few inaudible objections. (His younger son, Miles, in a carrier on Ms. Buxbaum\u2019s chest, was more cooperative.)Mr. Stringer managed to get through his oath. Afterward, he joked of Max, \u201cHe\u2019s not quite ready for a television commercial yet, but we\u2019re working on it.\u201d \u2014 KATE TAYLOR\nBloomberg Off to the Side\nIt was supposed to be the glorious opening day of his post-mayoral life. But for Mr. Bloomberg, Wednesday was humbling and, frequently, unkind.\nNo longer the city\u2019s C.E.O., he was seated off to the side, overshadowed by bigger political celebrities (Bill Clinton), rising stars (Hillary Clinton) and higher office holders (Andrew M. Cuomo).\nPraise for him of any kind did not arrive until an hour into the ceremony.\nAnd speaker after speaker challenged his legacy, sometimes pointedly. In a stemwinder of an address, the incoming public advocate, Letitia James, took aim at the billionaire, demanding a city government \u201cthat cares more about a child going hungry than a new stadium or a new tax credit for a luxury development that a majority of New Yorkers can\u2019t afford.\u201d\nMr. Bloomberg sat unsmiling, his legs crossed, his fists clenched and his head occasionally drifting skyward.\nA golf-filled vacation to warmer, exotic locations beckoned and it was tempting to think that, in his mind anyway, he was already there. \u2014 MICHAEL BARBARO \nA Freshman Laureate\nAt many points during Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inauguration, the performers upstaged the politicians.\nPatina Miller, a star of the Broadway revival of \u201cPippin,\u201d sang a tender version of John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine,\u201d accompanied by a guitarist. Lissette Ortiz, a Bronx resident and a senior at Medgar Evers College, kept the audience rapt with her account, in English and Spanish, of moving to the Bronx from the Dominican Republic at 15.\nBut the most showstopping performance was that of Ramya Ramana, New York\u2019s Youth Poet Laureate.\nA freshman at St. John\u2019s University in Queens, Ms. Ramana evoked the inequality that Mr. de Blasio made his campaign theme.\n\u201cNew York City,\u201d she began. \u201cNot lights, not Broadway, not Times Square. It is single mother donating her last meals worth of money to church. It is the faith in the heart that makes a dead dream worth resurrecting. It is coffee-colored children playing hopscotch on what is left of a sidewalk. It is chalk outlined, colonized map on a street as dark as the bones of the dead.\u201d\nHer voice full of passion, her words turned from haunting to exuberant:\nThis city always will be the foundation of this country.\nWe are root. We are backbone. We brown, we black, we yellow, we white, we young;\nWe collage of creatures stomping to be reminded of the mammal in us.\nWe, chance. We deserve. Us opportunity.\nUs New Mayor. Us New beginning like dancing cocoons.\n\u2014 KATE TAYLOR"}, {"text": "The Immigrant Advantage\n2014-05-24T18:30:03.000Z\nIF you want to die a successful American, especially in the heartland, it helps to be born abroad.\nStatistics show that if you are born elsewhere and later acquire American citizenship, you will, on average, earn more than us native-borns, study further, marry at higher rates and divorce at lower rates, fall out of the work force less frequently and more easily dodge poverty.\nWhat\u2019s curious is where this immigrant advantage is most pronounced. In left-leaning, coastal, cosmopolitan America, native-borns seem well groomed by their families, schools and communities to keep up with foreign-borns. It\u2019s in the right-leaning \u201cWalmart America\u201d where foreigners have the greatest advantage.\nFrom Mississippi to West Virginia to Oklahoma, native-borns are struggling to flourish on a par with foreign-born Americans. In the 10 poorest states (just one on the East or West Coast: South Carolina), the median household of native-borns earns 84 cents for every $1 earned by a household of naturalized citizens, compared with 97 cents for native-borns in the richest (and mostly coastal) states, according to Census Bureau data. In the poorest states, foreign-borns are 24 percent less likely than native-borns to report themselves as divorced or separated, but just 3 percent less likely in the richest states. In the poorest states, foreign-borns are 36 percent less likely than native-borns to live in poverty; the disparity collapses to about half that in wealthier states like New Jersey and Connecticut.\nThis phenomenon came vividly to life for me while I was reporting a book about the brutal collision of a striving immigrant and a hurting native. One was Raisuddin Bhuiyan, a Muslim immigrant from Bangladesh, working in a Dallas minimart in 2001 to save for a wedding and an education; the other, Mark Stroman, shot him in a twisted post-9/11 revenge attack, blinding him in one eye, during a rampage that killed two other immigrant clerks. Mr. Bhuiyan eventually learned more about Mr. Stroman and the world that formed him. What he found astonished him, then inspired him to forgive his attacker and battle to rescue him from death row. \nMr. Bhuiyan realized that he was among the lucky Americans. Even after the attack, he was able to pick up and remake himself, climbing from that minimart to waiting tables at an Olive Garden to six-figure I.T. jobs. But Mr. Bhuiyan also saw the America that created Mr. Stroman, in which a battered working class was suffering from a dearth of work, community and hope, with many people failing to form strong bonds and filling the void with escapist chemicals, looping endlessly between prison and freedom.\nEventually, Mr. Bhuiyan petitioned a Texas court to spare his attacker\u2019s life because he had lacked his victim\u2019s advantages: a loving and sober family, pressure to strive and virtuous habits. The naturalized citizen claimed the native Texan hadn\u2019t had the same shot at the American dream as the \u201cforeigner\u201d he\u2019d tried to kill.\nAt a time when even the American middle class is struggling, a difficult question arises: Are you better off being born in some of the poorest parts of the world and moving here than being raised in the poorer parts of the United States?\nThere\u2019s no easy answer. But let\u2019s first acknowledge the obvious: Most naturalized citizens \u2014 nearly half of America\u2019s roughly 40 million immigrants \u2014 arrived by choice, found employer sponsors, navigated visas and green cards. (We\u2019re not talking here of immigrants who never reach citizenship and generally have harder lives than American citizens, native- or foreign-born.) It\u2019s no accident that our freshest citizens have pluck and wits that favor them later. \nBUT I also think there\u2019s something more complicated going on: In those places where mobility\u2019s engine is groaning and the social fabric is fraying, many immigrants may have an added edge because of their ability to straddle the seemingly contradictory values of their birthplaces and their adopted land, to balance individualism with community-mindedness and self-reliance with usage of the system.\nAmerican scholars have long warned of declining \u201csocial capital\u201d: simply put, people lacking the support of others. In Texas, I encountered the wasteland described by writers from Robert D. Putnam on the left to Charles Murray on the right. In mostly white, exurban communities that often see themselves as above the woes of inner cities, I found household after household where country music songs about family and church play but country-music values have fled: places where a rising generation is often being reared by grandparents because parents are addicted, imprisoned, broke or all three.\nIn places bedeviled by anomie, immigrants from more family-centered and collectivist societies \u2014 Mexico, India, Colombia, Vietnam, Haiti, China \u2014 often arrive with an advantageous blend of individualist and communitarian traits.\nI say a blend, because while they come from communal societies, they were deserters. They may have been raised with family-first values, but often they were the ones to leave aging parents. It can be a powerful cocktail: a self-willed drive for success and, leavening it somewhat, a sacrificial devotion to family and tribe. Many, even as their lives grow more independent, serve their family oceans away by sending remittances. \nMr. Bhuiyan seemed to embody this dualism. By back-home standards, he was a rugged individualist. But in America it was his takes-a-village embeddedness that enabled his revival: Immigrant friends gave him medicine, sofas to sleep on, free I.T. training and job referrals.\nWorking at Olive Garden, Mr. Bhuiyan couldn\u2019t believe how his colleagues lacked for support. Young women walked home alone, sometimes in 100-plus degree heat on highways, having no one to give them rides. Many colleagues lacked cars not because they couldn\u2019t afford the lease but because nobody would cosign it. \u201cI feel that, how come they have no one in their family \u2014 their dad, their uncle?\u201d he said. They told stories of chaotic childhoods that made them seek refuge in drugs and gangs.\nMr. Bhuiyan concluded that the autonomy for which he\u2019d come to America, while serving him well, failed others who had lacked his support since birth. His republic of self-making was their republic of self-destruction. \u201cHere we think freedom means whatever I wanna do, whatever I wanna say \u2014 that is freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the wrong definition.\u201d\nA second dimension of this in-between-ness involves the role of government. In this era of gridlock and austerity, many immigrants have the advantage of coming from places where bankrupt, do-nothing governments are no surprise. They often find themselves among Americans who are opposite-minded: leaning on the state for economic survival but socially lonesome, without community backup when that state fails.\nAll this has nothing to do with the superiority of values. If distrust of government made for the most successful societies, Nigeria and Argentina would be leaders of the pack. What\u2019s interesting about so many of America\u2019s immigrants is how they manage to plug instincts cultivated in other places into the system here. Many are trained in their homelands to behave as though the state will do nothing for them, and in America they reap the advantages of being self-starters. \nBut they also benefit from the systems and support that America does offer, which are inadequate as substitutes for initiative but are useful complements to it. \nLike many immigrants, Mr. Bhuiyan operated from the start like an economic loner, never expecting to get much from the government. He was willing to work at a gas station to save money. Recovering in his boss\u2019s home, he ordered I.T. textbooks online to improve his employability. Plunged into debt, he negotiated with doctors and hospitals to trim his bills. \nBut the system also worked for him. Robust laws prevented employers from exploiting a wide-eyed newcomer. He sued the Texas governor, in pursuit of leniency for his attacker, and was heard. Through a fund for crime victims, Texas eventually paid his medical bills.\nIn an age of inequality and shaky faith in the American promise of mobility through merit, we can learn from these experiences. Forget the overused idea popularized in self-help guides that native-borns must \u201cthink like an immigrant\u201d to prosper, an exhortation that ignores much history. Rather, the success of immigrants in the nation\u2019s hurting places reminds us that the American dream can still work, but it helps to have people to lean on. Many immigrants get that, because where they come from, people are all you have. They recognize that solitude is an extravagance.\nAmerican poverty is darkened by loneliness; poverty in so many poor countries I\u2019ve visited is brightened only by community. Helping people gain other people to lean on \u2014 not just offering cheaper health care and food stamps, tax cuts and charter schools \u2014 seems essential to making this American dream work as well for its perennial flowers as its freshest seeds.

So were nearly all of the 18 countries with fertility rates of five or more (the exceptions were Afghanistan and East Timor).\nSub-Saharan Africa also makes up a substantial portion of countries with estimated fertility rates between three and four: Notable exceptions include Iraq, Jordan, the Philippines and Guatemala. Fertility rates just under three were reported in countries like Pakistan, Egypt, Haiti, Honduras and Bolivia.\nTHIS is news to many people, and also a source of alarm, even hysteria \u2014 mostly in the West. In his book, \u201cWhat to Expect When No One\u2019s Expecting,\u201d Jonathan V. Last, a senior writer at The Weekly Standard, described a \u201ccoming demographic disaster\u201d from \u201cAmerica\u2019s baby bust.\u201d Steven Philip Kramer, a professor at the National Defense University, says rich countries with low fertility should adopt \u201cpronatalist\u201d policies to close \u201cthe baby gap\u201d and arrest a spiral of ever fewer workers supporting ever more retirees. Even the usually sober Economist recently warned about \u201cthe vanishing Japanese.\u201d\nThese dark prophecies have a long history, and they are as misguided as they are unoriginal. Theodore Roosevelt warned of Anglo-Saxon \u201crace suicide\u201d and, during the Depression, books like \u201cTwilight of Parenthood\u201d (1934) caught the Western public\u2019s imagination. After the powerful (and largely unanticipated) baby boom in the West, the chorus of calamity resumed. Dire Malthusian projections of mass starvation resulting from population growth outstripping the food supply \u2014 fear-mongering briefly revived after the end of the baby boom by Paul R. Ehrlich\u2019s 1968 book, \u201cThe Population Bomb\u201d \u2014 were discredited. But the march of fear continued, with evocatively titled books like \u201cThe Birth Dearth\u201d (1987) and \u201cThe Empty Cradle\u201d (2004).\nWhy do commentators, like Chicken Little, treat this worldwide trend as a disaster, even collective suicide? It could be because declines in fertility rates stir anxieties about power: national, military and economic, as well as sexual. Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 dystopian classic \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and the Mexican director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s 2006 film \u201cChildren of Men,\u201d based on the P. D. James novel, are among the more artful expressions of this anxiety.\nIn reality, slower population growth creates enormous possibilities for human flourishing. In an era of irreversible climate change and the lingering threat from nuclear weapons, it is simply not the case that population equals power, as so many leaders have believed throughout history. Lower fertility isn\u2019t entirely a function of rising prosperity and secularism; it is nearly universal.\nThe new hand-wringing stems from a gross misunderstanding of the glacial nature of population change.\nEven when the total fertility rate falls below 2.1 children, the \u201cmomentum\u201d effects of earlier fertility trends will keep a population growing for many decades. In cases when the absolute size of a national population declines, the drop often turns out to be short-lived, and in aggregate numbers usually is so slight as to be of little significance.\nTHERE are exceptions, of course. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russia experienced an unusual combination of rapid fertility decline to very low levels (falling to about 1.2 in 1999) coupled with remarkably high mortality for adult males \u2014 the latter largely attributable to alcohol abuse. This singular combination did produce a modest, and widely reported, decline in the Russian population. The Russian fertility rate has rebounded to just over 1.6, and mortality among working-age men has declined, perhaps because of concerted alcohol-regulation measures.\nIn nearly all countries that are not desperately poor, women of childbearing age inevitably compare the burdens of bearing children against the potential rewards. And in many of these countries, young women especially, but also young men, increasingly see marriage and childbearing as major risks, given high divorce rates and the responsibility to support aging parents, who are enjoying longer lives. The task of assessing these risks is heaviest for young adults (ages 20 to 35), who happen to be the same people who produce the most births in all societies. In Brazil, Italy, Turkey and the United States, these young adults must prepare for careers that now require extended years of higher education and, often, high levels of debt. Even with college degrees, employment is uncertain and career paths are increasingly unstable.\nMeanwhile, dual-earner partnerships have become essential, in countries rich and poor alike, even as earnings have become increasingly precarious. High home prices and rents, along with limited access to mortgages, have restricted the ability to create the independent homes typically considered essential for new families.\nRapidly declining fertility \u2014 especially if rates go very low \u2014 does pose challenges. Yet it also can provide substantial benefits that have received less attention.\nFirst, as noted, fertility decline is associated nearly everywhere with greater rights and opportunities for women. The deferral of marriage and the reduction of births to two, one or none across so much of the world \u2014 and, again, in countries that are still far from rich \u2014 are broadly consistent with the higher educational attainment and career aspirations of young women. It is no surprise that the hand-wringers over fertility decline are usually men.\nSecond, the work forces of societies with low-to-moderate fertility rates often achieve higher levels of productivity than do higher fertility societies. This is one reason China\u2019s economic growth far outstripped India\u2019s from 1970 to 2010 \u2014 a period when fertility declined rapidly in China (though only partly because of the one-child policy, now being relaxed) but did not decline as much in most of India.\nSubstantial fertility declines in southern India, notably in the state of Kerala, have been associated with significant economic and educational gains. It is not hard to figure out why. Children, teenagers and young adults are generally less productive than middle-aged workers with more experience, especially as employment in services rises and physical labor in agriculture and industry declines.\nThe fewer children who need primary and secondary education, the more resources there are that can be invested in higher-quality education per child \u2014 especially crucial for younger children \u2014 and in expanding access to higher and continuing education for teenagers and young adults.\nAlthough China, in the early stages of its economic rise, benefited by tapping into a large pool of rural migrants moving to low-wage manufacturing jobs in towns and cities, the country is clearly trying to move rapidly (perhaps too rapidly) toward mass higher education, from which it anticipates rising productivity from a slower-growing but higher-paid work force.\nThird, by enhancing the employment and career experiences of young adults, lower fertility can also bring about greater social and political stability. High-fertility societies commonly produce large numbers of young adults who have trouble finding productive employment \u2014 many experts have attributed everything from terrorism to the Arab Spring to this \u201cyouthquake\u201d of disaffected young adults in the Middle East and North Africa \u2014 but this begins to change 20 to 30 years after fertility rates start to decline.\nBy then, young adults are no longer in great surplus relative to labor market demand; their relative economic value for employers begins to rise and their economic and career prospects improve. Over time, this should facilitate marriage and family formation.\nIt\u2019s true that in the United States \u2014 the world\u2019s largest economy for more than a century \u2014 younger workers face significant employment and career problems, which may partly be because of older workers\u2019 holding on to their jobs. The labor-force participation rate among older workers, especially older men, has increased over the last decade (but represents only a recent reversal). Indeed, the uptick may have something to do with improved health and productivity of older workers; the rise of service industries and the decline of manual-labor occupations; gradual but small increases in the Social Security retirement age; and the destructive effects of the financial crisis on the housing and retirement assets of many baby boomers. One cannot extrapolate a long-term trend from the last six years.\nFinally, lower fertility rates may gradually reduce the incentives that have led a surprisingly large number of governments to encourage the emigration of their own young citizens, both to find work and send home hard-currency savings, as well as to remove them from potential political activism at home.\nSUCH policies \u2014 sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit, but always accompanied by real ambivalence \u2014 can be seen in countries as diverse as Mexico, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, as well as in many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Out-migration as a way of life (and an instrument of national economic policy) has its limits.\nLike all major social changes, the spread of low fertility poses challenges to established practices. Political systems that fail to adjust will predictably face vexing fiscal challenges, even crises. Generous public pension systems in Europe, with fewer younger adults employed and paying taxes while life expectancy at older ages rises, are a grave source of anxiety for members of the European Union. National leaders will have to decide whether the early retirement ages and high \u201cwage replacement\u201d payout rates of their pension systems, created decades ago under very different economic and demographic circumstances, can be adjusted to become sustainable over the long term.\nThere are, in fact, ways that low fertility can be moderated, or even reversed, over time. Indeed, this already has happened to modest degrees in some of the countries with the earliest fertility declines. Sweden and France were among the first European countries to experience low postwar fertility rates. Sweden\u2019s declined to about 1.6 in the 1970s and again in the 1990s, but has since rebounded to about 1.9, possibly because of a variety of support mechanisms for young families with children. In France, where public support for young families with children has been long-term public policy, fertility rates over the past half century did not decline as much as in Sweden, and are now around two (about the same as in the United States). Part of the reason is that France provides subsidized day care for children, starting at 2 1/2 months. Fees are on a sliding scale based on family income. Other countries have been reconsidering traditional school schedules, such as half-days and early closing times that impose serious work-family conflicts for parents, and housing subsidies for young families.\nThe experience of places like Sweden and Russia suggests a modest recovery in fertility rates in countries where they have fallen to very low levels \u2014 rather than the \u201cdeath spiral\u201d feared by some commentators.\nBut with the global economy still quite fragile, it\u2019s a safe bet that ominous jeremiads about endangered, geriatric societies will continue. Population doom of one kind or another is a recurring fad. Like most fads, this one can be safely ignored. Humanity has many legitimate problems to worry about. Falling fertility is not one of them."}, {"text": "Violence in Afghanistan\n2014-03-11T22:51:22.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nRe \u201cFrustration With Afghanistan\u201d (editorial, March 4):\nIf after a dozen years of investment of effort, blood and treasure by the world\u2019s only superpower in Afghanistan \u201cserious questions remain about whether the country will ever be able to stand on its own,\u201d might it be that there is something more to this endless conflict than a purely domestic insurgency?\nWhen President Hamid Karzai makes the startling claim that Al Qaeda is \u201cmore a myth than a reality,\u201d he is simply pointing out that militant Islam in his region is a far deeper phenomenon \u2014 both in terms of its history and its continuing threat to world security \u2014 than that one terror organization.\nSince the early 1970s, the underlying cause of mass violence in the name of Islam from Bangladesh to Kashmir to Afghanistan has been the powerful support fundamentalist proxy groups have received from the Pakistani military.\nBy not only failing to shield the Afghans from this aggression but also actually financing it in the delusion that the Pakistanis had accepted our post-9/11 ultimatum and switched sides, we have failed to meet the basic challenge of self-defense that was thrust upon us that day.\nVANNI CAPPELLI Poughkeepsie, N.Y., March 4, 2014\n \nThe writer is president of the Afghanistan Foreign Press Association."}]
