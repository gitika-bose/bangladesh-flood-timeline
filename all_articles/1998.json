    "text": "Next to Subcontinent Face-Off, the Cold War Looks Safe\n1998-07-20T05:00:00.000Z\nU.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott will resume talks in New Delhi Monday with Jaswant Singh, the Indian government's point man in defending its nuclear tests to the world.\nTheir meeting comes amid signs of increasing realism in Washington about the rationale behind the tests, and about the limits of international sanctions as an instrument for effecting a policy change in New Delhi.\nIn turn, two months after their tit-for-tat nuclear weapons tests, it is dawning on many Indians and Pakistanis that their net security has been degraded, their economy damaged and their status diminished.\nMr. Talbott would do well to impress upon his Subcontinental hosts just how dangerous the nuclear relationship between India and Pakistan is compared with that between the Soviet Union and the United States in the Cold War.\nCold War deterrence was itself more unstable than realized at the time.\nIn the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, for example, the U.S. strategy was based on the best available intelligence, which indicated that there were no nuclear warheads in Cuba. In fact there were more than 100 warheads already stationed there, and the local Soviet commander had taken them out of storage to deployed positions for use against an American invasion. The thought of India-Pakistan relations being as stable as Cold War deterrence is not very reassuring.\nThe geostrategic environment of the Subcontinent has no parallel in the Cold War. India and Pakistan share a long border; the United States and the Soviet Union did not. This dramatically shortens the time frame either country would have to decide, during a crisis or war, whether to use nuclear weapons.\nThe entire province of Kashmir, the source of two of the three wars India and Pakistan have fought since their independence from Britain in 1947, remains in bitter contention, whereas the United States and the Soviet Union had no direct territorial dispute.\nContiguity permits India and Pakistan to meddle in each other's territory on a scale that was never an option for the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\nIndia also shares a long border with nuclear-armed China; it, too, is disputed. This introduces a third element of territorial tension into the strategic equation, which was never the case in the Cold War.\nThe stability of Cold War deterrence rested on credible second-strike retaliatory capability. Stockpiles, command and control centers and the military-political leadership were protected against a surprise attack that could destroy all of them in one strike. Neither India nor Pakistan has even the most rudimentary basing, command and control systems in place that could survive a nuclear assault. Such an infrastructure could take one or two years to develop and install.\nMoscow and Washington spread their stockpiles across land (on missiles), sea (on submarines) and air (on planes). This three-pronged dispersal added to detection and strike difficulties for an enemy and so buttressed second-strike capability. India and Pakistan lack this stabilizing triad of weapons platforms.\nBecause of the lack of survivable forces and command centers, both nations are highly vulnerable to a preemptive strike. But there is an inherent asymmetry in the way each calculates risks.\nPakistan cannot match India's conventional superiority. However, a successful first strike could destroy India's nuclear capability and paralyze its conventional superiority, thereby allowing Pakistan to avenge its defeat in the 1971 war over Bangladesh and wrest Kashmir from India \u2014 or so a government in Islamabad might conclude.\nConversely, a government in New Delhi might conclude that since reciprocal nuclear capability rules out their actual use by either country, it is safe to launch a military strike against Pakistan in punishment for its provocations in Kashmir. There is nothing in the history of the U.S.-Soviet relationship to indicate the eventual outcome of such an adventure.\nFinally, all these worries are exacerbated by political volatility in both countries. The government of Pakistan faces economic meltdown and political challenges from Islamist groups and the military.\nThe government of India is an uneasy coalition of an intensely nationalist party that bases its legitimacy in religion and mythology, and a number of disparate parties that pursue different, and sometimes incompatible, regional agendas.\nIn the 51st year of India's independence, the governing Hindu nationalist party \u2014 heir to the fanatic movement that spawned Mahatma Gandhi's assassin \u2014 has betrayed the apostle of nonviolence by coveting the most horrific weapon of mass violence. And this when India has the highest number of poor and illiterate in the world.\nNo food, no clothing, no shelter? Don't worry, we have the bomb.\n-\nThe writer is a vice rector at the United Nations University in Tokyo. He contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.",

    "text": "PUBLIC LIVES; Honoring Immigrants, and How They Lived\n1998-12-17T05:00:00.000Z\nRUTH ABRAM'S life is the story of how personal hurts grew into a museum that no one ever imagined.\nIt started on a bus in Atlanta in the early 1950's, when the Abram family maid, Rosa May Maddox, found a seat for young Ruth in the front, then moved to the back. In 1958, when Ruth was 13, she was told at her private Atlanta school that she could not join the cotillion because she was Jewish. Soon after, when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. came to her home -- her father is Morris Abram, the legendary civil rights lawyer -- her parents said it was best not to tell her friends.\nMuch later, when Ms. Abram found an Orthodox synagogue in Riverdale for the education of her children, the rabbi informed her that she was not Jewish at all. Why? Because Ms. Abram's mother, a one-time Methodist, had converted to Judaism only after Ms. Abram's birth.\n''It sort of felt like I was being spun out into the universe, with no anchor,'' Ms. Abram said.\nSo it is not a complete surprise that Ms. Abram, 53, is the founder and president of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, an institution that celebrates immigrants -- and which Ms. Abram sees as ''promoting the kind of tolerance that wouldn't permit the things I experienced.''\nLast month, the decade-old museum -- housed in a five-story Orchard Street apartment building that from 1863 to 1935 was home to about 10,000 people from 25 countries -- became a ''national historic area'' and part of the National Park Service, meaning it can now apply for Federal funds. The month before, the tenement building was designated a site of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. So far, it is the only Trust site in America that was not the home of someone rich or famous. (New York has two other Trust sites: Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate, and Lyndhurst, the home of Jay Gould, the financier and swindler.)\nMs. Abram, needless to say, is in a very good mood. There is the prospect of more money, and visitors. There is also the realization that she is running the only tenement museum in the country, and helping to change the idea of what is important to preserve in America. Her goal, someday, is to have the museum be a stop for tourists after they see Ellis Island. ''I always say there's this great question,'' she said. '''What happened afterward?''\nMs. Abram talked last week in the drafty kitchen of the tenement house, where she was gracious and appropriate. She came alive, though, during a one-hour tour of the museum -- she still gives one a week -- for a group of a dozen or so. (Whose families came, they told her when she asked, from England, China, Peru, Bangladesh, Russia, Ireland, Sweden and Poland.) Ms. Abram started in the building's entrance hall, in total darkness and under peeling paint, just as it looked in 1863. ''Welcome home!'' she said. ''Come with me.''\nTHERE followed a tour of the museum's permanent exhibit, opened last week, of the apartment of the Rogarshevskys, a family of Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Lithuania, who lived in three rooms re-created to look as they did on July 12, 1918, after Abraham Rogarshevsky, a 45-year-old garment presser, died of tuberculosis. There was medicine on the table by his bed, and bagels and bialys brought by friends. Ms. Abram calls the Rogarshevskys and their neighbors ''our urban pioneers.''\nThe Rogarshevsky apartment is the fourth of 20 in the building to be restored. The most recent in time is that of Adolpho and Rosaria Baldizzi, Catholic immigrants from Sicily, who lost their jobs during the Depression and were evicted in 1935. Ms. Abram told her tour that the Baldizzi apartment, re-created to look as it did on the day they were thrown out, was filled with authentic belongings taken from the apartment by the Baldizzis' daughter, Josephine, who lived there as a child and died a few months ago.\nJust before the apartment opened to the public, Ms. Abram said, Josephine came to see it. ''And she got right here, and she burst into tears,'' Ms. Abram said. Josephine Baldizzi requested only one change: That she be allowed to iron and neatly pack the clothes displayed in the suitcases on the apartment floor. ''My mamma was fastidious!'' Josephine told Ms. Abram. ''Even for eviction, she never would have thrown things together in the haphazard way you packed!''\nMs. Abram lives on the Upper West Side, is married to Herbert Teitelbaum, a partner at Robinson Silverman, has two grown children, was a social worker and a women's rights organizer, graduated from Sarah Lawrence College, has a master's degree in American history from New York University and apologized for being boring in an interview.\nHer most vivid memory of Dr. King? ''What I remember more than anything is going to the Abyssinian Baptist Church to hear him preach, and what he was saying to the congregation was 'support your children.' In other words, your children will be doing things you don't want, but there is a higher law. And it had an incredible effect on me. Because of all the places to try to change people's minds, to do that in your own community is harder.''\nMs. Abram's forbears were from Romania, Prussia, Ireland and Scotland. Despite her pedigree, she says her museum has made her feel as if she has ''come home'' ---- to a place where Americans can ''meet our families before they became acceptable.''",

    "text": "Clinton Packs Up His Care and Woe To Trot the Globe\n1998-03-23T05:00:00.000Z\nPresident Clinton left the country today. And you had better get used to it.\nThe 12-day trip to Africa that Mr. Clinton began today is not merely the longest foreign visit of his Presidency; it is also the first in a series of trips that will sweep him away to four continents in four months. Those travels will keep him out of the country for more than four weeks between now and early July.\nAll in all, not a bad itinerary for a fellow under fire from an independent counsel, assorted lawyers and a pack of Congressmen who have taken to occasional mutterings about impeachment.\n''I believe he's looking forward to his trip,'' the President's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, said mildly on Friday, as the latest wave in the Paula Corbin Jones case crashed over his head.\nCynics, wags and Republicans have been quick to invoke a time-tested political rule to explain Presidential wanderlust, citing the example of President Richard M. Nixon's 1974 visit to Egypt during his Watergate turmoil.\n''If you're in trouble, go abroad,'' said Lyn Nofziger, the former strategist for President Ronald Reagan. ''It changes the subject pretty thoroughly.''\nBut advisers to Mr. Clinton dismiss that idea, noting that while his schedule has been rearranged and expanded a bit in recent weeks, most of his overseas destinations for the year were picked long before Ms. Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit against him made Monica S. Lewinsky a household name.\nWeighty matters of foreign policy -- not the tangled wranglings of domestic politics and legal actions, White House aides insist, with some exasperation, are what have turned the President into a rolling stone.\nWhich is not to say that the White House is unhappy at the prospect of television's carrying images of Mr. Clinton preoccupied with affairs of global security and economics, and standing beside the likes of Nelson Mandela, the President of South Africa.\n''Pictures of the President as a world leader are always nice,'' an Administration official conceded, on condition of anonymity.\nBut, he added, that is far from the reason for Mr. Clinton's trip to Africa.\n''It's something that he's always wanted to do, and he feels that it's an important part of the world that doesn't get enough attention,'' this official said.\nIn fact, Presidential trips themselves do not receive the attention they once did. With the cold war over, superpower prestige, ego and security are no longer perceived to depend as much on the fates of tiny countries, including some African ones Mr. Clinton is visiting.\nPartly to insure some coverage of the trip back home, the Administration has loaded the President up with what officials call ''deliverables'' -- new programs, like increased financing for education and food security, for Mr. Clinton to announce. White House aides also note that the trip has already received widespread attention among American blacks, one of the Democrats' most important constituencies.\n''There are audience segments that pay a lot of attention,'' another White House aide said.\nFurther, officials said, they have learned that Mr. Clinton can generate news on a domestic issue, like the budget, just as easily from abroad.\nWhatever the vagaries of coverage and political reaction in the United States, Presidents are assured a personal boost from wall-to-wall foreign coverage and from ecstatic crowds lining motorcade routes and filling cobbled or dirt plazas.\n''Foreign travel does a lot for a President under siege in terms of his own psyche,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the former press secretary for Presidents Reagan and George Bush. ''Every President enjoys traveling in foreign countries because it makes him feel like a President again.''\nAfter focusing his first Presidential campaign on domestic issues, Mr. Clinton found himself, to his aggravation and occasional dismay, repeatedly distracted in his first term by foreign policy crises like Somalia. But he has grown to relish his foreign policy duties, aides say, and no longer feels the need to rely on more experienced mentors in his decision-making. He is said to love the travel and the opportunities it provides to soak up information, trivia and stories.\nAfter his trip to Africa, Mr. Clinton plans to go to Latin America next month for the Summit of the Americas in Santiago, Chile. In May, he plans to go to Birmingham, England, for an annual economic summit meeting. The White House has been adding stops to that trip, including a visit to Berlin before and perhaps one to Northern Ireland at the end. And while he is in Europe, Mr. Clinton just might bop over to Moscow.\nThe President is expected to be back in the United States in plenty of time for the Jones trial, which is scheduled to begin on May 27 in Little Rock, Ark. Having already given a deposition, he does not have to testify in the trial. But his advisers are holding open the option of having him appear in his own defense.\nThen, in June, Mr. Clinton is off again. He is planning to make a 10-day trip to China, beginning near the end of that month.\nThe China trip was originally scheduled for November, but last week the White House moved it up, saying the President was eager to preserve momentum in relations with China. White House aides insisted the change in plans had nothing to do with the Jones trial.\nLater in the year, Mr. Clinton plans a trip to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as one to Malaysia.\nThe Africa trip is planned to be the longest of the year -- indeed, the longest foreign tour of any President at least since Mr. Reagan went to Europe in the spring of 1985. White House aides said the schedule was driven by Mr. Clinton's desire to make what he has called the first ''serious trip to Africa'' of any President.\n''If you're going to do this,'' a senior Administration official said, ''to have the story be all the places you didn't go versus all the places you did go would be to pay a big price for not spending a couple of extra days.'' As it is, Mr. Clinton will still visit only 6 of the 48 sub-Saharan countries: Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, Botswana and Senegal.\nMr. Clinton's advisers describe African nations as poised for extraordinary growth the way Asian countries were in the 1960's and 70's.\n''So many of these countries are at a lift-off point,'' the Administration official said. Decades hence, this official and others believe, the visit may appear to be a historic moment, cementing American and African ties.\nSamuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said, ''One of the overriding goals of this trip is to help Americans rethink Africa, and Africans rethink America.''\nFor all the high-minded foreign policy goals, some Clinton advisers expect little to change in their daily routines besides the food and the scenery. The 800-member traveling delegation includes scores of reporters attuned to the continuing investigations back home.\nAsked at a news conference if there was no ''side benefit'' to Mr. Clinton's ''getting out of town for a couple of weeks,'' Mr. Berger said, ''Well, you come with us.''\nSome aides hold out the hope that reporters might get a dose of perspective upon witnessing the troubles of some African nations.\n''They don't have the luxury of getting diverted to the kinds of stories we've gotten diverted to in the last eight weeks,'' a Clinton adviser said.\nBut because reporters have had little chance to question Mr. Clinton about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and recent developments in the investigations, White House aides expect a joint news conference by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Mandela on Friday to turn into a circus.\n''It's probably a safe bet,'' one of Mr. Clinton's advisers said sourly.\nThat is one event for which the White House seems rather uninterested in generating much of an audience. It is scheduled for 11:20 A.M. in Cape Town -- 4:20 A.M. in Washington.",

    "text": "Traveler's Notebook; Have Adapter, Will Travel\n1998-09-24T05:00:00.000Z\nIN the old days, travel meant getting away. Now it means going, but not getting away. To explore the third world may still mean lugging a backpack, but inside it you can have a trove of high-tech devices that tether you as securely to the first world as a ball and chain.\nWhen I set off for the hinterlands these days, I sometimes still pull out the same dark blue Eagle Creek backpack that I used 15 years ago as a graduate student. But in those days I would simply step out of some Asian or African airport, put on my cool sunglasses, heave the backpack onto my shoulders and disappear for five weeks at a time.\nNow the backpack is the same, but everything in it has changed. The most important transformation is that it can now serve as a communications center.\nThe centerpiece is my Thrane & Thrane satellite phone, which I can set up in about 30 seconds in the middle of a jungle clearing. Satellite phones are expensive -- one costs about $3,000, which doesn't include charges of about $2.50 a minute for calls -- but they allow voice and data transmission from any place on the planet outside the polar zones. When the light plane I was riding in lost the use of its controls in Uganda last year and was coming down for a crash landing without even being able to dump its fuel first, I braced myself in crash position and grimly contemplated the expected fireball -- then realized that I might have time before the crash to pull out the satellite phone and use my laptop to buy extra life insurance off the World Wide Web.\nProgress is comforting.\nA half-dozen years ago, satellite phones were suitcase-size contraptions with huge antennas, and they required a large amount of electrical power. But in the current generation, a satellite phone is the size of a laptop computer and works from a battery pack. In contrast with cellular phones, which function only if a ground station is nearby, a satellite phone can be used almost anywhere.\nYou point a satellite phone at the sky, turn it on and rotate it until you find the satellite that best serves the area. The line is slow for data, 2,400 baud, and there is a slight lag in conversations as the signals go up to the satellite and back, but the battery will give you nearly two hours' worth of phone conversation or an hour of E-mail transmission.\nWhen the battery goes out on my Thrane & Thrane, a solar panel is available to recharge it. But for juice, I always pack a portable power inverter that I picked up from Radio Shack. It is a device that plugs into a car's cigarette lighter at one end and offers a regular 110-volt electrical outlet at the other end. So as long as there is a car around, I can power up my laptop and satellite telephone -- and electric shaver.\n(A cautionary tale: In a remote part of Congo, I once ran a satellite phone from a car battery and then tried to drive off. But the phone had drained the battery dead, and I was on a dirt road in guerrilla-held territory in the middle of a civil war. The moral of the story is to always keep the engine running when you borrow from a car battery.)\nFor following the news, I also carry a little Sony shortwave radio, scarcely bigger than a cigarette pack. I've been through many versions, and although my current one is a neat digital version that also functions as an alarm clock, the key element is an accompanying antenna with a clip at one end so it can be hooked onto a hotel curtain or window. Good shortwave reception depends not on a $300 radio but on a $10 antenna.\nMy communications center also includes a couple of phone cables, including a device called a spider that has a United States-style telephone plug at one end for my laptop and divides into eight arms with plugs for different kinds of phone systems at the other. Ever since a desperate struggle with a phone system in Macao many years ago, I also carry alligator clips to connect my modem directly into the phone cables if all else fails: I unscrew the phone outlet from the wall and poke around until I find the phone wires.\nFor all this reconnaissance work on phone lines, I carry around a little screwdriver set that I got in Korea a decade ago to take apart the telephones in the Chosun Hotel. The screwdrivers have stubby ends so airline security officials will not confiscate them as weapons, and I also carry folding scissors and a miniature pocketknife that airlines regard as less threatening than my Swiss Army knife. I avoid checking bags on flights, so that makes it impossible to carry anything that bothers the people who cluster around airport X-ray machines.\nRounding out my communications center is a convertible plug set that I got for about $10 at Heathrow Airport to deal with wall outlets in various foreign countries and a small Radio Shack device that plugs into the phone line at one end and my little tape recorder at the other, allowing me to tape phone interviews. (It's the same device that Linda Tripp used, I believe, but unlike Ms. Tripp, I get permission before I tape calls.)\nMoving from the communications center to the bedroom, I carry some low-tech gadgetry in the third world to make sure that I survive long enough to play with the high-tech toys. I sleep inside a sheet sack, which is a bit like a sleeping bag except that it is made out of a tightly woven sheet and keeps out bedbugs, and I pack a mosquito net as well. My current version is a wonderful device that folds up around my face like a little tent.\nI once had to bivouac in Africa in an abandoned mud hut that turned out to have a wasp nest directly above my cot. My mosquito coils evidently had an effect on the wasps because they dropped on me all night, sick but not dead. I ended up covered by a layer of squirming wasps, but with my sheet sack and mosquito net, I ended up as snug as a bug in a rug. Well, O.K., as snug as a human covered with wasps, which is to say not so snug at all, but it could have been worse.\nSince catching malaria last year, I have been on the warpath against mosquitoes. So now I also pack disgusting insect repellents that have a hefty concentration of DEET and also a substance called Duranon to treat clothing, keeping insects away for two weeks even after the clothing is washed. In malarial areas, I also take a nifty Japanese thingamajig (not available anywhere else, as far as I know) that snaps onto your belt and holds a burning mosquito coil, which puffs merrily as you walk around.\nNone of that is effective against rats and roaches, which are my bane. I once settled into a cheap hotel room in Bangladesh and found it infested with thousands of two-inch cockroaches crawling all over the bed and floor. I packed a small can of roach spray on my next Bangladesh trip. But that was a luxury and in any case, I've stopped carrying sprays ever since an embarrassing incident in a tiny airport in southwestern China. When a security guard there found my spray deodorant, he held it up before a throng of hundreds of curious Chinese and asked me suspiciously what I intended to use it for.\nDeodorant is unknown in rural China, and the term for deodorant in Chinese literally means ''chemical to drive away the stink.'' So it was a bit awkward to explain to the crowd that I used such a chemical on myself and that otherwise I would begin to smell. Hundreds of pairs of eyes gazed at me in fascination, and noses began twitching curiously. I have never again packed a spray can in my carry-on luggage.\nMy kitchen is the smallest section of the pack. It consists simply of an iodine dropper to purify water -- a few drops are supposed to kill even amoebic dysentery -- and a military-issue can opener, a great little gadget scarcely bigger than a paper clip. I gave my first one away to a Bedouin who treated me to dinner over his campfire in the Sinai many years ago, and I've gone through several since then.\nFor times when the electricity goes out, I pack a couple of small candles and matches. Then there's always either a miniflashlight or a slightly larger flashlight that converts into a lantern.\nMoving from the office, bedroom and kitchen to the front door, I prefer a profusion of low-tech devices to make sure that my pack stays in my possession. In India a dozen years ago, I once lost the key to the minipadlock on my pack and was horrified to discover how easily I could jimmy it open with a screwdriver. So I went to a locksmith and bought a dozen much stouter padlocks that all take the same key, and now I use those hefty locks and keep a few copies of the key secreted here and there. I also carry a bicycle lock and run it through the padlocks and then lock it to something sturdy if I am in a cheap hotel.\nThe silliest place to carry money and a passport, of course, is in one's pocket or a purse, but I also lost my faith in the common waist and neck pouches after running into a Canadian man on a train in the Ivory Coast. A big hefty man (he was a professional basketball player), he had been set upon when he had first stepped onto the train. The first thing the robbers did was to rip open his shirt and grab the waist pouch containing his money and passport. The problem with those pouches is that they leave a visible bulge under one's shirt and tell thieves where to look.\nSo in bad areas, I carry my passport and other essentials in a leather pouch that loops around my belt and then slips down against my leg on the inside of my trousers. It's almost impossible to detect unless somebody pulls down my pants, which has not happened so far (even if some drunken Ghanaian soldiers, in the course of robbing us, once made a traveling companion pull off his shoes and socks so they could check for hidden money). In unstable areas, I also wear a nifty black leather belt that looks like any other but has a zipper on the inside; I keep two $100 bills folded there. Then, even if everything is stolen, I can at least pay any lifesaving bribes and get transportation to an American embassy.\nAnother essential is a decoy wallet because it is only polite when you encounter an angry soldier with a machine gun to allow yourself to be robbed. So I have a wallet in my hip pocket with some local currency and a library card for identification (it's amazing what checkpoints an English-language library card will get you through). The problem is that it is easy to forget that the wallet is just a decoy, meant to be taken.\nOne time when I was walking with a friend through a slum in Lima, Peru, a mugger grabbed my friend's decoy wallet, which had only about $10 in it. We should have let the mugger take it, but instead we wrestled around on the ground with the mugger as a crowd gathered. Finally the mugger ran off empty-handed, and a mysterious man emerged and began firing a pistol in the general direction of the fleeing thief.\nWe had not counted on guns, and the episode had escalated much more quickly than we had expected. We felt rather foolish explaining that there had been almost nothing in the wallet, and I suppose that the incident illustrated the importance of something even more important than a low-tech decoy wallet or a high-tech satellite phone: non-tech common sense.",

    "text": "South Asians Lament Economic Rifts\n1998-08-03T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen the seven nations of South Asia held a summit meeting in Sri Lanka last week, their leaders engaged in what has become an annual lament, acknowledging that the region has been an economic backwater for decades. Ending their three-day meeting on Friday, they vowed, as they have at such meetings for years, to hasten efforts to break down economic barriers among them.\nBut as they headed home, the leaders were faced with a barrage of skepticism. Throughout India, Pakistan and Bangladesh -- the three large nations in the grouping -- and Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, critics have despaired of ending the suspicions and enmities that have blocked economic ties that could help lift their people out of poverty.\nThis time, the disappointments had a ready focus in the failure of India and Pakistan to agree on resuming talks aimed at bridging the region's largest rift. The two nations demonstrated again, after several rounds of abrasive talks about talks, how difficult they have found it to reconcile themselves to the bitter events of 50 years ago, when Hindus and Muslims -- unable to agree on terms for living together -- opted to carve separate countries out of what had been British India.\nWhat was to have been the crowning event of the summit meeting, a handshake sealing an agreement on new talks, became a moment for the two Governments to exchange old grievances over Kashmir, the territory divided between them at the partition of the subcontinent in 1947.\nIndia's Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, accused Pakistan of engaging in ''fantasies'' and ''propaganda'' over Kashmir; Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, said India's refusal to make Kashmir the priority issue in talks meant that the two leaders were ''wasting each other's time.'' The meeting closed with a sense of failure.\nAmong other things, the standoff appeared to mean that India and Pakistan will not hold early discussions on ways of lessening the risk of a nuclear war, the issue that dominated discussion in the corridors of the summit meeting. Because of a stipulation in the regional group's charter that precludes discussion of politically divisive issues between member states, the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in May were not on the agenda and were not mentioned in the concluding communique.\nMr. Vajpayee set the pattern with a speech that mentioned the nuclear tests only obliquely, referring to them as ''recent events in South Asia,'' and then only to say that there was no reason for the tests to impede new regional economic ties. President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga of Sri Lanka, the meeting's host, held to the protocol forbidding discussion of contentious issues, but made her own feelings clear. Calling for an ''ambiance of confidence'' in the region, she added, ''It cannot be denied that such an ambiance could be affected by recent developments.''\nA leading Sri Lanka newspaper, The Island, captured the gloomy mood of the group, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, with an editorial today headed, ''S.A.A.R.C. at a Dead End.'' ''Ten years of summitry has not brought any tangible results to the billion people of the region,'' the editorial said, adding that if political hostilities continue to thwart economic cooperation, the organization's reason to exist ''is in question.''\nSome optimists said that even if the meeting did go aground over the hostilities between India and Pakistan, it had served a purpose in underlining the region's dismal economic state. Several of the leaders noted that the region, with a combined population of 1.3 billion people, has the world's largest concentration of poverty. According to figures quoted here, at least 40 percent of the region's people live without adequate shelter, food, education or medical care or even safe drinking water.\nOf the nations that attended the summit, only the Maldives, with a thriving tourist industry, has a per capita income as high as $500 a year.\nThe point was made forcefully by Mr. Vajpayee, on his first trip outside India since becoming the country's leader after elections in March. ''We represent great civilizations, ancient yet vibrant and alive, and yet we are among the poorest in the world,'' he said. He made a plea for change: ''Enough of sterile ideology. Enough of hostile nationalism. Enough of conflict on the basis of religion and creed. Enough of poverty and backwardness. Let us grow rich together.''\nFor many years, India was considered the obstacle to closer regional ties. But at the Colombo meeting, India led the way in pushing for lowering trade barriers, announcing that it would eliminate restrictions that have severely limited imports from its neighbors of more than 2,000 products.\nThe seven nations also renewed their commitment to establish a South Asian free trade area by the year 2001, but many participants seemed doubtful that the goal could be met. A preferential trading area, under which each member state agreed to make concessions to the others not available to other nations, has been bogged down in red tape since it was established in 1993.\nAccording to Indian statistics, only 3.7 percent of the region's total foreign trade of about $140 billion is from trade among the South Asian nations, which trade primarily with Japan, Europe and the United States.\nAs an example of the disfunctional economic arrangements in the region, others at the meeting noted that Pakistan imports iron ore from Australia, Canada and Brazil, while India has a surplus it exports to Japan. Other examples abounded.\nPrivately, officials attending the meeting acknowledged that achieving economic momentum among their countries is unlikely until political tensions abate.\n--------------------\nToll Rises in Kashmir\nSRINAGAR, Kashmir, Aug. 2 (Agence France-Presse)\nIndian and Pakistani forces traded fierce artillery fire in the disputed Kashmir region for a fourth day today, pushing the death toll from the fighting to nearly 80.\nA police inspector, Shesh Vaid, said more than a dozen people were also wounded, adding that at least 29 people, mostly civilians, had died in Indian territory since Thursday.

    "text": "Traffic on Columbus Circle Finally Comes, Well, Full Circle\n1998-08-11T05:00:00.000Z\nFor the last 40 of its 106 years, the one thing Columbus Circle has not been is a traffic circle. What this putative monument to a great navigator's vision has been instead is the chaotic, confusing center of one of the busiest crossroads in the city.\nBut with a few dozen strategically placed barriers and the flick of a signal switch, the configuration known as a roundabout in London, a rotary in Boston and simply a traffic circle in hundreds of other places has returned to Manhattan.\nWith it comes a plan to turn the area inside the circle -- often called one of New York's most unattractively squandered opportunities for a great civic space -- into a plaza befitting the place where Broadway meets Central Park.\nThe transformation began Friday. Now northbound drivers on Eighth Avenue who used to cut across the left side of the center to Broadway or across the right side to head up Central Park West must now enter a newly widened stream of traffic and flow counterclockwise to their destinations.\nAnd on the right side of the circle, where two lanes of northbound traffic and a mini-parking lot used to be, there are now the greatly expanded boundaries of the plaza itself. While a rose garden just outside the new boundary has been paved over to accommodate extra traffic, pedestrians for the first time are now legally able to enter the plaza, feel the spray of the fountain and enjoy the view down several of the city's grandest boulevards.\nAll in all, a city traffic official said yesterday, not a bad way to honor the man in the middle of the circle who staked his reputation on a hunch that the world was round.\n''I think Columbus would be very proud,'' Joseph Albano, a project director for the City Department of Transportation, said as he stood by the fountain and watched motorists circumnavigate him. ''The circle is no longer fragmented. It's one circle around.''\nAlthough the future park is still mostly a round patch of asphalt, it is already attracting fans. Bill Karg, an architect and urban planner who came to check out the circle, said yesterday he saw the potential for something like the New York version of the Arc de Triomphe.\n''This is one of the few vantage points in Manhattan where you can look down a street and say, 'Whoa, look at that, that's really something,' '' he said. ''It deserves the kind of attention and prominence it looks like they're giving it.''\nColumbus Circle, the five-legged asterisk where Eighth Avenue, upper and lower Broadway, Central Park South and Central Park West converge, is not the only traffic circle in the city. There are at least a half-dozen others, including Park Circle at the southwest corner of Prospect Park in Brooklyn and one at Mosholu Parkway and Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx. But with 60,000 cars a day, Columbus Circle is by far the busiest.\nAnd while some drivers coming up Eighth Avenue yesterday hesitated and changed lanes uncertainly as they approached it, as if overnight the city had moved the roads -- which it had -- most of them seemed to grasp the concept.\n''This is better, and it's less congested,'' said Chowdhury Iftekhar, a cabby who learned to navigate traffic circles in his native Dhaka, Bangladesh. ''Before it was all different directions, and you couldn't do it unless you were already familiar. Now it's a circle, an O shape. Where you want to go, you have to follow the circle.''\nMr. Albano said that over the next six months, traffic engineers would study the new configuration to see whether cars and pedestrians were getting around the circle more quickly.\nSome pedestrian advocates were skeptical. John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, said that pedestrians at the southwest corner of Central Park would have a harder time crossing over to Broadway because the city had removed a traffic light for vehicles turning north onto Central Park West. He also complained that the two new crosswalks into the circle are inconveniently both on the west side.\n''In terms of linking uptown and downtown, from a pedestrian's perspective it doesn't seem great,'' he said. ''My impression is that this was planned with the first priority being to improve traffic flow, second, putting in some aesthetic improvements in what has been an atrociously unattractive public space, and third, if at all, to improve pedestrian movement.''\nDespite its commanding location and the statue and fountain in the center of it, Columbus Circle has never been a pedestrian mall. A 1910 photograph shows the 1894 statue of Columbus, which sits atop an 80-foot marble column, on a tiny island surrounded by what looks like a circular racetrack at least eight lanes wide. For decades, the circle was an important turnaround point for trolleys, making passage from the street corners into the center particularly treacherous.In the middle of this century -- transportation officials do not know exactly when -- the roads crossing the plaza were added.\nThe plans for the park within the circle, which with the new boundaries is more than 200 feet across, are still in the early stages. The design, said Richard Barth, director of the Manhattan office of the city's Planning Department, will have to harmonize with Merchants' Gate, the southwest entrance to Central Park.\nWhen pressed for details, Mr. Barth would say only that the park could conceivably include seating, landscaping and some type of ''water feature.'' There are a few small trees now, but, he said, adding more could pose a problem because the subway below is so close to the surface.\nOn the west side of the circle, Time Warner and the Related Companies will pay for the part of the new park in front of the twin towers they plan to build on the site of the New York Coliseum, Mr. Barth said.\nFor the few who have long braved the traffic and jaywalked into the circle, the improvements would be welcome.\nGeorge Aponte, 44, of Harlem, said he visited the fountain almost every day after receiving AIDS treatments at Roosevelt Hospital nearby.\n''If they fix this up, that's going to bring a lot of people,'' he said, leaning on a cane as he slowly walked around the fountain. ''You want to spend time and refresh your mind, you've got to come to places like this. Feel the spray of the water. Look at that building'' -- he gestured at Trump International Hotel and Tower on Central Park West. ''You got markets, you got the buildings, you got women, you got food, you got everything here. What else could you want?''",

    "text": "The Nation: Parallel Universe; Listen Up, Out There. Here's What Cabbies Think of You.\n1998-05-24T05:00:00.000Z\nTIME was, the stereotypical New York cabdriver was a gabby if slightly gruff man with a Brooklyn accent who knew every pothole in every street in every borough and greeted people with the world-weary query, ''Where to, Mac?''\nBy the 1970's, however, this relatively benign image had transmuted into Travis Bickle from the movie ''Taxi Driver'': a sleep-deprived, psychotic loner with a schoolboy crush on Cybill Shepherd and an assassin's approach to politics.\nMore recently, the cabby archetype is that of a turbaned third world man, short of cash and long on nerve, darting through traffic in a frenzied forage for passengers, each fare seemingly as valuable to him as a green card.\n''There is not a great deal of public sympathy for taxi drivers,'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani chortled last week, as he deployed police officers to thwart their protests against the stricter new rules proposed to cut down on cabbies' reckless driving and discourtesy.\nFast-driving cabdrivers have now joined jaywalkers, pornographers and panhandlers as the villains du jour in the Mayor's continuing campaign to bring more civility to New York. ''As a political issue, this is what you'd call a no-brainer,'' Mr. Giuliani said.\nBut if people have little nice to say about New York cabbies, now is a good time to listen to what New York cabbies have to say about people. The views from the front seat are far different from those in the back, and they go a long way toward explaining why cabdrivers feel like an angry and oppressed minority -- maligned by the public, harassed by the police and overburdened by regulators.\n''Drive a taxi in New York -- you'll wish you had an ejector button to fling people out of the back seat,'' said Michael Higgins, a 10-year veteran driver and the editor of Taxi Talk magazine. ''You have no idea what kind of lunatics get into your cab each day, every day. People are high. People are drunk. People are throwing up. I wish I could put up a sign: Bean eaters must use mass transit.\n''Then there are the businessmen. They're tense, they're late. They don't want to hear that red means stop or U-turns are illegal. They have big mouths and they use their tongues like a whip. Day in, day out, you have to listen to their condescending crap: go this way, go that way. Well, shut the hell up!''\nDriving a taxi is tough work. The shifts are usually 12 hours long. The traffic is madness. The pay is not great. The passengers are unappreciative.\nThe aggravation begins with the hailing of the cab. ''Some people stand several yards out in the street to wave at you, and when they see you're stopping they just stay where they are,'' said William Mersey. ''Picking them up out there is illegal. That's what gets you tickets.''\nNew Yorkers assume they know the quickest route to a destination.\n''The passenger has not dealt with the gridlock all day, but they do not want to listen when you tell them,'' said Mohammad Gull, a Pakistani driver. ''Then, in the tie-up, when they see you are stuck for a half hour and the meter is going, they say, 'O.K., I walk from here.' And the driver is the one who is stuck.''\nKhalil Snaky, a Moroccan cabdriver, said many passengers checked their political correctness at the curb before getting into a cab. ''They talk about you with a lot of racism, figuring you can't understand,'' he said.\nNot the Good Life\nEast Side, West Side, all around the town: the routine gets a bit dizzying. Cabbies confess to getting sleepy, which is not a good thing. Someone must remain alert -- and it is surely not going to be the city's pedestrians.\n''Look at this man!'' shouted Balvinder Singh, an Indian cabbie, as he drove along Broadway in midtown. A pedestrian was crossing in front of his taxi, lined up in the bull's-eye of his bumper.\n''I'll bet this man has a Ph.D.,'' he said. ''And I'll bet he is wearing a $1,000 suit. But he cares nothing for his life, nothing at all!''\nMr. Mersey offered some rough estimates regarding pedestrian traffic: ''If I kept going until I ran into every jaywalker, I would kill 200 a shift.''\nThe city's 12,187 yellow cabs are regulated by the Taxi and Limousine Commission, which publishes a 45-page booklet of rules pertaining to driving, courtesy, rate cards, meters, roof lights, seat belts, where to pick up and where to drop off.\nWhile each rule has its own logical purpose, taken together they demand a near-perfect standard of performance that few cabbies can attain.\n''It is a Draconian system that would make life difficult for anyone,'' said Guy Roberts, a one-time driver who now operates his own fleet of 111 cabs. ''Nobody says the laws should not be enforced, but drivers -- and we're talking about low-income people -- are being seriously harassed with stupid tickets for stupid rules: $100 for a single light bulb being burned out.''\nCabbies hate being pulled over for routine inspections by the police. They are fined if a receipt is found hanging from the meter, if a piece of paper is found lying on the floor, if a smudge of dirt has stained the back seat, if an incomplete entry is logged on the trip card.\n''Most drivers are from the Indian subcontinent, and immigrant groups have always had problems with the police,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''Their culture is different, their English is not the best. They get treated with contempt. The Irish went through it, the Italians, the Jews. Now it's the Indians' turn.''\nIn 1995, the Police Department was ordered to form a special unit to enforce the host of T.L.C. regulations for yellow cabs. By 1997, the number of summonses against drivers had more than doubled, according to city statistics.\n''Taxi drivers have a tremendous responsibility and they need to be held to a higher standard,'' said Capt. Walter Smith, who runs the police taxi unit. ''After all, they are carrying precious human cargo.''\nThe higher standard often results in double penalties. If a police officer tickets a cabby for a moving violation, the state Department of Motor Vehicles then alerts the T.L.C., which mails the driver a second summons. This is widely known as ''the double zap.'' Violating a traffic law is a violation of a T.L.C. law.\n''Yes, there are bad taxi drivers, but the penalties are too high for even the good ones, and now Mayor Giuliani wants to make them even worse,'' said Mohammad J. Hussain, a Bangladeshi driver. ''The taxi drivers have no union, just splinter groups. We have no power against someone like the Mayor.''\nIf cabdrivers ever did attain some power, the Bastille they would want to storm would be the T.L.C. court on Queens Boulevard in Long Island City. Most every summons requires a T.L.C. hearing, and most every hearing requires the loss of a day's pay in an hours-long wait in an overcrowded building for an inevitable fine.\n''People think the cabdriver is crazy,'' Mr. Singh said. ''They should come to the T.L.C. court and find out what drives the cabdriver crazy.''",

    "text": "Congressional Fact-Finding in Saipan: They Came. They Saw. They Golfed.\n1998-01-20T05:00:00.000Z\nAt least five members of Congress and dozens of Congressional aides have traveled a grueling 9,000 miles, crossed nine time zones and endured serious jet lag, all in the name of diligent fact finding.\nTheir destination: Saipan, a volcanic island and capital of the Northern Marianas, a chain of 14 islands in the western Pacific that is a commonwealth of the United States. The islands, which are about 3,500 miles west of Hawaii, boast crystalline lagoons, balmy climes, championship golf courses and, for the free-market minded, relaxed wage and immigration rules.\nThe bills for the journeys, which can run as high as $5,500 for one person for one week, were paid by the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which is trying hard to keep its exemption from Federal minimum wage and immigration laws.\n''You have people coming here who, before they came on the trip, couldn't find Saipan on the map and have no direct responsibility over it, no history of involvement,'' said Representative George Miller of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Resources Committee who is a vocal critic of the commonwealth's low wages and labor policies. ''It's just a pure and simple lobbying job.''\nFor the past year and a half, the office of the commonwealth's Governor has conducted an ambitious public relations campaign, paying millions of dollars for fact-finding trips and in fees to Washington lobbyists, particularly the law firm of Preston, Gates, Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds.\nWhat sets this lobbying strategy apart from others is the success that the Marianas government has had in convincing Congressional Republicans that Democrats are wrong in pushing a bill that would raise wages and curtail immigration there.\nOver the New Year's holiday, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip who has been a staunch supporter of the commonwealth's policies, made the trip to Micronesia with his wife, his daughter and three aides. He stayed for five work-filled days but also found time to play two rounds of golf on a pristine seaside golf course. Upon his return, Mr. DeLay proclaimed the Democrats' legislation dead.\nThe government-paid trips, first reported by Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper, have become especially popular in the last year, when the former Governor of the Northern Marianas, Froilan Tenorio, sensed a threat from the Clinton Administration to the islands' status quo. The Administration has described the laws as exploitative to workers.\nCalled to action, the Washington lobbyists hired by the commonwealth got to work. They extended invitations to nearly all members of Congress and their aides, as well as to officials of conservative research centers and newspaper editorial writers, to ''educate'' them about the Northern Marianas, said Jack Abramoff, the Preston, Gates lobbyist who arranged the trips. As many as 80 Congressional staff members, most of them Republicans who espouse free-market beliefs and dislike Democratic labor policies, have visited the island courtesy of the government.\n''They don't have a Congressman or a delegate to the United States,'' Mr. Abramoff said. ''It's the farthest territory from the United States. Nobody knew anything about it. And the Federal bureaucracy, which for so long had a paternalistic and almost colonialist rule over these guys, said let's make a move on their economy.''\nAfter World War I, Japan controlled Saipan and the Northern Marianas under a League of Nations mandate. Saipan, which was the site of a Japanese air base in World War II, was seized by United States forces in July 1944 after a three-week battle in which 3,400 Americans and 27,000 Japanese were killed. The island, 13 miles long and about 5 miles wide, then became a base for air attacks on the Japanese home islands.\nSaipan and the other Northern Marianas voted to become a commonwealth in 1975. To help stimulate industry, the United States agreed to exempt it from Federal minimum wage and immigration laws.\nNow Democrats say the exemption should be revoked. Most of the garment factories are not owned by American citizens. The workers hail mostly from China, Bangladesh and the Philippines, brought in for one or two years and paid $3.05 an hour, compared with $5.15 in the United States. So many workers have arrived -- 35,000 -- that they outnumber Saipan's permanent residents.\nTo the Democrats' chagrin, the clothing can be shipped to the United States with labels that say ''Made in the U.S.A. With Imported Fabric,'' because Saipan is American soil. Earlier this week the bipartisan United States Commission on Immigration Reform deplored what it described as systematic labor and human-rights violations relating to the treatment of workers there.\nBut Congressional visitors on Government-paid trips return home with a rosier picture of the islands, said Allen Stayman, an Interior Department official and critic of commonwealth policies.\nSaipan is ''essentially being taken over by Asian garment interests who are exploiting it for their own greed,'' said Mr. Stayman.\nAt least five members of Congress have made government-paid trips to Saipan in the past year and a half, but the island's most illustrious Congressional visitor was Mr. DeLay, the Texas Republican, who came at the invitation of the former Governor, Mr. Tenorio. Mr. DeLay's trip was arranged by Mr. Abramoff, a friend who, along with his wife, contributed $4,000 to Mr. DeLay's 1998 re-election campaign.\nTo be sure, Mr. DeLay's official itinerary was chock full of meetings. He met with the former Governor and the new Governor, Pedro P. Tenorio, a relative of his predecessor. Mr. DeLay sat down with members of the legislature and with the Roman Catholic Bishop of Saipan, who touched on human rights.\nBut there was time for regaling and relaxing, too.\nMr. DeLay was honored and entertained every evening. One reception was given by a Hong Kong businessman, Willie Tan, who agreed in 1992 to pay $9 million in back wages for his companies' failure to pay garment workers overtime.\nAnd Mr. DeLay, an avid golfer, twice played on one of Saipan's finest golf courses, the Lao Lao Bay Golf Resort. He and his family also visited Managaha Island, a 10-acre island in the lagoon that is known for its snorkeling.\nWhen he returned to Washington, Mr. DeLay spoke glowingly of the commonwealth's economic policies and renewed his vow to block legislation that would tinker with its wage and immigration policies.\nMr. DeLay's press secretary, John P. Feehery, who accompanied him, said the Congressman wanted to see for himself whether Saipan's purported sweatshop conditions were as outrageous as the Democrats say.\n'' 'Tis the season to cry junket,'' Mr. Feehery said. ''He would not travel 30 hours for some fun in the sun. That's not what he's about.''\nBy and large, Republicans maintain that Mr. Stayman and other Democrats are simply doing the bidding of American labor unions. Saipan's policy, they say, has been fruitful and effective at making the islands increasingly self-sufficient.\nIt is an opinion they have honed during their visits to the Marianas.\nRepresentative Phil English, Republican of Pennsylvania, just returned from his own trip to Saipan, where he represented Congressional Republicans at the new Governor's inauguration.\nOther guests of the Marianas government have included Representatives Dana Rohrabacher, who later gave a complimentary speech about the commonwealth on the House floor, and Brian P. Bilbray, both California Republicans. Mr. Rohrabacher took his fiancee along, and Mr. Bilbray took his wife.\nBecause the commonwealth is the equivalent of a state government, the Congressmen did not have to disclose the trips in the same way as those paid for by private businesses. At least four Democrats have made the trip, but the Marianas government did not pay the expenses of three of them. Mr. Miller, who introduced legislation to change the wage and immigrations laws, visited the island this week. His expenses were paid for by taxpayers because he traveled on committee business.\nThe same will apply for Representative Don Young, the Alaska Republican who leads the Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over the commonwealth, and 10 members of the panel, who plan to visit Saipan in February. But one of Mr. Young's aides took a trip there earlier this month, paid for by the commonwealth.\nSome members of Congress are distancing themselves from the Pacific voyages.\n''You can't make a decision here in Washington that affects the Northern Marianas with your head stuck in the sand,'' said Ken Johnson, press secretary for Representative W. J. (Billy) Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who decided this week not to take the February trip.\n''That said,'' Mr. Johnson continued, ''there have been instances where staff members have been shielded from seeing and talking to people who would be able to shed some light on what is happening over there. You're only going to see what they want you to see.''",

    "text": "THE BABY BUST: A special report.; Population Implosion Worries a Graying Europe\n1998-07-10T05:00:00.000Z\nMia Hulton is a true woman of the late 20th century. Soft-spoken, well-educated and thoughtful, she sings Renaissance music in a choral group, lives quietly with the man she loves and works like a demon seven days a week.\nAt 33, she is in full pursuit of an academic career. And despite the fact that she lives in Sweden -- which provides more support for women who want families than any other country -- Ms. Hulton doesn't see how she can possibly make room in her life for babies. Someday maybe, but certainly not soon.\n''There are times when I think perhaps I will be missing something important if I don't have a child,'' she said slowly, trying to put her complicated desires into simple words. ''But today women finally have so many chances to have the life they want. To travel and work and learn. It's exciting and demanding. I just find it hard to see where the children would fit in.''\nMs. Hulton would never consider herself a radical, but she has become a cadre in one of the fundamental social revolutions of the century.\nDriven largely by prosperity and freedom, millions of women -- here and throughout the developed world -- are having fewer children than ever before. They stay in school longer, put more emphasis on work and marry later. As a result, birth rates in many countries are now in a rapid, sustained decline. Never before -- except in times of plague, war and deep economic depression -- have birth rates fallen so low, for so long.\nWhat was once regarded universally as a cherished goal -- incredibly low birth rates -- have in the industrial world at least suddenly become a cause for alarm. With life expectancy rising at the same time that fertility drops, most developed countries may soon find themselves with lopsided societies that will be nearly impossible to sustain: a large number of elderly and not enough young people working to support them. The change will affect every program -- from health care and education to pension plans and military spending -- that requires public funds.\nThere is no longer a single country in Europe where people are having enough children to replace themselves when they die. Italy recently became the first nation in history where there are more people over the age of 60 than there are under the age of 20. This year Germany, Greece and Spain will probably all cross the same eerie divide.\n''You can look at this in a philosophical way,'' said Jean-Claude Chesnais, director of research at France's National Institute for the Study of Demography. No country has worried more, or more publicly, about the implications of a low birth rate (which is the rate not for individual mothers but of whole societies). Like so many other European nations, uneasy officials in France see in current trends a world where populations of color -- in Africa, India, Asia -- are still growing, while their own is struggling to keep from shrinking.\n''Europe is old and rigid,'' Mr. Chesnais said. ''So it is fading. You can see that as the natural cycle of civilization, perhaps something inevitable. And in many ways low population growth is wonderful. Certainly to control fertility in China, Bangladesh, much of Africa -- that is an absolute triumph. Yet we must look beyond simple numbers. And here I think Europe may be in the vanguard of a very profound trend. Because you cannot have a successful world without children in it.''\nThe Outlook\nWorldwide Drop Confounds Experts\nThe effects of the shift will resonate far beyond Europe. Last year Japan's fertility rate -- the number of children born on average to a woman -- fell to 1.39, the lowest level it has ever reached. In the United States, where a large pool of new immigrants help keep the fertility rate higher than in any other prosperous country, the figure is still slightly below an average of 2.1 children per woman -- the magic number needed to keep the population from starting to shrink.\nEven in the developing world, where overcrowding remains a major cause of desperation and disease, the pace of growth has slowed almost everywhere. Since 1965, according to United Nations population data, the fertility rate in the third world has been cut in half -- from 6 children per woman to 3. In the last decade alone, for example, the figure in Bangladesh has fallen from 6.2 children per woman to 3.4. That's a bigger drop than in the previous two centuries.\nLittle more than 25 years have passed since a famous set of computer studies sponsored by the Club of Rome, the global think tank, showed that population pressures would devastate the world by the mid-1990's.\nNothing of the kind has come to pass. The authors of that dire forecast could not have foreseen 30 years ago that women in countries like Italy would by now be producing an average of fewer than 1.2 children, the lowest figure ever recorded among humans. Or that the Berlin wall would disappear, creating economic uncertainties that have frozen the birth rate from the Black Forest to Vladivostok. In a world where women work more than ever before and contraception remains readily available, it is hard to find somebody who believes that someday soon large families will make a comeback.\n''I'm thinking of having children in the future, perhaps two,'' said Roberta Lenzi, 27, who is single and studies political science in Bologna, Italy, the city with the lowest fertility rate in the world.\n''I'm an only child and if I could, I'd have more than one child. But most couples I know wait until their 30's to have children. People want to have their own life, they want to have a successful career. When you see life in these terms, children are an impediment. At most you'll have one, more are rare.''\nThere has long been an assumption that low birth rates were better than high birth rates. Fewer people put less strain on the resources of the planet. And anyway, as a country becomes richer its people always have fewer children. If more people are needed immigration can be a solution -- and in many places, specialists now think it's the only one left. But Europe, unlike the United States, has been resistant to immigration.\n''What is happening now has simply never happened before in the history of the world,'' said Nicholas Eberstadt, a demographer based at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ''This is terra incognita. If these trends continue, in a generation or two there may be countries where most people's only blood relatives will be their parents.''\n''Would it be a lonelier and sadder world?'' he continued. ''Yes, I think it would. But that might simply be the limits of my own imagination. Frankly, it's just impossible to really conceive of what this world will be like in 50 years. But when you come to the end of one era it's almost always impossible to see your way into the next.''\nThe Watershed\nBirth Incentives No Longer Work\nPerhaps no country has tried harder to change the future than Sweden.\nDecades ago, with its birth rate dwindling, Sweden decided to support family life with a public generosity found nowhere else. Couples who both work and have small children enjoy cash payments, tax incentives and job leaves combined with incredible flexibility to work part time for as many as eight years after a child's birth.\nSweden spends 10 times as much as Italy or Spain on programs intended to support families. It spends nearly three times as much per person on such programs as the United States. So there should be no surprise that Sweden, despite its wealth, had the highest birth rate in Europe by 1991.\nWith 10 million mostly middle-class people, this country may have little in common with any other. But the experience here clearly suggested that if countries wanted more babies they would have to pay for them, through tax incentives, parental leave programs and family support. At least that's what nearly all the experts thought it showed.\n''We were a model for the world,'' said Marten Lagergren, Under Secretary in the Ministry of Social Health and Welfare, and the man responsible for figuring out what is happening with Sweden's birth rate. ''They all came to examine us. People thought we had some secret. Unfortunately, it seems that we do not.''\nSometime after 1990 the bottom dropped out of Sweden's baby boom. Between then and 1995, the fertility rate fell sharply, from 2.12 to 1.6. Most people blamed the economy, which had turned sour and forced politicians to trim -- ever so slightly -- the country's benefit program. It is normal for people to put off having children when the future looks doubtful, so the change made sense.\nBut then the economy got better and the fertility rate fell faster and farther than ever. By March of this year the figure for Sweden was the almost same as that in Japan -- 1.42. And though it's too soon to say, officials here think it might be falling still.\n''Nobody on earth can tell you what is going on here,'' said Mac Murray, a philosopher trained in statistics who is in charge of strategic planning for the nation's school system. ''Sometimes I think it must be just a blip -- we've had them before -- and everything will turn out the way we expect it to. But I guess I don't really believe that. I believe we are seeing a fundamental shift in human behavior. We have lived for 200 years on the idea of progress. That the future will be better than the past. It's a universal belief -- not just in our little country.\n''But I think those days have ended now. I have no data to support my views. But young people now seem to have a sense that living for today is about the best they can do.''\nIt is Mr. Murray's job to plan for the material implications of these changes. But it's not going to be easy. Sweden has 6,000 schools serving children from the ages of 6 to 18. This year there are more than 130,000 8-year-olds in the system -- 1990 was a boom year for births. They need classrooms and teachers and all the support that goes with them.\nBut in just three years the 8-year-old population will shrink drastically, to 75,000. ''So what are we doing?'' Mr. Murray asked rhetorically. ''We are recruiting more teachers now than ever before and giving them raises that nobody else can hope to have. Have you ever tried to tell a politician to plan for something that's 20 years away?'' It is a problem felt across Europe as the elderly supplant the young.\nThere used to be many more young people than old people in the world. Right now there are roughly equal numbers. But by 2050, according to data supplied by the European Union, there will be nearly twice as many old people as young people. Yet most governments programs still encourage people to retire early.\n''The whole system is backward,'' said Massimo Livi-Bacci, a professor of demography at the University of Florence. ''In Italy we are paying people to retire at an earlier age than ever before even though we know they are now going to live longer than ever before. We have the best pension system in Europe and the worst system for family support. Rich old people supported by the labor of poor young people. No wonder nobody wants to have a family.''\nThe Perception\nThe Good Life Is Top Priority\nAsk dozens of people, and few of them even realize that the birth rate is dropping all across Europe. When they do think about it, most people see it as somebody else's problem.\n''I am supposed to have an extra child to help the system?'' said Jan Delaror, a recently married marketing expert. Mr. Delaror says he has no children but expects to ''if and when it makes sense, not because the Government thinks it's a good idea.''\nMr. Delaror was standing in the middle of the Sture Gallery, one of Stockholm's many exclusive malls. He was trying to decide whether to buy a box of Havana cigars, for several hundred dollars, or to wait until he traveled to London in a few weeks.\n''It's not as easy to have children these days as it once was,'' he said, voicing a commonly held belief. ''The sacrifices are not always acceptable.''\nIn surveys young couples almost always report that they want two children -- but many also mention the future and their concerns for maintaining a good life. It doesn't seem to matter that materially at least -- people in the developed world live better now than they ever have. There is a perception -- shared even in vastly different countries like Sweden and Italy -- that what was possible for previous generations is not possible for this one.\n''I'd like to have a child but my work situation is unstable,'' said Francesca Casotti, 29, a lawyer in Rome who has been married nine months. ''I'm at the office all day and it is difficult to think about having a child. People my age want their freedom. They see children as a burden, as an inconvenience. I'd like to have a stable job and I'd like to have more than one child. But there is the economic question.''\n''Children cost more than they used to,'' she continued. ''Today you have to bring them to the pool and you need to get a nanny, and they have to learn a foreign language. Children have more needs. Parents just didn't think of all these things before.''\nNot everyone agrees, of course, that the need for pool memberships or foreign language tuition is responsible for such a remarkable drop in birth rates.\n''We have become so selfish, so greedy,'' said Ninni Lundblad, 31, a biologist who works in Stockholm. Ms. Lundblad has no children but hopes that will soon change.\n''Did your parents sit down with a spreadsheet and figure out whether they could afford to have two or three children?'' she said, her bright eyes widening at the absurdity of her own statement. ''No, of course not. Did this ever happen before anywhere? No, of course not. We live in the richest place and at the best time, and everyone is worrying whether they can afford to take their next vacation or buy a boat. It's kind of sickening.''\nThe Epicenter\nA Shift in Focus From Young to Old\nIf there is a ground zero in the epidemic of low fertility it would have to be in the northern Italian city of Bologna, where women give birth to an average of fewer than one child (in 1997, the number was 0.8). The city has more highly educated women than any other in the country. Produce is cheap, food is wonderful and living is generally easy.\nThe local population has dropped steadily for two decades, but 1,500 people turn 75 every year. Fewer children and more elderly mean a greater need for health care programs and specialized housing and transportation. But that does nothing to encourage young couples to have families. This year the budgets for retirees and children are roughly the same in Bologna, a city of 375,000. Next year 5 percent will be shifted from the young to the old. And that will happen every year for the next decade as the city becomes filled with elderly and starved for children.\nHow did Italy, a largely Catholic country that has always been seen as the stereotypical land of big, close-knit families, attain the world's lowest level of fertility?\n''Prosperity has strangled us,'' said Pierpaolo Donati, professor of sociology at the University of Bologna and a leading Catholic intellectual. ''Comfort is now the only thing anybody believes in,'' he said. ''The ethic of sacrifice for a family -- one of the basic ideas of human societies -- has become a historical notion. It is astonishing.''\nWhere Dr. Donati sees selfishness, however, others see women who have been placed under monumental stress. To some minds, the women of Italy -- have the worst of both worlds. They now work for a living in record numbers, but tremendous obstacles remain for balancing work and family life.\nFar more than in places like Sweden, France, or even the United States, the Italian man still seeks a wife who will make his dinner every night and who takes complete charge of the family. Women have responded by realizing that with only 24 hours in each day something has to give. Children seem to have become that something.\nWhatever the reasons, the changes, and what they will mean, are difficult to ignore. In 20 years, at present birth rates, for every child under the age of 5 in Bologna there will be 25 people over the age of 50 -- and 10 of them will be older than 80.\n''It is impossible to have a human society built like this,'' Dr. Donati said. ''Something simply has to change.''\nWalter Vitali agrees. The Mayor of the longtime leftish town -- its nickname Red Bologna still stands -- Mr. Vitali is a former Communist who likes to invoke the name of the city's Cardinal when talking about population figures.\n''The Cardinal says our lack of interest in families symbolizes our loss of faith in ourselves,'' he said. ''It's sort of hard to disagree with that. Let's face it, something is going on here that is very troubling.''\nBut exactly how troubling is it, and for whom? The birth rate is dropping but there are still plenty of people on the earth. As a result, the world's population is still growing rapidly, and that will not stop for at least another generation -- when more than two thirds of all countries are at or below the replacement level. The fertility rate of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, has soared to 8.8 children per woman. The 45 nations of East, West and Middle Africa average more than six births per woman.\nRight now the populations of Europe (including Russia) and Africa are about the same. If trends continue, by 2050 Africans will outnumber Europeans three to one. And in that same year, half of all residents of Italy will be over the age of 50. Half of the residents of Iraq will be under 25.\n''The truth is there doesn't have to be a demographic catastrophe,'' said Lalla Golfarelli, the head of family planning in Bologna. ''Look at a map. Look at Europe on that map. We are all only two to four hours away by boat or plane away from many countries with many people. Open the gates. Immigration can solve this problem. If people would just open their minds they would realize there are enough people on this earth to go around.''\nJan Hoem, head of the demographics faculty at the University of Stockholm, warned against alarmism. ''The world is hardly about to disappear. It's just becoming a very different place.''",

    "text": "Once Widowed in India, Twice Scorned\n1998-03-29T05:00:00.000Z\nGovind Dasi has only a vague sense of the passing years, but this much she knows: She was married at 12 in her native village outside Calcutta, widowed at 14 when her teen-age husband died of tuberculosis, then forced to work as an unpaid servant for her mother-in-law for about 30 years.\nAbout 15 years ago, penniless and despairing, she boarded a train for the 1,000-mile journey west to Vrindavan, the holy city that has been a point of convergence for Indian widows for at least 500 years.\nIf Govind does not remember exactly how long she has been here, it is partly because she is illiterate, and partly because of the seamlessness of time.\nLike the other widows who migrate to this city in central India, she makes her way before dawn each day to one of 4,000 Hindu temples, where she joins in chants to the deity Krishna. Her surname, Dasi, ''servant'' in Hindi, is adopted by all the widows here to show their religious devotion.\nAlong with poverty, illiteracy and malnutrition, many Indians regard the plight of the 33 million Hindu widows as one of the darkest blots on the nation's conscience -- one that 200 years of social activism and legislation has only partly erased. To be a Hindu widow in the 1990's, at least a poor one, according to Uma Chakravarty, a sociologist at Delhi University, is still to suffer ''social death.''\nThe core of the problem lies in what Indian sociologists call patri-local residence -- the custom of Hindu brides' marrying into their husbands' families, largely severing ties with their own.\nIn many cases, especially when widowhood comes early, this leaves a woman dependent on in-laws whose main interest after her husband's death is to rid the family of the burden of supporting her.\nBut like many of Vrindavan's widows, Govind has little inclination to bewail her fate.\n''Whatever happens to us happens; it is our karma,'' she said, referring to the Hindu belief that life's fortunes are dictated by good or evil deeds in former lives.\n''In any case, if we say we are suffering, who is going to bother? We will still be alone, and we will still be left with only one solution, to pray to God. It is our life, and we must live it, and hope for better in the next.''\nWhen they are not chanting in the temples, most of the 5,000 widows here spend that life alone, without family, often without proper shelter, and with no savings beyond the few rupees they tuck into their saris.\nMany came here voluntarily to escape the miseries of life as outcasts in their native villages, as Govind did. Others were brought by their families on the pretext of making pilgrimages, then abandoned.\nFor most, survival is assured by meager handouts of rice and lentils at the temples, coupled with a stipend of two rupees -- about five cents -- if they chant for four hours in the evening, on top of the four morning hours of holy choruses.\nSome live beneath stairwells, on verandas or in makeshift shelters, using old jute matting or discarded clothing for bedcovers.\nBut even those with a bit of money fear eviction. Slum landlords are eager to join a housing boom that has been driven partly by the young Westerners who come in the thousands as Krishna devotees.\nFor the younger widows -- some barely teen-agers despite laws that forbid child marriages -- there is the additional threat of being forced into sex with landlords, rickshaw drivers, policemen, even Hindu holy men.\nThis, too, has historically been part of the widows' lot. The tradition of their being forced to have sex with other men in their husbands' families, or to sell sex, was once so widespread that the Hindi word ''randi,'' or widow, became a synonym for prostitute.\nGovind's life is better than many. Along with her chanting, she works as a seamstress in a garment factory, earning 500 rupees a month to supplement the 125 rupees she gets as a widow's pension.\nThis is enough to pay for a room on the edge of the city, and a few small comforts, like a spare sari in the white muslin that is the traditional widow's garb, and a pair of sandals, as she would otherwise go barefoot. Still, she worries about what will happen when she grows too old to work or walk to the temples.\n''Life is not happy, but it is not so unhappy either,'' she said as she sat on the floor of a local schoolhouse, where she gathered with a dozen other widows who visit to get help from the principal, Kamala Ghosh.\nGovind went on, ''But when I think of the future, then I get worried.'' Voice breaking, eyes brimming, she paused. Then, composed again, she resumed. ''It's all karma anyway, so what's the use of thinking?''\nMrs. Ghosh, 51, is in a long line of Hindu activists going back to Ram Mohan Roy, an early 19th-century reformer. One of Mr. Roy's goals was the banning of the custom of suttee, the immolation of widows on their husbands' funeral pyres. Suttee was outlawed by a British colonial governor, Lord William Bentinck, in 1829.\nDespite the ban, the practice has survived, with occasional reports of widows dousing themselves with fuel and setting themselves alight, either voluntarily or under duress. Murders of widows are much more common.\nThe cause of both is most often conflict over property, particularly land. Widows are pitted against their husbands' families, or sometimes their own sons and daughters. Much of the misery inflicted on them through the centuries is rooted in this issue.\nMrs. Ghosh has won the widows' loyalty by battling for them: with landlords over rent-gouging or eviction orders; with bureaucrats who delay or deny pensions until thick files of paperwork have accumulated or sufficient bribes have been paid, and -- most difficult of all -- with those said to have sexually harassed them.\nAlthough Indian studies have shown that widows' sexual vulnerability is an entrenched fact of life, most widows are reluctant to acknowledge the problem for fear of being barred from the temples or otherwise ostracized.\n''No! No! We are married to Lord Krishna,'' the women at Mrs. Ghosh's schoolhouse said in chorus, after an exchange of glances, when asked about unwanted sex.\nVrindavan's appeal to widows over the centuries has rested on the belief that Krishna, the most human incarnation of the universal Hindu God Vishnu, played along the banks of the Jumna River here as a boy and teased young girls as they bathed in it.\nKrishna's appeal to the widows is said to lie partly in his boyhood waywardness, and partly, in his adult incarnation, as the ideal lover.\nAs with the battle to uproot some of the most regressive aspects of the ancient Hindu social hierarchy known as caste, those who fight for widows' rights must reckon with ancient scriptures.\nAccording to the Skanda Purana, an early Hindu text, widows are to be avoided.\n''The widow is more inauspicious than all other inauspicious things,'' it says. ''At the sight of a widow, no success can be had in any undertaking; excepting one's mother, all widows are void of auspiciousness. A wise man should avoid even her blessings like the poison of a snake.''\nAttitudes evolve at a glacial pace, especially in the 650,000 villages where nearly three-quarters of all Indians live.\nThe banning of suttee was followed in the late 1800's by another British law removing the Hindu ban on remarriage. But the taboo on second marriages has remained strong.\nAnother widow at the Vrindavan schoolhouse, Urmila Dasi, 35, who was married at 11 in her village in Bangladesh and widowed at 14, said she had longed for a second husband and children, but abandoned the idea.\n''I dreamed of it,'' she said, ''but I was told that society would not permit it, that if I did it anyway, I would be an outcast. But I was only a child then. Later I came to understand that if I remarried, the honor of my family would be lost, that it is our Hindu custom to have only one husband and that if he died, it was only because I had bad karma. And if I had bad karma, what was the point of remarrying?''\nSince independence, Indian governments have revised inheritance laws to entrench widows' rights to a share of their husbands' property, and legislated for pensions. But more often than not, laws are circumvented.\nOne study found that inheritance laws often served to entrap women. Their husbands' families, intent on preventing division of land and homes, frequently forced them to remarry back into the family.\nThe old customs mean that many Hindu girls are twice blighted. Parents eager to unburden themselves of a daughter arrange a childhood marriage, and widowhood leaves the woman unwanted again.\nGovind still weeps when she recalls the miseries after her husband died in the early 1950's.\n''It was terrible working all those years as my mother-in-law's servant,'' she said. ''But here things are much better. All around, there are cries of 'Krishna! Krishna!' and that makes me feel as though I belong.''",

    "text": "Lawyer's Fall Rends Immigrants' Lives; Search for Help in Gaining Work Permit Leads to Deportation\n1998-10-23T05:00:00.000Z\nIn the tightly ordered, self-contained world of Li Yu Mei and Wei Liang Li there is little room for chaos.\nMarried just over a year ago, the couple, Chinese immigrants who live in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, had planned their life down to the last detail. Their marital bed is big enough to accommodate the children they hoped to have (''so no one rolls off the bed,'' Ms. Mei says). They had talked about having a girl next year, the Chinese Year of the Rabbit, so that she would be soft and pure. The following year, the Year of the Dragon, they hoped for a boy, so that he would be strong and daring.\nBut the events of the last week have wrecked their plans.\nMr. Li, a 26-year-old handyman who came to the country illegally in 1994, is now being held in a Federal detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., where he awaits deportation to China. Ms. Mei, a 25-year-old graduate from the University of Rhode Island, is trying to stop his deportation by calling lawyers and sending faxes to the White House and human rights organizations.\n''I wake up every night and don't see him next to me and I just cannot go back to sleep,'' said Ms. Mei, who cried throughout a recent interview. ''I don't know what I'm going to do without him or even if I can go on.''\nMr. Li's predicament is an object lesson on how everything can go wrong, and usually does, when immigrants who do not speak English and do not understand the laws of the United States try -- by themselves or following the bad advice of inept or corrupt lawyers -- to decipher the intricate ways of the immigration laws.\nMr. Li's arrest comes at a time when Federal officials have a mandate and the resources to detain and deport more people than ever before, because of a 1996 law that makes it harder for illegal immigrants to stay in the United States.\nMr. Li, his wife said, was the victim of a bad lawyer who filed a political asylum claim on his behalf three years ago. Ms. Mei said her husband, who had no intention of seeking political asylum, had gone to the lawyer only for a work permit. Without Mr. Li's understanding of the process, she said, the asylum claim was filed and denied. That denial led to a 1996 order of deportation that Mr. Li ignored. His wife said that without telling him the contents of the order, his lawyer had advised him to ignore it.\nIt is not possible to know what Mr. Li's former lawyer, Sheldon Walker, can say in his defense or even if he recalls Mr. Li's case. Mr. Walker, a 60-year-old immigration lawyer from Great Neck, N.Y., is finishing the first month of a 42-month sentence in a Federal prison for defrauding the Immigration and Naturalization Service and misleading thousands of clients who sought his help at his Manhattan office near Pennsylvania Station.\nMost of Mr. Walker's clients were non-English-speaking immigrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, India, Turkey, China and the former Yugoslavia. Prosecutors in the criminal division of the United States Attorney's Office in Manhattan got an indictment of Mr. Walker with the help of dozens of his former clients. Seven of them testified at his two-week trial in May.\nThe immigrants testified that they had gone to Mr. Walker hoping to receive a work permit. Mr. Walker had told them that for $600 he could get them the permit, a much-sought-after privilege. Some of them did not even know that Mr. Walker had applied instead for their political asylum until prosecutors seeking evidence against Mr. Walker showed them the asylum application with their signatures.\nMr. Walker's mishandling of thousands of cases has caused many expensive and time-consuming administrative problems for the I.N.S. In a letter sent to the judge during the sentencing of Mr. Walker last month, Edward J. McElroy, I.N.S. district director in New York, said that Mr. Walker's conviction would force the agency to scrutinize all pending applications filed by his office and, most likely, also lead to a review of old cases in which benefits were granted.\nBecause Mr. Li was not granted any benefit from the application Mr. Walker filed on his behalf, his case is not up for review, though. Following an agency policy of not discussing individual cases, I.N.S. officials declined to answer questions about Mr. Li this week.\nMr. Li's ordeal began Oct. 14, when, accompanied by his wife, he walked into the immigration office in lower Manhattan for a much-awaited interview on his attempt to legalize his status. After marrying Ms. Mei last year, he had applied to obtain legal permanent residency, or what is commonly known as a green card. (Ms. Mei, who came from China when she was 12, is an American citizen.)\nThe couple hoped that within an hour, Mr. Li would walk out with a green card. Instead, Mr. Li and Ms. Mei were ushered into an office on the 12th floor. There, an immigration officer asked Ms. Mei to translate his words to her husband.\n''He said: 'Ask your husband if he has anything he wants to give to you, because we are going to take him now. He is on his way to China,' '' Ms. Mei recalled. ''And that was it. My husband was gone in five minutes.''\nSince then, Mr. Li has been held at the Elizabeth, N.J., detention center. The day after his arrest, Mr. Li came within 10 minutes of deportation. Immigration officials shackled him and took him to Kennedy International Airport, hoping to send him to China. Just before he boarded the plane, his new lawyers filed a motion to stop the deportation. Mr. Li was sent back to the detention center but the motion was denied later and so was the appeal.\nMr. Li's new lawyers, Stephanie Yutkin and Theodore N. Cox, were able to postpone the deportation only after filing a request for what is commonly known as a torture convention interview, a last-minute appeal that stops the process while the authorities determine whether the immigrant is likely to be tortured on returning to his country.\nMs. Mei says she so wants to be with her husband that if he is deported to China, she will follow. That could present a problem, though. Ms. Mei, who was born in the province of Guangdong, about an hour's drive from Hong Kong, is what she calls a black-market child. Because her parents already had a child when she was born and China has strict laws that allow one one child per family, Ms. Mei's birth and young life were not properly recorded in her own country.\n''It's like I don't exist over there,'' she said. ''My parents always had to bribe officials to hide my presence everywhere we lived and to be able to send me to school.''\nAnd because the rule about having only one child per family has become even more strict in recent years, Ms. Mei is also reluctant to return to a country that would limit the number of children she can have. Having a family is especially important for Mr. Li, an only child whose mother was forced to have five abortions, Ms. Mei said.\nMr. Li so wanted to become a father, Ms. Mei said, that he had already bought a pretty little frame with room for two pictures. The frame, resting on a shelf near a sunny window, is for the first baby portraits of their future children.\nProsecutors in the United States Attorney's Office declined to discuss Mr. Li's case beyond what they argued in court. Their argument hinges on the contention that Mr. Li could not possibly have been lied to by his lawyer because in 1995, he attended an asylum hearing, at which he testified in detail about how, as a student leader in China, he had been a victim of persecution. That hearing should have indicated to him that he was seeking political asylum, not work authorization, prosecutors said.\nIn addition, they said, even if he was lied to by his lawyer, he should have been alert enough to understand that something was amiss when he had signed the letter of deportation he had received. At the very least, a prosecutor said, he should have walked into an immigration office when he received the deportation order, in order to inquire about it. He could also have turned his lawyer in, they said.\nHis lawyers vehemently argue that Mr. Li had been misled and could not possibly have understood the legal or bureaucratic terms involved.\nProsecutors also point to the findings of the immigration judge who ruled against Mr. Li in his 1995 asylum hearing. The judge noticed the rehearsed way in which Mr. Li was testifying. In denying his claim, the judge noted that Mr. Li's demeanor in court was not that of someone speaking from personal experience; instead, he appeared to be trying hard to recall facts he had memorized.\nAnd indeed he may have been. His wife has not asked him about this and it is not possible to communicate with Mr. Li now that he is detained. His current lawyers said he was repeating in court what he had been told.\nDuring court testimony in Mr. Walker's case, it was revealed that he instructed his employees to prepare fictitious stories of persecution for his clients to use, based on boilerplate model stories that Mr. Walker maintained in his files.\nMr. Li's new lawyers said that Mr. Walker's conviction should allow the courts or the I.N.S. to reopen their client's case.\n''They put the lawyer in jail, they know what he did and how and they are unwilling to give a break to one of his clients,'' Ms. Yutkin said. ''It's outrageous! I have never seen anything like this in my years of practice.''\nAlan J. Stopek, who has been practicing immigration law in New York since 1969 and is not connected to Mr. Li's case, said it was possible that Mr. Li went through the entire process of applying for political asylum without fully understanding what he was doing.\n''I see cases like that all the time,'' he said yesterday. ''People, sometimes not even lawyers, who file asylum claims for clients who don't know anybody. I just saw one last week in court. A lawyer was coaching a woman from Jamaica to say that she suffered persecution in her country because she is an educated woman, which is, of course, a lie.''\nProsecutors said Mr. Li's case was the first known to them in which an immigrant sought to avoid deportation using Mr. Walker's conviction. Of the seven immigrants who testified at the trial, six had already managed to obtain permanent residency. One had not. A spokesman at the Federal Attorney's office said he was not promised a green card in exchange for his testimony.",

    "text": "An Islamic Reminder of the Sacred in Design\n1998-10-11T05:00:00.000Z\nAGA KHAN: the name shimmers with glamour. Fabulous wealth. Palatial houses. Racehorses. Yachts. Jewels. Royal prerogative. As if that weren't enough, the Aga Khan is also the most important figure in the world of architecture today. In a ceremony at the Alhambra in Spain last Friday, Prince Karim Aga Khan honored seven buildings and urban plans, winners of the 1998 Aga Khan Awards for Architecture.\nFounded in 1977 with the relatively modest aim of raising the standards of modern building in the Islamic world, the awards program has since become far more significant. By focusing the attention of Western architects, planners, historians, critics and the public on new building in the developing Islamic world, he has created a dynamic forum for defining architecture's place in the global culture emerging in the wake of the cold war.\nThough less well known than the Pritzker Architecture Prize -- often described as architecture's Nobel -- the Aga Khan's awards program has embraced a far broader cultural mission. Unlike the Pritzker Prize, the Aga Khan awards go to projects, not architects. In addition to appraising esthetic merit, jurors assess social needs, economic growth, environmental impact and the relationship between local traditions and innovations in contemporary architecture worldwide.\nThis year, for example, the winners include the restoration of Hebron Old Town on the West Bank, the design of a leper hospital in Chopda Taluka, India, a new arts center in Lahore, Pakistan, and Tuwaiq Palace, a recreation center for the diplomatic quarter in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The range of projects is typical of those awarded in previous years. They adhere to no esthetic school, historical style or theoretical doctrine. But they do expand ideas on architecture beyond Western frames of reference. And they alter the context in which even Western buildings should be appraised. Above all, the awards program has created an opportunity for Westerners to reckon with the withdrawal of architecture's spiritural dimension from the public realm.\nIn his commencement address at Brown University in 1996, the Aga Khan observed, ''For all Muslims, the concepts of Din and Dunya, Faith and World, are inextricably linked.'' At 61, the Aga Kahn is imam, or leader, of the Ismaili sect of Shia Muslims, an affluent group of about 13 million members who reside mainly in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya, Egypt, the former Soviet Republics and other communities worldwide. He traces his descent from Mohammed through Fatima, the Prophet's daughter. A man of independent wealth, he also receives tithes from his followers and uses the money to support public works in Ismaili communities.\nAs imam, the Aga Khan is responsible for the material as well as the spiritual well-being of his followers. Based at his Secretariat in Chantilly, less than an hour from Paris, the prince exercises his authority through the Aga Khan Development Network, a group of organizations that relies extensively on volunteers in Ismaili communities. The prince's interest in architecture began with his experience as a dissatisfied client, frustrated with the poor quality of the schools, hospitals, housing and other projects he had commissioned to serve Ismaili communities. Since then, he has also established a program to restore historic cities, including buildings in Cairo, Zanzibar and Samarkand, and funded the study of Islamic architecture at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania.\nI first learned of the awards in the late 1980's in Mimar, the prince's sumptuously produced magazine dedicated to new buildings and restoration projects in the Islamic world (alas, it has since ceased publication). Another royal, the Prince of Wales, was then making waves with attacks on modern architecture that were little more than dim appeals to reactionary taste.\nLike the British prince, the Aga Kahn sought to build upon architectural traditions But his approach was dramatically different. Instead of villainizing modernity as the enemy of history, he grasped that modernization is a part of history. He perceived that nothing historically significant could be achieved by merely hating the present.\nThe British and the Ismaili prince share one overarching concern: the withdrawal of architecture's sacred dimension from the public realm. Architecture is traditionally an art form of the rich, but it is also a medium that since prehistoric times has been used to stake a place for spiritual values in everyday life. As recently as the late 19th century, the design of ecclesiastical buildings played a central role in British architectural discourse. Today that focus has all but vanished. The extent to which its disappearance has made ours a time of mourning is perhaps not fully realized.\nI went to Turkey to look at a small group of projects that have received the Aga Khan Award for architecture over the years. My itinerary included a mosque in Ankara, a reforestation program outside the Turkish capital, a park in Istanbul and a group of vacation houses in the Aegean resort town of Bodrum, under the guidance of Suhah Ascan, an architect who directs the program from the Geneva offices of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. Turkey is not, as a matter of fact, a center of Ismaili life. Since 1922 it has been ruled, if at times tenuously, by a secular government. But, as a country that has long symbolized the threshhold between East and West, it is steeped in the cross-cultural spirit that guides the awards program.\nI wanted to look at buildings outside the superpower frame of reference, to step outside the membrane that has come to enclose much of American architecture within the environment of consumer fantasy. What drew me to the awards program initially was the belief that the end of the cold war had precipitated a crisis for American architecture, urbanism, and those who write about these fields. After World War II, architects enjoyed substantial moral authority, a reflection of their simultaneous commitment to creative discipline and social responsibility. Much of that authority has evaporated. Today, American architecture often resembles an infernal bubble machine run by evil clowns.\nAmusement parks with swan hotels, Egyptian gambling casinos, pseudo-urban shopping malls, gated communities, pasteboard versions of history with comic book historians to endorse them. It is as if all the energy once exerted to contain Soviet aggression has imploded, enclosing the world's superpower within the bubbular fantasy that a changing world can be understood by dominating it, monitoring it, contacting it through cyberspace.\nMosque of the Grand National Assembly, Ankara\nI'm finding it hard to focus on the architecture because I can't figure out why Can is still wearing his tan loafers. We're in a mosque, for heaven's sake. I've left my shoes outside, and I'm not even Muslim. Is Can trying to make a statement? Or perhaps the gaffe is mine. Maybe you're supposed to wear shoes in a mosque attached to the Turkish equivalent of our Capitol building: the legislative heart of a modern secular state. Both are reasonable conjectures. The building itself makes a political statement. It was deliberately designed to reinforce the secular government against those who would see Turkey ruled by clerical law.\nDesigned by Behruz Cinici, in association with his son, the stubbornly shod Can, the concrete building is situated on the secular equivalent of sacred soil. The Assembly's 1930's buildings, in modern classical style, embody the political legacy of Ataturk, modern Turkey's founder. Cinici, a student of the Assembly's architect, declared he would not design a conventional mosque on Ataturk's land.\nCritics of Mies van der Rohe's design for the Illinois Institution of Technology campus once complained that you can't distinguish the chapel from the boiler plant. The Assembly's mosque distances itself even further from the conventions of sacred architecture. It deliberately inverts the elements of traditional mosque design.\nIn many mosques, the entrance is approached through an open arcade that partly screens the main facade. Here, there is nothing but a long row of concrete pedestals -- symbolic bases of the columns that the architects have declined to provide. Instead of a dome, the roof mounts in low steps to form an elongated ziggurat. Clerestories between the levels admit light into the prayer hall below. On the right side of the building, where a minaret would typically rise, a set of steps leads up to two platforms, both open to the sky.\nThe mosque's most unconventional element is visible from within the prayer hall. Instead of facing a solid wall, kneeling worshipers face a large glass window and, beyond it, a sumptuous, multilevel sunken garden with pools, fountains, trees, a waterfall and a profusion of water plants. It is a representation of paradise, an image of the afterlife to which devout Muslims aspire. Can Cinici tells me that for Muslims, life is a threshhold at which we stand, preparing ourselves throughout life, through faith and devotion, for entrance into heaven. The Canicis designed an architectural interpretation of that theshhold. Beyond the garden, one beholds the earth berm, an intimation of death and burial.\nI like the threshhold image, not only as a key to this building's meaning, but as a metaphor for the awards program itself, as a doorway into realms of deeper understanding of the post-cold war world. The awards are presented every three years, after a selection process that is elaborate, well-financed and rigorous. Several hundred nominations are proposed by a network of architects and critics throughout the Islamic world. An international master jury meets in Geneva to review the nominees and make an initial cut. Experts conduct extensive field research on the finalists. The jury picks the winners at a second review in Geneva six months later.\nThe composition of the master jury changes with each cycle. Over the years, non-Muslims on the panel have included Charles Corea, Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry, Hans Hollein, Fumihiko Maki, Charles Moore, Alvaro Siza, James Stirling, Kenzo Tange and Robert Venturi. Excerpts from the jury's deliberations are published in book form. These are adding up to a permanent record of the impact of global change on the art of creating place.\nBut why is Can still wearing his shoes? (Because, I later learned, he was flustered by showing a Western journalist around his building.) Or, why does this building continue to cause anxiety? Just months before my trip, last year, the Turkish military intervened to prevent the ruling party from mandating religious education in the nation's public schools. The ground occupied by the mosque, in other words, is contested as well as sacred space. Here, formal invention serves architecture's unparalleled power to open the pores to history and meaning.\nReforestation Program, Middle East Technical University, Ankara\nSince 1961, one million trees have been planted annually on the hills outside Ankara: pine, cedar, oak, poplar, almond and plum. The 11,000-acre-plus project of the Middle East Technical Institute has altered the city's climate, creating milder winters and summers and helping to decrease air pollution. The forest has also become a haven for abundant life and an oasis for the eyes.\nBut perhaps the major impact of the forest has been to limit urban sprawl. Turkish law forbids the development of forest land. Like the mosque's sunken garden, the forest offers a vision of paradise, but the delights here are earthly as well. The forest offers greenery in a desert, a parched terrain of banal housing that spreads outward from Ankara's urban core.\nAt the Technical University, classes are conducted in English, campus buildings are designed in the Brutalist style and architectural instruction is derived from the Bauhaus model. It strikes me that the reforestation program lies partly within the tradition of British Arts and Crafts. Like that movement, the program is grounded in the values of simplicity, social reform and truth to materials; in rejection of the shoddy and the ornate. Arts and Crafts was more than a style. No other movement declared more emphatically the withdrawal of the religious dimension from the public sphere. With it, belief withdrew into the sanctity of the home, the privacy of what we now call life style. It is heartening to see that tradition revived on the urban scale of collective expression.\nVacation Houses, Bodrum\nThe Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, is now a big pit in the back streets of Bodrum, a hip resort town on the Aegean coast. In the early 15th century, Crusaders pillaged the Mausoleum, quarrying it for stone to build the Castle of St. John, a fortress that still stands on a mole in the harbor. But enough rubble was left lying around in the 19th century to construct two small stone houses built on the waterfront. These are now the property of the record producer Ahmet Ertegun and his wife Mica, who remodeled the buildings in 1973 with the architect Turgut Cansever.\nOn the ground floor, the rooms are cool and white, with high ceilings and floors strewn with blue and white striped cushions. The bedrooms, lodged in a newer annex, are more richly decorated. The old buildings and the new enclose a garden of enchantment. It covers a small area, but tall trees are mingled with short ones and the foliage bursts out at eye level, creating an effect at once infinite and intimate. Mausoleus was a tyrant, and the Crusaders were terrorists. It's a joy to see these ancient stones recycled into a house rebuilt by jazz.\nAfter an afternoon in this garden, it comes as a letdown to visit another award-winning project, the Demir Holiday Village, also designed by Turgut Cansever. Like Seaside in Florida, this resort offers itself as a model for urban development. And like the reforestation program, it was designed to limit sprawl. In two decades, Bodrum has gone through a San Tropez-style transformation, from fishing village and hippie colony to a booming resort that makes South Beach look sleepy. The hills surrounding the harbor bristle with stumpy white apartment buildings of no distinction.\nBy contrast, the holiday village is compact, its houses unified by stone walls, terraces and stairs that organize the dwellings in a staggered arrangement on the hillside site. It's a rustic Habitat, Acapulco on Alka-Seltzer. If you care about architecture, this is the sort of project you're supposed to admire. But the rooms in the houses are minuscule, the sun is gone from the water in the afternoon, and the entire complex is so tight and repressed that you want to blare a transistor radio and race back to the sprawl. Why bother with Bodrum if you want to be square? I'm glad to see that Turkey has bubbles too.\nDolmabahce Palace Gardens, Istanbul\nCompleted in 1856, Dolmabahce Palace is the superbubble of a burnt-out superpower, the last seat of the Ottoman rulers before the sultanate was dissolved in 1922. An imperial palace can feel like a desert, too. The grandiosity of this European-style palace is more oppressive than Death Valley. It is one gigantic package of everything that Arts and Crafts designers rebelled against, 25-ton crystal chandeliers, bear skin rugs (gifts from the Czar), diamond-encrusted demitasse cups, gilded moldings, red brocade. Just climbing the Crystal Staircase, with its Baccarat balustrade, can induce reverse vertigo: you fear you won't make it to the top. This is the center of an empire rapidly devolving into the so-called Sick Man of Europe, a nation whose assets and interests were dominated by businessmen and politicians of the major European powers.\nBut the Aga Khan Award wasn't presented to this project for interior decoration. Rather, the award honored the restoration of the palace gardens and the decision to open them to the public. Istanbul is not rich in parks, and this is a fine one. The palace stands at the mouth of the Bosphorus. An esplanade, with five water gates, is one of world's great river walks. Among Istanbul's public spaces, I prefer the square between the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, where people come to sit on benches and contemplate great buildings. But, for a native of the eastern United States, it is a thrilling reversal to gaze westward across water toward the European shore.\nArab World Institute, Paris\n''One can't write directly about the soul,'' Virginia Woolf states in her diary. ''Looked at, it vanishes. But look at the ceiling, at the cheaper beasts in the Zoo which are exposed to walkers in Regents Park, and the soul slips in.''\nOn the way back to New York, I stop off in Paris to pay my respects to the Aga Khan in Chantilly. It also happens that the one Western building to receive an Aga Khan award is in a Left Bank riverside location at the foot of the Boulevard Saint Germain. Jean Nouvel is an architect I greatly admire, but I've never been a fan of his Arab World Institute. Each time I enter this visually cool, gunmetal gray building, the body temperature drops.\nBut the institute's lozenge shape makes good use of its site, and the views from its rooftop restaurant outclass those from the Tour d'Argent. And the building makes a historical point. Its most noted feature is a south-facing sunscreen wall made up of hundreds of light-sensitive irises, which was designed to control the light entering the building. Arranged in blocks fitted into a grid, the irises form patterns resembling arabesques: a reminder that Western technology arose from the genius of Islamic mathematicians. We've taken that inspiration in more than one direction. The irises stopped working within weeks of the building's opening, but we still love the image of science even when appliances break down. And, to me, Nouvel's arctic architecture is a fine thermal symbol of the chilly rationalist philosophy for which Paris was long the supreme urban center.\nIFEEL as if I've been traveling around inside one of architecture's most interesting minds, but the Aga Khan's Chantilly compound feels oddly bland. The road winds through a lovely, leafy park. Stables to the right; the prince's house to the right; the Secretariat just ahead, the latter blonde in effect. Tawny limestone walls; floors of honey-colored marble; ecru carpeting; brass accents. Only the small foyer to the prince's office, encrusted with a collection of mineral crystals, gives an Oriental impression. Inside, chairs and sofas are upholstered in blue and white.\nI came here to run two ideas by the prince. Can he confirm my impression that his interest in architecture stems from that art's capacity to unite spirit and matter in the landscape of everyday life? Yes, he answered, his eyes lighting up, as if to suggest that no point is more fundamental to his thinking.\nAnd what about using the threshhold as a metaphor for this story? This idea he rejected. It evoked for him images of conquest, of crossing a border with the intention of colonizing the territory on the other side. The threshhold also implies terrain left behind -- epochs, values, roots. Neither image fits the prince's mission. His aim, rather, has been to create a meeting ground for cultural exchange.\nSome critics have said that the buildings commissioned by the Aga Kahn are still not up the level of the projects honored by his awards. Others have wondered whether the money it takes to run the program might not be better spent on actual buildings. Both criticisms miss the point. The aim of the awards program is to construct a world view, and this is priceless.\nWith a morning plane to catch, I had no time to pretend that I was actually visiting Paris. But before turning in I decided to walk down to the Seine and see its banks bathed in the harsh glare of the bateaux mouches. There, I encountered something unexpected: an impromptu memorial to Princess Diana, sculptured from thousands of letters, cards, flowers and photographs. These were massed around the base of the replica of Liberty's torch that stands on the quai at the bottom of the Avenue George V. Visitors replenish offerings there to this day.\nThe princess had died the night before I left New York for Turkey, and since I'd been out of touch with the news, I hadn't heard about the cascades of grief generated by her death. Surprising, too, was the volume of cards and letters written in Arabic script. ''Pour Diana, Reine d'Islam,'' one large placard read.\nLike the princess's death, the site of the memorial was an accident of fate; the torch stands at the entrance to the Alma Tunnel, where the car in which Diana was riding spun out of control and crashed. But I thought it paradoxically apt that this public expression of grief was clustered around this golden symbol of liberty, of French Enlightenment values and their passage to the United States.\nThose values included religious freedom, and even the right to be free of religion in the public sphere. This is a cherished principle of modern democracy, an idea to be defended with vigor. Yet it seemed to me that more than a princess was being mourned here. Our separation of Faith from World has also left a void, fleetingly filled by this collective floral tribute.",

    "text": "EARNING IT; Charting A Course To Ethical Profits\n1998-02-08T05:00:00.000Z\nSAY your co-worker sends his Christmas presents from the company mailroom, your boss publicly upbraids sub-\nordinates and your best friend on the\nassembly line drops a gyroscope, then installs it in an airplane anyway. Meanwhile, you are wondering whether to complain about the racy cartoon on the bulletin board or to accept that gold Cross pen from your supplier.\nWhat to do? Whom to consult?\nIncreasingly, the answer is: Call the ethics officer. Today, more than 500 companies have created official guardians of corporate rectitude -- up from 200 just six years ago -- with a mission of keeping employee conduct more upright than the law requires, if not necessarily as pure as the golden rule commands.\nIt is hard to object to the trend. A company with clear policies on how to report employee transgressions -- from stealing envelopes to making unwanted sexual advances to reading the competition's confidential memos -- is more likely to hear about such lapses before legal remedies are required. Ethics hot lines give workers a place to go for advice. And, said Bill Prachar, a former ethics officer with Teledyne Inc., the military contractor in Los Angeles, a business with many subsidiaries can unite around a central ethics message.\nSome ethics officers are even welcomed into their companies' innermost sanctums. Nancy Higgins, the sentinel at the Boeing Company, reports annually to the board's corporate responsibility committee -- and, she says, has been told by several directors that she can call them any time.\nBut at some companies, the reality is often less compelling than the public face of virtue they assume. After all, one of the main factors behind the sudden popularity of ethics officers was the creation in 1991 of sentencing guidelines that reduced fines for white-collar crimes committed by corporations with comprehensive ethics programs. In many cases, the job is reserved for longtime company loyalists who command little support from higher executives, or its duties are lumped together into an ungainly title like ''vice president, ethics compliance, diversity and organizational development.''\nShirley Peterson, a former vice president in charge of ethics at the Northrop Corporation, which has since merged with the Grumman Corporation, describes the frustration that those who try to make a difference can feel when they wade into an ethics controversy.\nIn some cases, said Ms. Peterson, who is now a consultant, ''the ethics executive has had to put forth such a forceful position on it, it has left a lot of broken glass on the floor,'' and the victory is not worth the cost. At other times, the officer can foresee that her stand, while perhaps the most honorable, will not prevail. ''The force there is more powerful than you, and you've lost status,'' she added. ''You've lost, period.''\nMichael Josephson, president of the Joseph & Edna Josephson Institute of Ethics, a nonprofit group in Los Angeles, says he hears similar stories from ethics officers nationwide. ''When I hear them talking together, they are very, very cynical about the process, because they feel so powerless,'' he said. ''They know about all the times they lost, all the times they were not consulted about a problem but asked how to clean it up after the fact.\n''Most ethics officers don't even have the clout to come close to overriding the bottom-line-ism that governs most business goals,'' he added.\nIndeed, the severest critics disparage ethics officers as foxes guarding the henhouse. But most analysts view ethics officers more as prophets in a land of profits, doing the best they can to deal with the everyday ethics quandaries of the workplace.\nIf they lack power, at least their jobs give them a window on the foibles of the human race. And the most common problem they tackle, apparently, is not larceny or licentiousness, but loss of face.\n''Eighty percent of the ethics issues that came across my desk were human-resources-related,'' said Mr. Prachar, the former Teledyne ethics officer. These involve ''people who thought they should have been allowed to try for a particular job opening, or someone who thought they were unfairly disciplined, where the boss yelled at them unfairly in front of others, showing a lack of mutual respect,'' he said.\nAlso found in an ethics officer's ''in'' box are complaints about falsifying product testing to make a deadline, making phone calls on company time, lying about being sick, stealing office supplies, padding expense accounts and sending off-color E-mail. Bosses come under fire, too, for the so-called say-do gap -- engaging in behavior that they ban among their employees, such as taking two-hour lunches. One former ethics officer said one ethics program failed to catch on at a company whose married president was dating his secretary. ''It made the whole message kind of hollow,'' the officer said.\nTHE boundary between right and wrong is not always clear, and part of an ethics officer's job is to make sense of muddled situations and then enlighten people about the consequences of their actions. Mr. Prachar recalls the case of one executive who, apparently with the best of intentions, was steering employees to the medical practice where his daughter was in training.\n''He would let employees off because she needed patients,'' he said. ''This put employees in a very awkward situation, and some felt that in order to advance, to be seen kindly by the boss, they ought to go and show up.''\nThe executive, when confronted, said it never occurred to him that his actions were inappropriate.\n''It was sort of a high-level analogue to selling Girl Scout cookies,'' Mr. Prachar said. ''The employees felt pressure. It raised very important issues and demonstrated management's lack of sensitivity. In fairness to that person, when we called him on it, he said he did see how people could see it. The practice stopped, and there were apologies all around.''\nEven in life-and-death matters, the right course of action is not always obvious. One former ethics officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cited the predicament of an American corporation that was making an industrial item in Europe that had tipped over, possibly causing one death. ''In this country, you might be required to have certain kind of safety equipment, where that requirement does not exist overseas,'' he said. ''Is there an ethical obligation to install that particular safety equipment for sale overseas, even though you don't have to? It's a real issue and a tough issue.'' It was resolved by redesigning the item for future production, though products that were already in operation were not retrofitted.\nSimilar issues are raised at American companies that do business in countries whose anti-pollution or child-labor laws are less stringent than those in the United States. Some executives argue that even if they do not meet American standards on foreign soil, they follow more benign policies than their local competitors do. Others actively resist practices that would be unacceptable at home; Levi Strauss & Company and one of its suppliers in Bangladesh paid for children to go to school rather than work, Mr. Prachar said.\nEthics executives generally decline to discuss specific instances of workplace improprieties, although Boeing has compiled a fairly exhaustive list of ethical quandaries that employees might encounter.\nIn a training program titled ''Questions of Integrity: the Boeing Ethics Challenge,'' the company sets down 54 ethics situations and four possible ways of dealing with each. Supervisors are supposed to discuss each situation, then ask their employees to choose the best outcome by holding up cards marked A, B, C or D. The exercise can be fun, but no one is allowed to call it a game.\nIt does not take a rocket scientist, or even an aeronautics engineer, to figure out the solutions to some of the puzzles. In one instance, employees are asked: ''When walking through the halls, you constantly hear one of your male co-workers call any female employee 'babe.' What do you do?'' Of the following answers, two are considered correct: ''A. Speak to your co-worker in a nonconfrontational manner about the sexist comment. B. Tell his manager that the employee should be fired for sexual harassment. C. Nothing. Calling a woman 'babe' is a form of endearment. D. Tell your supervisor that you feel this is demeaning in the workplace.'' (If you answered A and D, gain 10 feet of moral high ground.)\nOther situations include ''selling Amway products'' at work and ''staying at supplier's beach house'' (say no to either), ''transporting Air Force officials'' (also a no-no, even if they are headed to the airport or even if it is on your way home) ''wearing a pro-choice T-shirt'' (no; too incendiary) and ''dealing with dropped gyroscope'' (confront the person who dropped it, and if necessary, get it inspected yourself.)\nSome questions, though, are trickier. One hypothesizes the visit of a Boeing engineer to a customer, who offers to let him inspect the design of a rival's aircraft. Should he?\nYes, says the booklet, and you don't need to call the ethics officer to ask if it is O.K. After all, the aircraft is a commercial product, and its owner has invited Boeing to check it out -- a perfectly legal procedure.\nSometimes a practice may draw more criticism from the outside than from within. The Weyerhaeuser Company in Federal Way, Wash., for instance, has received adverse publicity over the years for clear-cutting forests, but challenging such policies is generally not on the ethics officer's plate.\n''Most people here understand why clear-cutting is done the way it is,'' said Nancy Thomas, Weyerhaeuser's manager of business conduct, adding that the company meets and often exceeds required forestry standards in the United States and abroad. ''The employees are really proud of the company.''\nMr. Josephson of the ethics institute in Los Angeles says ethics officers can have their work cut out for them just educating business people on the difference between what is technically legal and what is right.\nHe once posed this question to the top dozen executives of a Fortune 100 company: What should you do if a contract you signed turns out to be unprofitable? The legal specialist in the group responded by discussing the leeway the company would have in backing out, he said.\n''I said, 'Don't you see the ethical issues?' '' he recalled. '' 'If you're willing to fight it out in court that you have no obligation to keep promises, on what basis would people think you're an ethical corporation?' ''\nThough the reaction discouraged him at the time, he now looks on the bright side. ''The field is still in its infancy,'' Mr. Josephson said. ''Fifteen or 20 years ago, the whole concept would've been rejected.''\nALREADY, measuring the results of such programs is like counting the forest fires that Smoky the Bear has prevented -- the effect may be much greater than most people imagine. Ms. Higgins of Boeing says she has noticed a sign of growing ethical awareness at her company -- a steady increase in the percentage of people who are willing to give their names when calling the ethics hot line. And Ed Petry, head of the 500-member Ethics Officer Association in Belmont, Mass., notes that of the 157 organizations sentenced in 1996 under the 1991 Federal guidelines -- mostly for fraud -- none had bona fide ethics programs.\nLikewise, Mr. Prachar, the former Teledyne official, says the entire military industry has gone through a ''cultural change'' since corporations instituted ethics programs in response to scandals in the 1980's, when a quarter of the 100 largest Pentagon contractors were convicted of procurement fraud. Teledyne was fined $13 million in 1995 for illegally shipping zirconium to Chile, where it was used to make bombs for Iraq. In 1994, the company spent $113 million to settle whistle-blower lawsuits that accused the company of fraudulent cost accounting and parts testing. And in 1992 it was fined $17.5 million for falsified tests on aerospace components.\nMr. Prachar is now acting coordinator of the Defense Industry Initiative, a group of about 50 military contractors who say they are committed to maintaining higher ethical standards.\nJoan Dubinsky, a former ethics officer with the Mitre Corporation, a nonprofit science and technology group based in Bedford, Mass., and McLean, Va., says ethics officers' opinions may carry more weight than their companies' organizational charts would suggest.\n''They really are internal consultants,'' said Ms. Dubinsky, who is now head of the Rosentreter Group, a consulting firm in Kensington, Md. ''Rarely does an ethics officer have the capacity to make a change. But they have a great capacity to influence, recommend, persuade and suggest.'' Ms. Dubinsky was able to use her position to encourage Mitre to conduct annual eight-hour training sessions in moral reasoning for all midlevel managers, she said.\nMr. Josephson, the Los Angeles ethicist, says he tells ethics officers that their job is not a spelling bee, where one is disqualified after a single misstep. It is more like baseball, where a player can strike out two out of three times and still excel.\n''You can bat .300 and still make the Hall of Fame. Ethics officers are maybe hitting .250,'' he said. ''I do believe ethics officers are helping corporate America make progress, and we need more.''\nNominees for such positions may be forgiven for turning them down. Ms. Dubinski calls the job ''one of the loneliest, loneliest'' in corporate America. And those who hold it say it has a built-in risk: the obligation to resign if the corporate hierarchy breaches the ethical line.\n''I think the thing that makes you most prepared to be an effective ethics adviser is the knowledge that you could find a new job any time,'' said Boeing's Ms. Higgins.\nMs. Thomas of Weyerhaeuser added: ''Most of us will say it's stressful and difficult to challenge management. We're always protecting our company, too. We always talk about the hill you want to die on. I haven't found that hill yet. But if something comes up and I have to challenge management, and they don't agree with me, I have to be prepared to give some kind of ultimatums.''",

    "text": "HAILING DANGER: A special report.; Behind the Wheel: Long Hours and Hard Feelings\n1998-05-15T05:00:00.000Z\nLike generations of poor immigrants before him, the Bangladeshi Mamun Masud sought to fulfill the sunny promise of America behind the wheel of a yellow taxi. Each day spent amid Manhattan's potholes and gridlock was a gift to his young daughters, whose lives, he said, ''should be better than mine.''\nMr. Masud and a friend had teamed up in a common arrangement. They leased a taxi medallion from a broker for $685 a week, adding an extra $250 toward the purchase of the cab itself. One man worked a 5 P.M. to 5 A.M. shift, the other 5 A.M. to 5 P.M. Taking but a single day off, they each made about $800 a week, though repair bills for the overburdened vehicle often gnawed into the profit.\nThen, late last year, the friend moved away. Mr. Masud, 40, either had to quickly find another driver for the second shift or default on his car loan. Anxious weeks passed until, one afternoon, someone gave him the address of Naeem Akhter, a Pakistani cabby who lived in the North Bronx.\nMr. Akhter, 27, comes from a reverent Islamic family. Mr. Masud asked him if he had driven for a long time, and Mr. Akhter assured him that he had. More questioning would only have been an embarrassment, Mr. Masud said, so he did not learn of his new partner's 11 license suspensions and 6 moving violations until after the accident.\nOn Jan. 15, Mr. Akhter was at the wheel when the taxi jumped a curb on the Upper East Side, pinning Sachiko Kiyabu against a light pole and tearing off her right leg. Scattered about were the items she had just purchased at lunch time, among them a pair of sneakers still swathed in white tissue. Nearby, a baby stroller lay crumpled. A little boy with broken legs wailed in pain.\nSomething has gone wrong with taxi safety, and many New Yorkers, most prominently Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, believe the solution rests with getting tougher on cabbies. His proposals for harsh new penalties against drivers this week caused cabbies to stay home on Wednesday and left the Mayor to counter: who needs you, anyway?\nBut the gloomy tale of Mr. Masud and Mr. Akhter speaks of deeply embedded problems in a complicated $1.5 billion industry: unforgiving arithmetic in the leasing of taxis and medallions; inadequate scrutiny in the hiring of drivers; grueling 12-hour shifts, and high turnover in what is now largely an entry-level immigrant industry, likened by some to a sweatshop on wheels.\n''What the city has created is a system with demeaned, poorly paid drivers who work under conditions of maximum stress,'' said Edward G. Rogoff, a professor of management at Baruch College who has studied the taxi industry.\n''There are already so many rules and regulations, that any taxi stopped at any time can be found to have something wrong that can lead to a fine. The long-term solution is not more nit-picking with more rules, but reducing the pressures that cause some drivers to drive like madmen.''\nThe leasing system -- and its underlying economics -- is often thought to be the pathogen for much of what ails the business. Before 1979, when leasing became legal, most cabbies were simply employees, driving for large fleets and sharing a percentage of their day's receipts with the company. Many drivers had health insurance and a retirement plan.\nBut as powers within the industry favored leasing, most cabbies, out of necessity, became small-business operators bedeviled by big overhead. Typically, they pay lease fees up front, starting each 12-hour shift about $90 to $135 in the hole. What sometimes follows is a frantic quest for fares. ''It's a different mind-set,'' said Mike Snaky, a cabby. ''Drivers get a little crazy until they break even.''\nWhatever the causes of taxi accidents, the numbers have been climbing alarmingly. Between 1990 and 1996, accidents involving ''taxis'' -- yellow cabs, car services and other liveries -- shot up 41 percent, according to police statistics.\nBut, oddly, the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission does not keep track of accidents. It does not know which of its drivers were involved in the 12,557 accidents that occurred in 1996, how serious each one was or whether a cabby was at fault.\nEdward McGettigan Jr., head underwriter for the industry's largest insurer, thinks the T.L.C.'s emphasis has been cockeyed: ''If I'm driving 40,000 miles a year, does that mean I'll get a lot of tickets? Probably. Does it mean I'm a bad driver? No. If I get into six accidents a year, does it mean I'm a bad driver? Probably.''\nTo discipline cabbies, the commission has relied on its own judicial system of summonses and hearings. Hack licenses can be taken away after a combination of violations, big and small, such as reckless driving, discourtesy to a passenger or the improper operation of a roof light.\nThe Mayor's new proposals call for higher fines by the commission, more insurance coverage, mandatory drug testing and other measures. The plan would also make mandatory the reporting of taxi accidents to the T.L.C.\nCabbies approve of some of these measures, though they regard the plan as something out of kilter, a proposed overhaul that involves profound overkill.\nFor instance, taxi drivers would be suspended for 30 days if they compiled six penalty points on their driver's licenses during an 18-month period, something achievable with only two illegal turns and the obstruction of one intersection.\nWould that take good cabbies off the road as well as bad? they ask.\n''To pull out a few weeds, they are mowing down everything,'' said Vijay Bali, a leader of the United Yellow Cab Drivers Association, one of the few cabby groups in an industry that is hard to organize.\n''Thousands will lose their licenses, and who will replace them? I ask you: Is this being done because the driver today is basically a minority person? Is this because of bad publicity and politics and a city that has a bull's eye on the driver's back? Has the taxi driver been made an object of hate?''\nThe Accidents\nAn Injury Unleashes Anger and Blame\nSachiko Kiyabu, 51, a buyer for a cable TV station, was once a nimble woman who easily skipped up the 35 steps to her office. Now, a wrap of bandages covers the stump where her knee ought to be. She mostly stays at home in a wheelchair.\n''She's like an injured animal, afraid to go out in the world,'' her husband, Jim Ward, whispered when his wife was wheeled out of earshot.\nThe couple had agreed to speak of their personal calamity. Two cabbies were involved in the accident on the Upper East Side, and the police have concluded that both were at fault. To Ms. Kiyabu, these men -- Naeem Akhter and another Pakistani, Jillani Ghulam -- are nothing more than ''assailants.''\nMr. Ward, an airline pilot, was reserved as his wife talked in their apartment, but then he suddenly detonated with wrath. ''Take their money, take their livelihood or, better yet, throw them in jail,'' he said of the drivers.\n''These taxis go careening about the city. Running people down. Killing them. Gaggles of cars careening down the streets, a horde of kamikazes!''\nHis wife corrected him. ''Kamikazes also kill themselves,'' she said softly. ''These people just kill other people.''\nGiven their hurt, it may be understandable for Ms. Kiyabu and Mr. Ward to demonize the two cabbies, to say they never want to meet them or to know of their lives. Their rancor is also a concession to a New York myth: the rude, half-mad cabby darting for openings in a frenzied hopscotch through Manhattan.\nThe facts of the accident, however, are too ambiguous to reek of malice or recklessness. And the drivers involved, flaws and all, are hardly demons.\nJillani Ghulam came to America 12 years ago from the historic city of Lahore. He was 27, and wanted to go to college. Back home, he had worked in animal husbandry, on livestock farms. That job paid $150 a month, he said. Here, mopping tables was paying $60 a day. He forgot about college.\nIn the late 80's, Mr. Ghulam, like many Pakistanis, acquired a hack license. But without knowing the city, he found the work too stressful and quit after a few days. When he began again in 1993, he was more comfortable at the wheel, if still unhappy with the wages. The fleets charged $100 a day to lease a car, but he often took home only $70 in profit after a 12-hour shift.\nHis younger brother was also a cabby, and the two decided to get a stake of their own. With what they could save and borrow, they made a $40,000 down payment on a medallion, that vital piece of tin whose price had already hyper-inflated past $170,000. Their math was sound. What they saved from paying the usual lease fees was enough to get them through the inevitable calamities: the engine breakdowns and the torn upholstery and the occasional summonses.\nAt the time of the Jan. 15 accident, Mr. Ghulam had a son just starting to walk and a pregnant wife. He lives in a small home in Long Island City, Queens. A polite, earnest man, he seems to have surrendered himself to oncoming doom.\n''Fate has seized my neck,'' Mr. Ghulam said, subduing sobs. ''There will be lawsuits, and I will lose the medallion and my life will be a ruin.''\nHe mentioned pity for Ms. Kiyabu, but that concern seemed outweighed by his own lamentations about a livelihood in jeopardy.\n''People think all taxi drivers are animals,'' he said, first angrily, then defensively. ''I am always a clean-shaven man in clean clothes.''\nFor four months, the hack licenses of Mr. Ghulam and Mr. Akhter have been under suspension. A hearing was held on April 1, and the two men are awaiting the decision of an administrative law judge. Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the T.L.C. Commissioner, will have final say about whether the two will drive a cab again.\nBlame has been hard to apportion. Neither was speeding, investigators say. Mr. Ghulam initiated the tragedy when he improperly strayed from his lane and grazed the other cab, which then veered into the sidewalk. But Mr. Akhter was at fault as well, detectives concluded. Though his side mirror was sheared off, the bumping of his taxi was deemed far too slight for him to lose control.\n''I am the latest taxi trophy for someone,'' Mr. Akhter said bitterly, suggesting that high-profile accidents require a cabby as sacrifice.\nHe is an affable man with bushy eyebrows that hang like archways above his eyes. He lives among a large extended family in the Westchester Square area of the Bronx. His sister married a lawyer and she was the first to emigrate from the small town of Gujarkhan. One by one, 10 other siblings followed.\nMr. Akhter arrived at age 17. He would become a vendor, selling fruit at 44th Street and the Avenue of the Americas and later hot dogs in Battery Park.\n''I am not skillful,'' he said. ''My best skill is driving.''\nThere are managers at taxi garages who assess applicants before leasing them a cab. By their standards, Mr. Akhter would have been considered a high risk.\nSome drivers who are in debt take more chances on the road, and Mr. Akhter, divorced, was $2,700 behind in his child support payments. Though licensed since 1993, he was still a novice cabby, having driven for less than six months. In December, 1997, he received two tickets, one for stopping in a bus lane, the other for a hasty dash across four lanes of traffic.\nRecently, at home, Mr. Akhter talked about himself as some members of his family listened. When asked if he felt badly for Ms. Kiyabu, he said yes, but added: ''I think I am just as much a victim as she is.''\nOthers agreed, though several in the family said Ms. Kiyabu's tragedy was to them an ongoing torment.\n''We have been praying for that woman who was hurt,'' said Mohammad N. Rahim, a taxi driver and Mr. Akhter's brother. ''We wanted to visit her and tell her about us and tell her that we are not criminal people. This was an accident.\n''We discussed it and then asked the man at the taxi broker's office. He said, 'They'll just be more upset and probably take a swing at you.' ''\nThe Drivers\nFacing an Exam, And Then Passengers\nMost every New Yorker has a cabby horror story, and these usually involve long journeys to short destinations, and the screech and blur of a wild ride.\nBut life from the front seat, while no less forbidding, has a transposed view of good and bad. Cabbies say this high-strung, thin-skinned city is abundant with riders who malign immigrant drivers, stiff them on fares and leave behind keepsakes of spilled cappuccino, muffin crumbs and masticated gum. At night come the drunks, moodily wading out of their scotch and water.\nFor every breakneck cabby, there are a dozen behind-schedule big shots who demand to go faster, like cowboys whipping a stallion into a gallop. People like to flag a taxi in a crosswalk, where picking up passengers is illegal. They like to be dropped off exactly at their door, whether this requires double parking or not.\nNew Yorkers grumble about cabbies who scoot across the avenue to vie for a fare, and yet cabbies complain about people who, without fail, get into those same taxis, seemingly glad to get a bold driver who can out-run the lights.\n''It's a disgusting job,'' said one cabby, Mehmood Khan, 32. ''People curse you, don't pay you, call you a damned Paki and tell you to go back home.''\nTo drive a cab, a person must be at least 19, hold a chauffeur's license, possess ''good moral character,'' be a United States citizen or a legal resident and pass two tests, the first of which demands a minimum ability to read -- though not necessarily to speak -- English. Passing that exam leads to 40 to 80 hours of class work in etiquette, map-reading, geography and defensive driving: What is a blind spot? Where is Yankee Stadium?\nAbout 70 percent of the students pass the final exam.\nThe city-licensed Master Cabbie Taxi Academy is a grim, three-story walk-up in a warehouse district of Queens. Twenty-three men were recently in attendance, almost all of them immigrants who, during break time, spoke of the usual trapdoors into joblessness. To them, a yellow cab seemed a vehicle of financial rescue, though few knew much more about the cars than their color.\nAt one point, the instructor asked: ''How many of you have been -- and I didn't say drive -- I ask, how many of you have been inside a taxi?''\nOnly 11 raised their hands.\nAs the lesson went on, only two items dominated students' concerns: fares and tips. This prompted the teacher to ask another revealing question: How much of what you make off the meter is taxable?\n''Zero,'' one man answered as the others nodded agreeably.\nThe Incentives\nPushing the Limits To Make a Profit\nDrivers don't like the job. The backaches, the worry, the lip. They are bouncing down city streets, needing to use the bathroom. Some passenger orders them into a traffic jam, then says, ''Driver, I'll just get out right here.''\nMoney is the magnet that keeps a cabby in a car, though the earnings of a typical driver are hard to determine. Winters pay more than summers, night shifts more than days. Some cabbies vastly out-hustle others.\nThese days, most cabbies talk of averaging $70 to $90 a day, and blame lean earnings for the rise in accidents, favoring the theory that unpaid bills can tempt a driver into unsafe turns. Fleet owners put the numbers at $100 to $200 a day, and wonder why there is a shortage in so lucrative an occupation.\nA total of 45,266 cabbies have up-to-date hack licenses for the city's 12,187 medallion taxis, but owners always say they are short of drivers.\nMost cabbies begin their careers leasing on a daily or weekly basis from one of the larger fleets, which have 100 or so cabs. These operations are self-insured, and, consequently, their owners claim to have a greater stake in safe driving. Managers give applicants a road test before leasing them one of their precious taxis, and, alarmingly, report that 35 to 50 percent are turned away.\nParked cabs earn no money, of course, and some fleet owners report that 15 percent of their shifts are idle in any given week. How often, then, do they let their standards slide and let a greenhorn have a go at it? Brokers have the same economic pressures. Do they let medallions sit unused in a drawer?\n''No matter what they say, nobody's that picky when they really need the drivers,'' said Fidel F. Del Valle, the T.L.C. Commissioner from 1991 to 1995. ''It's a balance of the finances against the risk. Some owners couldn't give a damn about who they put on the street.''\nJoseph C. Hennessy, in the taxi business for 34 years, gives the road tests at the Team System Corporation, one of the bigger fleets. He tests plenty of people who can't even make it off the lot without bending a fender. Still, Mr. Hennessy cannot be too picky. Since leasing took root, a cabby who wants to drive for a fleet is as much a customer as a job applicant. Fleet owners or brokers: they are a lot like Hertz. They need people to lease their cars.\nOne morning, a tall Albanian immigrant, laid off from a construction job, walked into Team System. Mr. Hennessy entrusted him with a taxi, and the man could handle a car superbly. But he also one-handed the wheel, rolled through stop signs and jackknifed ahead of oncoming traffic to complete left turns.\nThe derring-do made Mr. Hennessy flunk him.\n''But in a taxi, you need to make money, you go fast,'' the Albanian man said crossly.\nHe walked off angrily, and as Mr. Hennessy watched him go, he knew some other fleet would lease the man a car.\n''Drive for someone else for three or four months,'' Mr. Hennessy called after him hopefully. ''Then come see me again.''\nThe Penalties\nCabbies Say Scrutiny Feels Like Persecution\nFines, suspensions, revocations: these always have been the ways to punish rule-breaking drivers. The Giuliani administration turned up the heat.\nIn 1995, the Police Department was ordered to form a special unit to enforce the host of T.L.C. regulations for medallion taxis. These rules run the gamut: running a red light, giving incorrect change, tampering with a fare meter, refusing to pick up a passenger, not taking the shortest route.\nDozens of uniformed officers focus their attention on yellow cabs. By 1997, the total number of commission summonses against drivers had risen by 115 percent, according to city statistics.\nDrivers have taken note. ''War has been declared on the taxi driver,'' said Lesly Princival, 39, a cabby since 1982. ''They have taxi inspections where they pull you over and harass you. The car is dirty -- a summons. This light is out -- a summons. There is a receipt hanging from the meter -- a summons.''\nCapt. Walter Smith, who runs the unit, said these inspections are needed to maintain credibility. ''If a driver thought all he had to do was drive safely in order to never be pulled over, then he wouldn't have to take care of his cab, would he? He could put a zapper on the meter or take out the seat belts.''\nBut taxi enforcement, important as it is, may well be having a perverse effect, cabbies say. It begins to seem like persecution.\n''They make it too tough to make a living,'' said Balvinder Singh, a driver. ''You pay on the medallion, the car, the repairs, the fines: it's too much.''\nIt would be helpful to know how many summonses are being written for each particular violation. But, during a two-month period, Deputy Commissioner Allan J. Fromberg was unable to produce any such breakdown. He did, however, admit to a serious problem of overcrowding in the Taxi and Limousine Commission's court.\n''The system really puts a lot of people through the wringer,'' Mr. Fromberg said. ''I mean that in the context of an emotional situation. It's not a very nice thing to have to go through.''\nThe main taxi court, in Long Island City, Queens, is a shabby old structure with a small elevator that inches its way up the three floors to the commission.\nOn busier days, lines begin forming at 5:30 A.M. for a 7 A.M. opening of the doors and an 8:30 start of proceedings. The line outside leads to the line to the elevator. Once upstairs, the line for registration then leads to the hours-long wait in a waiting room for a hearing, which is followed by another wait in the waiting room for the judge's decision, and then the line to pay the fines.\nOnly tempers seem short, as drivers strain to hear their names called in a hivelike atmosphere abuzz with mumbles and cursing. Guilty or not, a cabby is likely to lose a day's pay as he tarries. There are no pay phones -- no way to tell a boss that things are taking longer than expected or to check up on the child care situation at home. The paperwork befits Kafka, with several mind-boggled cabbies reporting only to pay fines for their ''failure to appear'' at hearings for which they have already appeared and paid earlier fines.\n''This is torture, this is anti-human, this is anti to anything decent to humanity,'' groused Ali G. Darabi, 57, one recent day, well into his 10th hour of waiting. A cabby since 1971, he was wise enough to bring along a large volume of Persian poetry by the great Jalal ad-Din ar-Rumi, but even the spiritual couplets of a sufi mystic could not calm his soul for so long.\n''This is fascism to the extreme point,'' he said, vowing he had finally had enough. He would turn in his hack license as soon as he paid his $80 in fines for a burned-out bulb in his off-duty light, a receipt found hanging in his meter, a trip card that had his name written in pencil, not pen.\nIn court, he told the judge, ''I am sick and tired. I want out. Here, please take my license.''\nShe sympathized, but, obeying protocol, told him: ''This is not where you submit your license. You know that. Go to the second floor and wait in line.''",

    "text": "The New Immigrant Tide: A Shuttle Between Worlds\n1998-07-19T05:00:00.000Z\nFernando Mateo has been shuttling between New York City and Santo Domingo since he was in utero. His pint-sized immigrant mother, belly swelling, flew back to her homeland so Mr. Mateo, now 40, could be born a Dominican. After that, his childhood was split between here and there, between a cramped Lower East Side apartment and a pink house beneath a mahogany tree in the Dominican capital.\nAs an adult, Mr. Mateo, a stocky man with a dimpled baby face, continues to lead a double life, with gusto. A dual citizen of the Dominican Republic and the United States, he wears a custom-made lapel pin that entwines the Dominican and American flags. He is fluent in Spanish and English, in the business handshake and the business hug, in yucca and plantains, bagels and lox. But there is nothing fractured about his existence.\nEvery few weeks, Mr. Mateo, who owns a money-transfer company, simply commutes between the Westchester County suburb of Irvington, where he lives, and Santo Domingo. Many a day, he and his wife, Stella, start out in blaring traffic on the Grand Central Parkway and end up on horseback in the verdant Dominican countryside, cantering down to a river to feast on rum and goat.\n''I believe people like us have the best of two worlds,'' Mr. Mateo said. ''We have two countries, two homes. It doesn't make any sense for us to be either this or that. We're both. It's not a conflict. It's just a human fact.''\nFor modern immigrants like Mr. Mateo, the homeland is no longer something to be forsaken, released into a mist of memory or nostalgia. As the world has grown smaller, the immigrant experience has inevitably changed. Unlike the Europeans who fled persecution and war in the first half of this century, few modern immigrants abandon their motherlands forever, shutting one door, opening another and never looking back. Instead, they straddle two worlds, in varying degrees, depending on where they came from and what they can afford.\nSome immerse themselves in two societies at once -- economically, culturally, politically. Jesus Galvis, a travel agent in New Jersey, ran for a Senate seat in his native Colombia earlier this year; had he won, he would have considered holding office simultaneously in Bogota and Hackensack, where he is a City Councilman.\nMost immigrants, however, base themselves more fully here, but maintain ties so vital that their homeland is a part of their American-born children's identity. Mersuda Guichard, 47, leads a hectic New York-centered life as a subway token clerk and single mother of three. But she travels to Trinidad at least once a year, and plans to retire there, which will keep alive her children's connection, already strong from so many summers there.\nEither way, this here-there phenomenon, while common to every immigrant center in the world, makes a particularly clear stamp on the psyche of New York, the American city with the largest and most diverse population of immigrants, living side by side in neighborhoods where the very fact of their double identity is a bond. It has evolved during the newest wave of immigration, which began in the late 1960's, eventually driving the city's immigrant population to an all-time high of 2.7 million, according to an analysis of the Census Bureau's latest population survey. More than a third of the city's residents are foreign-born, and about 60 percent are either immigrants or their children. Most are black, Latino and Asian, unlike the Europeans of the previous waves of immigration.\nTo some extent, the new immigrants bear a resemblance to the Ellis Island generation. During that last great migration, which began in 1880 and petered out during the 1920's, some immigrants did revisit their homelands, and many returned for good. But their experience was largely erased from popular consciousness by the mid-century immigrants, most of whom, fleeing war, never looked back.\nStill, for the newest immigrants, technological advances and global political and economic changes have revolutionized the relationship with the homeland -- just as the American embrace of multiculturalism allows it to flourish as never before.\nArmed with cut-rate phone cards and frequent-flier miles, with modems, fax machines and videocameras, immigrants can participate in the lives of their families back home -- be they in Barbados or Tibet -- with an immediacy unknown to any previous generation. Indeed, this phenomenon has given birth to an entrepreneurial subculture -- the money-transfer houses, phone parlors, barrel shippers and even videophone centers dotting immigrant neighborhoods.\nIn the last few years, a proliferation of dual nationality laws has allowed many immigrants to formalize their double identities. And, among other worldwide political changes, the break-up of the Soviet Union and liberalizations in China have allowed even refugees to reconnect in commonplace ways they once could not have imagined.\nMei Yung Liew left China 19 years ago, and settled into a garment worker's life in New York, quickly securing her American citizenship. She made a first visit back for her father's funeral. Three years ago, she traveled back for a meeting of labor-union women. Now, she watches with awe as her brother, an artist who sells his work in China, not only conducts business by fax from their Bushwick, Brooklyn, apartment but even returns for long stretches to the land they supposedly fled forever.\nSo fluid is the exchange between the homeland and New York that it alters both places. People move back and forth, money moves back and forth, ideas move back and forth.\nFamilies and sometimes whole towns bestride borders. The population of Chinantla, Mexico, is evenly divided between that tiny town and New York City, but the Chinantecans still consider themselves one community -- 2,500 people here, 2,500 people there. In New York, the first-generation Chinantecan immigrants are waiters, garment workers and mechanics; back home, they are the big shots whose earnings built the town's schools and rebuilt its church.\nThe extent to which the newest immigrants have held onto their homeland identities has unsettled many Americans, and this unease underlies current debates about immigration, multiculturalism and bilingualism. Among a growing army of immigration experts, there is a raging debate, too, about the importance of this phenomenon, which the academics call transnationalism.\nMany experts believe that modern immigrant families are ultimately shifting their allegiances here, even if their resettlement takes decades. They see transnationalism as a phase on the way to what they imagine will be the eventual assimilation of the immigrants' grandchildren, and pronounce the modern immigrant experience a variation on an old theme.\nOthers disagree, but only with their conclusion. First, they say, it is significant that the resettlement can span decades in the life of an individual family, especially in a city where more than 100,000 new immigrants arrive yearly. Also, they say, transnationalism seems to transform the life of the first generation's children and sometimes their grandchildren, creating a hybrid identity that is genuinely novel.\n''At the same time as they are keeping their old links, many are successfully integrating themselves into the United States,'' said Robert C. Smith, a sociologist at Barnard College and expert on transnationalism. ''They're redefining what it means to be American.''\nThey are also making immigration a much more complex phenomenon than described in policy debates. Immigrants have always had a utilitarian relationship with America. But when the homeland remains alive, every life juncture, from cradle to grave, becomes a time to choose: where to baptize, where to bury?\nIn 1996, more than half the Dominicans and Mexicans who died in New York City were sent home for burial, as were a third of the Ecuadoreans, a fifth of the Jamaicans and 16 percent of the Greeks, according to an analysis of city death records.\nMarriage, too, is a defining moment, especially among Indian immigrant families. Many of the American-born children of, say, gemstone merchants from Jaipur or hoteliers from Gujarat, agree to arranged marriages, often with weddings in India, sometimes followed by new lives based there.\nAt key points in their lives, many immigrant families separate, some here, some there. Needing day care, some send small children home to grandparents. Fearing drugs, gangs and sexual precociousness, some ship their teen-agers home for high school. And many retire to their birthplaces, which keeps their children and grandchildren ineluctably linked. The familial webs crisscross the globe.\nMargarette Lee, 36, is a vivacious Manhattan real-estate lawyer who came to New York as a child and considers herself eternally wedded to its life style. Her parents retired to Korea about 20 years ago, dragging back her older sister because she was getting a little too independent. After marrying a Korean, the older sister settled in Seoul, as did her younger sister, who was mostly reared in Korea anyway.\nThen, her parents re-immigrated -- because golfing is so much cheaper in Fort Lee, N.J. Meanwhile, Ms. Lee married a Korean-American artist, Ik-Joong Kang, who is represented by a gallery in Seoul, where his parents live. And they recently had a baby whom they gave two first names, Kevin and Keeho.\n''I hope for my son's relationship with Korea to be continuous, just as mine has been,'' she said.\nJets and Wires -- Making the Commute To Santo Domingo\nBefore daybreak on a recent morning, Mr. and Mrs. Mateo left home for Kennedy International Airport after blowing kisses to their sleeping daughters, Megan, 11 (named after a character in ''The Thorn Birds''), and Hennessy, 10 (as in the Cognac). Fernando Jr., 19, was away at college.\nLeft in their grandfather's care, the girls were soon so busy with their suburban social lives -- baking brownies, swooning over Leonardo DiCaprio and E-mailing their girlfriends -- that they didn't mind their parents' absence. Third-generation New Yorkers, they themselves have spent a good part of their preschool years and many summers in the Dominican Republic. They find the intense connection between here and there so natural as to be unremarkable.\nThat morning, the Mateos sauntered onto a 7 o'clock nonstop flight to Santo Domingo -- the first of six that day -- as casually as if it were a shuttle. The plane was packed with immigrants returning home for a wedding, a visit with an ailing family member, a business meeting. When the plane bumped down three hours later, they applauded, and someone called out, ''De regreso, paisanos!'' (''We're back, countrymen!'')\nIn all immigrant groups, it is entrepreneurs like Mr. Mateo who have developed the infrastructure that allows their countrymen to keep in touch with home. ''They are the vanguard,'' said Alejandro Portes, a Princeton University immigration expert, ''the ones whose economic or sometimes political interests require them to be simultaneously present in their two countries.''\nFour years ago, on a flight home, Mr. Mateo sat next to a fellow Dominican who sold discounted phone time to immigrants. The man expounded on the profit potential in the link between here and there, and by the end of the ride, Mr. Mateo had decided to go into the money transfer business.\n''I set myself up in this business so I would have an official reason to go back as often as my heart wants to take me there,'' Mr. Mateo said.\nMr. Mateo's money-wiring business, like some 15 other companies, provides an electronic lifeline between Dominicans in New York and their families on the island. Dominican immigrants send back $500 million a year (including about $100 million that the authorities believe to be proceeds from drug sales). The cash sustains their relatives and their homeland's economy, just as such remittances bolster familial, and sometimes national, economies throughout the world.\nWhile there is no total estimate of immigrants' remittances, New York State Banking Department statistics indicate that the industry has mushroomed here in the last decade. The number of companies licensed to send money has increased 40 percent since 1988, and those companies have as many as 2,000 storefronts and agents.\nAmong them, Boby Express says it transfers about $1 million a year to Haiti; Habib Exchange sends about $6 million a year to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh; Pekao Trading wires about $320 million a year to Poland. Mr. Mateo has 200 agents throughout the city, and transfers $40 million a year.\nDominicans, regardless of class, are probably the most transnational of all New York's immigrants. The city's largest immigrant group, they have transformed their nation while laying claim to whole New York neighborhoods. The Dominican President, Leonel Fernandez Reyna, grew up on the Upper West Side, still holds a green card, and has said he intends to rejoin his family in Manhattan at the end of his term.\nIn Santo Domingo, the influence of New York-based immigrants is so visible it can be toured. Here is the new residential subdivision built close to the airport for the back-and-forth immigrants; here is a bagel shop, a video store, a pizzeria that delivers; here is a parochial high school whose student body is 20 percent New York-born.\nJust before his recent trip to the island, Mr. Mateo traveled by subway to Brooklyn, his pinstriped suit equipped with beeper, cellular phone and computer organizer. He was making a routine visit to one of his 200 agents, Teresa Guzman, who runs Family Travel on Myrtle Avenue.\nBehind a glass partition, Ms. Guzman and her employees sat before computers and typed in orders from the immigrants who dribbled in that morning. A home health attendant sent $65 to her elderly father. A garment worker sent $69 to relatives with a succinct message: ''THIS IS FOR FOOD.'' The directions were often quite specific:\n''Ten kilometers past Hatos de Yaque, left at the henhouse, climb the hill past two herds of cattle and you can find Mercedes in the small green house.''\nFrom Ms. Guzman's agency, the orders traveled electronically to Mateo Express headquarters in midtown Manhattan, then on to Santo Domingo, where the company's war room holds a giant city map divided into sectors. Each sector is assigned to a messenger who packs his pockets with cash-filled envelopes that he delivers by motorbike within four hours of an immigrant's visit to a storefront in New York.\nOn his recent trip, Mr. Mateo accompanied a messenger to the home of Jose Antonio Ortiz Sanchez in Bani, a small city outside the capital. Mr. Ortiz Sanchez, a skinny, toothless old man who suffers from a nerve disorder, was lying on a cot on his patio when the envelope arrived. He clutched it to his chest -- $70 for a doctor's visit. When Mr. Mateo asked who had sent the money, the man rose from his cot, hoisted his blue boxers, walked inside and pointed to a poster of a St. Louis Cardinals Double-A farm team.\n''My son,'' he said proudly. (The son no longer plays for the team.)\nJust as they scratch together enough money to send home, even the poorest Dominican immigrants make at least one trip back a year, travel agents say. Fares run as low as $330 round-trip.\nMr. Mateo does not come from a wealthy family. His father began as a gardener. He is a Seward Park High School dropout whose outsized hands bear decades of calluses from manual labor. Before starting his money wiring company, he built a carpet business from scratch, while his wife, who now runs a small construction company, worked at an accounting firm.\nBut they and their families have been moving back and forth for decades. Even now, Mr. Mateo's mother, Carmen, 76, hops between the family's modest, airy house in Santo Domingo and a spare apartment in a retirees' building in lower Manhattan.\nAfter a few weeks in Santo Domingo, she begins ''kvetching'' (Mr. Mateo's word) about the heat, the blackouts, the lack of Haagen-Dazs ice cream. So she flies north.\nAfter a few weeks on the Lower East Side, she starts complaining about how cooped up she feels and about the outrageous price of mangos, which are supposed to be free. She insists on flying back to visit the grave of her husband, who died in Manhattan years ago only to be transported south for burial. There, she sprinkles his grave with his favorite beer and plays him salsa from a boom box, often accompanied by Mr. Mateo's half-brother, Dagoberto Linares.\nMr. Linares, 51, a small man whose jeans hang low and baggy like a teen-ager's, also shuttles, between East New York, Brooklyn, and Yamasa, the Dominican Republic.\nIn New York, he works as a carpet-layer; in the Dominican Republic, fulfilling a lifelong dream, he lives on a farm -- riding horses, raising chickens and harvesting a cornucopia of fruit trees.\nTechnology -- Breaking Barriers Of Space and Time\nWhen Hamid Ali drives his yellow cab through Manhattan, the images of his family in Pakistan run through his head as if on a loop. They keep him company through 10-hour workdays and lonely nights in a one-bedroom apartment he shares with three other drivers. But they are stale images, four years old and frozen in time.\nIt pained him, until a friend told him about a cutting-edge solution to old-fashioned immigrant heartache: videophones.\nAt the end of June, on Ditmas Avenue off Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn, Mr. Ali sat nervously before a large computer screen in the darkened conference room of Satellite Tech Telecommunication. His wire-rim glasses slipped to the very tip of his nose; he pushed them up, and they slipped back down.\nWithout warning, the screen came to life, and the image of his older sister, draped in a floral head scarf, flickered and died. He gasped softly. Then she reappeared, live from Islamabad, a four-hour drive from their town of Okara. And she had a thing or two on her mind.\nFor four straight minutes -- at $5 a minute -- his sister, Shamim Kusar, harangued him for not writing. He protested that he phoned weekly, but his sister told him letters were better; they could be fingered and re-read and kept under pillows. No one could fathom why he didn't just come home, she said, or why he was so ambitious. Their father thought he probably no longer cared for them, she reported; now he was American.\nWhen Mr. Ali's eyes brimmed, Mrs. Kusar softened. She told her brother he looked weak and underfed. He told her he was working too hard, that everyone worked too hard in America, which was why it is such a prosperous country. ''Is everyone so skinny?'' she asked. ''I will tell Mother you are fat.'' She reached out to tickle his face on the screen.\n''I will tell everyone in town that I saw my brother on TV,'' she said, giggling. ''They won't believe me. We are simple people.''\n''Pray to Allah for me, dear sister,'' he answered, biting back tears, ''and I will be home soon -- two years at the most.''\nThis scenario, unimaginable even 10 years ago, shows just how far technology has gone in breaking down the barriers of space and time that used to separate immigrants from the lands they left behind.\nEarly in the century, it was too difficult and expensive to lead a genuinely double life. Immigrants might return home for good, but they could not hop a steamship to the Old World for a long weekend. Letters were the bond between families, but they took so long that communication was herky-jerky.\nNow, Chinese immigrants jet to Hong Kong for meetings with investors in their Queens banks; Bombay movie stars fly in for standing-room-only performances at the Nassau Coliseum, and highland Indians from Ecuador fax home orders for more ponchos to sell on the streets.\nThe most revolutionary technological change in the lives of immigrants, though, is the inexpensive direct-dial phone call.\nIt was not even possible to make a trans-Atlantic phone call until 1927, and it was prohibitively expensive -- $200 in current dollars for a three-minute call to London, said Sheldon Hochheiser, the corporate historian for A.T. &T.\nIn the last 10 years, small communities around the world have obtained direct phone service, fiber-optic cables have drastically improved the quality of long-distance calls, and rates have become dirt cheap: in 1965, it cost $10.59 to call the Dominican Republic for three minutes, and $15 to call India; now those rates are $1.71 and $3.66, respectively, with A.T.&T.'s one-rate international plan.\nMany immigrants, however, seek out even cheaper rates at phone parlors, now ubiquitous in the city, or with prepaid phone cards. The phone parlors and card businesses, typically immigrant enterprises, buy telephone minutes in bulk from long distance carriers and sell them at sharply discounted rates.\nIf the ability to call home cheaply connects immigrants to their families, the ability to click on the homeland's news or soap operas connects them to the society they left behind.\nAll a Korean immigrant need do is turn on the 24-hour Korean Channel, which is offered in Queens as part of basic cable service, to watch the news from Seoul, as well as Korean soaps, children's programs and Sunday morning religious shows. Similarly, a Russian emigre can turn to WMNB-TV, based in Fort Lee, N.J., for live performances from the Moscow Concert Hall.\nFor immigrant communities that lack television channels, there are closed-circuit radio stations that operate on side frequencies leased from FM stations. If they get their radios equipped with a special chip or filter, immigrants can listen in on the Ukrainian Parliament, and Haitians can participate in call-in shows that link listeners in Flatbush with those in Port-au-Prince.\nReflecting the dual interests of their audiences, the immigrant radio and television channels have also become electronic settlement houses, offering all manner of advice.\n''We're killing a lot of different birds at the same time,'' said Evgeniy Lvov, president of the Russian-American Broadcasting Company, which owns WMNB. ''We're making this world smaller for everybody.''\nThe New Breed -- Rebuilding A Burnt Bridge\nBefore Leonid Slepak left Russia in 1979, he traveled three days over land from Moscow to Siberia to say goodbye to his parents. They were well-known dissidents; he was a draft evader living underground and a poster boy for Soviet Jewry, his photograph marched through the streets of New York, Washington and Los Angeles.\nMr. Slepak was only 19. He had finally won his 10-year-battle to emigrate, and in that moment, sitting opposite his parents in a Siberian prison, he thought he understood with a panic what a permanent rupture it would be. ''It would be like dying, I imagined,'' he said recently.\nTwo decades later, it has not turned out to be so final after all. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many Soviet Jewish refugees ventured back for a visit. They were the last immigrants who had ever expected to lead transnational lives; they had relinquished their passports and possessed little nostalgia. But the years away had taught some that they were more Russian than they thought, and that it made sense -- business sense, family sense -- to re-establish ties.\nLike Mr. Slepak, many have reconnected with a vengeance, building businesses that require them to travel back and forth, to E-mail, to adjust their body clocks to the eight-hour time difference. They have bought second homes in Moscow or St. Petersburg.\nMr. Slepak, who puts together business deals that require financing and know-how in both countries, even moved back for a year. He has a family here and a family there: three very Americanized teen-agers in New Jersey (whose mother he divorced in the 80's), and one Russian child, 7-year-old Anastasiya. His parents live in Israel.\nMr. Slepak considers himself more American than Russian, but calls himself ''bicontinental.'' Has he embraced Judaism in exile? He laughed and called this a ''very American question.'' Being Jewish is a matter of blood, not deed, he said. But then, he elaborated, with a very American answer: ''If I arrive home on a Friday, and the sun is just setting and the mood is right, I will light the candles, and say a bracha,'' a blessing. ''But it's more in the spirit of T.G.I.F.''\nThe Old Breed -- When Goodbye Meant Forever\nWhen the new immigrants began arriving in large numbers, many Americans believed there was a protoypical immigrant experience: immigrants were supposed to shed their old selves and become Americans in language, culture, dress and appetite.\nThat model was based on the living memory of Morris Adler's generation.\nAt 103, Mr. Adler is a spry, stoop-shouldered man, happily retired in Jamaica, Queens, with 5 grandchildren, 11 great-grandchildren and a great-great granddaughter. His eyes are milky with age but his memory is undimmed.\nAfter anti-Semitism drove him from Poland, he said, he arrived at Ellis Island in 1920 with $9 in his pocket. Within days, he found work as a hat maker and enrolled in night-time English classes. He quickly changed his name from Gershon Szmedra, just as he tried hard to lose his accent and Americanize. He didn't want the stigma of being a greenhorn; he wanted to belong in his new land, where no one ever told him to get off the sidewalk because he was a Jew.\nIn New York, he married the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Poland and built his American family. But he never saw his Polish family again. He corresponded with them until the letters stopped in 1943; nearly everyone perished in the Holocaust.\n''I never wanted to see Poland again,'' he said. ''My country where I'm born showed me hate, so I never had love for it. To me the other world is, 'Forget it.' ''\nBut if Mr. Adler's seems to be the prototype of the American immigrant experience, immigration experts say this kind of abrupt break with the homeland was actually a historical anomaly. The current immigrant experience, they say, more directly echoes the mass immigration that stretched from 1880 to 1930.\nThen, just as now, millions of immigrants came expecting to go home. Some crisscrossed the Atlantic by steamship, like the Italian migrant workers whom immigration officials called ''birds of passage.'' And many returned for good, carrying back their earnings and buying themselves new prominence and comfort in their homelands.\nOne historian, Mark Wyman, believes a quarter to a third of the 23 million Europeans who emigrated to America between 1880 and 1930 repatriated. But their story has rarely been told because the history of immigration was written by those who stayed.\nWith a return home on their minds, many immigrants behaved very differently from Mr. Adler. They were slower to learn English and become citizens. They lived and worked in ethnic enclaves, and belonged to homeland village associations. Homeland politicians courted them; Irish nationalists made fund-raising trips to New York in the early 1900's, just as Dominican candidates -- and Irish nationalists -- do now.\n''It's a mistaken idea that everyone always rushed to Americanize,'' said Roger Waldinger, an immigration expert at the University of California at Los Angeles.\nFrom the late 1920's to the 60's, though, the fluidity of these migration patterns was interrupted by the Depression, World War II and the cold war. In 1929, Congress also imposed severe immigration restrictions that were not lifted until 1965.\nFor those 35 or so years, the majority of newcomers were refugees fleeing political persecution: first European Jews, then Hungarians, then Cubans. They are the immigrants whose experience has shaped the living memory of New York.\nUnlike those who came before, and those who would follow, they knew they would never go home. And since their numbers were relatively small, they could more easily be absorbed into America at a time when it was consciously forging a national identity. At that moment in history, with the concept of Americanization taking an ever-stronger hold, ethnic identity was a leftover, and often an embarrassment.\n''There was a zero-sum notion of identity,'' said Aristide R. Zohlberg, director of the International Center for Migration, Ethnicity and Citizenship at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. ''If you became 10 percent more American, you became 10 percent less of what you were.''\nEthnic Pride -- A New Notion Of Americanization\nPhilippe Vielot arrived in New York from Haiti in 1969, four years after Congress lifted immigration quotas. He was 12, and he didn't know he was at the vanguard of a new wave of immigration that would bring in black, Latino and Asian immigrants in an era when many Americans were asserting their ethnic and racial pride for the first time.\nDuring Mr. Vielot's American lifetime, the idea of assimilating to a single American norm would come to be seen as a dated, even racist, concept. It would become socially acceptable for immigrants to hold onto their cultures, but then the extent to which they did so would unnerve many Americans.\nMr. Vielot's family arrived intending to return to Haiti, and after 20 years as hospital workers, his parents did retire there, keeping their apartment in East Flatbush for visits north. When Mr. Vielot's daughter was little, she was sent home to her grandparents, the best (and cheapest) day care imaginable.\nMr. Vielot never stopped following the ins and outs of Haitian politics. He never gave up his languages, Creole and French, never stopped listening to zouk and compas, never stopped going home for visits. He still awaits the perfect moment to return for a long stay, maybe for good. He wants to be a farmer.\nBut Mr. Vielot long ago became an American citizen. He is fluent in English; he peppers his speech with exclamations like ''oh, gosh.'' He works for a New York City agency as a mechanical engineer. His wife is a kindergarten teacher, his children are American, and they all live in Bridgeport, Conn.\nHe is the very model of the modern immigrant, part of the mix of cultures that has been called everything from a salad bowl to a gorgeous mosaic. But has he Americanized? Mr. Vielot was at first stumped by the question, then said, ''By my estimate, maybe not by yours.''\nSociologists say that to many modern immigrants, the issue of becoming American is pretty much beside the point, the kind of question best left to the sociologists. To many immigrants, assimilating means sinking into the dead-end universe of the inner cities where they live; holding onto their culture and values, then, is a way of inoculating their children against all those American ills.\nExperts prefer to ask if immigrants are integrating themselves into American life even as they hold onto their language, culture and ties. The test, they say, lies with the immigrants' children, and that is whom they have been studying, although the studies, and the children, are too young for definitive answers.\nStill, families like Mersuda Guichard's offer some tentative answers. For Ms. Guichard, Trinidad is the past, the island that felt too small when she left in 1971. It is the present, the place she goes to restore herself when the pressures of bringing up three children alone are too much. And it is the future, the ''paradise'' where she will retire, using the nest egg -- $6,000 so far -- squirreled away in a Trinidadian bank.\nBut it is not the past, present or future for her teen-age children. When they were younger, Ms. Guichard sent them home every summer -- because she was working, and because she wanted them to absorb her love for Trinidad. Her daughter, Starr, 16, still goes, and she describes it as a glorious vacation: walking barefoot on the beach, tending rabbits and ducks, learning to cook callaloo. But, every fall, Starr balks when her mother, who thinks a little Caribbean discipline would do her good, asks her to stay and attend school in Trinidad. Starr has no desire to wear a uniform or get her knuckles rapped for tardiness.\n''There, you can't wear make-up or nail polish,'' she said. ''You have to wear plaid pleated skirts and white shirts and little socks that fold at the bottom.''\nMs. Guichard now wishes she had sent all her children home to school when they were small, but, she says, it is too late for regrets. She herself is Trinidadian through and through. Her children are a hybrid: part West Indian, part American -- and all New Yorker. ''They were born here,'' she said, ''and they will die here.''\nOverwhelmingly, the experts say, American-born children of immigrants seem to have their feet planted in this country, no matter how many trips they make to their parents' homeland. While bilingual, they express themselves better in English than in their parents' tongues. And they feel more at home in the hyperdeveloped United States than in the developing world.\nStill, their parents' dual identity affects them, sometimes profoundly. In many cases, they have relationships with their parents' hometowns that help shape a newfangled identity. They are not going to move back, but they often consider their parents' birthplaces second homes.\nThe back and forth can be confusing, and some feel they fit in neither here nor there. ''Here they say, 'You're from the islands,' '' Starr said. ''In Trinidad, they call me a Yankee, and that's considered an insult.''\nAt the same time, however, these ties to home are often a source of strength -- an escape from a city where many live in a social underclass to another, freer world, where their families' social status has been elevated by emigration. It helps keep their immigrant aspirations alive.\nLiliana Maldonado, a 20-year-old computer student, has spent every summer in her parents' hometown in Ecuador.\n''I think of it as going home, and I was born here, which says a lot,'' she said. ''What it feels like to me is a relief.''\nCitizenship -- Dual Identities, Dual Loyalties\nThat the McManus Midtown Democratic Association, a century-old bastion of Irish-American politics, has a president born and raised in Cali is testament to the changing face of New York City.\nThat the president, Carlos Manzano, is a dual citizen of Colombia and the United States speaks volumes about the changing immigrant identity. At the same time as he courts Jewish, Italian and Irish voters in the district he seeks to represent in the New York City Council, he sends routine mailings about Colombian politics to his countrymen in the New York area.\n''Fortunately, the election cycles here and there don't overlap,'' he said. ''This spring, I was focused on the presidential elections down there. By fall, I'll shift gears back here.''\nAlthough immigrants taking the oath of United States citizenship must renounce their homelands, the renunciation carries no teeth. American courts increasingly tolerate dual nationality, and since the end of the Cold War, other nations have relaxed their attitudes toward the concept, too.\nSome countries have long allowed it, and in the last decade, many others, including Russia and Poland, have decided to simply ignore their countrymen's new citizenship. And others have enacted dual nationality or citizenship laws as they have come to see their emigrants as assets rather than traitors; among them are Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Italy and Mexico.\nThe Mexican law, overnight, created a potential population of millions of dual nationals, as it not only recognizes Mexican-born Americans but their children. Since the new law took effect, five New Yorkers a day have sought to recapture their Mexicanness.\n''The binational society is a trend that is unstoppable,'' said Jorge Pinto, Mexico's consul in New York. ''It used to be limited to the border, but now the links are far afield.''\nFor some, the issue of dual citizenship poses the ultimate question raised by the transnational phenomenon: Where does an immigrant's allegiance lie? Some fear that dual loyalties are necessarily dueling loyalties, and that the bond between a citizen and his state should be exclusive.\nOthers, though, say this is an old-fashioned notion in a world that is not at war, and an impractical one in the face of a global reality of entwined economies, of businesses and families that straddle borders.\nLike Mr. Manzano, Fernando Mateo sees himself as doubly loyal. Naturally, almost physiologically, ebullient, Mr. Mateo hungered for a public role in his community once he no longer had to work day and night to keep his business afloat. His civic energy expressed itself both here and there.\nIn New York, he devised a campaign to urge New Yorkers to trade their illegal guns for toys. The Toys for Guns program went national and international. Mr. Mateo went on Oprah, met Bill and Hillary Clinton, and became a darling of Spanish-language television, which has hemispheric reach.\nThrough his minor renown here, Mr. Mateo was able to assert himself as a player in Dominican politics there. Last year, he won a battle to secure immigrants the right to vote from the United States -- making the Dominican population in New York the second-largest concentration of votes in any Dominican election, after Santo Domingo.\nIt also allows New Yorkers, including Mr. Mateo, to contemplate running for their homeland's highest offices. Mr. Mateo feels he has two countries, one that shaped him emotionally, and another that helped him rise above his station in life. He would fight for either country in a war, he said.\nOn a spring morning, from his home in Irvington, Westchester, Mr. Mateo debated by phone his potential as a candidate for election in the Dominican Republic -- with David Garth, the veteran New York political consultant.\nIn Yamasa, the Dominican Republic, Mr. Mateo continued the conversation with his wife as they danced to salsa on his brother's porch. Stella Mateo admires her husband's political ambitions, but she does not want to move back to the Dominican Republic.\nHips swaying, Mr. Mateo dipped her and said, ''Babe, you smell that goat on the grill? That's not a smell you get every day in Westchester.''\n''Freddy, honey,'' she answered, ''you like the smell of hamburgers and hot dogs, too.''\nMr. Mateo's cellular phone rang. The music stopped. A third conversation began, this one private. Mr. Mateo's mother, who had been rocking in a chair drinking milk from a coconut, said: ''Who is it? New York again?'' She smiled proudly.\n''My little gringo,'' she said.\nHere and There\nTODAY -- Coming to America, holding on to the homeland.\nMONDAY -- From New York to Jaipur: The pull of tradition.\nTUESDAY -- The global village: A community in two places at once.\nMORE ON LINE -- These articles, with additional photographs and charts, as well as a forum for discussion, are available on The New York Times on the Web, at www.nytimes.com/immigration.
