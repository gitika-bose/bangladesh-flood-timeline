[{"text": "After the floods : Bangladesh faces a food crisis\n2004-10-27T05:00:00.000Z\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 The hungry season is fast approaching in Bangladesh, and all the portents for it are bad.\nWhile the annual monsoon rains have stopped, and the floodwaters that covered the country in July and then again in September have for the most part receded, the specter of a severe food crisis is emerging. In Bangladesh, the months of October and November are called the \"monga,\" the period when food stocks run out and job opportunities dry up just before the main rice harvest in December. It is never easy for the millions of poor in Bangladesh to limp through these months. But because of the massive damage from the floods to the country's rice crop, this year the monga will be looking to claim far more victims than usual.\nAlready we have seen a jump in rice prices of between 20 and 30 percent since the beginning of the year. The cost of vegetables in the markets in Dhaka has gone up many times over. Anybody who has to buy food in order to eat is going to feel the pinch, but the nip will be sharpest for the urban slum dwellers and the landless rural poor, neither of whom have the ability to produce their own food.\nThe World Food Program is in the midst of an emergency operation to get food aid to five million people who were the hardest hit by the floods. So far, we have distributed food to some three million people, including schoolchildren, in flood-affected areas. In the coming weeks, we want to begin delivering a month's supply of rice to 900,000 families and a nutritional supplement to 400,000 women and children. It is not going to be an easy task because so far, we have received only one-fifth of the $74 million we need\nThe message coming in from our staff in the field and our nongovernmental organization partners is clear: What assistance we have been able to give up to now is not keeping pace with the needs of the Bangladeshi people. In a low-lying country flooded every year during the monsoon season, this was the worst climate disaster in six years. The floods killed more than 760 people, damaged more than 2 million homes and destroyed 1.1 million hectares, or about 2.7 million acres, of crops.\nThe statistics cannot possibly convey the suffering of the people themselves, like Morzina Bewya, a widow in Kurigram district who is the solely responsible for supporting her six children. When Morzina's house was washed away, along with most of her belongings when the second wave of monsoon-driven floods swept the country in September. The family cobbled together a hut near their former home and moved in. That is where they are today, scraping from one day to the next on what they can beg or borrow.\nMultiply Morzina by several million and you have an idea of what life is like for the poor of Bangladesh. The World Food Program and our sister agency, Unicef, have determined that more than one million children are at risk of acute malnutrition with the potential consequences of illness and death; more than 500,000 pregnant women and nursing mothers are also extremely vulnerable.\nMalnutrition is a silent but deadly predator. If it sets in when you are young, you never recover. You will be small, physically weak and mentally impaired, simply because you did not get enough food or the right kind of food at the most important time of life for human growth. The babies of malnourished mothers never realize their full potential. That is why the World Food Program for more than two decades has been fighting malnutrition among the poor rural women of Bangladesh with a development program that gives them food, education and skills training. It is the single best chance they get in their lives to rise above the worst poverty in the country.\nNow these women and their children need our help more than ever. It is unconscionable that the world could stand by while malnutrition and death stalk the shantytowns and the water-soaked countryside of Bangladesh. The remedy is available: The World Food Program's emergency operation addresses the nutritional needs of women and children in this time of crisis. It also offers long-term solutions to the annual floods in the form of food-for-work projects to build river dikes and embankments, designed to give the most vulnerable people some protection from the floods.\nWhat we need now is the assent and support of the donor community for us to go ahead and do our work.\n***\nDouglas Casson Coutts is the World Food Program representative in Bangladesh.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]\n"}, {"text": "Bangladesh Asked for International Aid to Help With Floods\n2004-07-29T05:00:00.000Z\n NEW DELHI, July 29 \u2014 The government of Bangladesh has asked for international assistance to help with rehabilitation for those affected by flooding that has left more than 400 dead and millions more homeless, marooned, or at risk of water-borne diseases. \n Floods are a recurring problem in Bangladesh, which sits in a river delta, crossed by three major continental rivers and many more tributaries. But the waters have come with particular severity this year, particularly to Dhaka, the capital, and surrounding areas. \n Millions of slum-dwellers \u2014 who live in flimsy housing on insubstantial land \u2014 have watched their homes be submerged. They have been forced to relocate to roadsides or embankments in Dhaka and on the highway outside. \n Bangladesh is the world's most densely populated country, with 147 million people crammed into an area the size of Indiana. \n \"It has far too many people in all the wrong places,\" said Douglas Coutts, the country representative for the World Food Program. Speaking by telephone from Dhaka, he was referring to the sandbars and flood plains where the poor have made their homes. \n While the levels of many rivers continued to recede today, more rain was forecast for the coming days. \n Waters continued to recede, too, in the Indian states of Assam and Bihar, which have also been badly affected by the flooding. In Bihar, where the flood waters are now much lower, 489 people have died. Half a million houses have been damaged and, by the state's estimate, $60 million in crops lost. \n In Assam, the flooding had left 199 dead as of today, and sent 1.3 million people to refugee camps. Almost three million acres of crops were damaged, as well as 522,820 homes damaged. \n Assam's chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, said in a telephone interview tonight that while the situation was improving, at least some of those displaced would have to remain in camps while their homes were rebuilt. \n He and aid officials in Bangladesh expressed concern that the worst was yet to come, in terms of the health impacts of the flood. As the waters recede, officials are bracing for a possible epidemic of diarrhea. \n The distribution of adequate food supplies has been one great challenge, with local journalists in Bangladesh reporting that not all of the promised aid was reaching people, and that some of the food was stale or rotten. Shahnoor Wahid, a journalist who works as a consultant for the World Health Organization, said he expected to see malnutrition worsen. \n But perhaps even more critical is the lack of clean water for drinking, bathing and washing. As the waters rose, tubewells and boreholes supplying clean drinking water were submerged, and sewage systems have broken down, sending fetid refuse into spreading flood waters. \n Mr. Coutts said he had watched displaced slum-dwellers scooping up flood water because they had nothing else to drink, as well as washing clothes in it. \n Mr. Wahid, who spoke by phone from Dhaka, said families often had to wade through the waters to secure relief. The country's Rotary Clubs are going to undertake a massive effort to distribute clean drinking water. But he said that he expected to see many more cases of diarrhea, as well as skin diseases like scabies. More than 27,000 cases of diarrhea have been reported from Bangladesh's flood-affected areas since July 13. \n For days, as the flood waters rose, the government resisted asking for foreign assistance. Mr. Coutts said he had seen a similar reaction in many developing countries where natural disasters are commonplace. \n \"Governments are very eager to show they can handle it themselves,\" he said.

But the waters have been particularly severe for the last three weeks, particularly in Dhaka, the capital, and its vicinity, with other countries, including India, China, Nepal and Vietnam also deluged.\nMore rain was forecast, even as many rivers receded Thursday.\nMillions of Bangladesh slum dwellers, who live in flimsy housing on insubstantial land, have watched as their homes were submerged, and then moved to roadsides or road embankments in Dhaka and the highway outside it.\nThe distribution of food has been a great challenge.

More than 2.8 million acres of farmland and 522,820 houses were damaged.\nTarun Gogoi, the chief minister of Assam, said by telephone Thursday night that while the situation was improving, some of the displaced people would have to remain in camps while their homes were rebuilt.\nHe and aid officials in Bangladesh worried that the greatest impact on health was still to come. As the waters recede, officials are bracing for a possible epidemic of diarrhea.\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh authorized the United Nations to issue an appeal for help on behalf of Bangladesh. The money would be used for rehabilitation and reconstruction. For days, as the flood waters rose, the government resisted seeking foreign help. Mr. Coutts said he had seen similar reactions in many developing countries where natural disasters are common.\n''Governments are very eager to show they can handle it themselves,'' he said.

Located on the alluvial plain of the Ganges River northeast of India, Bengal was ruled by Buddhist kings from the eighth to 12th centuries. Conquered by Muslim invaders around 1200, many inhabitants converted to Islam and Bengal became part of the Moghul Empire in the 16th century. The British East India Company established a settlement in 1642, and by 1750 all of Bengal was under British rule. The diverse agricultural economy became dominated by export crops of opium and jute, while rice continued to be grown in the fertile delta. The region's trade flowed through the British-built city of Calcutta. With Indian independence in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines, Hindu West Bengal (including Calcutta) remaining with India and Muslim East Bengal becoming the eastern province of Pakistan. In the elections of 1971, the Bengali Awami League gained control of Pakistan's National Assembly. Seating of the new National Assembly was postponed, and riots broke out in East Pakistan. Troops from West Pakistan were sent to quell the riots on May 25; the following day East Pakistan declared its independence as Bangladesh. Civil war followed; 10 million refugees fled to India. Following Indian intervention, Pakistan acknowledged Bangladesh's independence on Dec. 15. Since independence, Bangladesh has consistently been one of the world's poorest countries, plagued by violent political instability, military coups, overpopulation, a flagging economy, and frequent catastrophic floods (including one in 1975 that killed half a million people). The first president, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated in 1975. Lt. Gen. Hossain Mohammad Ershad, who seized power in a coup in March 1982, was elected president in 1986, but resigned in 1990 in the face of opposition unrest. In 1991, the Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) of Begum Khaleda Zia (widow of former president Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981) won 138 of 330 parliamentary seats running on a platform of free enterprise and an Islamic state. In 1991, the constitution was amended to put the prime minister in charge of the government. In 1994, nearly 150 opposition members of Parliament resigned en masse, eliciting a promise from Prime Minister Zia to hold general elections in June 1996. In those elections, the Awami League, led by Sheik Hasina Wazed, returned to power for the first time since 1975, when the military massacred most of her family, including her father, Pres. Sheik Mujibur Rahman. In 1998, fifteen were convicted and sentenced to death for their role in the assassinations. Zia's call for nation-wide protest strike went unanswered, but her BNP (in Jan. 1999) was one of three parties, with General Ershad's Jatiya and the Moslem Jamaat-e-Islami, to form a bloc seeking to force early elections upon prime minister Hasina. After completing Bangladesh's first-ever five-year term, premier Hasina and her Awami League faced the voters in Oct. 2001 only to be buried in a surprise landslide victory by former premier Khaleda Zia and her Nationalist party coalition.

As customers came in asking for The Weekly Bangalee or Thikana, or to peruse the headlines about the floods and violence in Bangladesh, Mohammed Kanruzzaman, 32, regarded them benignly.\n\"When they come from work they stand here and read and then they go home,\" said Mr. Kanruzzaman, the owner of the grocery store-cum-makeshift reading room, who claims to read all of the Bengali weekly newspapers that are published in the New York area.\nThat's no mean feat. In the last decade, one or two new Bengali-language newspapers have appeared every year in New York City. Out of tiny offices dotted throughout Queens, and often with minuscule staffs, almost a dozen newspapers now issue forth every week.\nSo now in New York City, more newspapers are printed in Bengali than in any other South Asian language. The City Planning Department estimates that there are 38,500 Urdu speakers and 47,500 Bengali speakers in the city, but Bengali newspapers outnumber Urdu newspapers two to one.\n\"There are certain communities that are very word-oriented, very publication-oriented,\" said Juana Ponce de Le\u00f3n, editor of the Independent Press Association project, Voices That Must Be Heard, which translates articles from the ethnic press into English.\nKazi Shamsul Hoque, editor of The Akhon Samoy, agreed.\n\"Bangladeshis have very good reading tendencies,\" said Mr. Kazi, who worked as an editor of a labor newspaper in Bangladesh and now owns a wireless store in Jackson Heights. \"They are buying almost every newspaper.\"\nExhibit A is Fazlu Haque, who was reading The Weekly Darpon on the Q train last month.\n\"One doesn't finish the news with one paper,\" said Mr. Haque, who was looking for information about a bomb explosion at an opposition rally in Dhaka. \"Tomorrow I will buy a new one.\"\nThe newspapers are published so that there are at least one or two fresh ones everyday, although the editors say this is accidental. The oldest of New York's Bangladeshi newspapers, Thikana, was started in 1990 by M. M. Shaheen, an immigrant who had worked as a waiter at Windows on the World and went on to run his own restaurants.\nMr. Shaheen began putting out the newspaper with the help of people who had worked as journalists in Bangladesh. Two of them, Kowshik Ahmed and Mohammad Mahbubur Rahman, now publish rival newspapers, The Weekly Bangalee and The Weekly Bangla Patrika, respectively. While none of the dozen newspapers' circulations have been audited, Thikana, which has the largest New York staff, claims a circulation of 15,000. At grocery stores in Kensington, a heavily Bangladeshi area, shop owners said that Thikana sold the best.\nAll of the newspapers are tabloids that feature news from Bangladesh, and most cost a dollar. Popular stories involve immigration news, stories about religious toleration or dissension, crimes against Bangladeshis and the festivities of the many regional associations.\n\"The main focus of these community newspapers is not the news, but the news that people want,\" said Abedin Quader, publisher of one of the newest papers, The Kagoj Bangla News Weekly. \"What is the news value of what happens in Bangladesh and how two ministers are fighting? It's nothing. But these things are very important to those who buy these newspapers.\"\nSome of the papers carry the syndicated advice column of a cleric in Bangladesh. Thikana has a column about Washington politics. All of the them have a literature page, which showcases poems and fiction written by the readers.\n\"Bengali people like literature,\" said Mr. Monjur Hossain, the vice president of marketing at Thikana and the owner of Darpon, Thikana's sister paper. In fact, he said, they demand it: \"Otherwise it is not a full newspaper. They will say you are showing disrespect for writers.\"\nBecause of the respect Bengalis have for the written word, many writers and publishers want to be in the newspapers to increase their social standing.\n\"Most of the owners of the newspapers are facing some sort of identity crisis,\" said Moinuddin Naser, who works as an editor at Patrika and also translates articles for Voices That Must Be Heard. \"They have the money and all these things but they are lost in the American mainstream. They think that a newspaper can give them a sort of identity that is known to all.\"\nMany of those working as journalists worked in other fields before entering the news business.\n\"When you are a master's from Dhaka University, you cannot sell your diploma here,\" said Mr. Quader, of Kagoj. \"So what do they do for survival? Either they start a job in the restaurant or they start cabbing, and both are demeaning to them. So when they get this kind of job, they grab it.\"\nAt least one person, Mr. Shaheen, the founder of Thikana, parlayed his newspaper fame into a career in politics. In 1993, he returned to Bangladesh and won a seat in Parliament as an independent candidate. For others, the newspapers' roles in helping the Bangladeshi community in America -- especially after 9/11 -- is what drives them.\n\"There's been a shift in the past three years to reporting on Muslims and non-Bangladeshi communities,\" said Jane Yager, who is working on a master's in religious studies at Harvard University. Ms. Yager worked at Voices That Must Be Heard in 2003 and has studied the Bengali press in New York as part of Harvard's Pluralism Project, which explores religious diversity in America.\nWhere the newspapers were once centered exclusively on Bengali issues, they now also cover events in other Muslim communities. \"Circumstances have thrust a lot of Bangladeshi immigrants into a more politicized role as Muslims,\" Ms. Yager said.\nMr. Naser, a journalist at the Patrika who also translates articles for Voices That Must Be Heard, said that the newspapers definitely have a post-9/11 consciousness.\n\"Before, we were not that serious, terrorism would not get that much importance, hate crimes would not get that much importance,\" he said.\nAccording to some editors, however, the new coverage can sit poorly with readers, especially if they feel a newspaper is portraying Bangladeshis or Muslims in a bad light. Mr. Quader said he worried about this when his paper ran an article on an imam of Bangladeshi origin who was arrested in an F.B.I. sting operation in Albany in which an informant posed as an arms dealer.\n\"It is a very big story,\" Mr. Quader said. \"Still my readers say, 'Why are you playing it up out of all proportion? Why do you put my Muslim brother on the front page?\"'\nEditors at Thikana said that they faced threats over publication of articles on an imam accused of child molestation.\n\"The community people thought we were wrong and they burned this newspaper,\" said Mr. Mohammed Sayeed-ur-Rabb, Thikana's editor-in-chief. \"They threatened us, they cursed us.\"\nDespite their successes, some of the editors feel that the market might be saturated. None of them have any plans to become dailies any time soon.\n\"It is a little worrisome,\" said Mr. Naser of Patrika. \"Everything is going up, but revenue is being split among the newspapers. It is actually harmful for the growth of newspapers in the Bangladeshi community.\""}, {"text": "World Briefings\n2004-08-06T05:00:00.000Z\n ASIA \n CHINA: PRISON FOR 2 IN BABY FORMULA SCANDAL China has sentenced two men to prison for selling a low-cost milk powder in which nutritional supplements had been replaced with starch or sugar, a crime that resulted in the deaths of 13 babies, sickened many others and caused outrage across the country.

(Reuters) \n GEORGIA: PEACEFUL OVERTURES Negotiators agreed to reduce tensions in the separatist Georgian region of South Ossetia, but put off most of the thorny issues that have brought the two sides close to open conflict. Diplomats from Georgia and South Ossetia, along with Russian officials, spent two days hammering out a protocol emphasizing the avoidance of force but avoiding such issues as Georgian checkpoints in the territory and South Ossetia's status. South Ossetia broke with Georgia 12 years ago and has sought to become part of Russia. Long-simmering antagonisms have erupted in sporadic gunfire and border blockades.

The toll in South Asia - Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and India - included 13 deaths newly reported in Bangladesh. The annual South Asia flooding, fed by melting snow and torrential rains, has left millions in need, as waters have washed away homes, roads, crops and telephone lines.

Since April, President Fidel Castro's government has freed six dissidents on health grounds and released another four opponents who had been held without trial for two years. Last year's repression led to a deterioration in the European Union's relations with Cuba, which froze contacts with European diplomats for their support of dissent.

About one-third of Dhaka and two-thirds of Bangladesh is under water, officials said. Since the floods began three weeks ago, thousands of Bangladeshi villages have been flooded and at least 285 people have been killed. More than 10 million are homeless. Roads, train lines and embankments have been washed away in 43 of the country's 64 administrative districts. Foreign aid has also begun to flow in, with Britain saying it will provide $18 million. The floods have killed more than 700 people across South Asia, almost 400 in the eastern Bihar State of India. Weather officials are predicting more rain.

No one was injured. The man, a 32-year-old librarian from Hunan Province, tried to take over the Boeing 737, en route from Beijing to Changsha in the south with 108 passengers, minutes after it took off, the New China News Agency reported. He told the crew that he had companions on board carrying acid. The police found no acid or other hijackers.

General Yudhoyono won 33.5 percent of the votes cast in the July 5 election - the first in which Indonesians could vote directly for their president - with Mrs. Megawati at 26.6 percent, the election commission said.

(AP) \n MIDDLE EAST \n ISRAEL: COURT BACKS VANUNU TRAVEL BAN Mordechai Vanunu, who was released in April after 18 years in prison for disclosing nuclear secrets, lost a court case in which he sought the lifting of restrictions placed on him by the government. The High Court of Justice upheld the restrictions that limit Mr. Vanunu's movements inside Israel and prevent him from leaving the country for a year. Mr. Vanunu is also barred from speaking to foreigners, including the foreign media. The court said the restrictions were necessary because Mr. Vanunu could disclose more secrets. \"I don't like Israel,\" Mr. Vanunu told journalists after the court decision. \"I don't want to live in Israel.'' Mr. Vanunu, a former nuclear technician, was imprisoned after he detailed his work at Israel's secretive nuclear reactor in a 1986 interview with the British newspaper The Sunday Times.Greg Myre (NYT) \n ISRAEL: CABINET APPROVES HORSE RACING Cabinet members approved a proposal to permit horse racing and wagering in Israel, which has long resisted legalized gambling.

Ms. Leblanc, 23, told the police that six men of North African and African origin attacked her on a suburban Paris train this month after they mistakenly identified her as a Jew.

A lesbian couple in Toronto identified in court papers as M.M., 41, and J.H., 61, had been together for 10 years before marrying in June. Five days after the wedding, they separated. Granting the divorce, though, will require another legal breakthrough.

High demand and fears of terrorism have oil markets on edge, but you can blame Vladimir V. Putin next time you pay $50 to fill up your tank. Mr. Putin's prosecution of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the Yukos oil baron and a political enemy who has been charged with tax evasion and fraud, has left Russia's largest oil company in such disarray that it may cut off supplying world markets with 1.7 million barrels a day.\nAID GROUP GIVES UP ON AFGHANISTAN: Doctors Without Borders, which has provided life-saving medical aid to Afghanistan through the Soviet occupation, the rebellion of the mujahadeen, and the rule of the Taliban, announced that it was pulling out of the country because it has become too dangerous. Five of the organization's aid workers were gunned down on June 2. So far, no one has been charged with those killings, and the group said it had little confidence that President Hamid Karzai's government could protect it from warlords and resurgent Taliban fighters. The aid agency has pulled out of only one other nation -- North Korea.\nDEADLY HOSPITALS: A new survey of data from 50 states concluded that medical errors are killing 195,000 people a year in American hospitals -- double the previous estimate. HealthGrades, a private company that rates hospitals for insurers and health plans, said that if hospital errors were included on the nation's list of the leading causes of death, they would show up as No. 6 -- ahead of diabetes, pneumonia and Alzheimer's.\nBANGLADESH UNDERWATER: Torrential rains and floods inundated two-thirds of the country, forcing 500,000 people into shelters. More than 1,100 people have died in Bangladesh and India because of the flooding, and health officials said dysentery and diarrhea were spreading among the refugees.

Hulking American helicopters delivered tons of food. People with money and power -- aid workers and American soldiers -- attended to Mapou.\nFor the first time, and perhaps the last, someone strong is looking after the people of Mapou and its outlying hamlets. The people here lost as many as 1,670 of their friends, neighbors and relatives in the floods that have destroyed swaths of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, according to one Red Cross official in Mapou on Sunday, Erich Baumann.\nThe 1,900 American soldiers in Haiti -- and their helicopters, now Mapou's lifeline -- will start leaving the country on Tuesday. They will all be gone in a month.\nAbout 1,500 of them are marines based at Camp Lejeune, N.C. More than 1,000 of them were scheduled to go to Iraq in August. Some may take a bit more time to rest, retool and retrain, but almost all will head to Baghdad and beyond by year's end.\nThe Haitian government has about $3 per person to help the estimated 75,000 people affected by the flood. With so little money to aid Mapou's survivors, the government may force them to move. Many of the survivors say they might as well leave forever.\n''This land is cursed,'' said Lilie Jean-Baptiste, 26, who like most of her neighbors had willed a living out of the earth, growing a little cassava, buying rice and beans when she scraped a dollar or two together. ''Mapou is over.''\nMarcberth St.-Louis, 21, is the son of dirt farmers who dreamed of a better life abroad someday. Mr. St.-Louis, who speaks fluent French, Creole, Spanish and a little English, said: ''For many people here, life is finished. People loved their little piece of land but it's all gone now.''\nRaymond Delaba, 15, a survivor of the torrent that took Mapou and now the sole support for his six younger brothers and sisters, said: ''It's just impossible to survive here, with or without the flood. My parents are gone. My house is gone. Our pigs and goats are gone. How am I going to survive? Are we going to eat a handful of rice out of a bag from abroad for the rest of our lives?''\nThis is what life was like before the flood in Mapou and its six surrounding hamlets -- one of which, Barrois, was completely destroyed:\nAs in most of Haiti's villages, the average income here is a dollar a day or less. Last year, a drought shriveled the corn. For Christmas, fate gave Mapou a flash flood. During and after the February revolt that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected leader, the price of rice -- the staff of life for Haitians -- rose 50 percent in Mapou. That meant 50 percent less to eat, Mapou's survivors said.\nNo leader of Haiti has ever visited Mapou, the people said. ''For the poor, there is no government,'' Ms. Jean-Baptiste said. ''The only government of Haiti is God.''\nNow, starting June 1, a coalition of foreign soldiers cobbled together by the United Nations will begin to replace the American-led force that occupied Haiti after the fall of Mr. Aristide, who flew to exile in South Africa on Sunday.\nIt is unclear that this force will have the organization, money or equipment to deal with the emergencies of food, medicine and shelter facing survivors of the flood, who will need help for months to come.\nThe force is supposed to include soldiers from Brazil, China, France, Argentina, Nepal, Bangladesh, Uruguay and the Philippines. But it remains largely a force on paper, though a ceremony beginning the transfer is to take place on Tuesday and the new United Nations force is set to assume command on June 20.\nThe question is what happens to the people of Mapou when the world's fleeting attention -- and the American soldiers -- move on.\nThe same might be asked of the people of nearby Fond Verrettes, where the dead and missing now number close to 200, and Jiman\u00ed, just over the border in the Dominican Republic, where more than 700 are dead or missing. No one has counted the dead in two small floodstruck Haitian towns, Nan Galet and Boulou, but unofficially the toll in both nations is now well over 2,000.\nThe United Nations is already running more than a few major operations in places like Liberia, where thousands of peacekeepers patrol a devastated country. The world's aid agencies are struggling to handle a world of crises, many man-made, in places like Afghanistan. The charitable responses of the world's governments to Haiti have been far less than the United Nations sought.\nSo the withdrawal of American forces will not help Haiti cope with its latest disaster.\nThe American military began arriving Feb. 29, the day President Aristide fell, as the capital, Port-au-Prince, was stormed by armed rebels calling for a return of the notorious Haitian Army he had disbanded.\nThe Americans were seen by many Haitians as an occupying force; the United States Marines invaded and essentially ruled Haiti from 1915 to 1934. The return of American forces was welcomed by the armed rebels. But they were hated and feared by armed Aristide loyalists, who saw them as part of the political equation that ended Mr. Aristide's presidency.\nIn the last three months, the American military role in Haiti has shifted from taking -- and returning -- hostile fire, to building a firewall between pro- and anti-Aristide gunmen, to providing a measure of comfort.\nTroops have delivered 153 tons of food, 30,000 gallons of water, and 13 tons of supplies like tarpaulins and cooking tools to flood victims in the past five days. Before the flood, American, French, Canadian and Chilean soldiers here distributed food and medicine, cleaned up tons of garbage, refurbished schools and repaired orphanages.\nUnited States marines are trained to fight a ''three-block war,'' an idea conceived by Gen. Charles Krulak, Marine Corps commandant from 1995 to 1999.\n''You're handing out humanitarian assistance to people, you're peacekeepers intervening between forces, you're getting shot in combat,'' is the way Lt. Col. Dave Lapan of the Marines, the spokesman for the American military in Haiti, explains the three-block doctrine. ''Our forces would be able to do all three because, increasingly, that is the world we are going to be living in.\n''Haiti has been exactly that,'' Colonel Lapan said.\n''When we were first here, we were getting shot at,'' he said. ''We shot back. That calmed things down. Then you get into a neighborhood and help people. That helps protect you. You get information. You get a feeling from the populace that you're not here as an 'occupying force.' Giving people water, rebuilding schools -- that contributes to the mission.''\nHaiti, he said, has ''given our marines an experience that will help them later on'' -- in the months to come, when they arrive in Iraq."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n2004-07-30T05:00:00.000Z\nINTERNATIONAL A3-8\nIraq Delays Conference As 5 More Are Kidnapped\nIraq postponed a major national conference billed as one of its first steps toward democracy and national reconciliation.

''I hope, I hope it can happen.''\nYesterday was the first in a series of free informational sessions organized by the Taxi and Limousine Commission for the taxicab medallion auction in April, only the second in the city's history and part of the largest expansion of the taxi fleet since the Depression.\nThe first 300 medallions out of 900 are to be sold in a closed-bid auction next month. At more than $225,000 a piece, the coveted slips of tin are not cheap. The life of a cabdriver is also notoriously difficult, filled with long hours and difficult passengers. But for many, especially the immigrants who have long dominated the industry and have few other options, a taxi medallion holds the promise of financial independence.\n''This is the best way to earn money, but it's hard,'' said Nazir Hossain, a Bangladeshi immigrant who drove a leased cab from a fleet several years ago but quit after a year and a half because of the stress. He and friend recently opened a deli in Brooklyn, but he said he would return to driving a cab if he could be his own boss.\n''If I get ownership, I don't need to pay anyone else,'' he said.\nMr. Hossain listened intently as taxi commission officials sped through an explanation of the ownership requirements, the bid process and the average costs and income for medallion owners.\nThe process is clearly not for the noncommittal. Medallions are financed through loans similar to mortgages on homes. The typical down payment is $50,000, and this does not include the cost of buying a vehicle. A Ford Crown Victoria, the workhorse of the city's taxi fleet, costs about $24,000.\nFactoring in insurance, maintenance, gasoline, tires, assorted other expenses and monthly payments of roughly $1,500 for a 15-year loan, annual operating expenses for owner-drivers average more than $40,000, taxi officials said. A new medallion owner should be able to gross about $90,000, for a yearly income of about $50,000.\nFor many, it is the start-up costs that are most daunting. Mr. Hossain said he has been saving for a house for his wife and two children but could redirect the money toward a medallion purchase. ''I have to calculate,'' he said.\nMatthew W. Daus, the chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, encouraged aspiring owners yesterday to be creative, suggesting they invest together with family members or friends.\nMohammad Mia, his cousin Washim Bhuiyan and their friend, Mijan Rahman, are planning to pool their savings to buy a pair of medallions. Hailing from the same small city in Bangladesh and in their early 20's, they want to start a taxi fleet together.\n''This is the business we're going to do,'' Mr. Mia said. ''We're not afraid to work hard.''\nTo help spread the word about yesterday's seminar and others scheduled over the next week, the commission bought newspaper ads in several ethnic and English-language newspapers and mailed out almost 100,000 postcards.\nBut even city officials said they were caught off guard by the number who showed up. Dozens of extra chairs had to be carted in, and many in the diverse crowd were forced to listen from the hallway.\nAt the end, Mr. Daus tried to assuage those overwhelmed by the flood of information or worried about the steep price, reminding them, ''This is what the American dream is all about.''\nTo Mr. Salih, from Sudan, Mr. Daus's words were not just a sales pitch. Working seven days a week, nine hours a day, leasing from a fleet, he sends much of his money home to Sudan, where his wife and four children remain.\nHe plans to attend another technical session in a few weeks that will further explain the process, and he vowed to scrounge up the funds.\n''I think I can prepare the money,'' he said."}, {"text": "Bangladesh Is Surviving to Export Another Day\n2004-12-14T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nDHAKA, Bangladesh - Not long ago, garment makers in the world's poorest countries were in utter dismay, fearing that the long-planned abolition of global trade quotas for textiles and apparel next month would wipe out their factories and send millions of jobs to more competitive operations in China. The International Monetary Fund warned that a quarter of Bangladesh's exports and 2.3 million jobs here could evaporate next year, shaking the entire economy.\nSo why, then, is Abu Taher tripling his work force, adding five floors to his cotton trousers factory here? And why is Annisul Huq, just down the road, hiring 2,000 more workers and building two new factories -- adding to the eight he already has -- to churn out more shirts and sweaters for Calvin Klein, Van Heusen and others?\nIt turns out that the outlook for the textile and apparel makers here and elsewhere is not as bleak as many experts had thought, at least for the bigger, more up-to-date factories in developing countries, especially those like Bangladesh and Pakistan with large, low-wage work forces. \"Retailers are asking for better factories, more volume,\" said Mr. Huq, who got a master's degree in economics and did a stint in television before he started his apparel-making business. \"I do not foresee immediately an earthquake in 2005.\"\n[In an additional nod to countries like Bangladesh, China said on Sunday that it would tax clothing exports to stem excessive growth next year. And if that is not sufficient, the Bush administration is prepared to further limit Chinese imports.]\nStill, the end to decades of textile and clothing quotas on Jan. 1 is beginning to spin the economics of the developing world around and around. The expiration of the quotas is intended to allow for free-flowing trade in garment making. It used to be that by guaranteeing a certain level of clothing production from just about every poor country in the world, quotas became a classic engine for nations with cheap labor and low skills to connect effectively with the global economy.\nBut now, without quotas to ensure access, quality and modernity will count as much as, if not more than, low wages. Poor countries will have to compete on the scale and skill of their factories and on the efficiency of their roads, ports and electrical grids. Most of the cost of clothing lies not in the labor but in the logistics of moving it to stores for sale, so low manufacturing wages by themselves are not enough.\nOf the typical $48 to $54 for delivering a dozen long-sleeve men's shirts to Bangladesh's main port, for example, most goes for the fabric, often imported from China. Just $5 goes to the foreman, technicians and assembly workers, who earn as little as 70 cents a day.\nYet, the savings on labor costs here and in some other developing countries are enough to keep retailers from switching suppliers for now, especially as the Bush administration has re-imposed quotas on several categories of Chinese exports and is poised to do so on more.\n\"Our policy is to take a conservative position; we will continue to source from where we have been sourcing,\" said Andrew Tsuei, Wal-Mart's vice president for global purchasing, in an interview before the Chinese announcement. \"Bangladesh is very competitive because the labor cost in Bangladesh is only half of what China is, and maybe less than that.\"\nBut in the longer run, the survival of the garment industry in Bangladesh and other developing countries depends upon how well governments respond to the demands of the global market. That will be affected, in part, by how much they invest in roads, ports and electricity grids; in the past, such infrastructure has been starved of investment here and elsewhere.\nSmall factories and their workers are the most vulnerable. Less than two miles away from Mr. Huq's main factory, Shirin Akhter sat recently on a low wooden sleeping platform in her dirt-floored shack in one of this city's worst slums.\nShe lost her $15-a-month, full-time job in a pants factory a year ago and has been unable to find similar work. She now juggles two jobs as a housemaid while her husband searches for temporary work at construction sites.\n\"I can barely live here, sometimes I cannot eat regularly,\" she said, cradling her 2-year-old son, Rifat.\nThe garment industry has drawn literally millions of women out of villages into large cities in poor countries around the world. For deeply traditional countries like Bangladesh, where girls who leave their villages are seldom welcomed back, the globalization of trade in apparel and textiles has helped transform a way of life unchanged for generations.\n\"It is a silent revolution that has taken place in our country,\" said Morshed Khan, the foreign minister of Bangladesh, one of the few democracies in the Muslim world. \"For the first time in a Muslim country, hundreds of thousands of women in their late teens and early 20's are wearing cosmetics, carrying handbags and walking to work every day.\n\"There is no way in Bangladesh\" he added, \"that this government or any other government can send them back to the kitchen.\"\nJust a few months ago, it seemed unlikely that Bangladesh could avoid that fate. But now the future seems a little brighter.\nHere in Dhaka, Mr. Huq became a clothing magnate in much the same way Bangladesh became an international power in the garment industry: largely by luck.\nThe son of a senior civil servant, he earned a master's degree in economics, only to find himself jobless for two years. It was the late 1970's, and the country was struggling to recover from a devastating war of independence from Pakistan and the subsequent nationalization of many industries across Bangladesh.\n\"I was an unemployed man,\" he said, \"and there are millions of unemployed men in this country.\"\nMr. Huq became the host of a variety show, and literally stumbled into some luck when he opened a door too quickly and hit a stranger who turned out to be Noorul Quader. Mr. Quader was a civil servant who had just negotiated agreements that allowed desperately poor Bangladesh to start exporting garments without facing any serious quotas.\nMr. Quader had started a garment manufacturing business himself, and Mr. Huq went to work for him for $200 a month. A year later, Mr. Huq left and started his own business with two friends and $1,700 that he borrowed from his father. As Bangladesh's garment exports grew from $32 million to $5.9 billion in the last two decades, his business grew too.\nHe now lives in a three-story, impeccably decorated post-modern mansion and is chauffeured through Bangladesh's polluted, congested streets in a black BMW X5 sport utility vehicle.\nMr. Huq's spacious, well-ventilated and well-lit factories are designed to appeal to multinationals concerned about protecting their image from criticisms that they are exploiting workers in poor countries. The factories are fully booked with orders from brands like Calvin Klein and Van Heusen through next August, so he is building two more.\nYet Mr. Huq still worries. His workers earn $15 to $85 a month, sometimes more, based on output. That gives him an advantage over Chinese factories paying their workers $50 a month and up that also cover housing and food costs. But balancing the lower wages here are formidable disadvantages.\nOne problem lies in the hartals, national strikes called by political factions at short notice that can shut down almost all activity for one to three days. There have been 20 hartals in the last year, and even that is an improvement from recent years.\nThe biggest problem for Mr. Huq and other clothing makers here is Bangladesh's state-owned port in Chittagong. Studies have ranked it last or close to last in the world in turnaround time for big container ships. The ships must anchor in deep water offshore and then be unloaded and loaded by ancient, state-owned feeder vessels with shallow drafts.\nYet Mr. Huq's large factories have overcome these obstacles, sometimes even operating on Friday, the Islamic holy day, to meet deadlines.\n\"There are some concerns which need to be cured -- you cannot change a bureaucracy overnight,\" Mr. Huq said. \"We work overnight, we work Fridays, we work holidays, we ship the goods.\"\nBut if Bangladesh does not move quickly to raise the country's competitiveness, it will soon wind up with more unemployed workers living hand-to-mouth in slums like Banshtola.\nMs. Akhter moved here from her village four years ago, finding work as a \"helper\" in a small factory making short pants for men and boys. She used to clip stray threads after a more skilled worker sewed the pants.\nBut she lost the job a year ago when her employer ran low on orders. She has been unable to find new work, while her husband has cast about, unsuccessfully, for construction work. They rely on occasional profits from selling vegetables.\nBanshtola is filled with tiny shacks, with corrugated steel roofs and walls that are simple bamboo mats, often riddled with holes. The shacks rent for $6.75 a month. There is no running water, and the toilet is a hole in the ground at the end of one of the dirt alleys, which turn to mud during the rainy season.\nWorkers are often plagued by disease and malnutrition. And in the last two years, mosquitoes have brought an epidemic of dengue fever, which is sometimes fatal.\nMs. Akhter is resigned to her difficulties. But she looks on with a touch of jealousy at the new class of money-earners, women like Muhamad Zulekha, 27, a sweater factory worker whose nimble fingers allow her to earn $85 a month. She says that her husband now listens to her more because she can work outside the home and earn real money.\nUntil the infrastructure improves dramatically, the burden still falls on cheap workers like Ms. Zulekha -- and even Ms. Akhter when she was working, to give an edge to Bangladesh's factories, particularly if the country wants to keep a toehold as the quota system disappears.\nIndeed, big international buyers and manufacturers have proved leery of relying too heavily on a single country like China, seeing greater security in diversity. Top Form, a Hong Kong company that is the world's largest bra manufacturer, has decided to make no change to its long-standing policy of keeping 55 percent of its production in China and 45 percent in Thailand and the Philippines.\n\"Unless we see a more strengthened trade relationship between China and the United States,\" Willie Fung, the chairman of Top Form, said, \"we would not want to put all our eggs in one basket.\"\nFearful governments in other developing countries are showing rare bursts of energy, addressing long-festering problems in the hope of saving their clothing makers. Bangladesh plans to train 40,000 garment workers next year to improve their skills in conjunction with BRAC, a local nonprofit group formerly known as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and is eliminating taxes on electricity and other utilities used by garment factories.\nBut smaller or less populous developing countries like Brunei and Mongolia, and small factories practically everywhere, may still face serious losses. Executives at Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, say that they are likely to cut purchases from Fiji, Brunei, Turkmenistan and Macedonia, but plan to keep buying from the rest, and will actually increase their purchases next year from Bangladesh, their biggest single supplier of clothing, exceeding even China.\nBangladesh and other very poor countries have been lobbying Washington to grant them duty-free access to the American market. The $1.7 billion a year in apparel exports from Bangladesh to the United States currently face an average levy of 16 percent, or nearly $300 million a year, a burden that dwarfs the less than $70 million a year that the United States gives Bangladesh in foreign aid.\nArticles in this series are periodically examining changes in the global clothing business. Previous articles are available at nytimes.com/business.\nMade Elsewhere Correction: December 16, 2004, Thursday An article in Business Day on Tuesday about efforts by textile and apparel factories in Bangladesh to stay competitive as global trade quotas come to an end referred incompletely to working hours at plants operated by Annisul Huq. Mr. Huq said that while factories operated overnight or on weekends after production delays due to national strikes, natural disasters or port problems, the practice was not routine. He said workers also received compensatory time."}, {"text": "World Briefings\n2004-09-15T05:00:00.000Z\nEUROPE\nBRITAIN: BLAIR WARNS OF CLIMATE THREAT Prime Minister Tony Blair urged the international community to consider global warming a dire threat and agree on a plan of action to curb the \"alarming\" growth of greenhouse gases.

Same-sex marriage is legal in four Canadian jurisdictions - Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and the Yukon - but the federal divorce law still considers marriage as only between a man and a woman. The federal government, which has referred the issue of same-sex marriage to the Supreme Court to rule on its constitutionality before introducing legislation in Parliament to legalize it across the country, did not challenge the divorce decision and conceded that the definition of spouse in the Divorce Act violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. There are about 3,000 married same-sex couples in Canada, but until the federal divorce law is amended, the decision relates only to Ontario, the most populous province. The identities of the women, who had been together for nearly 10 years but separated after five days of marriage in June 2003, were kept secret.

(Reuters)\nBANGLADESH: CAPITAL PARALYZED BY FLOODS Life in Dhaka came to a halt amid floods caused by the heaviest rains in half a century. Houses were inundated, vehicles stranded and all schools and government offices closed, with the water level up to chest height in some places. An official of the Meteorological Department said 13.6 inches of rain fell on Monday in Dhaka, the highest amount recorded in the past 50 years. (Agence France-Presse) "}, {"text": "Unnatural Weather, Natural Disasters: A New U.N. Focus\n2004-05-18T05:00:00.000Z\nAs 1999 drew to a close, two weeks of continuous rain drummed down the sides of the \u00c1vila Mountains in northern Venezuela. The soil was so saturated that landslides and mudflows careered down the mountain, washing away towns, dams and bridges and claiming thousands of lives.\nAlthough this was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recent decades, it was far from unique. Last year, 700 floods, storms and other weather calamities claimed 75,000 lives worldwide and caused about $65 billion in economic damage. By far, most of the victims -- about 98 percent -- were in the poorest nations.\nBut officials at the World Meteorological Organization, the world's weather agency, say that in the future that toll can be cut in half. The little-known United Nations agency, with 187 member countries, began a drive in March to improve early weather warnings and disaster preparations, and to build up weather agencies in developing countries.\nMichel Jarraud, who took over as secretary general of the Geneva-based agency in January, said sweeping improvements in forecasting had made it possible to notify people of impending disasters in time to evacuate them or shore up their defenses.\n''Five-day forecasts today are as good as two-day forecasts were about 20 years ago,'' Mr. Jarraud said. And they can be broadcast almost instantaneously, almost anywhere in the world.\nChina, for example, used such forecasting when its coast was hit by Typhoon Winnie in 1997, said Gao Lanying, a meteorologist with the Chinese weather agency. Accurate forecasting allowed the government to broadcast typhoon information hourly, to recall fishing boats to port, to evacuate 1.4 million people from risky and low-lying areas, and to move grains and other materials. The death toll was 239, rather than thousands, she wrote in a recent paper analyzing China's meteorological disasters.\nWhile forecasting has improved, Mr. Jarraud said there was a worrisome gap between developed countries and developing ones. Poorer nations often lack the means to use weather data to blunt the effects of natural disasters and to avoid disruptions to food and water supplies.\nThe cost of natural disasters and their negative effects on development have attracted the attention of the World Bank, which no longer thinks of disasters as a purely humanitarian issue. Natural disasters can decimate a country's economy. Venezuela's 1999 mudslides cost the country $3.2 billion. Honduras lost 41 percent of its annual gross domestic product when Hurricane Mitch barreled through in October 1998, according to the World Bank.\n''This is not just a natural phenomenon and there's nothing to do about it,'' said Margaret Arnold, a hazard management official at the bank. ''There is a lot you can do.''\nMr. Jarraud said such devastating losses made it urgent to take action. ''We have to get out of our box and look at things from a wider perspective to help these countries,'' he said.\nBy contrast, industrialized nations incorporate weather predictions into their emergency preparedness efforts. ''We don't have situations such as countries like Bangladesh, where a natural disaster can kill thousands of people,'' said Dr. Ronald D. McPherson, executive director of the American Meteorological Society. ''Those people would have been moved away in advance.''\nOne reason the United States loses relatively few lives is experience; it has had to learn to cope with some of the world's worst weather. ''We have about as many hurricanes as China, as many winter storms as Russia and Europe, thunderstorms and virtually all the world's tornadoes plus big distances here, which make everything vulnerable to disruption,'' said William Hooke, director of the meteorological society's atmospheric policy program.\nBut Dr. McPherson noted that developing countries often lacked preparedness plans. ''Part of it is lack of money and lack of experience,'' he said, ''and it's lack of political will.'' Many politicians do not understand what modern forecasting can do, he said, and some cultures are fatalistic about such catastrophes.\nVenezuela's government has promised to put a high priority on developing a rainfall monitoring network, coupled with an early warning system for the \u00c1vila Mountains, where thousands still make their homes along banks carved out by the mudflows or on crumbling hillsides.\n''Perhaps we cannot prevent landslides, flash floods and debris flows,'' said Dr. Jos\u00e9 L. L\u00f3pez, an engineering professor at the University of Central Venezuela who speaks for the government on weather issues. ''But we can be much better prepared to prevent these natural hazards from becoming disasters.''\nMr. Jarraud acknowledged that his initiative, which does not have its own budget, could not be accomplished overnight. He has set a 15-year timeline for improving early warnings and disaster preparedness, and bolstering national weather agencies.\nA first goal is to make sure that all countries have access to observations of extreme weather events that are collected by weather satellites, and assistance in incorporating such data into their emergency planning system. He also wants to help train weather service personnel, transfer useful technologies and educate the public about disaster preparedness.\nIn research, he said, every nation would benefit from more systematic studies and observations of weather phenomena. The world needs to know more about ''how and why natural hazards happen, and how they can escalate into disasters,'' he said."}, {"text": "Textile Industry to Request Limits on Chinese Goods\n2004-09-02T05:00:00.000Z\nWASHINGTON, Sept. 1 - Officials of the United States textile industry said on Wednesday that they would petition the Bush administration this month to block the flood of Chinese imports that is expected next year after global quotas on textiles and apparel are lifted.\nThe White House rejected a similar request made earlier this year by 130 Republican and Democratic members of Congress. In contrast, an administration official said on Wednesday that it would consider the appeal by the industry, much of which is centered in politically pivotal swing states.\nThe expiration of the quotas on Jan. 1, 2005, was designed to allow for free-flowing trade in textiles and clothing. But thousands of firms in developing countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia, as well as companies in the United States, fear that China, with its huge advantages, will take over the global market and drive them out of business. Leaders of the textile and apparel industry warn that the United States could lose 600,000 jobs if action is not taken this year.\nThe appeal by the lawmakers earlier this year asked that the administration seek to postpone the lifting of the quotas. Now the industry is asking for restrictions on how much China can increase its exports here of apparel like shirts, blouses, slacks, dresses and some underwear, as well as home furnishings like cotton towels and sheets. The request is unusual because petitions to limit imports normally come after they have damaged a domestic industry.\n\"We can't afford to wait for the market disruption to occur,\" said Karl Spilhaus, president of the National Textile Association, a trade group. \"That's tantamount to calling the fire department after the house has burned down.\"\nMary Brown Brewer, a spokeswoman for the Commerce Department, said the administration would consider the petition for a safeguard even though it was based on a threat to the United States market rather than an actual disruption.\n\"We review every petition received very carefully and make our decisions on a case-by-case basis,\" Ms. Brewer said in a statement, adding that the petition had to include \"sufficient specific data necessary to make a determination as to whether imports are disrupting or threatening to disrupt the U.S. market.\"\nIf the administration imposed a safeguard just before the lifting of the quotas, it could cause confusion in the global textile industry as companies and countries prepare to abide by the agreement reached 10 years ago to drop all quotas. Industry officials also acknowledge that restricting imports could hurt American consumers.\n\"There may be less expensive goods at Wal-Mart, but at what cost in terms of lost jobs, lost wages, lost taxes paid to communities?\" said Cass Johnson, the president of the National Council of Textile Organizations.\nBut designers and merchandisers who would benefit from the lifting of quotas said manufacturers were trying to take advantage of a tough political battle in the presidential campaign. The textile industry has been governed by quotas for 40 years and has had a decade to prepare for the gradual elimination of them, said Brenda A. Jacobs, a trade lawyer in Washington for the United States Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel.\n\"This is a scare tactic, an obvious political ploy,\" Ms. Jacobs said. \"There is no question that the quotas will be lifted. There is no opportunity for a reversal.\"\nWith its vice presidential nominee, Senator John Edwards, hailing from North Carolina, a major textile state, the Democratic campaign of John Kerry said it sided with the textile industry. Phil Singer, a campaign spokesman, said that the proposed safeguards were necessary because the Bush administration had failed to stand up to China's unfair trading practices. Chief among the industry's complaints is that China manipulates its currency, which has helped it lower apparel prices by as much as 50 percent to seize more of the market.\n\"Senator Kerry wouldn't wait until after we lost our jobs before enforcing our labor laws,\" Mr. Singer said. \"The current administration's approach has been to stand by as tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs were zapped over the last four years.\"\nThe American textile trade groups have joined dozens of other industry groups from 50 countries in asking the World Trade Organization to vote on slowing down the elimination of quotas before the January deadline.\nBut global trade officials have said privately that they are losing their patience with these industry groups. They are concentrating their efforts on how to help developing nations that could suffer lasting damage with the loss of their special access to rich nations, especially the United States."}, {"text": "Antarctic Glaciers Quicken Pace to Sea; Warming Is Cited\n2004-09-24T05:00:00.000Z\nSpurred by warming coastal air and waters, some of Antarctica's glaciers have accelerated their seaward march, fresh observations show, suggesting that ocean levels might be irreversibly on the rise for centuries to come.\nGlobal warming from smokestack and tailpipe emissions of heat-trapping gases could well be contributing to the changes, but some of what is happening is probably a delayed reaction to the long warm-up since the last ice age, glaciologists said yesterday.\nOver all, Antarctica still holds a mix of conditions, with some spots cooling and others warming, but the new observations, described this week in three scientific papers, confirm that warming along the coast, as it causes fringes of ice to melt, can release larger ice sheets to flow faster to the ocean, where they will inevitably melt.\nThe changes were detected by separate satellite and aircraft surveys of small glaciers along the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula, the rugged, sharply warming arm reaching toward South America, and along giant ice sheets feeding into the Amundsen Sea.\nIn each place, the removal or weakening of fringing shelves of ice attached to the shore or seabed in front of the glaciers appears to have liberated the great inland ice sheets.\nSimilar shifts have been measured in some glaciers in Greenland, with erosion of \"tongues\" of ice protruding into the sea causing inland ice sheets to flow more quickly to the sea.\nEven with the acceleration, the potential rise in seas in this century would probably remain within the range estimated by the main international panel studying global warming, perhaps two feet or so, said some of the scientists monitoring Antarctica.\nThat change already constitutes a slow-motion catastrophe for places like Bangladesh, New Orleans and low island nations, experts say. But the findings add weight to the idea that rising seas could be a fact of life for centuries to come, requiring serious reassessments of the human penchant for living along coasts.\nIn a paper published today in the online edition of the journal Science, one team said the vast glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea were thinning twice as fast near the coast as they had in the 1990's.\nThis is important because these glaciers help drain the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, a region containing enough ice to raise sea levels 20 feet.\nThe changes in these glaciers could be a delayed response to the departure of coastal ice shelves there in the prolonged warming since the last ice age, experts not associated with the study said. But the speed-up could also have been affected by recent further warming of the air and seas in the western Antarctic, some of which is probably linked to warming of the global climate from gas emissions, independent experts and study authors said.\nWarmer seawater erodes the bond between coastal ice and the bedrock below, \"like weakening the cork in a bottle,\" said Dr. Robert H. Thomas, a glacier expert for NASA in Wallops Island, Va., the lead author of the Science paper. \"You start to let stuff out.\"\nA pair of papers published this week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters described strong additional evidence that coastal changes can speed the flow of inland glaciers, focusing on the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.\nThat region captured worldwide attention in 2002 when the floating Larsen B ice shelf, the size of Rhode Island and locked to the shore since the last ice age, abruptly disintegrated into a constellation of icebergs.\nIn subsequent flights over inland glaciers, American and Argentine scientists measured a two-fold to six-fold increase in their speed in the following months, the researchers said. Satellite measurements showed some glaciers there slumped as much as 100 feet over the same span.\nAdjacent glaciers not fronted by the departed shelf did not react, providing something rare in earth science, the equivalent of a case-control study, said Dr. Theodore A. Scambos, lead author of one of the papers on the changes along the peninsula and a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo.\nDr. Richard B. Alley, an expert on Antarctica at Pennsylvania State University who was not involved but is familiar with the findings, said the studies were cause for concern and justified a much more intensive survey of the world's thawing places.\nIn the best case, Dr. Alley said, there could be a short-term rise in sea levels that would stop as new fringing ice shelves eventually put the brakes on the glaciers. But it was also possible that conditions would set off \"complete or near-complete collapse over centuries or millennia,\" he said, guaranteeing a steady flooding of coastlines far into the future."}, {"text": "WIRELESS : Bhutan's hills are alive with sound of cellphones\n2004-12-20T05:00:00.000Z\n\nIn the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, the ancient way of life continues with few intrusions from the 21st century high-technology existence. The country remained closed to the outside world until 1974. Tourists are still prohibited from traveling on their own.\nThe Bhutanese remain wary of modern influences on their traditional Buddhist society. Thimpu, home to the royal family and the government, is said to be the world's only capital city without traffic lights.\nBut while Bhutan may get by without traffic lights, it appears to have realized it cannot miss out on the digital revolution. Soon, the shrill ringing of thousands of cellphones may echo around the picturesque mountain kingdom.\nEngineers and surveyors are criss-crossing the country, setting up the first phase of a rural telecommunications network, funded by Danida, the Danish development aid agency, and developed by Alcatel. This is a unique project connecting the geographically isolated Bhutanese with each other and the outside world via voice and Internet technology.\n\"By 2006, most of the villages will have access to a telephone,\" Ravi Sharma, president of Alcatel's Southeast Asia activities, said in a telephone interview. \"By 'access,' we mean that a telephone will be within reach of a two-hour walk from a village.\"\nMost villages will also have Internet access, with dial-up speeds of 128 kilobits per second, faster than the 56 kbps currently available in urban areas. Distance learning and telemedicine will be two of the main benefits.\nFor rural Bhutanese, this promises to bring significant improvements. Modern communications are mostly found in Thimpu and other major towns. There are just 30,000 fixed-line telephones to serve a population of 750,000 people. For Alcatel, it is a challenging and complex project. Teams bringing in equipment will face long treks or pony rides through the mountains. Some villages are so remote that it can take four days to walk there from the nearest road. There are no internal trains or flights. Engineers also could be stricken with altitude sickness, because some villages are above 3,600 meters, or 12,000 feet.\nThe rugged geography limits the technology that will be used. \"Alcatel feels wireless is the best solution for the mountainous terrain; landline equipment is not an option,\" Sharma said. So an innovative solution was devised, based on microwave radio and wireless technology. Each subscriber will be given a telephone set, a small antenna able to receive data from a central radio base station in the village and a solar cell for power.\nBhutan is not alone as it gingerly steps across the digital divide \u2014 rural or impoverished communities across the globe are increasingly getting the opportunity to employ new technologies.\n\"The project is a revolution in terms of education and communication for the rural people,\" said Sangey Tenzing, managing director of Bhutan Telecom.\nInvesting in developing countries also gives phone companies access to new and untapped markets just as the major European and American markets are becoming increasingly saturated. Alcatel has developed communications networks in the Caribbean, Romania, French Polynesia and Tunisia. In Bangladesh, Motorola has teamed up with CARE, the international humanitarian agency, to provide radio communication systems for communities vulnerable to the annual floods.\nAid agencies, like CARE or Danida, are often at the forefront of efforts to hook up isolated areas with improved communication technology.\nIn the Betul district in India, the UN Development Program has set up a center where traders can use the Internet to gain access to information on agricultural diseases, prices, marketing and the availability of produce.\n\"The telecenter has had a great impact on the lives of the villagers, since it provides them with timely market information as well as access to government forms and requests for assistance forms that would take them days to obtain before,\" said Shahid Akhtar of UNDP's Kuala Lumpur-based Asia Pacific Development Information Program.\nIn Bhutan, villagers are hoping they can benefit from that kind of access to technology without making too many changes to their ancient way of life.\n"}, {"text": "U.S. Quiet on China Trade Tax\n2004-12-14T05:00:00.000Z\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 13 - China's promise to impose new taxes on some textile exports will do little to sway the administration as it debates whether to limit the expected flood of Chinese goods next year, trade groups on both sides of the argument said yesterday.\nThe European Union, however, welcomed the Chinese announcement and reaffirmed that it would lift its textile quotas without limits.\n\"We're clear on this. We made our commitments back in 1994 and we will be delivering on those commitments,\" said Anthony Gooch, a spokesman for the European Union in Washington. \"As of January 2005, we will be lifting those quotas.\"\nBut a spokeswoman at the Commerce Department, Mary Brown Brewer, resisted making a judgment about the new Chinese proposal because critical details about the plan were missing, including the size of the tax.\nInstead, Ms. Brewer repeated the administration's pledge to oversee an orderly transition in the United States after the global quotas are lifted and \"to promote the competitiveness of U.S. industry and level the playing field for American workers.\"\nThe United States is expected to make its final decision about limiting Chinese imports beginning in February.\nMembers of the World Trade Organization agreed a decade ago to lift all trade quotas on textiles and apparel on Jan. 1, 2005, to permit the free flow of goods around the globe. But as the date nears, manufacturers in the United States and other textile-producing countries have been scrambling to protect their industries. Analysts have predicted that China could capture as much as 70 percent of the American market over the next two years.\nAt a summit with China last week, European officials said they were concerned about the effect on developing countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia that fear that their textile industries could collapse when forced to compete head on with China.\nThe Chinese government's announcement on Sunday seemed aimed at calming developing countries that worry that they will lose millions of jobs when all global tariffs on textiles and apparel are lifted.\nBut adding to the sense of crisis, the administration on Monday imposed embargoes of at least one month on an array of imported clothing and fabrics from a number of countries because the countries' shipments exceeded their quotas.\nAmerican retail apparel and textile groups called the administration's decision mean-spirited, one that could hurt businesses that had bought the goods to sell during the holidays.\nAmerican retail groups that will profit from greater access to Chinese apparel and textile goods said Monday that the Chinese proposal would do little to ease the mounting pressure from American manufacturers to protect the industry and tens of thousands of jobs.\nThe United States has been pushing China to come up with voluntary restraints once the global quota system ends and the $495 billion international textile and apparel industry is up for grabs.\nIn addition, the administration agreed Monday to consider another petition from the American textile and apparel industry to restrict the import of knit fabric from China, adding to a large variety of goods that could be limited.\nChina said prospective safeguards were illegal under W.T.O. rules, and the country had rejected the idea of voluntarily capping the amount of goods it exports to the United States.\nInstead, it offered its own proposal on Sunday. It included new tariffs on the quantity of goods exported, as well as other measures to encourage Chinese investment in textile and apparel enterprises abroad and greater production for the domestic market.\nBut Auggie Tantillo, the Washington representative of the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition, which is organizing the campaign to limit Chinese imports, said none of the measures addressed the basic problem.\n\"Even if this is a legitimate plan, it's not sufficient,\" Mr. Tantillo said. \"Chinese have a built-in advantage with unfair pricing schemes, undervalued currency and export subsidies. We still need safeguards, absolutely.\"\nMr. Tantillo said he thought that China's promise to impose a new tax for every piece of certain goods was a way to raise money for the government rather than a way to control exports.\nIn announcing the plan, a Chinese spokesman said the new duties would be collected on volume rather than quality, to encourage the manufacture of high-end textiles.\nMonday's announcement of an embargo on clothing and fabrics caught many retailers by surprise.\nNormally, countries that ship more than their quota on the last month of the year are given a reprieve and permitted to borrow from their quota for the coming year. But with global quotas ending on Jan. 1, the government announced that the containers of excess goods would be embargoed until February.\nA New York businessman who imports bedding said two containers were impounded from him, at the cost of $1,600 a month plus shipping charges. He has to decide the best way to get the same sheets, duvet covers and matching window panels to his customers and not break his bank account.\n\"We're the ones caught in the middle. We got a legal visa from India,\" said the businessman. \"Now we're the ones who have to pay.\""}, {"text": "A Cool Summer Can Mean a Chill on Business, Too\n2004-08-24T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nYesterday, Jimmy Vidal, an air-conditioner salesman in New York, fretted over his fate. It was a sweet, mild day -- in August, of all months -- so comfortable that he was vexed.\n''It's almost September,'' said Mr. Vidal, 29, assistant manager at the P.C. Richard & Son appliance store in Union Square. He noted that there had been only one day in New York City since May when the temperature exceeded 90 degrees (91 on June 9).\n''I should have a.c. overstock of maybe a hundred, two hundred, three maybe, by this time,'' Mr. Vidal said. ''I got one thousand unsold a.c.'s downstairs. I'm hurting.''\nAll over the city, people are noticing how the cool summer is hurting business. In Lower Manhattan, Hawaiian shirts, once a hot seller, are filling up the discount bin at Alice Underground. In Washington Square, Haider Ali, 55, a native of Bangladesh, says beverage sales are off at his stand because fewer people on the street need a cool drink when the weather is mild. At Coney Island, Norman Kaufman's Bumping Boat Rides, which shoots through the water, has fewer takers when the weather isn't hot.\nAnd don't even talk about ruined vacations. ''This is the shortest summer I can remember,'' said Joseph Tusa, 39, a security guard at a hospital. He and his wife, Vivien, 37, a social worker, were sitting in lounge chairs on the beach at Coney Island. ''We even took two trips to Florida and Puerto Rico because it was so cold here,'' he said. ''We never do that. We didn't even have one barbecue, and we normally have barbecues all summer long.''\nWho needs an air-conditioner when you're reaching for a sweater? Who wants Coney Island when you're shivering?\nThe summer, which ends unofficially on Labor Day, Sept. 6, has been unusually wet with nettlesome and occasionally deadly thunderstorms (a young couple was electrocuted not long ago during a flash flood in Queens). Not only has it not been hot, but some evenings have been autumnlike, with temperature in the 60's.\nFor the record, this is the seventh-coolest summer since record-keeping began in 1869. The average high temperature at Central Park from July 1 to Aug. 22 was 80.5 degrees, according to the meteorology unit at Pennsylvania State University. (The summer of 2000, for the same period, was even cooler, at 78.7 degrees, making it the coolest by far.)\nThe jet stream is the culprit, said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Penn State. It is a continentwide river of air -- four miles up -- that controls weather systems in North America. The jet stream's serpentine course helps determine where the Tusas go on vacation or whether P.C. Richard sells more air-conditioners. This year, the jet stream has veered off its normal course, barreling through British Columbia, picking up low-pressure systems, dipping down into Montana and Missouri, shooting up into Ohio and then dipping south as far as Virginia, which it rarely does.\n''The jet stream is why there is more cool air, as well as enhanced storminess and rain in New York,'' Mr. Miner said.\nSunny days were so scarce this summer that people were willing to turn down overtime to go to the beach. Henry Otero's boss at the post office, where he is a letter carrier, wanted him to work yesterday. But Mr. Otero, 39, declined so that he could spend the day at Coney Island with his wife and son.\n''This has been one of the darkest, wettest summers in a long time,'' Mr. Otero said. ''I came today because I thought this might be my only chance left for a sunny day.''\nThe Tusas said they were on the beach for the same reason. ''We hardly used the air-conditioner,'' Mr. Tusa said. ''At least we saved money that way.''\nTo be sure, the air-conditioning industry is in no danger of going out of business. Nationally, air-conditioner sales are projected to rise 7 percent, to 7.3 million units. Businesses bought air-conditioners to replace old units and because residential and business customers, remembering past hot summers, ordered more units earlier, according to the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group in Arlington, Va.\nBut that is of little consolation for Mike's Air-Conditioning, a small business in Brooklyn that sells the appliances, mainly to residential customers. Business is down 40 percent.\n''Every Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Target, Walgreen, Genovese, Pathmark and Waldbaum's sells room air-conditioners, which is what I sell,'' said Howard S. Lupowitz, who bought the business when the owner retired eight years ago.\n''Get this: for $85, you used to be able to buy a fan,'' he said. ''Now, for $75, I'll sell you sell an air-conditioner that'll cool the whole living room. If it's not the weather that gets you, the competition will.''\nThe air-conditioning industry's rule of thumb is that five days of hazy, hot and humid weather will have customers clamoring for units. But Penn State is forecasting temperatures in the low to mid-80's for the next few days, with the weekend unlikely to reach the high 80's, let alone 90.\n''I'm doomed,'' Mr. Lupowitz said.\nCorrection: October 4, 2004, Monday An article on Aug. 24 about the harm caused by cool weather in the New York region to businesses that depend on hot summers referred imprecisely to the period that meteorologists were calling the seventh-coolest, and misstated the years covered by that record. The period was July 1 to Aug. 22, not the entire summer; the average high temperature in Central Park during that time made those six and half weeks the seventh-coolest since 1900, not since 1869. A reader reported the error in late August; this correction was delayed for research."}, {"text": "'Boiling Point'\n2004-08-15T05:00:00.000Z\n By late 2003, the signals were undeniable: Global climate change is threatening to spiral out of control. \n The six-month period from June to December 2003 brought a succession of scientific findings, climate impacts, political and diplomatic developments, and responses from the financial world that vividly underscored the urgency and magnitude of the climate crisis. \n The events of that year surprised even many seasoned climate scientists-and brought home to many others the fact that, given all its ramifications, the climate crisis is far more than just an environmental issue. It is a civilizational issue. \n Nevertheless, by the end of 2003, most Americans were still in denial. \n The evidence is not subtle. It is apparent in the trickling meltwater from the glaciers in the Andes Mountains that will soon leave many people on Bolivia's mountainside villages with no water to irrigate their crops and, after that, not even enough to drink. It is visible in the rising waters of the Pacific Ocean that recently prompted the prime minister of New Zealand to offer a haven to the residents of the island nation of Tuvalu as it slowly goes under. It is evident in the floods that, in 2002, inundated whole cities in Germany, Russia, and the Czech Republic. It is underscored in the United States by the spread of West Nile virus to forty-two states-and to 230 species of birds, insects, and animals-and in the record-setting 412 tornadoes that leveled whole towns during a ten-day span in May 2003. Its reality is visible from outer space-where satellites have detected an increase in the radiation from greenhouse gases-to our own backyards. \n Seen in its full dimensions, the challenge of global climate change seems truly overwhelming. In the absence of a compelling and obvious solution, the most natural human tendency is simply not to want to know about it. \n When a crisis becomes so apparent that denial is no longer tenable, the typical response is to minimize the scope of the problem and embrace partial, inadequate solutions. Witness the voluntary approach of the Bush administration as well as the low goals of the Kyoto Protocol, which calls for industrial countries to cut their aggregate emissions by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels, by 2012. (The goal for the United States under the treaty was reductions of 7 percent below 1990 levels.) \n By contrast, the science is unambiguous: To pacify our increasingly unstable climate requires humanity to cut its use of coal and oil by 70 percent in a very short time. The grudging response in the United States, and to a lesser extent, abroad, reflects more than a profound underestimation of the scope and urgency of the problem. It betrays an equivalent underestimation of the truly transformative potential of an appropriate solution. Given the scope of the challenge, a real solution to the climate crisis seems to offer a historically unique opportunity to begin to mend a profoundly fractured world. \n But it all begins with the climate-and the stunningly rapid atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide emissions from our fossil fuels. This is trapping growing amounts of heat inside our atmosphere, heat that has historically radiated back into space. \n Unintentionally, we have set in motion massive systems of the planet (with huge amounts of inertia) that have kept it relatively hospitable to civilization for the last 10,000 years. With our burning of coal and oil, we have heated the deep oceans. We have reversed the carbon cycle by more than 400,000 years. We have loosed a wave of violent and chaotic weather. We have altered the timing of the seasons. We are living on an increasingly precarious margin of stability. \n The accelerating rate of climate change is spelled out in two recent studies-one on the environmental side, one on the energy side. \n In 2001, researchers at the Hadley Center, Britain's main climate research institute, found that the climate will change 50 percent more quickly than was previously assumed. That is because earlier computer models calculated the impacts of a warming atmosphere on a relatively static biosphere. But when they factored in the warming that has already taken place, they found that the rate of change is compounding. Their projections show that many of the world's forests will begin to turn from sinks (vegetation that absorbs carbon dioxide) to sources (vegetation that releases carbon dioxide)-dying off and emitting carbon-by around 2040. \n The other study, from the energy side, is equally troubling. Three years ago, a team of researchers reported in the journal Nature that unless the world is getting half its energy from noncarbon sources by 2018, we will see an inevitable doubling-and possible tripling-of atmospheric carbon levels later in this century. In 2002, a follow-up study by many of the same researchers, published in the journal Science , called for a Manhattan-type crash project to develop renewable energy sources-wind, solar, and hydrogen fuel. Using conservative estimates of future energy use, the researchers found that within fifty years, humanity must generate at least three times more energy from noncarbon sources than the world currently produces from fossil fuels to avoid a catastrophic buildup of atmospheric C[O.sub.2] later in this century. \n For nearly a decade after it surfaced as a public issue in 1988, climate change was regarded primarily as a remote, almost futuristic, threat based on an arcane branch of science that depended on the mind-numbing complexity and paralyzing uncertainty of an early generation of computer models whose reliability was too suspect to justify enormous policy changes. \n In 1995, the issue gained prominence when the world's community of climate scientists first declared they had detected the \"human influence\" on the climate. That finding legitimized global climate change as a major environmental issue. As a consequence, climate change was subsequently accorded the same mix of rhetorical concern and political inaction as most other environmental issues. \n In 2001, however, the issue was infused with a jolt of urgency. That January, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that the climate is changing far more rapidly than scientists had previously projected. \n More than 2,000 scientists from 100 countries, participating in the largest and most rigorously peer-reviewed scientific collaboration in history, reported to the UN that brutal droughts, floods, and violent storms across the planet will intensify because emissions from humanity's burning of coal and oil is driving up temperatures much more rapidly than scientists had anticipated just six years earlier. \n \"The most comprehensive study on the subject [indicates] that Earth's average temperature could rise by as much as 10.4 degrees over the next 100 years-the most rapid change in 10 millennia and more than 60 percent higher than the same group predicted less than six years ago,\" according to the Washington Post . \n Rising temperatures will melt ice sheets and raise sea levels by as much as thirty-four inches, causing floods that could displace tens of millions of people in low-lying areas-such as Chinas Pearl River Delta, much of Bangladesh, and the most densely populated area of Egypt. \n Droughts will parch farmlands and aggravate world hunger. Storms triggered by such climatic extremes as El Nin\u0303o will become more frequent. Diseases such as malaria and dengue fever will spread, the report noted. \n A second working group of the IPCC-one that focused on the impacts of coming climate changes-reached the extremely sobering conclusion that \"most of earth's inhabitants will be losers,\" in the words of the group's co-chair, James McCarthy of Harvard University. \n The report concluded that poor countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America with limited resources would bear the brunt of the most extreme climate changes. It added that economic losses from natural catastrophes increased from about $4 billion a year in the 1950s to $40 billion in 1999, with about one-fourth of the losses occurring in developing countries. \n (Two years later, nature had already upped the ante. In 2003, the United Nations reported that climate impacts cost the world $60 billion that year, an increase of 10 percent over the $55 billion in climate-related damages in 2002.) \n \"The scientific consensus presented in this comprehensive report about human-induced climate change should sound alarm bells in every national capital and in every local community. We should start preparing ourselves,\" declared Klaus Topfer, director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). \n In the fall of 2003, a succession of events-climatic, economic, and political-coalesced into a vivid mosaic that reflects the reach and variety of climate impacts and their reverberation through our economic and political institutions. \n Several developments, which are examined in more detail later in this book, were particularly ominous because of their scope: \n The entire ecosystem of the North Sea was found to be in a state of collapse because of rising water temperatures. \n For the first time in recorded history, the world consumed more grain than it produced for four years in a row . The reason: rising temperatures and falling water tables-both consequences of global climate change. \n The German government declared that the goals of the Kyoto Protocol need to be increased by a factor of four to avoid \"catastrophic\" changes. Otherwise, the climate will change at a rate not seen in the last million years. \n The most highly publicized impact of global warming in 2003 involved a succession of headlines from Europe about an extraordinary summertime heat wave. Scientists attributed the unusually high mortality rates not to the fact that the August temperatures were so much higher than before. The record-setting temperatures provided only a partial explanation. The link between climate change and the deaths of so many Europeans had been established in a laboratory of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) nearly six years earlier, when researchers at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center found that, as Earth's temperature has been rising, the nighttime low temperatures have been rising nearly twice as fast as the daytime high temperatures. Before the buildup of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, daytime and nighttime temperatures generally rose and fell in parallel. But as carbon levels in the atmosphere have thickened, they have tended to trap heat during the evenings, preventing it from radiating back into space once the sun has faded into the nighttime sky. \n In August 2003, that finding took on an especially grisly reality. The lingering nighttime warmth in Europe that summer deprived overheated Europeans of the normal relief from blistering daytime temperatures. As a result, people were not able to recuperate from the heat stress they had suffered during the relentlessly hot days. When that brutal summer finally subsided, it left more than 35,000 people dead. \n The following month, silently and out of view of most of the world, the biggest ice sheet in the Arctic-3,000 years old, 80 feet thick, and 150 square miles in area-collapsed from warming surface waters in September 2003. The Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, located 500 miles from the North Pole on the edge of Canada's Ellesmere Island, broke in two. A massive freshwater lake long held back by the ice also drained away. \n The same month brought another startling-and largely unanticipated-consequence of our fossil fuel use. Scientists reported that the pH level of the world's oceans had changed more in the last 100 years than it had in the previous 10,000 years-primarily because of the fallout from emissions caused by coal and oil burning. In short, the oceans are becoming acidified. \n By the fall of 2003, an eighteen-month drought in Australia had cut farm incomes in half-and left many scientists speculating that the prolonged drought may have become a permanent condition in one of the country's richest food-growing areas. \n Nor was it only the planet's physical systems that felt the threat of escalating climate change. Many financial institutions also began to feel the heat in late 2003. \n Pension fund managers, bankers, and Wall Street advisers-representing more than $1 trillion in assets-issued a \"call to action\" in November 2003 about impending climate-driven upheavals in the world's financial markets. At the meeting, which was sponsored by the United Nations, the treasurer of the state of California, Philip Angelides, declared: \"In global warming, we are facing an enormous risk to the U.S. economy and to retirement funds-that Wall Street has so far chosen to ignore.\" \n The meeting was the most elaborate effort yet by a growing group of fund managers and other finance officers to \"persuade businesses to move more aggressively to identify and address problems they might face from global warming, increasingly frequent extreme weather and other climate changes that have been linked to the rapid buildup in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases,\" according to the New York Times . \n Perhaps the strongest response of the financial community to the climate crisis came from one of the world's largest insurers. In May 2003, Swiss Reinsurance announced that it was asking directors and officers of its client companies what their firms were doing to reduce their use of fossil fuels. The company made clear that if those corporate officials were not moving aggressively enough to reduce their carbon emissions, they would risk losing liability insurance. \n But if the increasingly visible risks were causing ripples in the financial world, they seemed the subject of an almost perverse kind of satisfaction by the world's largest oil company, ExxonMobil. \n In late 2003, the oil giant announced it was anticipating a 50 percent increase in global carbon emissions by the year 2020. \"Between now and 2020 we estimate increases of some 3.5 billion tonnes per year of additional carbon emissions, so it's definitely increasing,\" said Randy Broiles, global planning manager for ExxonMobil's oil and gas production unit. \n Continues... \n Excerpted from Boiling Point by Ross Gelbspan Copyright &copy 2004 by Ross Gelbspan.

When Gelbspan first encountered the issue as a reporter nine years ago, he writes, he had no inkling of how it would change his life. But as he put together the evidence of the global climate crisis he describes in this book, he found himself pulled inexorably to do more than simply write about it. So he now feels called to a kind of mission: to describe what is happening, to single out the specific failures and misdeeds of politicians, energy companies, environmental activists and journalists who share responsibility for our predicament, and then propose bold solutions that -- unlike more timid blueprints already on the public agenda -- would in his view actually solve the problem.\nFor a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter at the top of his game, this is a career detour requiring courage I greatly admire. Moreover, he candidly describes how, as he opened himself to the implications of what he was learning in his dogged pursuit of this story, he has undergone something of a personal transformation. He writes that it has become ''an excruciating experience to watch the planet fall apart piece by piece in the face of persistent and pathological denial.'' He describes how mountain glaciers around the world are melting, most of them rapidly. And he cites early examples of environmental refugees like those created in recent weeks in Bangladesh, vulnerable to catastrophic flooding as sea levels rise.\nIn the course of this transformation, Gelbspan has become a different kind of reporter, one who recalls the great reforming journalists of the first decade of the 20th century -- Upton Sinclair, Ida Tarbell, Lincoln Steffens and others -- who not only reported on political corruption and corporate excesses but connected them to larger destructive patterns that had developed in the economy and politics of their time. They agitated for policy reforms, many of which were enacted into statutes when they became part of the progressive movement's agenda: antitrust laws, the Food and Drug Administration, railroad regulation, wage and hour laws, workmen's compensation and child labor laws, to name a few.\nIt is in that spirit that Gelbspan pursues solutions for climate change that can ''also begin to reverse some very discouraging and destructive political and economic dynamics as well.''\nPart of what makes this book important is its indictment of the American news media's coverage of global warming for the past two decades. Indeed, when the author investigates why the United States is virtually the only advanced nation in the world that fails to recognize the severity of this growing crisis, he concludes that the news coverage is ''a large reason for that failure.''\nAt a time when prominent journalists are writing mea culpas for allowing themselves to be too easily misled in their coverage of the case for war in Iraq, Gelbspan presents a devastating analysis of how the media have been duped and intimidated by an aggressive and persistent campaign organized and financed by coal and oil companies. He recounts, for example, a conversation with a top television network editor who was reluctant to run stories about global warming because a previous story had ''triggered a barrage of complaints from the Global Climate Coalition'' -- a fossil fuel industry lobbying group -- ''to our top executives at the network.''\nHe also describes the structural changes in the news media, like increased conglomerate ownership, that have made editors and reporters more vulnerable to this kind of intimidation -- and much less aggressive in pursuing inconvenient truths.\nGelbspan's first book, ''The Heat Is On'' (1997), remains the best, and virtually only, study of how the coal and oil industry has provided financing to a small group of contrarian scientists who began to make themselves available for mass media interviews as so-called skeptics on the subject of global warming. In fact, these scientists played a key role in Gelbspan's personal journey on this issue. When he got letters disputing the facts in his very first article, he was at first chastened -- until he realized the letters were merely citing the industry-funded scientists. He accuses this group of ''stealing our reality.''\nIn this new book, Gelbspan focuses his toughest language by far on the coal and oil industries. After documenting the largely successful efforts of companies like ExxonMobil to paralyze the policy process, confuse the American people and cynically '' 'reposition global warming as theory rather than fact,' '' as one strategy paper put it, he concludes that ''what began as a normal business response by the fossil fuel lobby -- denial and delay -- has now attained the status of a crime against humanity.''\nI wouldn't have said it quite that way, but I'm glad he does, and his exposition of the facts certainly seems to support his charge.\nGelbspan also criticizes the current administration, documenting its efforts to ''demolish the diplomatic foundations'' of the international agreement known as the Kyoto Protocol, and describing its approach to energy and environmental policy as ''corruption disguised as conservatism.'' Again, he backs up his charge with impressive research. Moreover, his critique is far from partisan. He takes on environmental groups for doing way too little and for focusing on their own institutional agendas rather than the central challenges.\nWhen Gelbspan addresses the subject of solutions, he first gives a detailed analysis of all the significant plans that have been offered, and then endorses a maximalist approach called the World Energy Modernization Plan, developed six years ago by an ad hoc group that met at the Harvard Medical School. His basic argument is that it is far too late in the game to waste time on strategies that might be more politically feasible but don't actually do enough to begin to solve the problem.\nHe may be right, but the plan's authors, though distinguished, remind me of Sam Rayburn's remark that he'd feel a lot better ''if just one of them had ever run for sheriff.''\nTHE fact is, many who have worked on this problem believe it may be essential to begin with a binding agreement among nations and then, after governments and industries shift direction, toughen the goals. That is the formula used successfully in the Montreal Protocol in 1987 to begin reducing the emissions that cause destruction of stratospheric ozone. Three years later, the standards were dramatically tightened in the London Amendments, and by then most resistance had dissipated.\nThe Kyoto Protocol (which may soon become legally effective if Russia ratifies it, even though the United States has not) has been criticized by many, including Gelbspan, for not going nearly far enough to reduce the emissions that cause global warming. But it has simultaneously been condemned from the opposite side for going too far. If Kyoto does take effect, we may find that after industries and countries begin to comply, it will be easier to expand the limits of what is politically possible.\nBut Gelbspan's point is a powerful one and is well argued.

So it is unsurprising that politicians of both parties ripped into N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, when his annual economic report on Tuesday made precisely the opposite point: that if services like software programming can be done more cheaply in India, it makes sense for companies to procure them there. Outsourcing will ultimately enhance their productivity.\nYet while debate is raging over globalization's costs and benefits, Mr. Mankiw's comments are based on solid, age-old economic arguments. Most economists agree that higher productivity -- whether it comes from trade, outsourcing or technology -- is good, even when it creates pain for many workers.\n''Outsourcing does not reduce the total number of jobs in America,'' said Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. ''If other countries can do something cheaper we ought to let them do it, and concentrate on what we can do best.''\nIndeed, despite the hemorrhage of jobs since Mr. Bush took office, the past performance of the American economy -- particularly the pattern of job creation and destruction over the past several years -- supports Mr. Mankiw's case.\nIn many ways, the economists' argument for outsourcing is as straightforward as the case for importing products. If an Indian software programmer is paid a tenth of an American's salary, a company that develops software in India will save money and -- provided competitors do the same -- the price of its software will fall, productivity will rise, the technology will spread, and new jobs will be created to adapt and improve it.\nTake cellphones, which 20 years ago were luxury items with the size and weight of a brick. Today -- thanks to competition and inexpensive, globalized production -- they are cheap, ubiquitous, tiny and packed with a mind-boggling complement of ancillary functions. The industry and the number of jobs have only increased. Global outsourcing also played a big role in the information technology boom of the late 1990's. Personal computers were imported from abroad. Chip companies shipped production overseas. But this outsourcing prompted the creation of new jobs here, on the higher end of the technological spectrum.\nA report released last December by Catherine L. Mann of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research group that backs free trade, calculated that lower costs due to globalized production accounted for 10 percent to 30 percent of the decline in hardware prices during the technology boom of the second half of the 1990's, when computer prices fell 10 percent a year.\nThe impact of cheap hardware was felt throughout the economy. Ms. Mann calculates that outsourcing boosted productivity growth from 2.5 percent to 2.8 percent a year from 1995 to 2002, a gain that in turn added at least $230 billion to the country's total output of goods and services.\nAs lower-priced technology flooded the marketplace, it helped generate new jobs, as companies that snapped up computers suddenly required software and workers who could adapt the products to their needs.\nMs. Mann notes that demand for people who knew how to use computers grew by 22 percent through the 1990's boom, twice as fast as overall job creation. ''This is despite the fact that outsourcing of computer jobs was going on,'' Ms. Mann said.\nMoreover, lower prices also muted inflation, allowing interest rates to be lower than they otherwise would be -- thus boosting investment and growth. And the Asian countries that made computers and chips spent some earnings buying other American services -- like legal and financial assistance.\nOver all, Ms. Mann notes, ''unemployment in the 1990's fell to 4 percent,'' despite aggressive outsourcing during this period.\nBut for many unions, investment in foreign lands is undisputedly bad. ''For every investment you make there is investment you don't make here,'' says Bob Baugh, executive director of the Industrial Union Council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , which has suffered a relentless decline in manufacturing jobs since the late 1990's. ''People are concerned about their own job. They know it's a problem and they are absolutely stunned by the admission of this administration.''\nFears of outsourcing have heightened even further, because it is no longer just manufacturing jobs that are threatened, but high-paying, white-collar service-sector jobs. Moreover, the worldwide pool of available well-trained workers is much larger, and they are only a mouse-click away.\nThe Internet and other technologies have enabled Dell, the personal computer manufacturer, to open customer support centers in India, and allowed Delta Airlines to send reservations jobs to the Philippines. The trend seems to be moving up the skills ladder: Oracle, a software company, and Ericsson, the telecommunications equipment manufacturer, have moved product and software development jobs to India. An often-cited report by Forrester Research says 3.3 million American white-collar service industry jobs will move overseas by 2015. People are afraid that they will be left with low-paying jobs at Wal-Mart.\nYet most economists agree that the impact on productivity, economic growth and jobs should be similar to that of the outsourcing of hardware in the late 1990's. Prices of technology services will fall, technology will become more pervasive, and jobs will be created as businesses find new things to do with the technology.\n''We tend to keep the high end of the value chain,'' said Janet Yellen, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley who was head of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. ''We're outsourcing the more standardized part of high tech.''\nIndeed, employment in the service sector -- including those services considered most at risk of being outsourced to developing nations -- has not done too badly compared with the rest of the job market.\nThe United States has lost many jobs of late. But that's basically because the economy fell into recession. From 1999 to 2003, as the economy peaked and went bust, 1.3 million nonfarm jobs vanished. Manufacturing lost 2.8 million jobs; 800,000 management positions disappeared -- including C.E.O.'s and other executive jobs that are not easily outsourced to Bangladesh.\nBut business and financial service occupations -- at risk of the kind of outsourcing that Forrester Research warns of -- added more than 600,000 jobs during the period. Another sector that is supposed to be vulnerable, what the Commerce Department calls computer and mathematical occupations, added 150,000 jobs. Moreover, many jobs that are outsourced today -- like call-center operators or data-entry staff -- could just as easily be lost to automation.\n''Productivity growth, however it occurs, has a disruptive side to it,'' Ms. Yellen said. ''In the short term most things that contribute to productivity growth are very painful.'' Fast productivity growth is one reason that employment hasn't picked up despite fast economic growth.\nWhat to do? Labor unions would support legislation that slowed globalization down. Others, like Mr. Reich, want more comprehensive employment insurance. Ms. Yellen supports better education and job training. But ending sources of productivity growth, she said, is not a good idea. ''You could end up with an economy that does not show progress and doesn't improve living standards,'' she said."}, {"text": "ART; Burtynsky's Account: Adding Up the Price That Nature Pays\n2004-01-04T05:00:00.000Z\nEDWARD BURTYNSKY views the world through a large-format camera and finds beauty in highly improbable places. For nearly 20 years his subject has been the ravages of heavy industry, seen at a scale so vast as to be unimaginable.\nMr. Burtynsky's oeuvre, a detached, ominous yet eerily seductive examination of industrial incursions on the natural landscape, is global in reach. Since the mid-1980's he has photographed rail lines in British Columbia (''Rail Cuts,'' 1985), marble quarries in Vermont (''Rock of Ages,'' 1991), nickel mines in Northern Ontario (''Nickel Tailings,'' 1996) and the Chittagong Delta in Bangladesh, where he extracted gorgeous formal compositions from a coast strewn with the seeping husks of dilapidated oil freighters (''Shipbreaking,'' 2000).\nHis 2003 series on the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in Hubei, China, the largest hydroelectric project in history, is no less unsettling. Vast rubble fields, created as the residents of the Yangtze River valley dismantled their homes by hand to make way for the coming flood, are at once splendid and disturbing, given the displacement and environmental ruin they represent. Those images, printed as large as 4 by 6 feet, went on view at the Charles Cowles Gallery in Chelsea on Friday.\nNow, as 2004 begins, Mr. Burtynsky, 48, has decided to step back. ''I'm taking this year off, in a way, without having a monolithic idea of what I want to do,'' he said recently over coffee in a restaurant near his West End Toronto studio. ''I'm allowing the year to be very splintered, where I'm just letting myself touch on different things that have piqued my interest. There are just a lot of things that I want to go look at.''\nMr. Burtynsky's photography is widely collected by major institutions in North America and Europe. The National Gallery of Canada is touring a major retrospective of his work, which will land at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 2005. But he's taking stock now, thinking about the meaning of the photographs he has done so far and where he will go from here.\nHe has no plans to abandon his trademark look: finding and freezing conflicting ideas within each image. ''I'm trying to invest an image with a dialogue that allows you to enter it and makes you think different things about it,'' he said. ''One day you might like it for its aesthetic value, and the next day you might abhor it for what it represents.''\nLori Pauli, the curator at the National Gallery of Canada who designed Mr. Burtynsky's retrospective, said that his calculated ambiguity helps shift the images from documentary -- which they are since they are neither staged nor digitally manipulated -- into the realm of conceptual art.\nMr. Burtynsky will continue to work with this technique, but with closer attention to an underlying theme that binds all of his blasted landscapes: oil.\n''One of the threads I saw in all the things I did, anything I photographed, was that this was all possible as a result of cheap fuel,'' he said. ''Yes, we have the technologies and machinery, and the industrial age taught us how to build efficient machines, but fuel was the energy source, and that affected the scale at which we were able to transform that landscape.''\nMr. Burtynsky has explored the notion of oil before, making images of oil refineries with their burnished steel piping, and of the vast fields of derricks, hundreds upon hundreds of them bobbing endlessly as they siphon the crude from deep below the earth's surface.\nWhat that activity has spawned is part of Mr. Burtynsky's perennial quest. All over North America, complex systems of highways cluster in urban centers and ramble off in every direction, their tendrils spreading across every kind of landscape. In his most recent and as yet unpublished work, Mr. Burtynsky has taken his camera on the road to reveal their dominance.\n''I'm looking at where the largest concentration of roads are and photographing them using aerial cameras,'' he said. ''A highway is a massive transformation and one that truly changes that landscape forever. But what it also changes is our relationship to the landscape, how we view it, and what it represents.''\nThe images capture the snaking arteries of concrete and blacktop at a scale rarely seen, a perspective both magnificent and chilling, which is, of course, classic Burtynsky. The project, which he describes as a work in progress (''Not all of these will succeed as images I'll go public with,'' he said), contains echoes of past work.\nAs long ago as 1985 Mr. Burtynsky was taking large-scale photographs of rail cuts, train lines carved into mountainsides for extracting forest products. His technique was apparent even then. A monolithic mountain face is conquered by a tiny string of rail cars making their way across the cut. Captured from a distance and rendered toylike in the image, the suggestion is of a virus: tiny but potent and guaranteed to proliferate.\nOther works, including ''Shipbreaking,'' also contain a whiff of oil-as-enabler, since the broken hulls once carried crude around the world, and the ships, when operating, presumably used oil as their own fuel. New images, relating to the highway project, include large tableaus of transport trucks, which, using fossil-based fuel, carry the vast majority of our consumer goods around the continent on the highways that the oil industry has made possible. These are the facilitators, ever present but rarely considered. Mr. Burtynsky offers the reminder that our amenities don't appear by magic. There is a cost paid by nature.\n''I wanted to talk about that infrastructure,'' he said, ''that thing that happens when we fill up our tank, or when we go to a wall and turn a switch on. We don't really fully appreciate or understand the whole process of how that got to us, or what is occurring to make that happen.''\nAll Mr. Burtynsky's work is consistent in tone. Neither heroic nor condemning, it offers an austere beauty and a simple critical pause, which gives the viewer an opportunity to gaze at the scale of the transformation that has taken place in a short time.\n''Most of my work is no more than looking in a mirror and wondering about what life on this planet is like right now,'' Mr. Burtynsky said. ''Even though the things I've seen, quite often, are tragic, it is who we are. Politicizing the tragedy I think limits the discussion. I place it in the middle, because if I associate it with a statement saying, 'This is wrong,' then it allows the viewer two choices: either you agree or you don't.''\nMr. Burtynsky's own perspective is equally ambiguous. ''I'm embodying a lot of those things,'' he said. ''I feel like I'm living in contradiction with myself. But I don't know any other alternative to how I live.\n''It's a dilemma of our times, in that there's no easy prescription for our ailment. But it is an important time for us to look at it, to gaze at it and understand what we're doing. And I feel that if my work is striving toward something, it's looking at the world straight on, in a way that won't let us immediately turn our eyes away.''"}, {"text": "An Icy Riddle as Big as Greenland\n2004-06-08T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nThis vaulting heap of ice and the swirling seas nearby have emerged as vital pieces of an urgent puzzle posed by global warming. Can the continuing slow increase in worldwide temperatures touch off abrupt climate upheavals?\nEach piece of the puzzle is a dynamic and complicated body of water. One, the North Atlantic, is some two miles deep and liquid. The other, this ice cap, is two miles high and solid. For scale, think of it as a freshwater Gulf of Mexico that has been frozen, inverted and plunked atop the world's largest island.\nExperts have reported a series of observations in recent months that show that the ice and the waters here are in a state of profound flux. If the trends persist, they could mean higher sea levels and widespread coastal flooding. There is also a small chance that the changes could lead to a sharp cooling in parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\nAlthough nobody expects shifts as rapid or cataclysmic as portrayed in the new movie ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' the cooling could disrupt the relatively stable climatic conditions in which modern human societies have evolved.\nIn the last few years, Greenland's melt zone, where summer warmth turns snow on the edge of the ice cap into slush and ponds of water, has expanded inland, reaching elevations more than a mile high in some places, said Dr. Konrad Steffen, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado.\nRecent measurements by NASA scientists show that such melting can have outsize effects on the ice sheet. Meltwater formed on the surface each summer percolates thousands of feet down through fissures, allowing the ice to slide more easily over the bedrock below and accelerating its slow march to the sea.\nSome jutting tongues of floating ice, where riverlike glaciers protrude into the sea, are rapidly thinning. Measurements this year by Dr. Steffen and others on the Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland show that more than 150 feet of thickness melted away under that tongue in the last year. Such melting can speed the seaward movement of ice in the same way that removing a doorstop lets a door swing freely.\nAs Dr. Steffen settled in with three colleagues for weeks of grueling research at this half-buried wind-tattered camp 4,000 feet up the flanks of the ice cap, he described how other Greenland glaciers were speeding their discharge of icebergs into the sea.\n''If other ice streams start to react in a similar way,'' he said, ''then we will actually produce much more fresh water.''\nThis influx of fresh water could block North Atlantic currents that help moderate the weather of the Northern Hemisphere. ''If that feedback kicks in,'' he said, ''then the average person will worry.''\nSome oceanographers say global warming may already be pushing the North Atlantic toward instability. In less than 50 years, waters deep in the North Atlantic and Arctic have become significantly fresher, matched by growing saltiness in the tropical Atlantic. Worldwide, seas have absorbed enormous amounts of heat from the warming atmosphere. A big outflow of water from Greenland could take the system to a tipping point, some say.\nIn past millenniums when such oceanic breakdowns occurred, the climate across much of the Northern Hemisphere jumped to a starkly different state, with deep chills and abrupt shifts in patterns of precipitation and drought from Europe to Venezuela. Some changes persisted for centuries.\nBut whether something similar is likely to result from the new melting in Greenland is far from clear. The forces that caused abrupt climate change in the past, like monumental floods released from collapsing ice-age glaciers, are different from the much slower ones being measured today.\nGaps in understanding are enormous. Scientists have been unable to devise computer simulations that consistently replicate past jolts to the climate, leaving intellectual heartburn about the future.\n''The models are not nearly as sensitive as the real world,'' Dr. Richard B. Alley, an expert at Penn State on Greenland's climate history, said. ''That's the kind of thing that makes you nervous.''\nTo solve the riddles, Greenland is being measured and monitored as never before, by satellites, by aircraft and by dozens of down-swaddled scientists who are braving 30-below-zero temperatures and deadly snow-cloaked crevasses that corrugate the slumping edges of the ice cap. The oceans around the ice sheet, which is four times the size of California, are peppered with instrument-laden buoys and plumbed with deep-diving robotic gliders.\nThe records obtained so far are so limited that no one can yet say whether the observed changes are a dangerous trend or a result of fluctuations in the naturally turbulent seas and atmosphere. Still, many experts who work on abrupt climate changes display a common concern about the relentless buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. While the human contribution to change here remains unknown, many scientists say the potential risks are all too evident.\n''It's as if we're running a gigantic uncontrolled experiment on the climate system and we know we have the capability of making large impacts,'' said Robert Hawley, a glaciologist from the University of Washington stationed at the Summit Camp, a permanent dome-topped installation at the highest point of the ice sheet. ''Should we continue just to experiment or should we try to figure this out first?''\nThe greatest concern is that the changes are part of an Arctic-wide pattern that includes a pronounced thawing of the Alaskan tundra and a retreat of the sea ice around the North Pole, at least in summer. Greenland's temperatures had for years bucked the Arctic warming trend. But they now seem to be increasing, according to new satellite data analyzed by Dr. Josefino C. Comiso at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.\nThe intimate relationship between Greenland and its surrounding seas was evident to 19 scientists, aides and other passengers on a recent flight from upstate New York aboard an Air National Guard LC-130 cargo plane. As the plane droned across the Labrador Sea separating North America from the white-topped island, the water below was laced with cordons of icebergs heading south from the ever-eroding edge of the ice cap, following the course taken in 1912 by the berg that sank the Titanic.\nJust as Greenland contributes meltwater and melting icebergs to the sea, the northward-flowing surface currents of the Atlantic transport heat from the tropics to the Arctic and adjacent regions. As this heat is shed to the air, it renders Greenland's coasts relatively mild and helps make northern Europe warm enough that roses can be grown at latitudes that elsewhere support polar bears. As the water chills, it grows denser and sinks. The downward flow is the engine that powers a world-spanning oceanic ''conveyor belt'' through which seawater is eventually mixed and recycled.\nSeveral times in the past, even early in the current 12,000-year warm spell in which modern civilizations arose, that conveyor belt has shut down. When it stopped, it stopped quickly, as if a circuit breaker had been tripped. In each case, according to recent research on layers of sea-bottom fossils and sediments, the trigger was a big inflow of fresh water into those vital spots where the surface water sinks.\nWaters in the region are not only freshening, but a buildup of fresher water is diminishing the bank of saltier, denser water that sustains the deep southward-flowing circulation in the Atlantic, said Dr. Ruth Curry, an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution at Cape Cod, Mass.\nIn December, Dr. Curry, with British and Canadian researchers, reported the 40-year trend toward a freshening of the North Atlantic and growing saltiness in the tropics. She said that the Atlantic was being pushed toward ''a precipice'' that could be reached in three or four decades and that a Greenland meltdown could push it over the edge.\nMany scientists disagree, saying even a significant melting is not likely to produce big shifts, at least in this century.\nDr. Peter Wadhams, an ocean physicist at Cambridge University, said a host of different mechanisms would keep the conveyor moving, even if the freshening persists. One is the formation of sea ice, which releases the salt in seawater as it forms, making underlying waters saltier and, thus, denser. Plumes of this briny water ''sink like syrup falling off a spoon,'' Dr. Wadhams said.\nOne possibility, some scientists say, is that the system could be self-regulating, with the shutdown of warm currents, in turn, cooling Greenland and stopping the melting. Another wild card, some computer models show, is that further warming will increase snowfall and add as much frozen water to Greenland as is lost through melting or the splitting off of icebergs. Other models suggest that the ice shield could shrivel entirely in 1,000 years, a phenomenon that scientists theorize has not occurred for 440,000 years.\nOn Greenland, efforts are under way to resolve the big uncertainties. Dr. Joseph R. McConnell, a snow hydrologist from the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nev., is examining whether forces other than global warming could be responsible for changes here. Under a NASA grant, he recently completed a three-week 250-mile snowmobile crossing of the ice sheet, extracting four shaftlike ice cores en route. The cores have hundreds of layers, like tree rings, made by each year's snowfall. They will be analyzed for shifts in dust types or subtle chemical markers that could show whether winds were blowing from Europe or North America in particular years. The study may show if recent changes in snowfall and melting match natural cycles in North Atlantic weather.\nAfter flying down from the summit to a coastal airfield following his snowmobile trek in May, Dr. McConnell took a break and hiked over undulating tundra to the clifflike edge of the ice. The spring warmth was eating away at the vaulting blue-white ramparts streaked with gray layers deposited by volcanoes and dust storms eons years ago. A torrent of silty meltwater poured along the bluff of ice, heading toward the Labrador Sea, 115 miles west.\nHe marveled at how much ancient water was stored in front of him.\n''If Greenland melted,'' he said, ''it'd raise sea levels by 20 feet. There goes Florida. There goes most of the Mississippi embayment. There go the islands in the South Pacific. Bangladesh is obliterated. Manhattan would have to put up dikes.''\nAlthough much work is needed to solve the puzzle, he added, the hints of big changes are building. ''There's definitely a lot of melting going on,'' Dr. McConnell said, flinching as a crack echoed from the warming white cliff and a giant ice slab shifted ever so slightly.\nCorrection: June 16, 2004, Wednesday A chart in Science Times on June 8 with an article about widespread climate changes that may be resulting from warmer weather in Greenland misstated the density of water in the North Atlantic, which is growing less salty as glaciers melt. The density ranges from 1,027 kilograms per cubic meter for the freshest water to more than 1,028 for the saltiest -- not from 27 kilograms to more than 28."}, {"text": "Filmmakers Examining the 'What Ifs' of Nuclear Power\n2004-09-08T05:00:00.000Z\nCesium-137 is not your usual topic for a Midtown Manhattan lunch. But if you sit down with Maryann De Leo and Rory Kennedy, who have completed documentaries on the effects on children of the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 (Ms. De Leo) and the Indian Point power plant in Buchanan, N.Y. (Ms. Kennedy), it is not long before the subject comes up. (Cesium-137 is radioactive waste, an isotope produced when uranium or plutonium undergoes fission.)\nThe women, who had not met before, quickly dispensed with the social niceties. Ms. Kennedy complimented Ms. De Leo on her film, which she said she found heartbreaking, then took 15 seconds to show a photo of her second daughter, born six weeks earlier. Ms. De Leo invited Ms. Kennedy to a reception her brother Dominic was organizing in honor of the films, which will be broadcast back-to-back by HBO tomorrow night.\nMs. De Leo said she too had proposed films to HBO about Indian Point and AIDS, a subject Ms. Kennedy tackled with \"Pandemic: Facing AIDS,\" a five-part series for HBO last year. But Ms. Kennedy, being a Kennedy -- she is Robert F. Kennedy's youngest daughter, born after his death -- was able to secure outside funds more readily.\nMenus in hand, the women quickly and nearly simultaneously dismissed tuna as a possible choice: \"Mercury, \" they said.\nMs. De Leo's film \"Chernobyl Heart,\" which won the 2003 Academy Award for best documentary short, is not easy to talk about or watch. It takes the viewer into children's hospitals in Belarus and Ukraine and into the 30-kilometer exclusion zone around the reactor. According to the United Nations, birth defects in Belarus have increased 250 percent since the accident, and the lives of the children in the film are tragic.\nOne girl, Julia, was born with her brain outside her skull; another child, 4, is the size of a 4-month-old.\n\"I had to show enough of the kids with deformities, but if I showed too many, nobody would want to watch,\" Ms. De Leo said.\nMs. Kennedy's \"Indian Point: Imagining the Unimaginable\" takes a less emotional approach. It features interviews with the plant's detractors (including her brother Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chief prosecutor for Riverkeeper, an environmental- protection group) and a few defenders. Ms. Kennedy, who narrates the film, begins with questions: what if American Airlines Flight 11, navigating along the Hudson valley on Sept. 11, had banked left and hit Indian Point, rather than continuing south to the World Trade Center? Is enough being done to protect Americans from terrorists at home?\nBoth women offered a quick and categorical no when asked if they considered their films anti-nuclear power.\n\"I don't believe in making didactic films,\" said Ms. De Leo, born in Brooklyn, one of six children of a sanitation worker. Her television documentary work has taken her to Vietnam, El Salvador, Cuba, Afghanistan, Angola, Korea and Iraq.\nThe idea for \"Chernobyl Heart\" was planted when a friend visiting from Spain suggested that Ms. De Leo see a United Nations photography exhibition about the children of Chernobyl. \"It was the most shocking thing he'd ever seen,\" she said. \"I had really forgotten about Chernobyl. I hadn't thought about birth defects there, and at the time I was working on a film about Bellevue,\" the Manhattan hospital.\nBut in 2002 Ms. De Leo went to Belarus. She would return two more times, at one point requiring treatment for cesium poisoning herself.\n\"Indian Point has much more cesium than Chernobyl had,\" Ms. Kennedy interjected. \"Being in New York City on 9/11, and in the aftermath, there was a lot of concern about where the next terrorist attack would be -- Indian Point, bridges and tunnels, waterways, chemical plants. There was a disproportionate amount of fear, some of it grounded, some not. I went into this project with the question, is Indian Point something we need to fear?\"\nMs. De Leo asked her about Indian Point's safety record (\"horrible,\" Ms. Kennedy said); both agreed on the impossibility of evacuating millions in the event of an accident. Ms. Kennedy talked about the inability of guards to protect the plant adequately because of the stress and long hours detailed in the film. Located on the Hudson, the \"exterior is screaming 'hit me,\"' she said. \"It's extremely vulnerable by water.\"\nIn the film Mr. Kennedy contends that the pools of water holding spent fuel rods, which contain more than 1,400 tons of spent nuclear fuel, are most vulnerable. His claims are followed by an interview with a scientist from the Union of Concerned Scientists, who details a potential terrorist attack, beginning with an explosive charge interfering with the rods' coolants and ending with the release of cesium-137 into the air.\nIn the film such criticisms are countered by representatives of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a federal agency, and the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association, who describe the robust structures housing the reactors, the stepped-up security after 9/11 and the extreme unlikelihood of an attack of the magnitude Ms. Kennedy suggests.\nJim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the two plants at Indian Point, is not interviewed in the film but defended the business in a phone interview. \"There has never been an event at Indian Point causing dangerous releases of radioactivity,\" he said. \"The plants are heavily regulated by the N.R.C.\" Since 9/11, he added, the commission has limited the number of hours a guard is allowed to work, and Entergy \"has spent well over $30 million on enhancing security at Indian Point.\"\nThose outside the industry also propose nuclear energy as a viable power source, given the environmental hazards of burning fossil fuels and the political ramifications of relying on Middle East oil. A recent interdisciplinary study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that \"the nuclear option should be retained precisely because it is an important carbon-free source of power.\"\nSpencer R. Weart, a historian at the American Institute of Physics and author of \"Nuclear Fear: A History of Images\" (Harvard University Press, 1988) offers a context for examining the nuclear option -- and, perhaps, for watching these films.\n\"All industrial systems are liable to accidents, and we have to ask ourselves, where is the most likely damage over the long term?\" he said in a telephone interview. \"Every energy source has its problems. Bangladesh has been in the news because of the terrible flooding there. This is what will happen increasingly with global warming. The longtime consequences of burning fossil fuels are more severe than nuclear power. Let's say I'm less a proponent of nuclear power than an opponent of coal and oil.\"\nListening to such arguments, Ms. Kennedy nodded and said, \"I would have said that before I made this film.\"\nScientists also have strong views about the fairness of comparing the Chernobyl disaster to what could happen in this country \"Chernobyl was a terrible tragedy,\" Robert A. Bari, a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., said in a phone conversation. \"It happened because they operated the reactor out of its specifications. And Indian Point has a very, very different design than the Chernobyl reactor.\"\nFor Ms. Kennedy and Ms. De Leo, who are passionate about their subjects, such arguments have little resonance. Ms. De Leo recalled a warning a Russian scientist made to Americans, imploring them to shut down nuclear plants.\nMs. Kennedy said, \"You can't throw numbers and statistics at children born with brains outside their heads.\" Such debates would not be resolved at a two-and-a-half-hour lunch.

Fathers and mothers wailed over drowned children. Bodies were arrayed in long rows in hastily dug trenches. Villagers sat by ruined homes, stunned. Hotels in some of Thailand's most luxurious resorts were turned into morgues.\n\"This may be the worst natural disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas,\" said Jan Egeland, the emergency relief coordinator for the United Nations, speaking at a news conference in New York.\n\"Usually a natural disaster strikes one or two or three countries, not eight or nine enormous coastlines like they've done here,\" he added. \"Bigger waves have been recorded. But no wave has affected so many people.\" Nearly half the reported deaths were here in Sri Lanka, where estimates jumped Monday to more than 12,000 killed, and where more than a million people were reported to have lost their homes.\nThe realization began to emerge Tuesday that the dead included an exceptionally high number of children who, aid officials suggested, were least able to grab onto trees or boats when the deadly waves smashed through villages and over beaches. Children make up at least half the population of Asia.\nOn the western tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, the destruction was doubly fierce, caused by both the earthquake itself 150 miles away and the tsunamis that followed. The Associated Press reported from the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, that bloated bodies filled the streets and thousands of survivors huddled without shelter. The American Consulate in nearby Medan has received reports that waters around Banda Aceh reached as far as 10 miles inland. The floodwaters reportedly inundated one city hospital, drowning patients inside.\nSome 5,000 people are confirmed dead but that number is expected at least to double. Indonesia's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, said he attended a mass burial of 1,500. The area has been closed to journalists and aid workers because of a civil war, and only a few local journalists have gotten in.\nMr. Egeland said, \"We haven't a clue\" as to the number affected in Aceh. He said it had been impossible to reach contacts there, which he called \"a bad sign.\"\nIndia reported more than 4,000 dead on the mainland. Hundreds were dead or missing in the southern resort islands of Thailand, many of them foreign vacationers.\nMr. Egeland said the big problem now was to coordinate the huge international aid effort, a particularly daunting challenge given how widespread the devastation is. He said the total damage would \"probably be many billions of dollars.\"\n\"We cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages and so on that have just been wiped out,\" he said. \"Hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone.\"\nAmateur videotape played on television showed terrifying scenes from several countries of huge walls of water crashing through palm trees and over the tops of buildings and roaring up coastal streets with cars and debris bobbing on the surface.\nTo backdrops of screams and shouts, people were shown clinging to buildings, being swept away by the current, running for their lives, weeping, carrying the injured and cradling dead children.\nAs the water receded, almost as quickly as it had arrived, bodies were seen in the branches of trees, and broken cars and houses littered the shores as if a tornado had struck. Some of the bodies and debris were sucked back out to sea.\nThere were fears of thousands more deaths on India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where most communications have been cut off.\n\"In Andamans and Nicobar Islands, the death toll is over 3,000,\" said Rana Mathew, a government spokesman. \"The southern islands are the most affected. No contact with the island of Nancoveri been established as yet. So the death toll might go up. And thousands of people are missing.\"\nSmaller numbers of deaths were reported in Malaysia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Bangladesh and the Seychelles, as well as along the distant African coastline, particularly Somalia, where entire villages were reported to have disappeared.\n\"All of the fishermen who went to sea haven't come back,\" said Yusuf Ismail, a spokesman for the president.\nIn Thailand, the government said 918 people had died, 7,396 were injured and thousands were missing, mostly on small resort islands or among boatloads of recreational divers who had headed out to sea in the morning before the wave struck.\n\"I would say the death toll would definitely exceed 1,000,\" Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said after visiting Phuket Island, the most prominent of Thailand's beach resorts, where the death toll stood at 130. \"We have a long way to go in collecting bodies.\"\nMany of those killed there were foreigners, but the most prominent of the dead was Poom Jensen, 21, the Thai-American grandson of King Bhumipol Adulyadej.\nThe smaller island of Phi Phi Lei, which was the scene of the movie \"The Beach,\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was reported to have been mostly leveled. On another small island, the proprietors of the elite Phra Thong Resort said only 70 of 170 guests were accounted for.\nApart from the huge death toll, it was the presence of large number of foreign tourists that distinguished this disaster from the many floods and typhoons that take a heavy toll in the region every year.\nIn Sri Lanka, the government said as many as 200 foreign tourists had been killed. In Thailand, an official estimated that 20 to 30 percent of those killed had been foreigners. The victims were reported to include people from Germany, Japan, Italy, Sweden, France, Britain, the United States, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Holland, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, Spain and Russia. The number of Americans dead stood at eight, including a well-known fashion photographer, Fernando Bengoechea.\nThose numbers were tiny, though, compared with the devastation suffered by the mostly poor fishermen, farmers and laborers who populate the low-lying coasts of these South Asian and Southeast Asian nations.\nIn Sri Lanka, Susil Premajayantha, a senior minister, said the homes of about 1.5 million people had been destroyed or damaged. Few have the resources to resume their lives without help.\nHe said 890 miles of railway track running south from the capital, Colombo, had been washed away. Local officials told The Associated Press that some 1,500 passengers had been trapped in railroad cars as an entire train was caught in the rushing tide and swept away.\nAt least 400 prisoners were reported to have escaped during the chaos from two jails in the southern area, and officials offered them an amnesty to turn themselves in. Across the region, police officers and soldiers patrolled in an effort to halt looting.\nThe United States Geological Survey said the 9.0 magnitude earthquake on Sunday morning was the fourth-largest in a century and the largest in the world since 1964, when an earthquake measuring 9.2 hit Alaska. A number of strong aftershocks have followed.\n\"We have ordered 15,000 troops into the field to search for survivors,\" said Edy Sulistiadi, a spokesman for the Indonesian military, which is fighting separatist rebels in the area. \"They are mostly retrieving corpses.\"\nASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: THE OVERVIEW Correction: December 29, 2004, Wednesday Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the rising death toll from sea waves after the earthquake in Asia on Sunday misstated the known fate of an American photographer, Fernando Bengoechea, and his specialty. Known for interior design photography rather than fashion, he has been listed as missing, not dead."}, {"text": "FOOD STUFF; From Far Away and Long Ago, Sea Salts With a Special Touch\n2004-09-01T05:00:00.000Z\nMost of the natural sea salts introduced in the last few years have about the same effect on your food. But texture is a factor and can influence the amount you use. The latest exotic salts are from Asia: Bali, Bangladesh and the Himalayas, from ancient marine deposits left in the foothills.\nTwo years ago, Ben and Blair Ripple, American entrepreneurs, started Big Tree Farms, a cottage industry in Bali that employs local families to extract sea salt, above, from the black sand beaches. The coarsest of the grains are actually hollow and shaped like pyramids; they have an almost sweet finish. These salts are sold at Dean & DeLuca in 5-ounce boxes for $6.50 and in 10-ounce coconut shells for $14. Kalustyan's has Bay of Bengal sea salt, which is coarse, rustically uneven and a bargain at $8 a pound.

After scrambling, she was lucky to land a job as manager and waitress at the Towel City Junction Cafe, earning $3 an hour plus tips, a fraction of her factory wages.\nFor many years, textile and clothing factories in the mill towns of the Carolinas -- originally drawn from New York and New England decades ago by the prospect of inexpensive nonunion workers -- have been closing one after another as the industry migrated abroad in search of ever-cheaper labor. Now, this gradual loss may be about to turn into a rout.\nOn Jan. 1, the global system of country-by-country quotas regulating the $495 billion international trade in textiles and apparel is scheduled to be eliminated. That will transform the vast business in ways that were barely glimpsed a decade ago, when the newly created World Trade Organization went along with the demands of developing countries and agreed to phase out the quotas imposed by advanced nations to protect their own industries.\nToday, though, poor countries at the bottom of the economic ladder, like Cambodia and Bangladesh, have a new fear: China. It is the colossus in the field, home to a seemingly endless supply of workers available to feed vast numbers of suppliers operating with high efficiency and low costs in ways that threaten to overwhelm competition from developing countries except India, Pakistan and Brazil.\nFor China and other big developing nations with expanding apparel industries, the end of the quotas will mean tens of millions of new factory jobs for people without work or barely scraping out a living.\nBut for dozens of even poorer Asian and African countries now relying on their clothing exports to gain a foothold in the global economy, it could be still another bitter pill to swallow. The quotas they fought so hard to eliminate had ensured that their products would have at least a narrow opening in American and European markets.\nWithout rules, though, restricting how much fabric or how many garments they can buy from any country, name brands and merchants like Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, J.C. Penney and the Gap will purchase most of what they want from five or six countries, not the 50-plus countries that are now part of their networks.\nMeanwhile, here in the slowly beating heart of the remaining American textile industry, workers and owners of factories still operating along a stretch of Interstate 85 from Charlotte to Greensboro see the dawning of 2005 as a death sentence. More companies, they fear, will go bankrupt. More communities will wither like Kannapolis, and thousands more workers will be desperate for training, employment and health insurance.\nIn hopes of staving off the worst, politicians in the Southeast from both parties are taking advantage of the close outlook for the presidential election to win last-minute concessions from the White House that could slow the flood of imports from China.\nAnd, seriously weakened as it is, the American textile and apparel industry is still flexing its political muscles. [On Oct. 29, days before the election, the Bush administration accepted the industry's petition seeking relief, promising to consider special steps to limit Chinese exports.]\nMost experts expect that China, left unimpeded, will gain almost half the global apparel market. Its factories now make about 20 percent of the clothing and textiles sold in the United States; China is expected to capture as much as 70 percent of that market, potentially leading to the closing of half the surviving American mills and layoffs for tens of thousands more workers.\nFashion executives say that those fears are exaggerated and that American manufacturers have already weathered the worst.\n\"Yes, China will benefit because of the quality of its goods,\" said Robert J. Zane, senior vice president for sourcing, manufacturing, logistics and distribution at Liz Claiborne in New York. \"But it will be more at the expense of other Asian countries than at the expense of the American industry.\"\nAnd lost in the swirl of anxiety are the benefits that the change will bring to tens of millions of consumers. Americans alone are expected to save an estimated $6 billion in lower-cost goods once the quotas are gone, allowing clothing makers and designers from New York to Milan the freedom to choose factories based on cost and quality rather than a complicated system of 1,300 categories for every nation.\nBut that is little consolation to this Carolina community of 36,000, which was reduced to an economic ghost town in little more than a year once Pillowtex, Ms. Harrington's former employer, fell into bankruptcy. The residents have remained, but the factories are being dismantled and the stores and shops shuttered on Main Street after this one-industry town lost its industry.\n\"I think the middle class is pretty much gone here,\" Ms. Harrington said as she cleared tables in the classic cafe of black-and-white-tile floor and red leather booths. \"In one year our receipts in the cafe have been cut in half. People are starting to lose their unemployment benefits, and then there will be nothing left.\"\nShe had to compete for a job against more than 4,000 other workers who lost work when the mills that once made Cannon towels and sheets closed in July 2003.\nWhile American consumers' household budgets will benefit from lower prices for blouses and pillowcases, the shock to the affected workers and communities will be immediate and gut-wrenching.\n\"The end of the textile quotas will act like the tipping point on trade,\" said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International in New York. \"If we want to continue to enjoy public support toward moving toward more open trade, we have to do a lot more to help people dislocated by trade.\"\nDislocation is an understatement for what has happened to the people in this town.\n\"For generations, everyone worked in textiles -- your mama or your daddy or your granddaddy,\" said Audrey Beaver, whose mother worked at the old Cannon mills until the bitter end.\nKannapolis grew up around the mills built in 1906 by James William Cannon. Identical row houses line the streets radiating from the empty factories that once employed 20,000. The cold smokestacks still rise above the town, but teams of machines and men in hard hats are tearing down the mills, with the machinery, scrap wood and metal being sold to the highest bidders.\nDespite the grim employment picture, families have refused to move away from aging parents or new grandchildren. So fathers and mothers are searching for jobs in Charlotte and Greensboro, growing white-collar cities with service industries, and accepting long commuting times.\nThe United States, unlike other wealthy nations, provides little support for companies and workers who lose out in the global marketplace. Current trade adjustment assistance, largely aimed at training workers for new jobs, was denounced by factory owners and union officials in this region as too little and too difficult.\n\"The high-tech jobs never came to our town,\" said Delores Gambrell, 52, who is a former union organizer at the mill, \"and the only good jobs are going to young people under 45 years of age. We've had to refinance our home. We're penny-pinching as much as we can, and I still don't know if we'll make it.\"\nHer family's savings are gone and so, too, are the college plans of her youngest son, who was the first in the family to win acceptance at the University of North Carolina.\nUnion members and managers who were at each other's throats over organizing drives now agree that their common enemy is whichever administration is in Washington. In their opinion, neither President Bill Clinton nor President Bush fully understood the effect trade agreements would have on American industry.\n\"All I hear from Washington is that trade is a win-win proposition,\" said John A. Emrich, chief executive of Guilford Mills in Greensboro. \"Then I look at our growing trade deficit and think about the 3,400 good people in our good factories that we had to let go, and I want someone to show me where we have won. We're talked to by Washington as if we hadn't a brain in our heads.\"\nTo stay afloat, Mr. Emrich shut seven factories and shifted the emphasis from producing apparel to making fabric for automobiles and for technical uses. His company's revenue fell to $500 million last year from $900 million in 1997.\nDuring the presidential debates, trade was barely mentioned, but it is a major topic in the closely fought Senate race in North Carolina. Erskine B. Bowles, the Democratic candidate, is the husband of Crandall C. Bowles, chief executive of Springs Industries, a surviving Carolina household textile company. He jokes in his stump speeches that he \"sleeps with the industry\" and then promises to fight against the full lifting of quotas to save jobs and factories.\n\"We have to start enforcing the trade deals we've signed before we negotiate any new ones,\" Mr. Bowles said at a visit to Guilford Technical Community College in Jamestown, N.C. \"We've lost too many jobs already.\"\nHis Republican opponent, Representative Richard M. Burr, is just as vocal about the pitfalls of trade agreements for the textile industry. But he argues that he has a proven record of voting against deals with China while Mr. Bowles, as chief of staff for President Clinton, promoted them.\nWhile such political arguments go on in the cities and towns of North Carolina, a dozen poor Asian and Pacific nations are pressing for tariff legislation in Congress that would offer them some support.\n\"This is a very crucial moment for us,\" said Roland Eng, Cambodia's ambassador to the United States. \"If we lose half of our share of the U.S. market to China, it will have a cascading effect on our economy and we would be on the brink of devastation again.\"\nHis fears are not exaggerated. By the end of 2005, according to a World Bank study, China is expected to control 47 percent of the world's apparel market.\nBut economists argue that ultimately, the elimination of quotas will advance global growth.\n\"The textile quota system violated all the principles of trade that prohibits discrimination against suppliers,\" said Will Martin, lead economist of the development research group at the World Bank. \"If you want a market economy, you have to allow things to change. Textiles moved from England to New England and to the Carolinas. It's hard to blame China for using the same market forces to build its own industry.\"\nSome residents of Kannapolis have accepted the end of their textile industry and are looking to the popularity of stock-car racing for redemption. The town has built the Dale Earnhardt Plaza to celebrate its native son and has erected a statue of him that stands sentry over the doomed factories.\n\"Now the only people visiting here come to look at the Dale Earnhardt statue,\" Ms. Beaver said. But then, fondly recalling the son of the mill's founder, she added: \"I think it should have been a statue of Charlie Cannon. Charlie's the one who built up the mill and gave us jobs and houses, not Dale. It's not Charlie's fault what's happening now.\"\nMade Elsewhere\nThis article is the first of a periodic series that will examine the global clothing business."}, {"text": "Inquiry Grows to Include Arson at Suspect's School\n2004-01-13T05:00:00.000Z\nNew York City fire marshals are investigating whether the 15-year-old boy charged with causing a fatal fire in the Bronx on Dec. 30 in a possible suicide attempt may have caused another fire, at his private school in Queens 10 days earlier, law enforcement officials said.\nThe boy, Hasan Mohammad, denied to investigators that he had started the fire at the school, Darul-Uloom New York, on Dec. 20, the police said. They said the fire had destroyed a ground-floor apartment that the school had just renovated but it resulted in no injuries. Investigators did not release details about that investigation but said arson had been the cause of the fire.\nFriends, neighbors and relatives of Mr. Mohammad, a Bangladeshi immigrant, reacted with shock and sadness yesterday at his arrest, describing him as playful and energetic, though at times unruly.\n''I'm so sorry to see my son with handcuffs on,'' Abdul Karim Mohammad, the boy's father, said yesterday afternoon as he left his house in the Bronx for his mosque. ''It's something I never thought would happen. I'm so sorry.''\nHasan Mohammad was arraigned in criminal court yesterday and charged as a juvenile with two counts of second-degree murder and three counts of arson, among other charges. If he is convicted of the murder charges, he will face a maximum sentence of nine years to life in prison, said Steven Reed , a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson. The boy is being held without bond, Mr. Reed said.\nThe fire, at 1437 Glover Street in the Parkchester area of the Bronx, killed Maria Cruz, 20, and her mother, Brenda Casanova, 41, and critically injured two people -- Ms. Casanova's 17-year-old son, Carlos, and a 2-year-old boy.\nMr. Mohammad immigrated to the United States from Bangladesh with his parents and four siblings three years ago, his brother Rashed Hasan Mohammad said. The family lives in part of a three-story house on Doris Street, a block from the site of the fire.\nNeighbors said they had often seen Mr. Mohammed walking with his father and brothers to the family's mosque several blocks away or having barbecues in the summer, and said they were friendly and personable. The thin, small-framed boy known to his family as Zobaer loved to play his GameBoy and often played catch with his brothers in the family's backyard or did chores around the house like taking out the garbage, friends and family said.\n''The kid was very nice, polite,'' said Alex Torres, 39, who lived a few blocks away and talked to the family daily during walks in the neighborhood. ''I've never seen him doing anything where you would say that kid is trouble.''\n''They were very religious,'' he added.\nMr. Mohammad and his two brothers attended Darul-Uloom New York, a school and mosque in Jamaica, Queens, until two weeks ago, though teachers said they did not know why the boys' parents had pulled them out. The curriculum at the Islamic school, at 87-74 150th Street, is centered on students fully memorizing the Koran, school officials said.\nAt the school, Mr. Mohammad had a more troubled history. He often missed classes, did not turn in assignments on time and, when he was present, disrupted class, said Fareed Tapan, 45, one of Mr. Mohammad's teachers.\n''This is a religious environment where all children are taught to be obedient,'' he said. ''But I wouldn't find him to be quiet like all the others. He was a little bit out of control.''\nThe Dec. 20 fire started at 7:30 p.m. in one of the ground-floor apartments owned by the school. At the time, people were in the basement mosque, at prayer.\n''When we came up, the entire apartment was on fire,'' said Ghazi Bokhiri, the owner of the building. Mr. Bokhiri said he did not believe that Mr. Mohammad had started the fire because none of the students were present at the time.\nOfficials would not say whether they found a definitive link between the fire and Hasan Mohammad.\nThe boy told investigators that he started the fire as part of a suicide attempt. He told them he had planned to kill himself by running into the building but hoped that others would think he did it to save lives, the police said. The authorities saw Mr. Mohammad leaving the scene of the early morning blaze with burns on his face and hands, and decided to question him further because he smelled of gasoline, they said.\nMr. Mohammad was released yesterday from Lincoln Hospital and was arraigned in the afternoon. Throughout the day, people in the neighborhood talked in disbelief about the arrest.\n''This is really sad,'' said Mohammad Uddin, the imam of Baitul Aman Islamic Center, Mr. Mohammad's mosque in the Bronx. ''Those who passed away, we pray for them.''"}, {"text": "NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SOUTH ASIAN NEW YORK; The City Will Speak More Tongues, But South Asians Are Stranded\n2004-01-18T05:00:00.000Z\nADVOCATES for immigrants had reason to celebrate last month. After nearly two years of wending its way through the government, a City Council bill that requires the Human Resources Administration to provide interpretation and translation services became law. But now some of these same advocates are criticizing the fine print; they say the new law has left speakers of South Asian languages like Bengali, Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi stranded.\nUnder the new law, documents emanating from the agency, which administers public assistant and food stamp programs, will be translated into Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Haitian-Creole and Arabic only.\nPartha Banerjee, a columnist for the Bengali-language weekly Akhon Samoy, faulted the choices in a column published late last month. ''It's astonishing and arbitrary and needs to be fixed,'' he said last week, adding that part of the blame lay in the South Asian community's failure to organize behind the issue.\nThe backers of the law, many with gleaming pro-immigrant credentials, defend the legislation. ''Ultimately, the point was to be as inclusive as possible while accommodating the fiscal concerns that the administration and other members of the council,'' said Councilman John C. Liu of Queens, one of the law's sponsors. ''And these six languages covered the most people.''\nStill, resentment runs deep. ''I think it's essential legislation, but it excludes my community,'' said Annetta Seecharran, executive director of South Asian Youth Action, based in Elmhurst, Queens. ''Especially in the post-9/11 era, it feels like another slap in the face.''\nAlthough translation of documents is limited to six languages, the city must still provide oral interpreters in all languages. The agency already provides live and phone interpretation services in more than 100 languages, said its spokeswoman, Lisi de Bourbon.\nThe final list of six languages covered by the new law was derived from sources that included the latest census and a survey of food-stamp recipients, according to Andrew Friedman, co-director of Make the Road by Walking, a nonprofit group that worked for years on behalf of the legislation. The languages found to be most common among respondents nearly match the six languages cited in the law, except that Arabic replaced French. Bengali, at 16th, was the top South Asian language.\nDetermining how many people speak a language like Bengali is tricky. The 2000 census showed only 19,000 Bangladeshis in the city, but community leaders like Mujib Rahman, president of the Bangladesh Society of New York, said there were hundreds of thousands of South Asians who spoke the language. SETH KUGEL"}, {"text": "Athens: An Olympian Metamorphosis\n2004-03-07T05:00:00.000Z\nCharles Baudelaire wrote that ''No human heart/changes half so fast as the face of a city.'' Although the line refers to 19th-century Paris, it certainly applies to 21st-century Athens as it prepares for this summer's Olympics. The metamorphosis of their capital runs so deep that some citizens question what has happened to the sprawling city's distinctive soul and psyche.\nIn the past, whatever Athens's shortcomings, it remained resolutely Greek. Now, critics claim, it's becoming just another European city, with a McDonald's across from Parliament and designer boutiques surrounding the 11th-century church of Kapnikarea. The celebrated Caf\u00e9 Zonars, for a century a hangout for writers and intellectuals, recently shut down to make way for a mall; streets are clotted with S.U.V.'s; sushi and feng shui knickknacks have put in implausible appearances; and men have quit letting their pinkie fingernails grow long to prove that they're city folks, not country people who work with their hands.\nAll wrong! Athens's defenders argue. Such faultfinding is simple-minded Zorba-ism, a mindless misreading of reality. With a boost from the Olympics, Athens is becoming a fusion city, a bridge between Europe and the Middle East. When the Games begin this August in front of tens of thousands of visitors and millions of television viewers, Greece will showcase its entrepreneurial spirit, contemporary arts and surprising culinary sophistication.\nTrue, Olympic preparations have been unnervingly slow, disruptive and expensive, but in the end, optimists say, the last screw will be in place for the first event. As the smallest country to host the Olympics since Finland in 1952, Greece will recapture its ancient glory with games on a human scale. And if Stavros Lambrinidis, director of the International Olympic Truce Center, has his way, the 2004 event will revive the classical ideal, which calls for a global end of warfare during the 16 days of athletic competition.\nTo decide who's right -- the cynics or the optimists -- one can do no better than take a pre-Olympics trip to Athens and sample its ambience, its food and street life. My own exploratory journey in late November started with a flight to the new German-designed international airport, followed by a taxi ride on a toll road that rivals any American Interstate. But there was no mistaking that I was in Greece. The cabdriver smoked, as does apparently every man, woman and child in the country, and he fretted with worry beads as he tuned in bouzouki music on the radio.\nAt the distant fringes of the city, we encountered other forms of local folklore -- gridlock more infernal than in Bangkok and smog (known here as nefos, or toxic cloud) more asphyxiating than in Los Angeles. To complicate the chaos, many streets are blocked by construction, and traffic moves around Olympic sites-in-progress with the ponderousness of a millstone grinding boulders to dust.\nIt's estimated that Athens has more than two million automobiles and 500,000 motorcycles, and at any given moment all of them appear to be stalled in anaconda coils of exhaust. For more than 20 years, motorists have, in theory, driven only on alternate days, according to whether they have odd- or even-numbered license plates. But rather than halve the volume of traffic, this law has prompted many people to buy two cars. As for the much-vaunted Metro, a remarkable system with state-of-the-art equipment and exhibits of antiquities in each station, it has mostly siphoned passengers from other modes of public transport. What's more, no branch of the new Metro serves Olympic sites. Hordes of fans this summer will have to ride on the trash-ridden, flyblown old Electric Railway.\nWhen I asked a Greek how people would weather the heat and nefos this summer, he laughed and said the athletes are already polluted with pills and performance-enhancing drugs. ''A few exhaust fumes shouldn't hurt them.''\nFor hearty souls, the best advice may be to hike around Athens. In its most salutary innovation, the city has opened a series of pedestrian zones. Some, like Ermou Street, lead past sensible shops full of practical goods. Others, like the ones in the Kolanaki district, are lined with elegant boutiques. But none is more picturesque than Adrianou, a once tumbledown street, where people can now walk carefree and car-free past the ruins of the Agora, the serene symmetry of the Stoa of Attalos and the Temple of Hephaestus, Greece's best preserved Doric temple. Still other pedestrian esplanades snake up the Acropolis to the Parthenon. En route, there are restaurants and cafes where one can refuel and admire the time-worked stone and honey-colored marble.\nI settled into the St. George Lycabettus Hotel in Kolonaki, at the foot of Lykavittos Hill, which means ''hill of wolves.'' Its pine-covered heights offer panoramic views of the Attic basin as it slopes to the sea and to the islands of Salamis and Aegina. While the wolves have vanished, a canine presence still imposes itself upon the city like an atavism that haunts the urban unconscious. More than 5,000 stray dogs prowl the streets of Athens. Rumor has it these mutts, some of them the size of small ponies, will be shunted from sight during the Olympics, along with derelict ships from Piraeus harbor and prostitutes from prominent corners. But for the moment, the dogs have free rein, and Athenians regard them with blithe imperturbability. People don't shoo them away, not even when they nose around the outdoor tables at tavernas or snooze near Parliament, around the feet of the pompom-shod evzones. Is there a better definition of cognitive dissonance than stepping into Emporio Armani across a high-shag carpet of recumbent pooches?\nYet in most respects, the town is as up-to-date as a newly minted euro. While first-time visitors will want to pay their respects to the past and tour the National Archaeological Museum and the Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art, there's a contemporary scene reminiscent of SoHo or TriBeCa or any other area of former industrial blight that has been gussied up with galleries, nightclubs and expensive restaurants.\nTo explore this scene I set out by taxi, down the dreary stretch of Piraeus Street. In a neighborhood known as Gazi (''the gasworks''), Athens mounts exhibitions of up-to-the-minute art at the Factory, the School of Fine Arts and the new Benaki Museum (not to be confused with the in-town Benaki Museum of Greek Art or the Benaki Museum of Islamic Art scheduled to open in a few weeks). For reasons best known to himself, my cabdriver made the sign of the cross at each intersection. Maybe he viewed modern artists as the spawn of Satan. Anyone with a limited appetite for Damien Hirst's 20-foot-tall statue of a poor little crippled girl clutching a teddy bear and a collection box, or for video installations that induce seasickness, might sympathize. But I kind of liked the full-color photograph of a bucolic stream, leafy trees and a muscular bearded man having sex with a watermelon. I was also pleased that each of the sites had its share of stray dogs.\nI did wonder, though, why warehouses are always made over into art galleries, never art galleries into warehouses. Then, as if to refute me, Vicky Valanos, a Greek-American who has lived in Athens for a decade, escorted me to ''48,'' an art gallery that has morphed into a minimalist restaurant with maximalist prices, a picture window overlooking a Zen garden of stones and tubular lights that might have been left over from the last exhibition.\nA hurricane of energy and a treasure- trove of information, Vicky identified Greek shipping magnates at nearby tables and explained that every item on the menu was a dish that she remembered from her childhood. It was peasant food with city-slicker presentation. The dolmati arrived with sprigs of vine leaf decoratively perched atop cylinders of unsheathed rice and minced lamb. I followed the sommelier's advice and ordered a very dry white Domaine Sigalas Asyrtiko, produced from grapes grown in the volcanic soil of Santorini, and a red Boutari Naoussa Grand Reserve with strong oak overtones. The best Greek wines can now compete with those from France, Italy and Spain.\nI wanted to find out what novelists and poets thought of the changes that the onrushing Olympics have wrought in Athens. I anticipated negative views. After all, even local newspapers questioned whether the city would be ready for the Games. Would they be an international embarrassment? Would they be safe from terrorism? Would they bankrupt the municipality, diverting funds from more worthy projects?\nAlexis Stamatis met me at Horizons Restaurant, high atop Lykavittos Hill. A poet, writer (two of his novels, ''The Seventh Elephant'' and ''Bar Flaubert,'' have been translated into English), editor, journalist and son of a well-known actress, Stamatis spoke with authority about a wide range of subjects, including the menu. As another index of Athens's advance from provincial town to what Stamatis called the ''capital of the eastern Mediterranean,'' he pointed out dishes from France, Italy and Spain. In the past, he said, you never saw radicchio, avocados or mozzarella in a Greek restaurant. This was all part of what he characterized as an explosion of energy and creativity. ''There are 200 theaters in Athens. More than in London. Seven thousand books are published every year. That's a huge number, really too much, for a country of 10 million people. But this way there's a chance for everyone. It'll sort itself out. We're a society opening up.''\nThough he conceded that the city was chaotic, he described it as ''chaos with a style. Now we are trying to edit the chaos, deleting what's bad, keeping what's good.'' He not only approved of the Olympics and believed they would yield lasting benefits for Greece, he was, in his way, a participant in the Games. Following a tradition that has linked the arts and athletics since the fifth century B.C., when the lyric poet Pindar wrote odes for the Olympics, Stamatis has produced 10 prose texts for the Games, among them some about the mascots Phevos and Athena, cartoonish versions of the ancient gods.\nMany accomplished Greek artists will play a part in the Olympics. Dimitris Papaioannou, a choreographer known for his experimental work, will direct the opening ceremony, and Sofia Kokosalaki, a London-based designer, will do the costumes. ''Don't expect a Hollywood production,'' Stamatis said. ''No imitation Greek gowns or fake classicism. This should be something truly memorable.''\nLest the games be accused of cultural chauvinism, the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava has been commissioned to upgrade the Athens Olympics Sports Complex and install a dramatic new roof on the two-decade-old stadium. Scheduled to be finished by June, this project is another that has provoked worry that it won't be ready.\nNicholas Papandreou, author of the novel ''A Crowded Heart,'' and son of former Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, agrees that the Games will be a signal event in the city's renaissance. He welcomed the move to renovate neo-Classical facades along the marathon route and expressed hope that personal computers and the Internet will reduce the bureaucratic red tape that has often snarled Athens. But most of all, he said, ''I like that the city's becoming multiracial. That's a real positive. Greece used to be an exporter of labor. Now we've got immigrants from Albania, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China and Africa, and a lot of Greeks have returned.''\nThis made me wonder whether the old Athens still exists. But a series of strolls, with Vicky Valanos as my guide, proved that despite the influx of tourists, foreign investors and internationally known name brands, the city retains its identity and much of its raffish charm. A dozen flags may fly from the rafters of the central fish market advertising Swatch as the Official Timekeeper of the Olympics, but in the redolent stalls down below, vendors continue their ceaseless chant, hawking fresh tuna, squid, shrimp and octopus. Every night, in the hours before dawn, revelers pour in from nearby clubs to have a bowl of soup with workers whose day is just beginning.\nAcross the square from the fish market, past shops stuffed with sponges and burlap sacks bulging with spices, a building on the corner of Sokratous and Theatrou appears to be abandoned and on the brink of collapse. But two doors lead down staircases as steep as coal chutes to a taverna known as Diporto. There's no sign outside and no menu. The waiter simply brings what's on offer -- tomato salad, chick peas and bean soup, grilled red mullet, fresh bread, retsina and a dessert of halvah and sliced lemon. At $10 a head, a meal costs what an appetizer does at ''48.''\nVicky showed me around Psiri, a once clapped-out neighborhood that has become what the Plaka was decades ago, a zone of trendy restaurants and clubs with aggressively non-Greek names -- Blues, Pravda and so forth. But a short step onto almost any side street brought us back to unpaved courtyards and buildings with wildflowers sprouting from their roofs. Late one night, after a lively session of Moroccan music and belly dancing at Red Marrakech, we rounded a corner to a hole-in-the-wall bakery where we bought koulouris, doughnut-shaped bread covered with sesame seeds. Since the traffic was chockablock at 2 a.m., and we couldn't find a cab, we walked up the pedestrian esplanade on Ermou, past an organ grinder and a salepi vendor who sprinkled cinnamon atop the tea-like beverage. Stray dogs fell into step beside us, and we tossed them scraps of koulouri.\nThen, abruptly, as if we had been thrust into a time machine, the street reverted to its previous incarnation and was flooded with cars and motorcycles illegally shaking free of the traffic on parallel streets. Tires squealed, horns blared, dogs barked and Vicky laughed as we jumped clear. ''You see,'' she said, ''no matter how much Athens changes, it'll always be a Greek village at heart.''"}, {"text": "NEW YORK 2004: NEW YORK/DINING OUT; Looking for Good Eats? Check the Streets\n2004-08-29T05:00:00.000Z\nHAVING a hard time getting a table at a hot restaurant? Who needs one? On the sidewalks of New York you can get great food from every corner of the globe for under $10. Street food here has never been better or more varied.\nBurgers and frozen custard (soft ice cream made with egg yolks) are a classic combination everywhere in the country except New York. Danny Meyer and his Union Square Hospitality Group have filled that void this summer with the opening of Shake Shack in the southeast corner of Madison Square Park.\nNew York is not known to be much of a chili town, but Adam Perry Lang has taken the classical chef's training he received at the likes of the ultrafancy Restaurant Daniel and applied it to red Texas-style chili. Mr. Lang has a Daisy May's BBQ cart right across Avenue of the Americas from Radio City Music Hall.\nThere are many fine Jamaican and Caribbean restaurants in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, but it can be harder to find a decent roti or jerk or stewed chicken in Manhattan. Tony Williams is doing his best to remedy this Midtown culinary shortcoming with his food cart on 42nd Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues in front of a post office.\nThe street sign at West 46th Street and Avenue of the Americas reads Little Brazil, but maybe it should say Little Middle East. On the southeast corner is Moishe's Falafel cart, which is bigger than many storefronts in Manhattan. The falafel balls taste as though the mashed chickpeas in the preparation were mixed with bread; nonetheless, they are tasty, filling and a steal.\nDirectly across the street from Moishe's is Miriam's Falafel. The falafel there has lots of cumin, parsley and garlic, along with a healthy dose of pepper.\nGo south one block and you will move from the Middle East to Bangladesh as you line up at the Kwik Meal cart. There the toque- and ascot-clad chef Mohammed Rahman has made that street corner a one-person empowerment zone. ''Here I get to make my food the way I want it, sell it at half the price I'd have to sell it for in a restaurant, nobody yells at me, and I get to spend my evenings at home with my family. God bless America.''"}, {"text": "NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST VILLAGE; At Bombay on Sixth, the Case of the Vanishing Samosas\n2004-05-23T05:00:00.000Z\nDuring its mid-1990's heyday, the stretch of East Sixth Street between First and Second Avenues known as Little India was a gaudy, successful mix of carnival and cuisine. Employees wearing vests of pastel patchwork lined sidewalks like barkers, urging passers-by to poke their heads inside. Within the restaurants, twinkling lights draped mirrored walls, and diners took their soupy saag to the thump of disco raga.\nBut now this South Asian outpost, one of the city's most visible, may be pulling up its stakes. Rising costs and changing tastes have left their mark, and the number of customers has fallen by at least 40 percent in the last few years, according to restaurant managers.\nWhile five years ago there were more than 30 Indian restaurants on the block (almost all are actually run by Bangladeshis), now there are just 19, and many are shells of their former selves. ''People all know the name and expect to find something here,'' said Ohidur Rahman, who manages Panna, a 30-seat restaurant that has occupied the same spot for 15 years. On a recent weeknight, while one couple ate inside, Mr. Rahman stood quietly on the sidewalk. ''Day by day,'' he said, ''I see it going down.''\nAs Indian restaurants have closed, many non-Indian restaurants have taken their place. Within the past year, East Sixth has welcomed Mara's Homemade (Southern), Zerza (Moroccan), and Mancora (Peruvian), housed in a former deli famous for selling ''500 varieties of beer.'' Boutiques have also arrived, among them Coup de Coeur (women's clothes), Tribal Soundz (musical instruments), and Prime Design & Printing, an Internet cafe.\nFrom a landlord's perspective, this new diversity is positive.\n''The street was tending to get seedy,'' said Stuart Rubinfeld, a spokesman for Matel Realty, which owns several buildings on the block. ''A lot of restaurants were not making it and lowering their standards.''\n''A few years ago we made a conscious decision to attract better quality restaurants, either Indian food or not,'' he said. ''Besides, the novelty of an Indian restaurant row is wearing off.''\nTrue, Bangladeshi and Indian restaurants can now be found throughout the city and in many suburbs, making a special trip to once-novel East Sixth Street unnecessary.\nThe block's smaller cafes have also been hit hard by soaring insurance costs. According to the New York State Restaurant Association, rates for restaurants have risen on average by 50 percent since Sept. 11, 2001.\nThe biggest blow, though, comes from being unable to keep up with a seemingly unstoppable New York phenomenon: gentrification. Little India's commercial rents hovered between $3,000 and $7,000 a month for 5- to 10-year leases as recently as five years ago. Now, the neighborhood can support $10,000-a-month leases, according to real estate and food industry experts.\n''This is a great part of New York City history,'' said Motiur Ramen, who works as a waiter at Sonali, one restaurant on the strip. ''But unless business picks up, it can't be preserved.'' C.J. HUGHES"}, {"text": "Debate Stirs Over Tiny Loans for World's Poorest\n2004-04-29T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nNearly every woman in this village seems to have gotten tiny loans to invest in a miniature business.\nNone has made better use of the cash than Firoza Akhter, a shrewd, flinty young mother who put her profits from four loans into cows, goats, land, a sturdy house and private tutors for her daughter. ''I can make money out of anything,'' she boasted in her wheezy voice, a gold, flower-shaped stud glinting in her nose. Hers is a shining success story for microcredit.\nBut while she came from humble origins, she was not among the poorest of the poor. Like many of the 50 million people who take part in microcredit programs, she hovered at the upper fringe of poverty.\nToday there is a growing push for the nonprofit groups and banks that run such programs to reach deeper into the ranks of the poor, though there is little rigorous evidence juding whether the very poor benefit from microcredit, economists say.\nSince 1988, the United States Congress has appropriated $2 billion for such programs. In new rules to take effect next year, it has put teeth into a requirement that half of American aid for these loans -- defined as $1,000 or less in Europe and Eurasia, $400 or less in Latin America and $300 or less in the rest of the world -- go to the very poor living on less than $1 a day.\nThe new rules have stirred strong opposition from other donors and a range of microfinance institutions, which contend that the industry may grow faster and ultimately help more very poor people by aiming at a wider pool that ranges from people who are struggling but not poor to those much further down the economic ladder.\n''This limbo dance to serve the poorest is a distraction from a much broader issue of trying to reach a billion people who have no access to credit or a safe place to save their money,'' said Elizabeth Littlefield, a former managing director at J. P. Morgan who now heads the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, an association of donors.\nResearchers for this country's largest microlender, the Bangladesh Rural Action Committee, or BRAC, have found that people near the poverty line are the main users of microfinance and are more likely to get more and bigger loans and build successful microenterprises.\nBy contrast, BRAC has found that the very poor are more likely to drop out of microcredit programs.\nBut the group's leaders say the microcredit industry needs to try new approaches to help the poorest people. They have coupled small loans with skills training and grants of food. And they are experimenting\nwith giving the poorest people cows and goats to raise, rather than loans to buy the animals.\nWhen the dynamic Ms. Akhter got her first loan, for $50, she said she already had $250 saved from working as a cook and raising chickens, the family trade. ''I thought I could increase my capital by taking the loan,'' she said. She invested it in a calf she later sold for $100. Her next $80 -- borrowed at 27 percent interest -- she loaned out at more than triple that rate. Today her skillful investments have helped her become relatively prosperous, despite having left her husband in disgust after he took a fourth wife. ''She was always enterprising,'' said her father, who gave her chicks to tend when she was just a girl.\nSince the 1980's, wealthy nations and international organizations have provided billions of dollars for microcredit programs. The idea that small loans enable millions of poor people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps has captivated liberals and conservatives alike.\nBut there are still no stringent evaluations of microcredit programs generally viewed as credible by experts. ''Energetic, entrepreneurial people do well with microcredit,'' said Jonathan Morduch, an associate professor of public policy and economics at New York University. ''But others who are less skilled and trained, how do they do? Can very poor households get decent returns or not? That's the big question policy-wise.''\nAt a time when the United Nations is pursuing the eradication of extreme poverty as the world's top development goal, advocates of the new congressional rules fear that the poorest people are too often neglected. They have mobilized elected officials from the United States to Britain and Japan to petition the World Bank, the largest provider of microfinance funds, as well as the African, Asian and Inter-American development banks, to adhere to the same emphasis on the very poor that was adopted by the United States Congress.\n''It's a myth that you can't reach the very poor,'' said Sam Daley-Harris, a musician-turned-advocate who founded the Results Educational Fund, which lobbied Congress for the new rules. He points to Share Microfin, an Indian lender, as evidence that the very poor can be helped with microcredit.\nIn the village of Gorma, the experience of Bina and Kanu Sarkar, a gaunt couple with anxious eyes, illustrates the complexities of escaping poverty, even where microcredit is available.\nHere, the paddy fields are alive with barefoot men delicately planting tender rice seedlings and oxen lazing in the sun. The landscape is a gentle, quilted patchwork of scratchy brown burlap and soft green silk, but the life it supports is hard.\nBefore microlenders arrived, the poor had little choice but to become deeply indebted to moneylenders who charged exorbitant interest rates of 120 percent or more a year. Microfinance institutions in Bangladesh generally charge from 20 to 50 percent.\nMrs. Sarkar last year became one of BRAC's 3.5 million borrowers. She used the $50 to buy her husband a rickshaw, which will save him 35 cents on the daily rickshaw rental fee once the loan is paid off. But even with the extra earnings, the Sarkars, both illiterate, will be desperately poor. They and their sons, Badal, 12, and Akash, 6, struggle to get by on the $1 a day that Mr. Sarkar earns pedaling his rickshaw. Now even that meager livelihood is threatened by an ulcer that doubles him over in agony. ''The choice is whether to see a doctor or buy food,'' he said, laying out the pitiless arithmetic of poverty. ''The government doctors don't check us properly because we don't pay them money. Even if they prescribe medicines, we can't afford them.''\nIf his strength continues to seep away, the rickshaw will be no use to him, he explained. The evening before, after miles of hard pedaling, he was forced to forfeit a fare when his stomach pain grew unbearable. He had to ask his passengers to get down.\nAs he related the story, Akash clambered into the rickshaw and pedaled out of the dirt courtyard. His father leapt up to chase the boy in a panic, fearing a crash would destroy the one asset he needed to feed his family.\n''If I can't work for even a day, my wife and children go unfed,'' he said, clutching his belly.\nSome lenders here in Bangladesh, the heartland of the microcredit movement, are experimenting with new ways to reach the poorest of the poor. For years, BRAC has offered some poor women free wheat and training along with micro loans.\nBut now it has entirely dropped the use of loans in one pilot program for ''ultrapoor'' women. BRAC gives them goats or cows to raise, coupled with training and health care, rather than burdening them with debts they cannot repay.\nNone of the poverty-stricken women who sat under a palm tree in Mochahata village on a recent morning had ever dared to apply for a microloan. One woman's pierced nose hole was empty because she had already been forced to sell her gold stud for money. Another's 9-year-old son pedaled a rickshaw for 50 cents a day to keep the family fed.\nBut they eagerly joined BRAC's new program -- and were pleased to see their fast-breeding goats multiply. They were still so poor that their bodies seemed little more than collections of bones beneath worn saris, but their new assets offered hope.\n''I had nothing, nobody,'' said Mina, who worked as a maid for payment in rice after her husband abandoned her. ''I was scared to become a member of BRAC. I was too poor to repay a loan. But now that I'm getting goats free, I'm interested.''\nCorrection: May 1, 2004, Saturday Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the debate over whether microcredit loan programs should focus more on people at the upper fringes of poverty or on the poorest misidentified an organization that lobbied Congress to make sure the loans benefit the world's poorest. Its name is Results.

The restaurant, now called Shamballa, will be remodeled and reopened early next year under the ownership and management of the group, who are immigrant restaurant workers from 20 nations.\nThe list of countries they call home is as varied as the menu of a Greek diner, and nearly as eclectic: Bangladesh, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal and a dozen others. They are young and not so young, men and women, legal and illegal. But they shared a single goal -- owning their own place.\nThough the 50 have accumulated a wealth of experience in preparing and serving elegant meals, a lack of capital kept them from being their own bosses or owning their own restaurant.\nTheir contribution to the new business will be sweat equity, and they expect to receive financial aid from a number of corporate guardian angels, including half a million dollars already pledged by an Italian food workers' co-op. They are also seeking commercial loans. Though they applied for government assistance, they have not yet received any.\nThe workers say that by opening their own restaurant they hope to show the city's food service industry that it is possible to treat workers fairly, pay them living wages and still make a profit.\nAnd there's something more. \"This is a legacy to the people we lost,\" said Fekkak Mamdouh, a former waiter at Windows on the World and a leader of the co-op. \"If it doesn't happen, it will really be a shame.\"\nIn the months after the attacks, the workers were overwhelmed by the economic downturn, and finding work was nearly impossible. With help from the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, they formed the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, which provides legal and technical assistance.\nThey started a catering company and used the proceeds to hire a consultant. Although warning the workers that successful new restaurants are a long shot, the consultant suggested that the new restaurant be located in TriBeCa and feature American comfort food, including steak and French fries. The menu would be supplemented by specialties taken from the cornucopia of meals represented by the co-op members' nationalities and backgrounds.\nThe workers' original idea of displaying photos and memorabilia from the original Windows restaurant, on the 107th floor of the north tower, was ruled out as being too painful a reminder of that day.\nThey negotiated for space in several buildings near ground zero, but never could close the deals. Opening day had to be pushed back.\nSaru Jayaraman, executive director of the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, said that after several false starts, they decided to buy an existing restaurant rather than design a new one. She said they were very close to signing a contract to take over the lease of Shamballa, at 407 Greenwich Street, about six blocks below Canal Street, and could close on the deal this month. The restaurant did not respond to calls requesting comment.\nMr. Mamdouh said the workers had not yet settled on a name. An early concept, \"Windows on TriBeCa,\" remains an option, but some of the workers are heeding the advice to distance themselves from 9/11.\nThey are holding a contest to select a name -- the winner gets dinner for two in the restaurant. But Mr. Mamdouh said that he, for one, was reluctant to stray too far from the memory of the 73 colleagues for whom it is dedicated.\n\"My own idea is 'Dignity,\"' he said, \"just that word all by itself.\""}, {"text": "Neighbors Describe the Suspects as Peaceful, Religious Family Men\n2004-08-06T05:00:00.000Z\n ALBANY, Aug. 5 - The small mosque on Central Avenue is as nondescript as many of the other storefronts lining the busy streets that run west from the doors of the State Capitol here, the Laundromats, fast food places and cramped shops that sell used furniture and old records or fix broken appliances. \n So it was not until pictures of it were splashed across television screens after two of its leaders were arrested early Thursday that many people said they felt the presence of Islam in their midst.

He said the mosque was trying to increase its ranks, and believed the local Islamic community was growing. But some people, he said, were too scared to come to the mosque in light of world events. \n \"Our biggest concern is the worshipers will stop coming to the mosque,'' said Mr. Ahmad, adding that worshipers had to pray on a sidewalk early Thursday when the police raided the mosque. As he spoke, people driving by occasionally shouted taunts, like \"lock them all up.\" \n The two men who were arrested were described by friends and acquaintances as hard-working, peaceful men devoted to their families and religion. \n Mr. Aref, a Kurd from northern Iraq, was the imam of the mosque. He lived in a ramshackle wood-frame house next to a vacant lot with his wife and three young children. He had a job driving for a local ambulance company, taught children at the mosque and, last year, took a group of children to an amusement park, friends said. \n As Mr. Aref's children played on the stoop of their house on Thursday, Arif Khan, a friend of the family's, said they were driven from Iraq by Saddam Hussein about four years ago. \n \"He was harassed by Saddam,'' said Mr. Khan, who called the government's charges, \"totally fake.\" \n Mr. Khan said the United Nations had sent Mr. Aref to Albany. \n \"He did not come to Albany by his own choice,'' said Mr. Khan, as Mr. Aref's wife left the house in traditional Muslim dress to attend her husband's appearance in Federal District Court in Albany. \n Across town, neighbors said Mr. Hossain was a married father of five who came from Bangladesh in 1985 and nine years later opened the Little Italy Pizzeria. Cleo Junco, the family's landlord, and Jake McClenahan, an upstairs neighbor, said Mr. Hossain spoke of Islam often. Ms. Cleo said she saw Mr. Hossain's wife crying recently, apparently because the family was about to split up, with some people returning to Bangladesh, and some of the children headed to a school in Buffalo. \n When questioned about his father, Abuhamza Hossain, 10, who was in the pizzeria on Thursday, pointed to an article about his father printed in The Albany Times-Union in June that was pinned on the wall under a poster praising Allah. \n In the article, Mr. Hossain was quoted as saying, \"I'm proud to be an American. When I was in high school in Bangladesh, I looked at a map of America and I dreamed of coming to this great land.\" \n On Thursday, his wife, Mossamat, told The Associated Press, \"It's totally wrong and totally false and totally a lie.\" She said her husband was a businessman, not a terrorist. \n At the court hearing, the wives of both men wept and hugged each other as United States marshals led their husbands away. One acquaintance there, Sajid Ahmed, a 32-year-old native of India, said the idea of Mr. Hossain being involved in an anti-American terrorist plot seemed incredible. Not only was he often heard saying that he loved America, he said, but he was well known for giving pizza to the poor. \n \"It was very surprising to me,'' Mr. Ahmed said. \"I think they were being nice to some other people and they got entrapped in this case.\" "}, {"text": "Arrest of Mosque Leaders Surprises Neighbors, Who Describe Both as Peaceful Men\n2004-08-06T05:00:00.000Z\nThe small mosque on Central Avenue is as nondescript as many of the other storefronts lining the busy streets that run west from the doors of the State Capitol here, the Laundromats, fast food places and cramped shops that sell used furniture and old records or fix broken appliances.\nSo it was not until pictures of it were splashed across television screens after two of its leaders were arrested early Thursday that many people said they felt the presence of Islam in their midst.

Many shook their heads, wondering hether they had missed a new community taking shape right in front of them. \n \"I've heard of Muslims and Islam, but I didn't know there was any mosques here,'' said Keisha Graham, 25, a lifelong Albany resident, as she stood at a bus stop about a block from the mosque, Masjid as-Salam. \"I didn't know there were any up here in Albany.'' \n The arrests of Yassin M. Aref, 34, and Mohammed M. Hossain, 49, cast a harsh and unwanted spotlight on an Islamic community that, according to its leaders, is thriving in the shadow of the State Capitol complex. \"Islam is one of the fastest growing religions in the world and Albany should be no exception,'' said Ahmed Kobeisy, the director and imam of the Islamic Center of the Capital District, in Schenectady, who said there were five mosques in the tri-city area of Albany, Schenectady and Troy. \n Faisal Ahmad, 25, the son of the president of the Masjid as-Salam mosque, stood on the curb and explained that about 200 people, including 50 women, attend Friday prayers at the mosque, which he said had been there about 10 years. He said the mosque was trying to increase its ranks, and believed the local Islamic community was growing. But some people, he said, were too scared to come to the mosque in light of world events. \n \"Our biggest concern is the worshipers will stop coming to the mosque,'' said Mr. Ahmad, adding that worshipers had to pray on a sidewalk early Thursday when the police raided the mosque. As he spoke, people driving by occasionally shouted taunts, like \"lock them all up.\" \n The two men who were arrested were described by friends and acquaintances as hard-working, peaceful men devoted to their families and religion. \n Mr. Aref, a Kurd from northern Iraq, was the imam of the mosque. He lived in a ramshackle wood-frame house next to a vacant lot with his wife and three young children. He had a job driving for a local ambulance company, taught children at the mosque and, last year, took a group of children to an amusement park, friends said. \n As Mr. Aref's children played on the stoop of their house on Thursday, Arif Khan, a friend of the family's, said they were driven from Iraq by Saddam Hussein about four years ago. \n \"He was harassed by Saddam,'' said Mr. Khan, who called the government's charges, \"totally fake.\" \n Mr. Khan said the United Nations had sent Mr. Aref to Albany. \n \"He did not come to Albany by his own choice,'' said Mr. Khan, as Mr. Aref's wife left the house in traditional Muslim dress to attend her husband's appearance in Federal District Court in Albany. \n Across town, neighbors said Mr. Hossain was a married father of five who came from Bangladesh in 1985 and nine years later opened the Little Italy Pizzeria.

Ashram Katwarol, 49, died in the top apartment of the three-story building, and his son, Adrian, 19, was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in critical condition. Later, he was transferred to the burn unit at Weill Cornell Center.\nMr. Katwarol's daughter arrived at the home shortly after the fire began, a neighbor said.\nOn the second floor, Ernesto Valdes, 47, heard glass shatter and an explosion below, and one of his three teenage children ran into his room shouting, ''Fire!'' he said.\n''When I tried to open the door, the fire came from the stairs,'' he said later yesterday.\nAll three children leapt out a rear window to the backyard, and Mr. Valdes and his girlfriend jumped from a kitchen window to the ledge of another building, Mr. Valdes said. The children suffered scratches from the broken glass but were otherwise unhurt, he said. His apartment and Mr. Katwarol's were the only two apartments in the building.\nThe front of the store stocked compact discs, while the rear was a grocery. The fire appeared to have started in the doorway of the building, which is next to the store. Smoke and flames heavily damaged the building, in a neighborhood of working-class Indian and Bangladeshi immigrants. ''I lost everything,'' Mr. Valdes said.\nMr. Katwarol was an automobile mechanic, his neighbor said.\nDown Liberty Avenue from the site of the fire, at Bonita Unisex Salon, the owner recalled giving Adrian his regular haircuts and said he came from a hardworking family.\n''It's sad, very sad,'' the woman said."}, {"text": "Stepped-Up Police Activity Irks an Arab Area in Greece\n2004-07-26T05:00:00.000Z\nAs the opening of the Olympic Games draws closer, the Greek police and foreign intelligence agencies have increased their activities in a predominately Muslim area of Athens, Greek officials say.\nResidents of the district -- whose narrow streets are lined with open-air shops selling such items as cement, clothes and onions, next to international call centers and places to wire money abroad -- say they are incensed that they are being treated as terrorism suspects.\nGreek, American and British intelligence agencies have all tried to infiltrate the Muslim and Arab communities here, Greek officials said. But the Greeks asked for, and received, assistance from counterterrorism teams and intelligence operatives from Jordan and Egypt, the officials said. The Israelis have helped keep an eye on Arab embassies, they said.\nAbout 100,000 people of Arab or Muslim background live in Athens, and they have generally not been militant, Greek officials said. But their fear, heightened after the bombings in Madrid in March, is that Al Qaeda or some affiliated terrorist organization has planted a sleeper cell in this part of the city.\n''If one were looking for a sleeper cell, this is where it would be,'' Alex Rondos, a former ambassador at large who was coordinator for Olympic activities, said of the area, near Omonia Square in central Athens. Mr. Rondos, who left office in March when the Socialist government was defeated, said his concerns arose more than a year ago, when he was working on various counterterrorism projects. The possibility of a sleeper cell, however remote, is something that Greek officials were slow to grapple with, he said.\n''There was a dangerous attitude of complacency,'' he said.\nFears of a possible attack by Islamic militants are not allayed by the statements made by Mehmet Imam, president of the country's largest Muslim organization.\nMr. Imam has called on all Islamic countries to boycott the Games, because of the fighting in the West Bank and Gaza, Afghanistan and Iraq. ''He is an enemy,'' Mr. Imam said in an interview, about anyone who attends the Games. But he disavowed any link to Al Qaeda or any sympathy for Osama bin Laden.\nHe said the Greek police were using the Olympic Games as a pretext to oppress Muslims.\nTerrorism investigators in Europe have found cells in many countries, including France, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and, most recently, Spain. But they have not found any trails leading to Greece, Greek and other European officials say.\nThe Greek government has discovered that monitoring possible suspicious activity within the largely Muslim part of the city has been made more difficult by one of its own policies. In spite of repeated promises, the Ministry of Religious Affairs has not given the necessary approval for a mosque in Athens, because of the opposition of the Greek Orthodox Church, the official state religion.\n''It is not a culturally sound policy, and it is counterproductive from a counterterrorism view,'' Mr. Rondos said. Instead of one central mosque, where the authorities could watch for suspicious people and listen for incendiary sermons, there are about 50 ''underground'' mosques, in tenement apartments and garages, Greek officials said.\nAhmed Asak, a 32-year-old garment worker from Bangladesh, said that he was stopped by the police 10 days ago in this district. They wanted to check his documents, to be sure he was in the country legally, and they looked in his backpack.\nThe same thing happened to Thomi Savr, 28, who managed to get out of Iraq three years ago. He made it to Greece via Turkey, was jailed for three months, then went to Germany, where he married. Then the Germans sent him back to Greece.\nMr. Asak goes to Friday Prayers on the second floor of a rundown eight-story tenement on Geraniou Street, within a few blocks of City Hall. Nigerians and Somalis live on the first floor, Bangladeshis on the third, Sudanese on the fifth, Afghans on the eighth.\nAt another tenement mosque, attended by Pakistanis, speakers have extolled the virtues of Osama bin Laden, a Western ambassador in Athens contended. He said he had been told this by a Muslim on his staff.\nSaudi Arabia has been sending money to various Muslim groups in Athens, Greek officials said, and the Greek government has spoken to the Saudi Embassy about it.\nIn trying to stop any potential terrorist from disrupting the Games, the Greek government has had some important help beyond all the high-tech gear and spies sent by the United States, Britain and other countries.\nCol. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya has sent word to the Libyan population in Athens that its members should not engage in any acts of violence during the Games, a Greek official said. The Palestinians have made a similar appeal to their residents here, who number about 25,000, he said.\nThe Turkish government has promised Greece that it would crack down on the smuggling operations that bring refugees through Turkey en route to Europe. The smugglers' routes go through Greek waters, and there is a concern that a potential terrorist could reach one of Greece's many islands.\nThe men on Geraniou Street reacted strongly to Mr. Imam's call for a boycott, though they tended to agree with his view that the police were using the Games as a pretext to harass them.\n''Muslims love sports,'' one man said, his voice rising above those of the others in the crowd on the second floor.\n''The Prophet says we should be good at sports,'' another said."}, {"text": "Bush and Other Leaders Quick to Offer Condolences and Aid\n2004-12-27T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nLONDON, Dec. 26 - From President Bush to Pope John Paul II, the world's political and spiritual leaders urged support on Sunday for victims of the giant waves in Asia as relief agencies and governments girded to offer technical help and aid. The United States said assistance was already on its way to some of the most stricken areas.\nThe speed and scale of the disaster -- with thousands dead -- left some relief specialists struggling to keep pace with events. \"The needs are enormous,\" said Louis Michel, a senior official of the European Union, which offered $4 million in emergency funds.\nIn Geneva, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said as many as 500,000 survivors could need help for the next six months. It appealed for some $6.5 million to finance relief efforts.\nUsually, in major catastrophes, relief agencies seek to meet the basic needs of survivors for shelter, clean water, food and medicines coupled with longer-term aid to help stricken regions to restore water supplies and rebuild themselves. But those efforts can founder because of poor communications and bad roads that prevent relief supplies from reaching affected areas.\nKofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said he was \"profoundly saddened to learn of the massive loss of life and destruction.\" He said the United Nations \"stands ready to provide the assistance necessary to meet the needs created by these natural disasters.\"\nTrent Duffy, the deputy White House spokesman, said in a statement: \"On behalf of the American people, the president expresses his sincere condolences for the terrible loss of life and suffering caused by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis in the region of the Bay of Bengal. The United States stands ready to offer all appropriate assistance to those nations most affected including Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Thailand and Indonesia, as well as the other countries impacted.\n\"Already relief is flowing to Sri Lanka and the Maldives,\" the statement continued. \"We will work with the affected governments, the United Nations, nongovernmental organizations, and other concerned states and organizations to support the relief and response to this terrible tragedy.\"\nIn the region itself, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan urged a \"swift and concerted\" response from international donors and said Pakistan would send tents, medicines and water to Sri Lanka, one of the countries hit by the huge waves.\nIn India, where more than 2,400 people were reported killed, the government sent naval vessels and aircraft laden with food and medicine to its southern coastline and to Sri Lanka. India is no stranger to natural disaster, including the earthquake in 2000 that killed 20,000 people in Gujarat.\nOffers of on-the-ground help and financial support came from Ireland, Britain, Kuwait and Turkey, among others.\nJack Straw, the British foreign secretary, said, \"For all the huge advances in the control of our lives through science and technology, an earthquake on this scale is truly humbling as well as profoundly tragic for everyone involved.\"\nQueen Elizabeth II said she was \"deeply saddened.\" The queen is the titular head of the Commonwealth, an assembly mainly of former British colonies of which India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Malaysia are members.\nRelief agencies in France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Israel, Russia and Greece indicated that the focus of their initial efforts would be in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.\nDoctors Without Borders, an international aid group, said in a statement posted on its Web site that it had staff on standby to fly to Indonesia and would send teams to India, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Burma.\nJackie Flowers, a spokesperson for the American Red Cross, said Sunday that Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations in the region had begun to deploy staff and volunteers.\nPope John Paul offered prayers for the victims during his customary noon appearance from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.\n\"The Christmas holiday has been saddened by the news that comes from Southeast Asia about the powerful earthquake which struck Indonesia, with consequences in other countries, including Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and the Maldives,\" the pope said.\n\"Let us pray for the victims of this enormous tragedy and assure them of our solidarity for all those who suffer, while we hope that the international community acts to bring relief to the stricken populations,\" he said.\nASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: RELIEF Correction: January 8, 2005, Saturday An article on Jan. 1 about the global relief effort for Asian nations struck by the tsunami misstated the Bush administration's first pledge of aid. (Several later articles about the disaster also misstated the first pledge.) The administration pledged $4 million on Dec. 27 for the International Red Cross and raised the figure to $15 million later that day for the total American effort. That figure was raised to $35 million on Dec. 28 and to $350 million on Dec. 31. The first pledge was neither $35 million nor $15 million."}, {"text": "After a Drizzly 5-Hour Match, Brooklyn College Takes the Cup\n2004-04-09T05:00:00.000Z\nIn terms of championship games, the cricket match played in Brooklyn yesterday between computer science students from Brooklyn College and a spirited bunch of players from City College will probably not make the annals of intercollegiate sports.\nIt had none of the flash of the Final Four and none of the hype of the Rose Bowl. And of course, it was not televised nationally.\nIn fact, the only ones there to watch the game end were some seagulls and geese foraging for food. And the players in this game did not don the snazzy white uniforms cricket players typically wear, choosing instead the standard urban garb with sneakers and even work boots.\nThe cricket pitch was in Marine Park, a hard dirt field with occasional patches of grass. Its boundaries were formed by a series of foam cups placed on twigs pushed into the ground. The championship trophy -- the Inter-College Cup -- stood unceremoniously in the mud, a plastic bag protecting it from the rain.\nBut when the five-hour match finally ended, with Brooklyn College winning by five wickets, the team mobbed its captain, Tareq Zaman, after he was presented with the trophy (by this reporter because there was no one else to do it). He hoisted it toward the rainy evening sky.\n''We did it,'' he said, as the rain intensified and team members quickly dispersed to pack their equipment into duffel bags. ''Now let's get out of here.''\nTruth be told, the match was no official city championship. In fact, City College lost a game on Wednesday to the Borough of Manhattan Community College, whose team showed up in flowing white uniforms bearing sponsors' insignias.\nBut whatever the game meant, the players called it proof that cricket has taken hold in city colleges as a somewhat organized sport. With more immigrants coming in from places like South Asia and the Caribbean -- areas where cricket is especially popular -- the game is growing as a club sport and also as a college sport.\nCollege cricket teams are usually student clubs that, once they manage to get in touch with other colleges' teams, organize games in public parks near a subway line, usually on a Saturday or a holiday, since a match can take the better part of a day to complete.\nThe Brooklyn College team, a branch of the South Asian students club called Shobujbangla, is made up almost entirely of Bangladeshi immigrants. During a break in the game yesterday, they ate spicy chicken pita sandwiches and drank Sprite. The City College team, which has Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian and Caribbean players, stood eating pizza on a muddy baseball infield.\nIn the morning, it took the players almost two hours to prepare the field, said Hasan Ahmed, 25, a Brooklyn College team manager.\n''You're supposed to have rope boundaries, but I knew we wouldn't have them, so I brought a bag of cups for the drinks and another bag of cups to make boundaries,'' he said. ''A lot of kids in New York learn their cricket technique from videos of legendary matches, like the ones between India and Pakistan.''\nAs the afternoon rain got heavy, baseball games around the park disappeared. A group of black-robed orthodox Jews ran across the cricket pitch as the rush-hour traffic on nearby Avenue U grew thick.\nBefore lifting Brooklyn College to victory, Mahria Shah, 19, of Brooklyn, took batting practice in front of a green metal garbage can. He wore a puffy Timberland ski vest, a Yankee cap and white, thigh-high leg pads strapped over his shiny sweat pants.\n''I love the Yankees, especially Derek Jeter,'' he said. ''It's hard to get cricket broadcasts here, so we mostly watch baseball. It's similar, but cricket is much deeper. Batting in cricket is a real science. There are so many more dimensions.''\nWith that, Mr. Shah entered the game, carrying his heavy wooden bat over to the wickets. A bowler for City College, a 21-year-old sophomore named Iqbal Mahamud, took a running start and hurled a fast pitch. Mr. Shah missed the ball, but so did City College's wicket-keeper, so Brooklyn scored a run. Then Mr. Shah smacked the next bowled ball out of the field on one bounce. It was worth 4 points, and a championship of sorts for Brooklyn."}, {"text": "Spread of Flu Across Asia Laid to Birds That Migrate\n2004-01-27T05:00:00.000Z\nTucked among broad-leafed banana groves and emerald rice paddies in west-central Thailand, the bird sanctuary here is one of the few jungled oases where migratory ducks, storks and other wildfowl can spend their winters in safety. They come from as far as India and Siberia.\nAs the sun began to set Monday evening, dozens of yard-high white storks with black-bordered wings roosted in the palm trees at one edge of the park.\nBut the sanctuary is a quieter place these days. Many of the birds have been dying of what Thai scientists suspect is bird flu, as the disease races across Asia.\n''Migratory birds are what carry the disease'' said Bob Dietz, a spokesman for the World Health Organization. ''If they're dying, it's an awfully strong disease.''\nAs they try to track the disease to try to stem its spread to humans, officials of the health organization say migratory birds like the ones here have probably played a central role in spreading the disease. Their infected droppings dry up, turn to dust and are inhaled by other birds.\nWhile chickens and other domesticated fowl succumb easily to avian influenza, migratory birds are hardier and can be infected for long periods and travel great distances while showing few ill effects. The wildfowl deaths here appear to be another ominous sign of the virulence of the epidemic that scientists now fear.\nPakistan announced Monday that chickens there had been infected with a mild strain of bird flu. [An official from Laos said Tuesday that an unknown strain had killed chickens there, news agencies reported.] Chickens have reportedly been dying from a mysterious illness in Myanmar -- formerly Burma -- Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia.\nSouth Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia have previously confirmed cases of the deadly type A influenza virus strain H5N1, while Taiwan and Pakistan have reported different, milder strains.\nThailand announced Monday that it had a third confirmed human case of bird flu, and that it suspected that 10 more people, five of whom have already died, had avian influenza. Cambodia said two children were suspected to have the disease, while Vietnam is investigating more than a dozen possible human cases and there have been reports of a mysterious viral outbreak in Bangladesh.\nThe medically documented cases so far appear to have resulted from birds infecting people, but the real fear is that the disease might evolve into a form that can pass easily from person to person, said Dr. Bjorn Melgaard, the W.H.O.'s chief representative here.\nWorkers in most of the countries with confirmed outbreaks are culling millions of chickens in the hope of stopping the outbreak. But with so many countries reporting cases, and with migratory birds and possibly chicken traders carrying the disease ever farther, United Nations officials have been warning that it will not be easy to curb.\nDr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, Hong Kong's secretary of health, welfare and food, said he had asked officials to step up their testing of migratory birds there.\nEnvironmentalists here warned against trying to cull wild birds or eliminate their habitats, saying that it would not be possible to cull enough wild birds to stamp out the disease, but that a cull could endanger populations of rare species.\nThe outbreak scares health officials because if a person with human influenza becomes infected with the avian version, the viruses may swap genetic material, possibly producing a virus that could be easily transmitted from person to person, with few having a natural immunity.\nThe big mystery remains where the migratory birds became infected. Although China denies having had any bird flu cases, many signs point to southern China, where there have been periodic reports in recent weeks of large-scale deaths of ducks.\nTwo Hong Kong residents who visited their ancestral hometown in southern China early last year fell ill with avian influenza on their return, and six of the 14 countries bordering China or just off its shores have reported bird flu. Farmers in Thailand and Vietnam have described seeing the first cases in late October and in November, consistent with the arrival of migratory birds."}, {"text": "Ideas & Trends: Staving Off Starvation; When Real Food Isn't an Option\n2004-05-23T05:00:00.000Z\nALL the mukhet bushes near the refugee camps in eastern Chad have been picked clean, the World Food Program warns in its latest appeal on behalf of more than 100,000 Sudanese who have fled fighting in their country and now face starvation. Mukhet berries are poisonous, and must be soaked for days to leach toxins out. After drying, they are ground up, but the flour has little nutritive value.\nIn Haiti's slums, round swirls of dough can be found baking in the sun. They look almost appetizing until you learn the ingredients: butter, salt, water and dirt.\nIn a world where the rich spend millions on ways to avoid carbohydrates and the United Nations declares obesity a global health threat, the cruel reality is that far more people struggle each day just to get enough calories.\nIn Malawi, children stand on the roadsides selling skewers of roasted mice.\nIn Mozambique, when grasshoppers eat the crops, people turn the tables and eat them, calling the fishy-tasting bugs ''flying shrimp.''\nIn Liberia during the 1989 civil war, every animal in the national zoo was devoured but a one-eyed lion. Dogs and cats disappeared from the streets of the capital.\nBut all that is, at least, fresh protein. During the siege of Kuito, Angola, in the early 1990's, Carlos Sicato, a World Food Program worker, described a man producing an old chair and promising his family, ''If we don't die today, we can survive for four more.'' He soaked its leather for 15 hours to soften it and remove the tanning chemicals. Then, with boiling water, he made ''lamb soup.''\nAnne-Sophie Fournier, director of the American branch of Action Against Hunger, said she had read that the victims of the Soviet famines of the 1930's ate furniture, too. The scene in ''Gold Rush'' in which Charlie Chaplin, trapped in a Yukon cabin, ate his shoe (actually made of licorice) was not entirely fanciful.\nStarvation brings out what professional famine fighters call ''coping mechanisms.''\nThe simplest is such a truism that it seems absurd: When there is little food, people eat less.\nEritrean women strap flat stones to their stomachs to lessen the pangs. Mothers in many countries have been known to boil water with stones and tell the children that the food is almost ready, hoping they will fall asleep waiting.\nNot eating is actually effective, famine experts say, at least for a short while. Farmers living on the edge know that if they can ration what's left and hold out a bit longer, the rains may come. Or United Nations trucks full of high-protein biscuits or corn-soya porridge might.\n''We know from hunger strikes that in a controlled environment, people can live for 40 days without food,'' said Patrick Webb, chief of nutrition for the United Nations World Food Program. ''But a famine situation is clearly not a controlled environment.''\nSince 1500, economic historians argue, no famine has been caused solely by a lack of food. Drought may wipe out the crop, but some political force always stops help from arriving: British indifference during the Irish potato famine, the Maoist crushing of peasant farmers in the Great Leap Forward, clan warfare closing Somali ports. No democracy with a free press -- even including post-independence India -- has ever suffered mass starvation. If North Koreans are occasionally eating each other, as has been rumored for years, it is because the government refuses to admit how desperate its citizens are, and to give aid agencies an unfettered right to find and feed them.\nFood shortages often set off strange migrations. In World War II, European urbanites visited farm cousins hoping for food parcels, while in this age of United Nations aid, farmers may rush port cities at the rumor of a ship.\nUntil help can arrive, people cope as their ancestors did. Rural people may be much better at that than city dwellers, who may be quickly forced to eat rats or chop up the palm trees along urban boulevards seeking their edible hearts.\nAn informal survey of World Food Program experts produced many examples of resourcefulness.\nAfricans dig up anthills and termite mounds to sieve out the tiny grains the insects have gathered. Some seeds, however, provoke fatal allergic reactions.\nLike Chad's mukhet bush, wild cassava in tropical regions and baucia Senegalensis in West Africa are poisonous, but can be made edible by pounding and soaking for days.\nIn Bangladesh, a type of lentil known to slowly destroy the nervous system is eaten when people are hungry enough.\nMarula fruit is so tasty that elephants knock trees down to get at it, but in battered Zimbabwe, once the fruit is gone people may be reduced to eating the tough seeds by cracking them with rocks and fishing out tiny kernels with a pin.\nPlants with very little nutritional value are eaten, like seaweed, tree bark and grass in North Korea or corn stalks in Africa.\nPlants that are hard to harvest, like cactus (because of thorns) or water hyacinths (because of crocodiles), become worth the risk.\nThe skins and bones of dead animals that even vultures are finished with may be boiled for soup.\nThe danger of all these substitutes is that they can cause diarrhea, which can kill more quickly than starvation, or irritate the gut so much that it has a hard time digesting better food if it does arrive.\nUnder those circumstances, people can ''lose more than they gain from eating,'' Mr. Webb said.\nEven dirt-eating is a coping mechanism that shows its worth when times are tough. The medical name for dirt-eating is pica, and while it is considered a pathology among the well fed, among the poor it can add minerals to a diet that even in good times may only be corn or sorghum mush.\nIn Zambia, balls of edible clay are sold in street markets. In Angola, a dark dirt called ''black salt'' is sprinkled on cold food, but cannot be cooked because it loses its tang.\nAnd the dirt biscuits of Haiti -- called ''argile,'' meaning clay, or ''terre,'' meaning earth -- are not exactly a final cri de coeur against starvation.\nLike the mice in Malawi, they are a staple of the very poor, somewhere between a snack and a desperation measure. Making them has been a regular business for years. The clay is trucked in plastic sacks from Hinche, on the central plateau. Blended with margarine or butter, they are flavored with salt, pepper and bouillon cubes and spooned out by the thousands on cotton sheets in sunny courtyards that are kept swept as ''bakeries.'' They cost about a penny apiece.\n''They're not food, really,'' said David Gonzalez, a reporter at The Times who has visited Haiti many times. ''People with hunger pangs eat them just to fill up their stomachs.''"}, {"text": "Sea Salts With a Special Touch\n2004-09-01T05:00:00.000Z\nMost of the natural sea salts introduced in the last few years have about the same effect on your food. But texture is a factor and can influence the amount you use. The latest exotic salts are from Asia: Bali, Bangladesh and the Himalayas, from ancient marine deposits left in the foothills.\nTwo years ago, Ben and Blair Ripple, American entrepreneurs, started Big Tree Farms, a cottage industry in Bali that employs local families to extract sea salt, right, from the black sand beaches. The coarsest of the grains are actually hollow and shaped like pyramids; they have an almost sweet finish. These salts are sold at Dean & DeLuca in 5-ounce boxes for $6.50 and in 10-ounce coconut shells for $14. Kalustyan's has Bay of Bengal sea salt, which is coarse, rustically uneven and a bargain at $8 a pound. Himalania is a sharp-tasting pink salt from the Himalayas, finely milled in France, packed with a wooden spoon in 8.75-ounce boxes and sold at Grace's Marketplace, $11, and Sur la Table, $11.95.\nCoffee Straight and Strong, or With an Eye-Opener\n Trudging around TriBeCa one steamy day, I wandered into Mocca Espresso Lounge, a bright, comfortable oasis at 78-82 Reade Street (Church Street). I ordered an iced double espresso, unaware that it was a house specialty. Out came a generous martini glass brimming with intense coffee, ice cold from being shaken like a cocktail, but served without ice, which would dilute it. Three coffee beans floated on top. The bar also whips up alcoholic espresso martinis among a collection of cocktails, including raspberry mojitos. The owners, Ori Raz and Shay Zohar, are in the coffee business in Israel. Mocca, which opens at 6 a.m. on weekdays and 7:30 on weekends and closes late at night, also serves well-made pastries, salads and sandwiches.\nFor Yesterday's Children, Too\n \"Look and Cook\" calls itself \"A Cookbook for Children,\" but with illustrations that could have come from children's books of the 1940's and 50's, it is no doubt meant to appeal to adults, too. The book's author and illustrator, Tina Davis, presents classic recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner, like macaroni and cheese, French toast, mashed potatoes and chocolate pudding. The book, published by Stewart, Tabori & Chang ($19.95) also gives kitchen safety tips, covers measurements and ends with instructions on setting a table.\nRelishes That Cut the Mustard\nFor the hot dogs and hamburgers at your Labor Day cookout, there are some unusual condiments made in South Africa. So!Go Relish (subtitled fruit chutney) is a bright sweet-and-sour mixture that throws off a touch of heat. Sweet Chili, above right, has more serious Sichuan leanings, and Catch'Up tomato sauce, in the rear, is earthier than Heinz's. The cute seven-ounce frosted bottles are convenient enough to take on a picnic, which might even make sense for the company's olive oil and soy sauce. Prices are $6.29 to $6.99 at Grace's Marketplace, Garden of Eden and Zabar's.\nOff the Menu\n BOBBY FLAY has changed his mind. Instead of opening a Latin-theme restaurant in the Judson Grill space at 152 West 52nd Street, he plans to put a brasserie there called BAR AMERICAIN. With DAVID ROCKWELL doing the design, Mr. Flay has started working on regional American dishes like slow-smoked pork chops with green onion grits, and cedar-roasted wild king salmon with a sauce of Oregon pinot noir. \"I decided that Latin was too limiting,\" he said. \"I've traveled all over America, and I really know the food well.\"\nPACE, 121 Hudson Street (North Moore Street), is the latest addition to the restaurant collection of JIMMY BRADLEY and DANNY ABRAMS, the owners of Red Cat, the Harrison and Mermaid Inn. JOEY CAMPANARO, formerly at the Harrison, is cooking hearty Italian fare, served on a 40-seat terrace and in a 118-seat dining room given the patina of age by JIM WALROD. The name (pronounced PAH-chay) means peace.\nIL MULINO has opened an outpost at 1042 Northern Boulevard in Roslyn Estates on Long Island. Copious plates of food like those at the Greenwich Village original are on the menu.\nFrom 5 to 8 p.m., the lights dim in the bakery-cafe section of BAZZINI, a food store at 339 Greenwich Street (Jay Street), and it becomes ROSOLARE, a restaurant offering pastas, salads and such, mostly under $10. MICHAEL NOVARRO is at the stove. Wine is bring-your-own, with a $5 corkage fee."}, {"text": "Asian Maids Often Find Abuse, Not Riches, Abroad\n2004-06-22T05:00:00.000Z\nFor Nirmala Bonat, whose home was a dirt-floor shack lit by kerosene lamp, the offer to work abroad was irresistible. As a live-in maid, she would earn far more than the $15 a month she got as a waitress. She would be able to send money to help her family.\nThe dream quickly evaporated. Like many poor women who are dispatched by government-licensed agencies as household help for the growing middle class in the Middle East and the rest of Asia, Ms. Bonat, 19, was severely abused.\nMs. Bonat, who was employed by a couple in Kuala Lumpur, said that the wife repeatedly pressed a hot iron against her back and breasts and beat her on the face. The couple's modern 25th-floor condominium in the Malaysian capital was a world removed from Ms. Bonat's rough-hewn village.\nA shy Ms. Bonat, her skin still sensitive from the burns, said during an interview at the Indonesian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur that she was mentally abused as well.\n''I was only allowed to open the door to throw out the rubbish,'' she said.\nMs. Bonat's treatment drew widespread attention when she was found in a crumpled heap, weeping and bleeding, in the hallway of the apartment building last month.\nThe case illuminated the dark side of a profitable international industry, supposedly government-regulated, that involves the export of women from poor countries -- chiefly Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India -- for these household jobs.\nAn annual State Department report, ''Trafficking in Persons,'' recently released by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, details many kinds of abuses, from sex tourism to conscription of children to serve as soldiers. Maids are an often-forgotten aspect of the vast problem. Some were found to have been kept in bondage in the apartments where they worked, the report said, and were forced to keep work routines tantamount to slavery.\nSome people involved in the business here do not disagree.\nAgustina Endang, the director of the Agesa Asa Jay recruitment agency, which sends Indonesian women to Kuwait, said, ''Some employers think they are buying the housemaid so they have the right to work the housemaid as a slave.'' If the maid, usually an ill-educated village woman, is unable to meet the employer's expectations, then the employer beats her, Ms. Endang said.\nThe export of women for domestic service has grown dramatically since the Asian financial crisis in 1997 severely affected some countries in the region like Indonesia.\nAs the supply of labor has increased, demand has grown in Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and Asian countries that were less affected by the crisis, like Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, where middle class families can afford to have cheap domestic help to iron clothes, do laundry, cook and clean, as well as wash the several cars that might be sitting in the garage.\nThe Philippine government, which increasingly depends on the $7 billion in remittances that come from overseas workers, has negotiated agreements with foreign governments that require that maids be given a day off per week. Hong Kong has also sought to regulate the treatment of women who are recruited to work abroad, but most other governments have done little in this regard.\nIn Malaysia, a relatively small country of 23 million people, 160,000 Indonesian maids were registered last year, compared with 585 in 1991. Another 100,000 were probably working in Malaysia illegally, according to Indonesia's Commission on Violence Against Women.\nSaudi Arabia has the largest number of Indonesian maids -- about 200,000, according to the Indonesian government -- even though terrible abuses are reported there every year.\nThe connection between maid and employer is made by commercial recruitment agencies, which often operate out of the public eye.\nAbout 400 agencies, ranging from businesses with training facilities to single people with cellphones, are registered with the Indonesian government's Agency of Manpower and Transmigration.\nThe agencies often maintain close connections to local government officials in Indonesia, who share in the money the agencies receive from the overseas buyers of labor, according to the Southeast Asia Research Center at City University of Hong Kong.\nRecruitment agencies rarely advertise. Instead, they send recruiters into villages where many of the women, like Ms. Bonat, are barely literate. Ms. Bonat said a man named Henry enticed her to work abroad, saying she could earn $100 a month. Experts agree that the agencies sometimes force the women into debt by charging high fees to obtain passports and to administer government-mandated medical, psychological and work tests.\nThe agencies often fail to tell their recruits that they will not be paid for their first months on the job, as part of an arrangement that is supposed to allow recruitment agencies to cover costs like air fare.\nOnce they are inside the foreign home, the maids are often not paid at all.\nAfter eight months with the Kuala Lumpur family, Ms. Bonat -- who comes from West Timor, one of Indonesia's poorest and most remote provinces -- had not received any pay, said officials at the Indonesian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.\n''The interests of the recruitment agencies and the government take priority over the workers,'' said Ruth Rothenberg, a former director of the International Catholic Migration Commission, who investigated the trafficking of women and children in Indonesia. ''It's as if it is O.K. for the women to make a pittance while everyone else makes a fortune off them.''\nSome recruits never become maids but are sent to brothels instead. Those who become maids are vulnerable to sexual harassment or worse. In Saudi Arabia, scores of rapes of Indonesian maids have been reported since the mid-1990's.\nMaids who are employed by couples are often forced by the wives to crop their hair and to not wear makeup so they will be less attractive to the husbands, said Ivy N. Josiah, the executive director of the Women's Aid Organization in Malaysia.\nMakhrivatun Yusrodi, 19, a pretty woman from Java in Indonesia, who is being sheltered by Ms. Josiah's group since she reported that she was nearly strangled by her employer, showed a photograph of herself during her time as a maid. She had a bowl haircut, and wore baggy shorts and a T-shirt that disguised her figure.\nSome abused women become desperate. Six Indonesian maids have committed suicide in Saudi Arabia this year, including a young woman who drank a glass of detergent on June 14, according to the Indonesian Embassy in Riyadh. Indonesian maids have committed suicide in Singapore by jumping out of high-rise apartments.\nSome maids manage to flee abusive employers but, bereft of funds and without documents or social networks, they have trouble seeking help or getting home.\nIn Batam, an Indonesian island close to Singapore, a women's group reported recently that every month about 10 maids escape to Batam from Singapore, trying to make their way home. Pimps wait at landing places to try to lure them into prostitution instead.\nThe Indonesian Manpower Ministry requires the agencies to train the women they recruit in such skills as how to use a toaster, a vacuum cleaner or a refrigerator -- appliances that many village women have never seen. But the training is often superficial at best.\nMs. Endang showed a visitor around her agency's training center, a locked compound where about 200 village women were cooped up as they waited, sometimes for three months or more, to be dispatched to Kuwait.\nThey were expected to learn enough rudimentary Arabic so they could answer commands: ''Come here,'' ''Sit down,'' ''Don't go out'' and ''Wait for me,'' said Ms. Endang, reciting the requisite phrases.\nIn a tile-floored room, equipment was demonstrated in a small kitchen. ''Many of the women don't even know how to open a refrigerator door,'' Ms. Endang said.\nFour plump dolls the size of newborn babies were lined up so that the women could practice changing disposable diapers and applying talcum powder, unknown items in many Indonesian villages. There was a demonstration by several maids-to-be on a live baby.\nTapping her high-heeled shoe on the white tiles, Ms. Endang said, ''They haven't seen a floor like this and they have to learn how to clean it.'' As she passed a vanity table, she said, ''Some don't know this is for lipstick and makeup.''\nBut with so many women in the compound and only one small demonstration kitchen, it was not clear how much practice the women got.\nIn the wake of Ms. Bonat's case, the impetus for reform of the domestic maid business has been revived.\nMs. Josiah said she was pushing the Malaysian government to exercise more control over the Malaysian recruitment agencies that are responsible for importing the Indonesian maids.\nShe was pleased, she said, that the new Malaysian government apologized to Ms. Bonat and announced that Yim Pek Ha, the woman who is said to have beaten her, would be quickly brought to trial.\nMs. Josiah said Malaysian employers must be educated so they will not treat Indonesian maids as slaves, ''who are made to eat last'' and are often taunted by being called rude names. In Singapore, at least, employers are given a handbook on proper behavior toward a maid.\nBut, she said, governments also had to make sure that maids are given access to the family telephone or issued mobile phones so they could call for help.\nIn Indonesia, reform appears to be slower. With unemployment high there, the export of women for domestic service abroad helps alleviate problems at home.\nBut Faiza Mardzoeki, a leader of Solidaritas Perempuan, an Indonesian women's rights group, said the government had to start making changes. ''Domestic workers must have the same legal protections as other workers,'' she said."}, {"text": "A Burning Issue for Workers in a Melting Pot\n2004-09-03T05:00:00.000Z\nThey were grabbing a bite at a Ray's Pizza before heading to Madison Square Garden, two women with Republican Convention V.I.P. tags on display, when the talk turned to immigration.\nOne, Diana Rains, a businesswoman and Republican Party official in Manatee County, Fla., acknowledged that she disapproved of a guest worker plan proposed by President Bush. \"I have nothing against immigration,\" she said. \"What I have a problem with is coming illegally and then demanding rights.\"\nJoanne March Souchek, first vice president of Republican Women of Tracy, Calif., countered that her state needs agricultural labor. \"Citizens don't want those jobs,\" she said. \"The illegal aliens do all the work.\"\nA few feet away stood the illegal Ecuadorean immigrant who had cooked, sliced and sold them their $2.90 pieces of pepperoni pizza. Across West 58th Street, at the Essex House, luxury service to match their Central Park views depended on hotel room attendants like Sukai Mahmud of Gambia.\nDownstairs at Ducasse, the four-star French restaurant where they had dined a few nights earlier, Bangladeshi waiters send their elegant uniforms to be laundered, by Mexicans, at the Korean dry cleaner down the block.\nAll around the Republican visitors this week, the complicated reality of immigration was at work, even if they were not always aware of it. As the party adopted a platform supporting a three-year guest worker status for some illegal immigrants and opposing permanent amnesty, the issue burned for immigrants doing the work of a New York welcome, even when they held their tongues.\nOutside Ducasse, Henry Aguilar, a floor captain from Ecuador via Europe, did not mince words in his critique of both parties on immigration.\n\"The Bush policy is a mess,\" said Mr. Aguilar, 34. \"For me, Kerry, he goes to the pool, he puts his feet in, and all of a sudden he pulls his feet out because it's too cold.\"\nThe Democrats oppose the temporary worker program, instead promising \"a path to citizenship\" for those who have worked and paid taxes in the United States for five years, and who pass security screening.\nMr. Aguilar went on to denounce Gov. George E. Pataki for a state crackdown on driver's licenses that affects thousands of immigrant residents. But when asked if he had revealed such sentiments this week to Republican diners who sampled the lobster gazpacho and caviar on Ducasse's $225 tasting menu, Mr. Aguilar looked scandalized. \"I've served three presidents,\" he said.\nMs. Mahmud, the Gambian room attendant at Essex House, also practiced discretion -- up to a point. As she told it, the hotel management distributed campaign-style buttons to the housekeeping staff before the arrival of 300 Republican guests. Despite what looked to her like a Republican logo, and her allegiance to Democrats, she dutifully pinned one on.\n\"Other workers asked me, 'Are you Republican?\"' she recalled. \"I said, 'I'm not Republican, but I want their money.\"'\nBut by Monday, she added, no one on the housekeeping staff was wearing a pin. \"We're international,\" she said. \"Asia, Africa, South America, Russia, China, you name it. We're all members of the union, like family. And that Bush immigration plan, that's a terrible thing.\"\nOne delegate at the Essex House tried hard to engage Nomani Choudhury, a room service waiter, in a political discussion. Mr. Choudhury, 54, a naturalized citizen from Bangladesh with a son serving in the United States Air Force in South Korea, said he chose not to voice his view that the Bush guest worker plan is a ploy that favors the rich, hurts unions like his -- Unite Here -- and exploits workers. But he did not play dead, either.\n\"He was asking me, 'What do you think, is Bush going to win this election?\"' Mr. Choudhury recalled. \"And I said, 'Not in New York.\"'\nDown the block, Sam Kim, 40, the manager of the dry cleaner shop, said both parties were ducking the real issues. A permanent resident born in South Korea, he said he paid $10,000 for the birth of his first child for lack of insurance, and understands why some poor, native-born workers with Medicaid do not want to take a low-paid job without health insurance.\nIf all illegal workers were deported, as hard-liners demand, \"then nobody will want to work 12 hours for little money,\" he said. \"New York City is not going to be working without immigration, but we are working without health insurance, with school problems, and most illegal immigrants are not paying taxes.\"\nAnd on a pizza man's wages of $400 a week, he added, \"Honestly, they can't.\""}, {"text": "Sting Operation Involving Missile Sale Yields 2 Arrests in Albany\n2004-08-05T05:00:00.000Z\n ALBANY, Aug. 5 \u2014 Law enforcement authorities raided a mosque here today and arrested two men, after they were set up in an elaborate sting operation in which they are accused of offering to help launder money made from the sale of a missile to be used in an attack, officials said. \n \"This is not a case where the defendants were discovered plotting terrorist violence,\" James B. Comey, the deputy attorney general, said at a news conference. \"The terrorist plot in this case is one that the government's agent, the cooperating witness, represented to be under way. It was not real.\" \n Mr. Comey said one of the men detained, Mohammed Hoosain, 49, the founder of the mosque, asked the witness cooperating with the authorities for help in securing a state driver's permit and then a loan. \"It was at about this time that the sting began,\" he said at a news conference. \n \"The cooperating witness brought a shoulder-fired missile to a meeting with Mr. Hoosain, and explained that he imports such things and ships them to New York City,\" Mr. Comey continued. \n He said the witness then told Mr. Hoosain that the missile was meant to \"shoot down airplanes\" but that the missile could also be used to attack the Pakistani ambassador in New York to \"retaliate\" for Pakistan's help in the war on terror. \n Mr. Comey said the court documents charge that \"Hoosain agreed to help launder the money.\" He said the other man who was detained, Yassin Aref, the prayer leader of the mosque, was meant to be a witness and guarantor of the transaction. \n \"At various times in the winter of last year and through this summer, Hossain and Aref met with the cooperating witness to receive cash that was represented to come from the missile transaction,\" Mr. Comey said. They received about $40,000 in cash and returned to the witness $25,000 in checks that \"they believed was his money coming from the missile transaction.\" \n The men were arrested on the basis of warrants issued on a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Albany and are being held in custody until a detention hearing early next week. \n Mr. Comey said that there was no real terrorist plot but that the sting and arrests were meant to send a \"disrupting message\" to those who might be plotting. \n Asked if he could explain why legally this is not entrapment, Mr. Comey said, \"Well, I would expect in a case like this, any case involving a sting \u2014 and I've tried some myself \u2014 entrapment is a defense.\" \n He added that Mr. Hoosain had said \"he believed now was not the time for violent jihad\" but that both men thought they were dealing with a \"terrorist facilitator.\" \n He declined to comment on reports that the men had links to a militant group, Ansar al-Islam, that has also been tied to Al Qaeda. \n \"The fact is there are terrorists among us who want to engage in acts to attack us again and to take away our freedom,\" Gov. George E. Pataki said at a separate news conference. Mr. Pataki said he did not believe there was any connection between the arrests and the recently heightened state of alert in New York City. \n Mr. Hossain's wife, Mossamat, said her husband is a businessman, not a terrorist. \"It's totally wrong and totally false and totally a lie,\" she said, quoted by The Associated Press. \n Mr. Hossain, a father of five, came from Bangladesh in 1985. After years of washing dishes and doing other kitchen work, he bought a pizzeria in 1994, according to a profile published this summer by the Times-Union of Albany. \n \"I'm proud to be an American,\" he told the newspaper. \"When I was in high school in Bangladesh, I looked at a map of America and I dreamed of coming to this great land.\" \n Mayor Gerald D. Jennings of Albany said the mosque has been in existence in Albany for about three years. He said police officers had been involved in the investigation into the mosque from the beginning. \n \"We have been working together with federal, state and local officials for an extended period, well over a year, on issues that have been brought to the front here,\" Mr. Jennings said. \"Most of this information comes from the street police officer, the local police officer.\" \n Mr. Jennings said the officials had been watching some residences as well. \n Detective James Miller of the Albany Police Department said the raid against the mosque started about 2 a.m. today. \n He said police officers had carried out the raid along with agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York State Police. At least two men were arrested, Mr. Miller said. \n One official said Mr. Aref, 34, lived at 44 West Street, in Albany. The mosque is located at 278 Central Avenue, about a mile west of the State Capitol building, along a busy commercial stretch of fast-food stores and businesses that sell used CD's and furniture. \n Its windows and front door were covered from the inside with white tape and white blinds. In the top window of the door are the words \"Masjid As-Salam,\" and below it the phrase \"House of Peace.\" \n The mosque is sandwiched between a food market and a discount shop, where Osman Ahmed, 47, who is originally from the Sudan but who has lived in Troy, N.Y., for the past nine years, attended to customers. \n He said he knew very little of what was going on at the mosque. \n \"A lot of people come here for the mosque, for prayer times, like in the afternoons and evenings,\" said Mr. Ahmed, who has worked as a clerk at the store for three months. \"They're nice people.\" \n He said sometimes it is a big crowd. \n \"I just see some people coming for prayer from different areas, from different countries,\" he said. \n Al Baker reported from Albany for this article and Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York City. "}, {"text": "Tension in a Michigan City Over Muslims' Call to Prayer\n2004-05-05T05:00:00.000Z\nTo hear people in this blue-collar city tell it, things were fine until the al-Islah Islamic Center petitioned to broadcast its call to prayer, or azan, over an outdoor loudspeaker.\nMasud Khan, the mosque's secretary, sat on the carpeted floor on Wednesday and reflected on what he had learned about some of his neighbors in the last few months. ''How much they hate us,'' he said softly.\nJackie Rutherford, a librarian and youth-care worker, sat on her front stoop watching three men in Islamic shirt-dresses and tupi caps at the house across the street. ''I don't know what's going to happen to our little town,'' said Ms. Rutherford, 39.\n''I used to say I wasn't prejudiced against anyone, but then I realized I had a problem with them putting Allah above everyone else,'' she said, of the plan to amplify the call to prayer, which mosques announce five times a day. ''It's throwing salt in a wound. I feel they've come to our country, infiltrated it, and they sit there looking at us, laughing, calling us fools.''\nFor the population of Hamtramck, a city of 23,000 surrounded by Detroit, the battle of the loudspeaker, which the City Council approved on Tuesday, has revealed a crossfire of religious, ethnic and lifestyle grievances, aggravated by the lingering memories of Sept. 11, 2001, which left many Muslims here feeling they were under suspicion.\nOnce an enclave of Polish immigrants, Hamtramck has since the 1990's become a haven for immigrants from Bangladesh, Yemen, Pakistan, Bosnia and other countries, including a large Muslim population. In the 2000 census, 41 percent of the city's population was born outside the United States.\nOn spring afternoons the sidewalks of Joseph Campau Avenue echo snatches of Polish, Bengali, Arabic and hip hop, punctuated by the sound of bells from several Catholic churches. Three mosques have opened in the last few years, increasing in size while the congregations at neighboring Roman Catholic churches dwindle.\nYet for all this churn, the ethnic populations coexisted with little overt friction.\n''Even after 9/11 we had no problems,'' said Abdul Motlib, the president of the al-Islah mosque, which serves a mostly Bangladeshi membership (the other two mosques are primarily Bosnian or Yemeni).\nThen last year Mr. Motlib applied for approval to amplify the call to prayer, a sonorous invocation in Arabic that lasts up to two minutes.\nFor some longtime residents, like Joanne Golen, 68, who described herself as a born-again Christian, the request crossed a line. Mrs. Golen said she had always gotten along well with the Bangladeshi families in her neighborhood. She noted that at Easter one of her new neighbors brought her a turkey that he had gotten at work. But she said the call to prayer was too much.\n''My main objection is simple,'' she said. ''I don't want to be told that Allah is the true and only God five times a day, 365 days a year. It's against my constitutional rights to have to listen to another religion evangelize in my ear.''\nAt City Hall on Tuesday, before the final vote on the loudspeaker, a crowd of more than 100 crammed into a room, with dozens more listening or arguing in the hallway outside.\nChuck Schultz, 49, a computer programmer from nearby Grosse Point, spoke against the measure.\n''Everyone talks about their rights,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''The rights of Christians have been stripped from them. Last week there were Muslims praying downstairs, in a public building. If Christians tried to do that, the A.C.L.U. would shut us down.''\nSome residents complained about the potential noise. Others, like Veronica Wojtowicz, 81, reminded neighbors of a time when life in Hamtramck was simpler.\n''My parents came to this country and worked hard,'' Ms. Wojtowicz said. ''I think the grace belongs on the other side. The intolerance doesn't come from the people who object, it comes from the other side. We all lived in peace and had no problems. You moved too fast.''\nIn response, Abdul Latef, the imam at Masjid Al-Falah, a mosque in Detroit, asked the community to be patient.\n''You can make history,'' Mr. Al-Falah said. ''This is part of our religion. If it is too noisy, then you can complain, and they will stop it forever.''\nCouncil members emphasized that there was nothing technically preventing the mosque from amplifying its call to prayer, even without amending the city's noise ordinance, and compared the amplification to the chiming of church bells. The amendment just gave government officials leverage to limit the volume and hours of the broadcasts, said Councilman Scott Klein.\nMr. Motlib said the mosque applied for approval ''because we want to be good neighbors.''\nParadoxically, the call to prayer is one that even most of the Muslims at al-Islah mosque cannot understand, because they speak Bengali rather than Arabic, Mr. Khan said.\nYet for many Muslims in town, the dispute seemed less about noise or the content of the azan than about insecurities of an older immigrant population feeling threatened by a newer one.\n''They see we are coming more and more, and they think we are taking their city,'' said Abusayed Mahfuz, 34, the editor of Bangla Amar, a local Bengali magazine and Web site. ''It's not really a religious problem. It's about migration, which is a reality.''\nMr. Musad, who moved to Hamtramck from New York in 1999, said he understood the insecurity.\n''It's human nature,'' he said. ''You feel an invasion. It could happen to me also.''\nLike others in his mosque, Mr. Musad said, he was drawn to the Muslim community here not for its engagement with the rest of America, but for its distance.\n''What attracted me was seeing school girls with veils and burkhas,'' he said. ''It's more authentic here than in New York, more roots. There's village life.''\nHis regret was that Muslims were not even more isolated from the other cultures around them. ''Parents feel they need to force their kids to follow their religion, or they're going to lose their kids,'' Mr. Musad said.\nAnd for the Polish community of Hamtramck, the clash of immigrant cultures was nothing new, said Greg Kowalski, chairman of the town historical commission. When the first waves of Polish immigrants began to outnumber their German-American predecessors after World War I, the fissures were even more profound, he said.\n''The Germans looked at these Eastern Europeans and thought they were all communists,'' Mr. Kowalski said. ''There was a lot of fear. So we're really repeating history.''\nOpponents of the City Council decision on the loudspeaker said they would try to reverse it, either through the courts or by a voter referendum. Unless they are successful, the mosque is expected to begin broadcasting the call to prayer in a couple of weeks. Several mosques in Detroit and nearby Dearborn already use loudspeakers, without incident.\nBashar Imam, a Muslim who runs three medical centers in Hamtramck, smarted at the venom the conflict had brought out.\n''These people get treated in my medical clinics, and that's what they think of us?'' Mr. Imam said.\nBut he added, ''This is healthy. This is how we get to know each other.''"}, {"text": "In the Line of Fire\n2004-08-04T05:00:00.000Z\nAt some point, the killing has to stop or effective humanitarian relief work as we know it today will never be the same. Relief workers are being murdered at an alarming rate because of a perceived lack of neutrality, because they are regarded as extensions of a donor nation's political and military agendas.\nOn the eve of the anniversary of the bombing of the United Nations compound in Baghdad, which killed 22 relief workers, it is disturbing to note that civilian humanitarian workers as never before have become fair game because their fiercely held neutrality -- long enshrined in international law -- is no longer taken seriously. Since then, nine aid workers of the United States Agency for International Development have been killed in the Darfur region of Sudan. Returning Taliban assassinated five relief workers of the unquestionably neutral Doctors Without Borders in Afghanistan in June. A Taliban spokesman said they were killed because they were considered spies for the United States.\nHere in Amsterdam, headquarters of Doctors Without Borders/Holland, the murders of its staff members in Afghanistan were a shock. Few agencies hold their neutrality more inviolate. The killings, and the Afghan government's failure to arrest the perpetrators, were too much. Kenny Gluck, operations director of Doctors Without Borders, announced last week that the organization was pulling out of Afghanistan after 24 years of service, after saving countless lives during what had been considered the worst of times -- during Soviet oppression and Taliban restrictions. Mr. Gluck said he made his decision in part because of the United States military's use of humanitarian aid for ''political and military motives.'' American officials have rejected the charge that mixing military and relief activity would endanger aid workers.\nBefore the killing of his colleagues, Mr. Gluck, an American, had expressed concern that the neutrality of all relief workers employed by nongovernmental organizations in the post- Sept. 11 world was being compromised: ''The Americans are pretending that NGO's are with them fighting the war against terror, and they are not. That puts them in danger. We want to be relevant medically and irrelevant militarily and politically.'' He himself was held hostage for more than three weeks in a moldy root cellar in Chechnya because, in part, his kidnappers questioned his group's impartiality.\nNeutrality has never been far from the surface in relief work. When I was worked for the United Nations World Food Program in Somalia, we distributed 50-kilogram sacks of grain emblazoned with the American flag and ''Gift of the People of the United States of America.'' Somalis readily accepted the aid but it was clear that our professed neutrality was suspect.\nJames Morris, director of the World Food Program, explained, ''It is important to see who cares about them, to know the genuine goodness of the United States.'' But at what point does the American gift to the needy in a war zone become a political weapon in the battle of influence, in the war of winning hearts and minds?\nMr. Morris told me that President Bush has told him that the United States ''will never use food as a political weapon.'' Other friends of the president seem to differ -- to the horror of relief workers who increasingly are targets of those who think otherwise.\nThe demand on relief agencies to shed that protective cloak of neutrality -- despite the dangers to those in the field -- has never been more aggressive than it is today. Secretary of State Colin Powell, addressing nongovernmental organizations in 2001, spelled out a revised policy on relief work: that ''just as surely as our diplomats and military, American NGO's s are out there serving and sacrificing on the front lines of freedom NGO's are such a force multiplier for us, such an important part of our combat team.'' Those remarks sent shock waves through the relief community, which would rather not be part of the combat team in the war on terrorism.\nMore recently, Secretary Powell's words were supported in a speech by Andrew S. Natsios, administrator of Usaid, the world's most generous food aid donor. At the Interaction Forum last year, he told relief groups that if they received American financing, they were ''an arm of the U.S. government.''If aid organizations did not show a stronger link to American foreign policy he threatened, according to the forum, to tear up their contracts and find new partners.\nRelief agencies today are desperately scratching for donations and workers to deal with the disasters unfolding in Darfur and in Bangladesh. Unless the United States, the key donor nation, publicly espouses the position that relief work is neutral, and unless the Bush administration makes it clear that those saving lives in the field do not follow a donor nation's political and military policies, other sources of donations might dry up. Nations that frequently augment American contributions may understandably be reluctant to donate the billions of dollars and personnel needed for humanitarian efforts. And more civilian relief workers are going to get killed in their service to humanity."}, {"text": "Keeping the Faith as the Meter Runs; Even Muslims on the Move Stop at Prayer Time\n2004-05-28T05:00:00.000Z\nYou drive a cab, wafted across the city on the whims of your fares. But you are Muslim, and must pray five times a day -- which involves ablutions, facing east and a series of prostrations in submission to God.\nWhat to do?\nWith the age-old ingenuity of immigrants adapting to a new world, Muslim cabbies in New York -- by one estimate, half of the city's 40,000 taxi drivers -- have devised a jury-rigged system.\nThe drivers congregate in South Asian restaurants that provide prayer space in basements or back rooms. They have an imprint of the city's mosques in their brains, at the ready wherever a fare may take them as prayer time closes in. Using a small carpet kept in the trunk, they pray in the back seat, or even on the side of the road.\n''Wherever we be, in the city, there is a place to pray,'' said Amar Abdemula, 42, a Sudanese cabdriver who lives in Flatbush.\nKeeping the faith, however, is not always easy for these men. (And that's pretty much who they are, given the profession.) The biggest obstacles are parking, timing and cleanliness. Muslims are required to wash before praying, and the place itself must be clean. The ritual generally lasts 10 to 45 minutes, depending on the circumstances.\nSome drivers say the threat of bias attacks after Sept. 11 has made them too fearful to prostrate themselves in the streets, but not Mr. Abdemula. ''I pray any place, because protection is from God,'' he said.\nMr. Abdemula spoke at La Guardia Airport. He was one of a steady stream of South Asian, Arab and African men who made their way to a nook beneath an overpass near the Delta Airlines terminal that has become an informal prayer space.\nA large cheap rug lay over a bed of ornamental mulch. The men first washed in a restroom at the arrivals terminal. They then unrolled tiny carpets over the rug, took off their shoes and faced east toward Mecca to pray as planes roared overhead and traffic whooshed by. A tuft of pine trees hid them from the road. In front of their bending bodies was a chain link fence and then a sea of yellow cabs waiting their turn to approach the taxi stand. The cabbies prayed quickly so they could reach their taxis before it was their time to move ahead in line.\nThe cabbie prayer strategies are a prime example of how outsiders trace new religious pathways in a city burbling with the world's faiths, sociologists of religion say.\n''You're also bringing religion into the daily warp and woof of American religious life in a new way,'' said Courtney Bender, an assistant professor of religion at Columbia University who has studied the drivers. ''It makes American daily life more religious.''\nShe estimates that roughly half of the city's cabdrivers are Muslim, based on the large number of mainly Muslim Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, as well as many Muslim Indians and drivers from Africa and the Middle East.\nGenerally, prayers take place shortly before dawn, at midday, in the late afternoon, in the evening and before bed. Cabbies working 12-hour shifts are bound to span several of the prayer times.\nSometimes it boils down to a choice between prayers or fares. Mr. Abdemula said if he is near a mosque where parking is difficult, he will put on his off-duty sign and forsake business well before the hour of midday prayer.\nIbrahim Khan, 24, who arrived in the United States from Pakistan three years ago, lucked into a parking place one Friday near New York's main mosque, the Islamic Cultural Center of New York at 96th Street and Third Avenue. A woman heading for La Guardia had hailed him at 65th Street and First Avenue, but he turned her down. ''I said I can't go because it was my prayer time,'' he said. ''She said, 'O.K., I'm sorry.' I said it's O.K.'' The loss of the $35 was a big chunk out of the $150 to $200 Mr. Khan said he earns in a day.\n''If God wants to give you passengers or money, he'll give you,'' he said. ''If you do for God, you have to believe that God is going to do for you. He's watching everything.''\nMany cabdrivers go to the 96th Street mosque for midday prayers on Friday, Islam's holy day, when it is important to pray in a group. Until recently, several cabdrivers and mosque officials said, the police would turn a blind eye to double-parked taxis. But that has changed, and the tickets are flowing, they said. The mosque provides forms stating that drivers were present for prayer services, for use in traffic court. Police officials say that there have been more complaints from neighbors because of an increase in attendance on Fridays but that they have not been giving out any more tickets.\nAlong with city's smaller neighborhood mosques, restaurants are a major prayer destination. Several are on or near Lexington Avenue in the 20's, a patch of South Asian businesses with a long yellow oasis -- a taxi stand.\nThe Shipa Kasturi Pavilion on Lexington and 26th Street is a bare, fluorescent-lit Bangladeshi restaurant with dirty linoleum and garish pictures of horses and a city skyline on the wall.\nDrivers go to the counter, get a key, unlock a side door and descend a narrow wooden staircase. A larger freezer, sacks of onions and rice, boxes of potatoes and gas meters crowd the already claustrophobic space. A clean, green-carpeted empty room is reached through a door, where the drivers pray.\nOne, Mohammad Manzur Alam, said he had appealed to the owner's sense of duty as a Muslim and talked him into providing the room, soap and a basin to wash in. Drivers chipped in for the renovation of the room and the carpet. But the street runs two ways: many restaurants benefit by providing the space because it ensures customers.\nOn this day in May, Mr. Alam had gathered a few of his fellow Bangladeshi drivers through cellphone calls. It is better to pray together, he said. After ablutions and prostrations, they ate upstairs in the restaurant, for a full cultural experience of faith, food and language.\n''We can do two necessary things together: lunch and prayer,'' Mr. Alam said.\nMr. Alam said he was also campaigning for a shed at Kennedy International Airport, where he said drivers pray in the middle of a lot, but had yet to receive support from the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Commission officials said they knew of no such request and referred the matter to the Port Authority because it was the agency's jurisdiction. The Port Authority said it had not received a formal request but would consider the idea.\nOther restaurants in Manhattan with prayer space include Sheezan, on Church Street in TriBeCa, and the Dhaka Restaurant on 31st Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues. When a visitor asked about prayers at Dhaka, the counterman led the way to a closet and produced a carpet for worshipers to use in the back of the restaurant. He said many drivers come in the evening after their shift. At Niamat Kada, on Lexington Avenue and 28th Street, there was only space for two or three worshipers in the basement.\nThe South Asian restaurant ''becomes sort of like a community center, like so many things in New York does,'' said Tony Carnes, a sociologist of religion and co-editor of the just-released ''Asian American Religions: The Making and Remaking of Borders and Boundaries'' (New York University Press), which includes an article on the drivers written by Professor Bender and a student.\n''What's unique about it is creating ritual purity in a place that may be an impure place,'' Mr. Carnes said, referring to a restaurant's association with heavy traffic, trash and restrooms. ''They see it as a place of order and of invitation and of relaxation.''"}, {"text": "Put Your Money Where Their Mouths Are\n2004-04-03T05:00:00.000Z\nWith Democrats on the warpath over trade, there's pressure for tougher international labor standards that would try to put Abakr Adoud out of work.\nAbakr lives with his family in the desert near this oasis in eastern Chad. He has never been to school and roams the desert all day with his brothers, searching for sticks that can be made into doors for mud huts. He is 10 years old.\nIt's appalling that Abakr, like tens of millions of other children abroad, is working instead of attending school. But prohibiting child labor wouldn't do him any good, for there's no school in the area for him to attend. If child labor hawks manage to keep Abakr from working, without giving him a school to attend, he and his family will simply be poorer than ever.\nAnd that's the problem when Americans get on their high horses about child labor, without understanding the cruel third world economics that cause it. The push by Democrats like John Kerry for international labor standards is well intentioned, but it is also oblivious to third world realities.\nLook, I feel like Scrooge when I speak out against bans on sweatshops or on child labor. In the West, it's hard to find anyone outside a university economics department who agrees with me. But the basic Western attitude -- particularly among Democrats and warm-and-fuzzy humanitarians -- sometimes ends up making things worse. Consider the results of two major American efforts to ban imports produced by child labor:\nIn 1993, when Congress proposed the U.S. Child Labor Deterrence Act, which would have blocked imports made by children (if it had passed), garment factories in Bangladesh fired 50,000 children. Many ended up in worse jobs, like prostitution.\nThen there was the hue and cry beginning in 1996 against soccer balls stitched by children in their homes (mostly after school) in Sialkot, Pakistan. As a result, the balls are now stitched by adults, often in factories under international monitoring.\nBut many women are worse off. Conservative Pakistanis believe that women shouldn't work outside the home, so stitching soccer balls is now off limits for many of them. Moreover, bad publicity about Pakistan led China to grab market share with machine-stitched balls: over the next two years, Pakistan's share of the U.S. soccer ball market dropped to 45 percent from 65 percent.\nSo poor Pakistani families who depended on earnings from women or children who stitched soccer balls are now further impoverished.\nI'm not arguing that child labor is a good thing. It isn't. But as Jagdish Bhagwati, the eminent trade economist, notes in his new book, ''In Defense of Globalization,'' thundering against child labor doesn't address the poverty that causes it.\nIn the village of Toukoultoukouli in Chad, I visited the 17 girls and 31 boys in the two-room school. Many children, especially girls, never attend school, which ends after the fourth grade.\nSo a 12-year-old boy working in Toukoultoukouli has gotten all the education he can. Instead of keeping him from working, Westerners should channel their indignation into getting all children into school for at least those four years -- and there is one way that could perhaps be achieved.\nIt's bribery. The U.N. World Food Program runs a model foreign aid effort called the school feeding program. It offers free meals to children in poor schools (and an extra bribe of grain for girl students to take home to their families). Almost everywhere, providing food raises school attendance, particularly for girls. ''If there were meals here, parents would send their kids,'' said Muhammad Adam, a teacher in Toukoultoukouli.\nSchool feeding costs just 19 cents per day per child.\nSo here's my challenge to university students: Instead of spending your energy boycotting Nike or pressing for barriers against child labor, why not sponsor school meals in places like Toukoultoukouli?\nI spoke with officials at the World Food Program, and they'd be thrilled to have private groups or individuals help sponsor school feedings. (See www.nytimes.com/kristofresponds for details.) Children in Africa will be much better off with a hot meal and an education than with your self-righteous indignation."}, {"text": "Spend $150 Billion Per Year to Cure World Poverty\n2004-11-07T05:00:00.000Z\nJeffrey Sachs is standing on a dusty brown hillside in Nazareth. Not the Nazareth of biblical renown, but the Nazareth of ancient Abyssinia, now Ethiopia, one of the poorest and most godforsaken places in the world.\nSurrounded by skinny, dirt-caked children, Sachs looks awkward in a navy blazer, white dress shirt and tan slacks. Balanced carefully on a rock, he stands in brown loafers that offer just enough traction to keep him from sliding into the mounds of dirt that surround him. Although Sachs's eyelids droop, he seems to be listening intently. His brow furrows, he nods, he cups his chin as if deep in thought.\nAn ash-colored woman with a creased face is mumbling in Amharic, Ethiopia's main language, pointing with a broken stick to rows of trenches, shrubs and stones. A translator offers a muddled explanation.\nWhen the presentation is over, the odd mix of about 20 Ethiopian peasants, international aid workers and Columbia University academics respectfully applauds and starts back down the hill. Sachs scrambles after Lee Bollinger, Columbia's president and Sachs's boss. Blond and tanned, in jeans and sneakers, Bollinger shakes his head, looking perplexed.\n\"It's their G.I.S.,\" says Sachs without hesitation -- as in Geographical Information System, a sort of computerized 3-D map. \"She's showing how the community uses trees and builds terraces in the hills to stabilize the land and prevent soil erosion.\"\nThough Sachs has been in the countryside for less than half an hour, it takes him just minutes to place this scene in the larger story he has come to tell. \"Right now, these are just survival mechanisms,\" he says, referring to the puppet-size project. \"But small things on this scale get washed away. It's like giving subtherapeutic levels of drugs to a dying patient.\" He steps around the dried cow dung that litters the path toward the row of waiting Toyota Land Cruisers. A small boy in sweatpants lingering by the dirt road looks up at Sachs curiously, then stretches out a tiny cupped hand. Sachs looks over at me. \"We need something much bigger,\" he says.\nSachs is nothing if not a big thinker. And in July, the renowned macroeconomist and special adviser to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan was in Ethiopia on a world tour advancing his most ambitious project yet: the elimination of global poverty. While others tinker with incremental steps, Sachs has no patience for the small scale. Ethiopia and sub-Saharan Africa have slid deeper into poverty in the last 20 years, and whereas many economists stress the failures of local leadership, Sachs is telling a different story. In his version, Africa, through no fault of its own, is trapped. Held back by geographical impediments like climate, disease and isolation, it cannot lift itself out of poverty. What Africa needs, then, is not more scolding from the West. It needs a \"big push\" -- a flood of foreign aid -- to boost its prospects and carry it into the developed world.\nIt's a controversial claim that has made Sachs a lightning rod in the world of development policy, where experts are still fighting over whether foreign aid even works. In many ways, Sachs's ideas are a throwback to the 1950's and 60's, when economists believed chronic poverty resulted from a lack of savings and investment -- creating an obvious role for foreign assistance. John F. Kennedy increased aid by 25 percent; under Lyndon Johnson, American foreign assistance reached its apex in real dollars. But the 70's brought more market-oriented theories, and by the late 80's, most economists converged around the \"Washington Consensus\" -- a belief that free trade, low taxes, deregulation and privatization would make all boats rise. Sachs himself bolstered that orthodoxy when he co-wrote a highly influential paper in 1995 that largely blamed protectionist policies for the lack of economic growth in poor countries.\nThe consensus has since broadened, adding the need for efficient, law-abiding governments to its concerns. But it has also blurred, as development economists debate the relative merits of large- and small-scale solutions, trade, aid and the promotion of micro-loans.\nEven as the experts quarrel, the war on terrorism and the backlash against economic globalization have induced wealthy nations to begin putting more in the collection plate. That has created an unusual opportunity for an impassioned advocate like Sachs to barrel along, spurred on by complete confidence in his own convictions. Although his advocacy of huge increases in foreign aid has won him both admirers and critics, all agree he now occupies an enviable position of enormous influence. He is the leading strategist on the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals -- an ambitious initiative that aims to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, as well as achieve universal primary education and significantly reduce child mortality, by 2015. He is also director of the Columbia University Earth Institute -- a $90 million think tank that joins the natural and social sciences with the explicit aim of helping the poor while preserving the planet. George Soros calls him \"a great proselytizer.\" Sachs advises governments across Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Africa. That he's always ready to offer strong views on matters seemingly beyond his expertise -- assailing American policy toward Iraq or Haiti, for example -- has only raised his global profile.\nIt's an image Sachs has been shaping, in various forms, for decades. Sachs, now 50, first attracted attention in the 1980's as a budding Harvard academic proposing to heal troubled economies through \"shock therapy\" -- a quick jolt of market-oriented reforms. After early successes, he stumbled badly when he sought to apply the formula to Russia, an experience that tarred his reputation and battered his ego. It also sparked Sachs's conversion from a believer that free trade can help deliver all from poverty to an advocate of the view that Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" isn't nearly strong enough. In what could be seen as an act of atonement for his market-oriented years, he is committed to convincing the world that only a direct transfer of alms from the rich can possibly save the poor -- and ward off an apocalyptic, terror-filled future.\nSachs makes no pretense at modesty. \"To the extent that there are any international goals, they are the Millennium Development Goals,\" he told me over breakfast at the Sheraton Hotel in Addis Ababa, a palatial structure of archways and fountains perched on a hill rising up from the center of Ethiopia's decrepit and polluted capital. \"And I've helped put them much higher on the agenda.\"\nI met Sachs at his hotel just hours after he arrived from Bangkok -- one stop on a nine-nation, five-week journey. A small, lean man with a large head that looks bigger because of his thick waves of brown hair, Sachs is famous for his boundless energy. This morning, though, he looked tired; his suit was rumpled, and he had missed some spots shaving.\nStill, Sachs was on message. \"Africa's challenges are enormous,\" he told me over a bowl of corn flakes, citing statistics on the frequency of drought and the failures of rain-fed agriculture. \"But we have powerful tools of science and technology. And we're here to say, 'Here are the things that can and should be done.\"'\nEver the macroeconomist, Sachs is in the process of calculating exactly what it will require to do them. Adding the costs of basic infrastructure, health care and primary education, among other things, he estimates that it will take about $100 per beneficiary per year for Africa to meet the Millennium Development Goals in the next 10 years. He figures African governments and households can kick in about $45, and donors already contribute about $10, so that leaves $45 more per person. On a global scale, meeting the goals would require about $150 billion of development assistance per year. If that sounds like a lot, it's still less than the 0.7 percent of G.N.P. a year that donor countries have repeatedly promised, most recently in Mexico, where in 2002 they signed the Monterrey Consensus pledging \"concrete efforts\" toward that goal. (Despite recent increases, the United States still spends under 0.2 percent of its G.N.P. on foreign aid -- less than any other wealthy industrialized country.) \"You can't have a civilized world in which the rich aren't even willing to live up to this tiny commitment,\" Sachs says. \"We're talking about less than 1 percent,\" he adds, a statistic that seems to astound him. \"It's stunning.\"\nSachs isn't just expecting rich nations to fork over the cash, though. He's traveling the world to rally poor countries to draft plans showing what they need and how they'll spend it. Hunger, for example, can be eliminated with the right science and technology, he says, which can be purchased with foreign aid. So in July, Sachs convened in Ethiopia a United Nations conference on hunger to persuade African leaders to see it that way. Ambitious as ever, Sachs aimed to start an African \"green revolution.\"\nOn the morning of the revolution's scheduled kickoff, Sachs hovered in the vast lobby of the United Nations conference center in Addis Ababa. \"What if no one shows up?\" he said, laughing. Some nervousness around this hunger conference was warranted. For weeks beforehand, Sachs frequently wondered aloud whether calling his campaign a green revolution was such a good idea. The first green revolution, financed by private foundations, began in the 1940's and introduced hybrid seeds, chemical fertilizers and powerful pesticides to the developing world. Although countries like Mexico, India and China vastly increased food production, the means by which they did it were later criticized for destroying biodiversity, creating dependence on expensive polluting chemicals and driving small farmers out of business. Meanwhile, economists grew skeptical that even the best technology would help countries whose own economic policies seemed to be stunting their growth.\nSuch controversy does not deter Sachs, however. He strategically timed the hunger conference for the day before the the start of the African Union summit, an annual meeting of African leaders, so that heads of state would attend. (Sachs said he also hoped to address the summit.) Judging from the hundreds who filled the conference hall and the long row of African leaders who took their places at the dais, including Kofi Annan and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, it was clear by 9:30 a.m. that Sachs had a good turnout. (Unexpectedly, President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan also showed up -- a stark reminder that not all heads of state are especially deserving aid recipients.) Sachs was the only non-African on the stage.\nWhen the Africans spoke, they stressed the importance of ending the continent's conflicts and applying African solutions to Africa's problems. Then Sachs took the podium. Leaning forward, his gaze spanned the audience. \"This is a moment of historic opportunity,\" he began. \"You are here to launch a 21st-century green revolution.\"\nHe went on, his voice rising: \"The poor are blamed for their problems. We say the poor are poor because they're corrupt or because they don't manage themselves. But in the past two years I've seen exactly the opposite.\" Hunger can be eliminated, he told them. \"My country spends nearly $450 billion on its military and only $15 billion on development aid per year. We have so much money we don't know what to do with it.\"\nLike a preacher rapt by his own evangelical zeal, Sachs was soon transformed from one of the rich himself to one of the Africans in the audience. \"They need to hear from us that this is not wishful thinking, this is not money down the drain,\" he declared. \"They need to hear from us.\"\nSachs went on to suggest that the rich countries should cancel all of Africa's debts. \"If they won't cancel the debt -- and I'm stretching here -- I would suggest that you do it yourselves,\" he announced, eliciting murmurs of surprise and then growing applause. His voice rising, he said, \"The time has come to end this charade.\"\nDick Beahrs, retired president of Court TV, and Hans Eenhoorn, a retired senior vice president of the food giant Unilever, hardly seem like revolutionaries. Yet as we bumped along potholed dirt roads in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia on the day before Sachs's arrival in the country, they certainly sounded like converts to his cause. Alongside our air-conditioned white Land Cruiser, tiny children led miniature donkeys loaded with yellow plastic water buckets. Bony cows with calves so skinny they looked like stray cats grazed on barely perceptible shrubs. But as we wound through the arid mountainous terrain, the eroded and abandoned soil gave way to small plots of freshly plowed dirt.\n\"I love those living fences!\" Beahrs exclaimed as we passed a row of cactuses that had been placed around newly planted trees to keep cattle from eating them. From the front seat, Eenhoorn spouted statistics: \"The amount of soil lost in one year in Ethiopia could fill a string of three-ton trucks circling the equator twice.\"\nBeahrs and Eenhoorn are members of the United Nations Millennium Project Hunger Task Force, one of 10 groups that Sachs has created that combine scientists, aid specialists, economists and philanthropists to draft \"business plans\" for meeting each of the Millennium Development Goals. Notwithstanding his relentless attack on wealthy governments, Sachs maintains strong ties with wealthy corporations and individuals. He has dined with the C.E.O. of General Electric, for example, and publicly touts Monsanto's latest research on drought-resistant seeds as a panacea for Africa, as he did at the United Nations hunger conference -- to an African audience strongly suspicious of genetically modified crops. To all his antipoverty work, Sachs takes a businesslike approach, with detailed plans, needs assessments and cost analyses, as if to make what many see as nebulous and unrealistic goals seem less so.\nThe members of the hunger task force returned to the capital just in time for a meeting on how Ethiopia could meet the Millennium Development Goals. \"We had a really exciting trip yesterday,\" Beahrs told Sachs. \"A picture is worth a thousand words. It really shows that scaling up on a mass scale is possible.\"\n\"That's a great op-ed,\" Sachs said, laying out the headline in the air. \"'Scaling Up Is Possible.' I'll have to write that.\"\nAddressing about 200 Ethiopian officials and United Nations functionaries 20 minutes later, Sachs emphasized the \"on-the-ground realities\" his colleagues had just seen, he said. \"Clearly, the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved. A huge scale of development can take place.\"\nBut can the problems of a country like Ethiopia be solved so readily by money and technology? It's unlikely that there are enough skilled administrators, teachers, engineers and health and agricultural workers to implement the programs Sachs says are needed. The projects in Tigray are a good example: 70,000 water-harvesting ponds and tanks were built hastily under government orders last year, but many were designed so poorly they don't actually hold water. And the region lacks the necessary workers and materials to fix them. What's more, although Ethiopia's communist rulers were overthrown more than a decade ago, private land ownership is still forbidden, destroying farmers' incentives to improve the soil. At the Council on Foreign Relations last January, the head of USAID, Andrew Natsios, said in a public debate with Sachs that Ethiopia has \"the worst economic policies next to Zimbabwe in Africa,\" citing it as an example of wasted foreign aid.\nBut travels through the country suggest Ethiopia does benefit from the aid it receives -- and could use far more. After Sachs left town, I drove with a local priest to Wonji, a dusty village of dry hills and grass huts a few hours east of Addis Ababa. When we arrived, a little girl in a bright yellow dress and neat rows of braids ran up to greet us. A year ago, the priest said, she was so skinny and her belly so swollen from hunger he assumed she would die. Now, she looked relatively healthy -- thanks to food aid trucked in by the United States. And with the help of Catholic Relief Services, financed by USAID, the villagers built a system bringing water from the nearest town to a bank of modern faucets in the village center. Still, the project is only a Band-Aid covering deeper wounds. If the rains don't come soon, said Almaz Tafara, a weary-looking 35-year-old mother of seven balancing a large clay jug as she screwed shut a shiny new water tap, \"we are lost.\"\nTo Sachs, such developments support his argument for a big infusion of immediate cash. But to others, such aid projects are beside the point. The government isn't meeting its larger responsibility to develop the country. How much can foreign assistance change that? The debate had been crystallized three months earlier, when I accompanied Sachs to the World Bank headquarters in Washington. Sachs and Arye Hillman, an economist from Bar-Ilan University in Israel, had been invited to discuss the question: \"How and Why Do States Fail?\"\n\"The idea that African failure is due to African poor governance is one of the great myths of our time,\" Sachs began, addressing a packed hall. \"They can't get out of the hole on their own. If we don't take a different approach, we will not only see certain collapse; we will see a catastrophic downward spiral of violence.\"\nHe continued, his voice rising: \"If you go to rural Ethiopia, Burkina Faso or Mozambique and try to figure out how to solve the problems of crushing disease burden, lack of cooking fuel -- they're living on dung as their cooking fuel. They lack access to basic medical care. We have not begun to take this problem seriously. What will it take for villages with no access to anti-malarials, where 10 percent of the adult population is H.I.V.-positive and has depleted soils because they can't afford fertilizer? If you have another idea of how they're supposed to do this all by themselves,\" he said, his voice shaking now, \"let me know.\"\nUnderstandably, Hillman began on the defensive. \"We all have the same objective,\" he said steadily, as if he'd just been accused of killing small children. \"We all want to help the poor. But billions of dollars have been spent in Africa over the course of two decades. Someone has to show us that throwing more money at the problem will solve it.\" Turning to Sachs, Hillman said: \"All the problems you pointed to are the responsibility of the government. Most of these problems are resolved in civil societies. It's a problem with culture here. We all know there are political elites in poor countries that do very well.\"\nIt's an argument Sachs confronts repeatedly. He agrees that foreign aid should be focused on countries with good governments: don't give money to Zimbabwe, for example. But how many good governments exist in Africa? In a recent article, Sachs argues that, controlling for income levels, African governments are no worse than others around the world. But \"the question is not whether governance is good relative to income,\" says Stephen O'Connell, a Swarthmore College economist who wrote a response to Sachs's paper, \"but whether it is good enough in absolute terms to avoid sharply diminishing returns or even outright institutional deterioration when managing a massive scaling-up of public services.\"\nIndeed, for all the research that has been conducted since the Marshall Plan first inspired American foreign aid to the developing world, there's little agreement on when or whether aid works. Many studies show that more spending fails to improve services like health or education in the long term; others say those studies measure the wrong things -- counting aid given for political or humanitarian purposes rather than development.\nThe World Bank's latest world development report reflects the growing view that money alone is not the answer. Even when governments spend large sums on health and education, for example, the bank's study finds they spend little of it on poor people: In Nepal, for instance, 46 percent of education funds are spent on the richest fifth; only 11 percent are allocated to the poorest. Even when the spending makes it to the local level, qualified staff members still have to show up for work; yet a survey of health clinics in Bangladesh found an absentee rate among doctors of 74 percent.\nBut Sachs is no longer fighting numbers with numbers. The economist has effectively bowed out of the debate, shedding his academic robes for a new cloth. He's become a believer, a preacher for the \"Big Push\" theory. His book, \"The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time,\" which will be published next spring, is a personal plea to heed the call. Ultimately, Sachs is convinced that we've never really pushed hard enough. \"It's like trying to put out a forest fire with one hose,\" he likes to say. \"If the fire continues to spread, it doesn't mean firefighting doesn't work. It means we need more firefighters.\"\nAlthough he is the son of a prominent labor and constitutional rights lawyer in Michigan, Sachs did not always have an especially progressive outlook. In fact, the \"shock therapy\" he engineered imposed austerity on nations in distress and earned him a reputation as a heartless market advocate.\nIn 1985, he successfully advised the Bolivian government on its recovery from a bout of 25,000 percent inflation. A few years later, he turned to Poland, where the fledgling Solidarity government wanted to create a market economy. Then only 35, Sachs boldly advised slashing government subsidies, abolishing price controls, liberalizing trade and devaluing the Polish currency. He also helped persuade Western nations to finance currency stabilization and cancel much of Poland's debt. Inflation dropped, new businesses started and government coffers grew, securing Sachs's reputation as an economic savior.\nNot long after, the new Russian Federation was teetering. Central planning had collapsed; inflation was rising; shops were empty. In December 1991, Sachs arrived to advise the government with a team of Harvard economists. But the Polish prescription had markedly different results in Russia, which was rent by political infighting and lacked markets or a strong civil society. Many proposed reforms stalled in Parliament. Those implemented, like elimination of price controls, led to spiraling inflation that wiped out Russians' savings and thwarted investment. Privatization led to looting of the country's most valuable assets by its leading businessmen and organized criminals. Fairly or not, many still hold Sachs responsible.\nWhenever I asked Sachs about Russia, he bristled, the only times in months I saw him lose his composure or stray off message. When it first came up, we were standing outside his four-story town house off Central Park West at the end of a long workday. Sachs launched into his standard defense: he gave the right advice, but the Russians didn't follow it. It was the United States' fault, too, for refusing to give enough money to stabilize the currency and create a safety net for the unemployed.\nThere was a clap of thunder. Then raindrops. Sachs's words seemed to race ahead of him. \"You try your best and do what you can do, but you couldn't imagine all of the blame that came afterward,\" he said. \"Say that malaria aid didn't work. It would be like being blamed for malaria for the next 10 years. Am I going to be blamed for AIDS too?\" The rain started coming down harder, and his wife, Sonia, rushed out with an umbrella and reminded him that the guests for a fund-raising dinner were already there. He paused for a moment and his voice lowered, cracking slightly. \"Frankly, the Russia thing was a very painful period.\"\nInstead of wallowing in the pain, however, Sachs has set out to redeem himself. It's as if having failed at the second-greatest challenge of modern history -- the transition from communism to capitalism -- he is intent on solving the first: the persistence of global poverty. Sachs has many of the necessary talents. \"Jeff has been extremely successful at putting ideas on the policy agenda of governments,\" says Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"All of these organizations and institutions he has criticized, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, are very much aware of him.\" But Sachs's supreme self-confidence also rubs many the wrong way. \"I would criticize his lack of humility,\" Rodrik says. \"Whatever he's focused on, he has this evangelical attitude that it's obviously the right thing to do, that people who disagree either have an ax to grind or are simply not thinking straight.\"\nIn fact, some experts, like the Harvard economist Michael Kremer, are highly skeptical of Sachs's current focus on the Millennium Development Goals. \"Focusing aid and development planning on the M.D.G.'s may distort how funds are spent,\" he says. Developing an AIDS vaccine, for example, could get short shrift because it isn't likely to yield results by the 2015 deadline.\nWealthy nations' attitudes toward foreign aid do appear to be shifting, however. Two years ago, the United States pledged a 50 percent increase in foreign aid by 2006 as it announced a new \"Millennium Challenge Account\" that aims to support \"the poorest nations that rule justly, invest in their people and encourage economic freedom.\" (Sachs accepts the idea but says it's not ambitious enough.) That's on top of the $15 billion the United States has pledged to fight AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean. Britain, meanwhile, has promised to double development spending by 2010, and this summer pledged to reach the developed countries' long-stated goal of donating 0.7 percent of G.D.P. by 2013. Five European countries have already met that goal, and five more, including France and Spain, recently promised to reach it by specific dates.\nSachs, for his part, realizes he's standing at a critical juncture in the history of foreign assistance and intends to use his clout to create an international clamor for its expansion. But he also realizes that to convert the world, he needs to win the faith of aid's intended recipients.\nThat goal was evident up until his last hours in Ethiopia. For months, Sachs was angling for an invitation to address the African Union during its summit meeting. By Tuesday night, his third day there, he still hadn't received one. Discouraged, he'd moved up his departing flight from Wednesday evening to early that afternoon.\nI waited for Sachs to arrive at the United Nations conference center Wednesday morning. African leaders surrounded by bodyguards swept in, but Jeffrey Sachs was nowhere to be found. Then, around 10 a.m., I saw him hurrying across the hallway. \"I did it!\" he said, a smile filling his face. He had the triumphant look of a schoolboy who'd just beaten his greatest rival in the chess finals. \"I addressed the African Union!\" After slipping in late to a closed-door session, Sachs had whispered his request to President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, the new African Union chairman. When Obasanjo opened the meeting, he invited Sachs to speak.\nMission accomplished, Sachs was now running late. He had to catch a flight to Paris for a meeting of international donor agencies. Still grinning, he strode quickly across the convention hall, his head bobbing above his oversize suit -- an unlikely-looking revolutionary sweeping through the thick crowd of African dignitaries and out the front door.\nDaphne Eviatar has written about development for The New York Times, The Boston Globe, Newsweek International and The Nation."}, {"text": "Flooding in Bangladesh\n2004-07-29T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nThe man-made tragedy in Sudan is finally getting attention from neighboring countries and the United Nations.

Raskob declared his intention to build a taller skyscraper than Walter Chrysler's, the Empire State Building has symbolized a type of tireless American labor. Even its construction was tireless: in one 10-day period in 1930, the building rose 14 1/2 floors. Thousands of tough guys, grateful for work, put in seven million man-hours at Depression-era wages, pushing the limestone-and-steel structure closer to the sky than any other, and arriving at the top ahead of schedule.\nSo it's fun to imagine what those stonemasons and riveters would say if they could see what now occupies a windowless office on the building's 24th floor, right down the hall from the hosiery distributors.\nAgainst the office walls sit eight white fiberglass pods, looking for all the world like giant cue balls lined up just so. Tiny speakers on the floor play the constant drone of white noise. Welcome to MetroNaps, the Midtown home of the midday nap. For $14, worker bees fighting the early-afternoon drowsies can buy 20 minutes of solitude. (Longer than that, the company says, will leave you feeling groggy.)\nOn a recent Wednesday afternoon, I visited MetroNaps to try and answer the question: In the city that never sleeps, who pays for a nap?\nDuring my visit of nearly an hour and a half, only two other customers visited for a post-lunch snooze. Anecdotal reports from other customers suggest that a typical half-hour visit can yield one to four co-nappers. One customer, John Mooney, a broad-faced corporate salesman whose job requires him to work all day after a long night on the town with clients, said he had recommended MetroNaps to friends, but would never tell his employer where he spends the occasional weekday afternoon. \"Hopefully,\" he said, \"my company won't see this article.\"\nArshad Chowdhury, the slim Bangladeshi-American who is a co-founder of MetroNaps, said he was struck by the idea for a nap center while observing his exhausted colleagues at a Wall Street investment bank. \"I'd see them dozing in bathrooms,\" he whispered. He tested the concept at Carnegie Mellon University, where he earned his M.B.A., and opened MetroNaps in May. Mr. Chowdhury, of course, said business was good, although he would not discuss customer turnout or specific financial details.\nWith his soft, lulling voice and all-black ensemble, Mr. Chowdhury is almost a nap personified. He admits that in a city as driven as New York, there is a stigma attached to the siesta -- forcing law firm associates under their desks for 40 winks and cable repairmen onto side streets to snooze in their vans. But Mr. Chowdhury aims to change that perception by citing scientific evidence -- from NASA, from Harvard, from the National Sleep Foundation -- that midday naps actually increase productivity.\nBehind his Zen exterior is the zeal of a missionary who can't believe that others haven't seen the light. And like any missionary, he's appalled that anyone might misconstrue what he's doing. He incredulously recounted the responses of skeptical real estate agents to his business plan: \"'You want to charge by the hour for people to rent a bed? There's a name for that.\"' Mr. Chowdhury pointed to a sign on the wall: \"Pods for single occupancy only.\"\nAnother MetroNaps customer, Ahsanul Karim, a dapper, mustachioed man in a brown suit, is the kind of \"avid napper\" to whom Mr. Chowdhury caters. And Mr. Karim has no qualms about telling his clothing company where he sometimes rests his weary head. That may have something to do, of course, with the fact that Mr. Karim owns the company, Sage Collections, and if he wants to come down from the 56th floor of the Empire State Building after pulling an all-nighter at the office, who's to tell him no?\nOnce Mr. Karim was safely tucked in, Mr. Chowdhury led me to my own pod. A sort of synthetic leather dentist's chair protruded from the bottom of the sleek, white sphere.\n\"We did a lot of research,\" Mr. Chowdhury said, \"and determined it's better for your clothing if you don't lie all the way down. Sitting reduces wrinkling.\"\nHe showed me the features of my pod, not unlike a bellman introducing a guest to his hotel suite. The chair reclined at the touch of a button, and big sound-reducing headphones attached to a portable CD player were already softly burbling with synthesized New Age music. He pulled a thin gray blanket up to my stomach and turned out the lights.\nSnug in my soundproof cocoon, I felt sudden performance anxiety; I paid $14 for this, so I darn well better fall asleep. But my attempts to do so were undercut by my brain, still chugging away at daytime rates. First, I couldn't shake the endless loop of the Eurythmics' song \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" lodged in my head. Soon, Annie Lennox's voice was joined by my own, nagging away: You forgot to ask Ahsanul Karim where he lives! Is $14 reimbursable? Boy, is your heartbeat loud.\nTwenty minutes later, having only recently fallen asleep, I was gently shaken and stirred by the chair's vibrations and the pod's soft lights. I removed the blanket, put my glasses back on and stumbled to the \"comfort station,\" a sink with a bottle of citrus spritz and some moist towels. While I felt sleepier than before I arrived, a rejuvenated-looking Mr. Karim told me he enjoyed his nap. (For the record, he lives in East Windsor, N.J.) While paying my bill, I asked the woman at the counter if the dark, soporific atmosphere of MetroNaps ever enticed her into one of the pods.\nHer eyes darted toward her boss before she crisply answered, \"Well, of course we're too busy for that.\" \"No, no,\" Mr. Chowdhury cheerfully interjected, \"Employees taking naps on the job is fine!\"\nHeaded home on the uptown D train, I sat next to a distinguished gentleman in a black Polo shirt, his eyes at half-mast as he struggled to concentrate on a set of homemade flashcards. As the subway bumped and rolled up the West Side, he gave up the fight, dropped his hands to his lap, and -- amid crying babies, screeching brakes and garbled announcements -- took the same metro nap New Yorkers have been taking for years, his head bouncing gently against the window.\nNEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MIDTOWN Dan Kois writes for Slate and Salon and is an editor of At Length, a quarterly literary journal."}, {"text": "Tyrants and failed states : The world must find a way to intervene\n2004-03-18T05:00:00.000Z\nLONDON\u2014  A year ago, on March 18, 2003, 412 members of Britain's House of Commons voted for military action in Iraq and 149 voted against. Iraq was an extremely divisive issue in Britain, that has now become marred by unreasonable allegations of lying. Both sides had a strong case and we are all capable of exaggerating our arguments. That does not mean the protagonists are liars. \n Prime Minister Tony Blair's overemphasis on weapons of mass destruction was a major tactical error and he has paid a high price for it. But opponents of the war face difficult questions, too. \n The left is clear in its criticisms of the Bush administration. But it is no use being shocked by the aggressive assertiveness of the right in the United States if we can't come up with an alternative policy to deal with dictators in the post-cold war world. \n In extreme cases, regime change is not only politically justified but morally necessary. The military intervention in Kosovo was largely supported by the left without United Nations support. And it is not always Western powers that intervene. Tanzania removed Idi Amin and Vietnam overthrew Pol Pot without UN agreement. India supported Bangladesh's bid to break free of Pakistan without UN support. But it is the failures to intervene that ought to shame those who talk about an international community. Who can defend the way that we sat back and watched the genocide in Rwanda? \n The challenge will be to find a way in which regime change can be legitimized by world opinion. At present we are torn between two equally unattractive options \u2014 to intervene with military force or do nothing. We need a new policy to enable earlier interventions in failing states. \n The central failure with Saddam Hussein was that the world did not act earlier, when it first became apparent that he had no intention of keeping the \n cease-fire agreement of 1991. The United Nations passed no fewer than 17 resolutions on Iraq. It should have stepped up the pressure each time it passed a resolution that was not obeyed, using military and nonmilitary measures. \n A particularly important approach is to use indictment procedures. These should be initiated at an early stage when there are gross human rights violations. \n In Zimbabwe there is currently ample evidence of gross human rights abuse, including state-sponsored torture, rape and murder. With growing starvation, state control of food supplies is being used to reward and punish the population. \n So shouldn't we be campaigning for the indictment of President Robert Mugabe now? Are the rape and torture camps enough? Or will the left just wait to see how awful it gets and then march through London if anyone threatens to intervene? \n A graduated process of intervention would start with UN debates followed by visits by UN officials and heads of state chosen by the United Nations. If the situation deteriorated, targeted sanctions and indictment procedures should begin. UN observers could also be placed in the country and if access or mobility were denied, more forceful measures applied. The failure of the United Nations to enforce the inspection regime in Iraq encouraged Saddam to think he could play cat and mouse with the world community. \n A U.S. president committed to working with the United Nations and a serious commitment by the other Security Council members to dealing with despotic regimes could lead to an effective interventionist policy that would only use invasion as last resort. \n At present the left stands accused of defending the rights of the nation-state over the human rights of the individual. If we are serious about our internationalist credentials then we cannot put our fingers in our ears and drown out the screams of the tortured while condemning those who intervene. We must give human rights a higher priority than the nation-state. \n * \n Clive Soley is a Labor member of Britain's House of Commons. \n [Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.] "}, {"text": "TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; Travelers Are Cautioned About Asian Bird Flu\n2004-02-01T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nA YEAR after East Asia suffered through an outbreak of SARS, another and potentially far more deadly disease is sweeping the region: the A(H5N1) strain of avian influenza.\nNo warnings had been issued against visiting any country when this article went to press, but influenza experts have been advising travelers to take precautions.\nSouth Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia had confirmed cases of the disease in chickens, while Taiwan and Pakistan reported what their officials said were cases of what they described as less dangerous strains of avian influenza. There were also unconfirmed reports of mysterious large-scale deaths of fowl in southern China, Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia.\nThailand and Vietnam have each confirmed handfuls of cases in people, with more cases under investigation, while Cambodia has asked a Thai lab for help in studying samples from two children suspected of having the disease. The World Health Organization says that so far, all of the cases appear to have involved people who were infected by live chickens or their waste.\nDr. Bjorn Melgaard, the W.H.O.'s chief representative in Thailand, said the disease had not yet been shown capable of passing from person to person. The real fear is that if a person becomes infected with avian influenza and human influenza at the same time, the two viruses could swap genetic material in a process known as recombination, producing a lethal virus that could pass as quickly from person to person around the world as other human flu viruses do.\n''The concern for humans is recombination,'' Dr. Melgaard said. ''That is the real threat to public health.''\nThe most important precaution for travelers is to avoid going near live birds, either wild or domesticated, in any country in which the disease has been identified or is being investigated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States is advising Americans to avoid poultry farms and markets for live poultry and to avoid touching surfaces that may have been in contact with bird droppings.\nInfected birds produce high concentrations of the virus in their droppings, which can dry up, turn to dust and then be inhaled by other birds or people. While chickens have received the most attention, there have been reports of ducks and even urban pigeons dying of a mysterious disease in Southeast Asia that Thai scientists suspect may be bird flu.\nEpidemiologists have thoroughly studied the best-known outbreak of A(H5N1) virus, in which 18 people fell ill with the disease in Hong Kong in 1997 and 6 died. One of those cases was a poultry farm worker; the rest were people who had visited markets where live chickens were sold. Many influenza experts credit Hong Kong with having stopped a global pandemic by killing every chicken in the territory within three days.\nMarkets for live poultry are very popular in China and elsewhere in Asia, where many consumers still like to inspect an animal for health before buying it to eat. The markets' persistence poses a continuing threat to human health, said Hans Wagner, a livestock expert with the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization.\nYet even Hong Kong officials, especially aware of health issues after the SARS outbreak last spring, have been unable to shut down the live markets there -- although they have publicly expressed a desire to do so -- because of opposition from the poultry industry.\nHong Kong announced on Jan. 21 that agricultural officials had found a dead peregrine falcon near the mainland border that had been infected with the disease. China has denied having any cases, despite evidence that the disease may have started there; two people from Hong Kong fell sick with the disease early last year, and one died after visiting a town in Fujian province in southern China.\nAlthough no cases have yet been linked to food, the W.H.O. has encouraged people to be particularly careful in their handling of raw chicken meat and eggs. They should be thoroughly cooked until their temperature exceeds 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit). Cooks should wash their hands carefully with soap, and surfaces used in the preparation of the meat should be thoroughly disinfected.\nAccording to the United States Agriculture Department, this country did not allow the import of chickens or their meat from Asia even before the current outbreak because of concerns that the exotic Newcastle disease, another threat to birds, might start to infect American chicken farms.\nTravelers who fall ill upon returning from overseas should always tell their doctor where they have been.\nCorrection: February 1, 2004, Sunday The Correspondent's Report article on Page 3 of the Travel section today, about avian influenza, includes an outdated reference to China's position on the disease. On Tuesday, after the section had gone to press, the Chinese said that fowl had indeed been infected in their country."}, {"text": "JERSEY; A Wasteland in Sudan, Empathy in Newark\n2004-10-31T05:00:00.000Z\nIT'S hard to drag yourself out on a Monday night in autumn, but earlier this month, those who drove to downtown Newark to hear more about the latest hellhole on the planet were oddly energized. There, in a beautiful museum that is underused -- the Newark Museum -- a group of Christians, Jews, African-Americans, Africans and Hispanics converged to learn more about what they could do about the devastating war in Sudan.\n\"I don't want my grandchildren wondering why we didn't do anything while this was going on,\" United States Representative Donald M. Payne of New Jersey said, echoing a sentiment that was common throughout the audience.\nThe conference, organized by the Rutgers Institute on Ethnicity, the N.A.A.C.P. of Newark and other groups, featured Mr. Payne, who showed photographs of smiling children and sad-eyed mothers driven from their homes in Darfur in western Sudan. Maria Sliwa, a leader against slavery in the Sudan, and Gerald Martone of the International Rescue Committee, described the onslaught of the Janjaweed, Arab herders who have murdered, tortured and pillaged Darfurians, using the rape of women and, in some cases, children as young as 8 years old, as a principal weapon.\n\"Some things are so bad that in fact you can get a coalition together,\" said Allyson Gall of the American Jewish Committee, a principal organizer of the conference.\nFor people whose knowledge of the situation is limited, the evening provided a crash course in global politics and human fallibility. On the 10th anniversary of the atrocities in Rwanda, a combination of economic scarcity, ethnic rivalry -- both sides are Muslim, though one side is made up of Arab tribesmen and the other African villagers -- and a power struggle by the government in Khartoum, the capital, has cost at least 70,000 lives and displaced 1.5 million people. During a typical assault by the Janjaweed -- it means \"evil horseman\" -- the men rush to save their cattle and the women rush to save their children. When the women fail, they are raped and maimed. Even then, some return in search of lost children, whose bodies or heads they often find stuffed in wells.\nAsked why she came, Clarice Jackson, a retired teacher and lawyer from Orange, asked how she could not. \"We're slowing down in our activities, but we just had to do this,\" said Mrs. Jackson, who attended the conference with her husband, Alfred. Looking back on the close to, but not capacity, crowd, she expressed her one disappointment: \"That auditorium should've been full.\"\nHarry Zutz, 80, a retired physician from Maplewood, said his motivation for coming stemmed from his reading last year of Samantha Power's Pulitzer-Prize-winning, \"A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide.\"\n\"Being Jewish, I've become obsessed with genocide and ethnic cleansing,\" said Dr. Zutz, a former member of Health Volunteers Overseas, which trains medical personnel in underdeveloped countries. \"Survivors of the Holocaust say, 'Never again,' and yet there's this insouciance when it's another ethnic group involved.\"\nAmong a handful of Darfurians at the conference, Ishag Ahmed, treasurer of the Darfur Rehabilitation Project, said he hoped that foreign troops would intervene, but given the United States' involvement in Iraq, and the United Nations' resistance on the issue -- China does business in the Sudan, where oil was discovered in the 1970's -- he doubted such a solution was imminent.\nMeantime, like other Darfurians -- about 20 live in New Jersey -- he eagerly awaits news from home. His mother, a brother and nine nieces and nephews survived a rampage by the Janjaweed, and are now safe, thanks to money provided by Mr. Ahmed and another brother.\nOther Darfurians are not so lucky. Starving in makeshift camps with scant supplies, the displaced are rapidly dying. Asked about priorities, the panel said that the village elders cited not only food and water, but schools. The day goes more quickly when the children have something to think about other than food.\n\"In America, we're all preoccupied with the election -- and rightfully so,\" Dr. Zutz said. \"Meanwhile, this goes on. \"\nThe son of Ukrainian immigrants who attended public school in Delaware, Dr. Zutz said that his own evolution as a global citizen happened slowly. \"I can't believe how stupid and unsophisticated we were,\" he said. \"It never occurred to me until years later, for instance, that there weren't any blacks in my school.\"\nHis perspective broadened in the 1960's when he read Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring,\" and books about world poverty and hunger. Eventually, he enrolled at Drew University, and received a master's degree in theological studies. During the next 20 years, he and his wife visited Africa, India, Afghanistan and Bangladesh as members of the health volunteers.\n\"Forgive my verbosity,\" he said after a long conversation on Darfur. \"I find so few people who are interested in the subject.\""}, {"text": "World Leaders Attend Military Funeral In Cairo\n2004-11-12T05:00:00.000Z\nAIRO, Nov. 11 A\u0302\u0096 Presidents, kings and potentates from across the Arab world and beyond paid their last respects to Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat here on Friday with Egypt holding a state memorial service for a leader without a state.\nThe ceremony followed the brief, somber choreography of most Muslim funerals, a few moments of prayer followed by a gathering of mourners in a large tent, then a march behind the coffin, drapped in a Palestinian flag and resting on a caisson drawn by six black horses. \nIn this case the coffin was not carried to its final resting place, but to an Egyptian military transport plane which flew it to Al-Arish in the northern Sinai, where a military helicopter whisked it to Ramallah in the occupied West Bank for the actual burial scheduled to take place before sundown. Thousands of mourning Palestinians gathered there for the ceremony.\nIn Cairo, the public was not allowed anywhere near the military service, with traffic halted and armed security forces stationed on all rooftops and even in mosque minarets along the brief, 150-yard route of the funeral march on CairoA\u0302\u0092s main airport road. Homeowners in apartments lining the road were evidently told not to even open their windows. \nFor the public, an emotional Friday prayer service inside the venerable Azhar mosque was designated a memorial service. ``What a shame, what a shame, ArafatA\u0302\u0092s funeral was at the airport,A\u0302\u0092A\u0302\u0092 the mourners chanted, with the couplet rhyming in Arabic, underscoring the failure of the areaA\u0302\u0092s leaders to solve the Palestinian problem. \nSpeaking at the mosque prayers at a military club which started the official ceremony, Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, the grand sheikh of Al-Azhar and EgyptA\u0302\u0092s highest religious figure, said brief prayers over the coffin resting on the patterned black and white marble floor. \n``He has served his people all his life, until he faced his God, with courage and honesty,A\u0302\u0092A\u0302\u0092 said the sheikh. ``Let us pray for his soul.A\u0302\u0092A\u0302\u0092 Then he repeated ``God is greatA\u0302\u0092A\u0302\u0092 numerous times. \nAfter that, the coffin was transferred to the caisson. Not far from the mosque, mourners, including some 60 senior officials from around the world, gathered in a traditional cloth tent used for funerals in Egypt, carpeted and the walls lined with giant red, green and yellow patterned arabesques. \nMost of the pantheon of Arab leaders flew in for the occasion, some landing at the very last minute and some chosing to overlook often bitter differences with the Palestinian leader. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and King Abdullah II of Jordan, both of whose fathers had long sparred with Arafat, attended, as did Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. The presidents of Algeria, Tunisia, Yemen, Sudan and Lebanon were there, along with a host of princes from the royal houses of the Gulf. \nFrom farther afield, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa came as did the presidents of Indonesia, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. There was a sprinkling of prime ministers, although most European nations were represented by their foreign ministers. The United States sent Assistant Secretary of State William Burns. \nAfter a delegation of Palestinian leaders lead by Mahmoud Abbas standing at the entrance to the mourning tent had greeted everyone, all the officials attending lined up behind the caisson and marched from the military club to the adjacent airfield along a main thoroughfare. \nAn Egyptian military band, marching in unison and playing ChopinA\u0302\u0092s funeral march as well as other dirges, lead the way.\n At the airfield, the mourners were joined by Suha Arafat and EgyptA\u0302\u0092s first lady, Suzanne Mubarak. In a rare public appearance, Mr. ArafatA\u0302\u0092s only child, a nine-year-old daughter named Zahwa, was at her motherA\u0302\u0092s side, both of them weeping. Eight pall bearers, lead by a three man honor guard, all in blue dress uniforms, marched the coffin crisply up a red carpet onto the plane, again to the sound of the Palestinian national anthem and the funeral march. \nEgyptian state television was the only media allowed inside the official ceremonies, and an unidentified commentator said, ``DonA\u0302\u0092t cry Zahwa. Your father never cried. He was a man of patience and endurance.A\u0302\u0092A\u0302\u0092"}, {"text": "NEW YORK 2004: REPUBLICAN NEW YORK; Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb?\n2004-08-29T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nANY pilgrimage to Republican shrines in New York City would be incomplete without a visit to Aziz Osmani's spice bazaar at 123 Lexington Avenue.\nMr. Osmani and his cousin, Sayedul Alam, both Bangladeshi immigrants, own Kalustyan's, the Middle Eastern and Indian food market in the only building still standing in New York City where a president of the United States -- a Republican, no less -- was sworn in. On Sept. 20, 1881, Vice President Chester A. Arthur took the oath at his home there after President James A. Garfield was assassinated. (Washington was inaugurated in the city, but at the original Federal Hall, which was razed in 1812.) A small plaque in the lobby for apartments upstairs is the only hint of anything historic.\nActually, it's a good thing Republicans are making history again by holding their convention in New York, because they haven't made much history here in years.\nRepublican sites in the city include several National Parks of New York Harbor, including Grant's Tomb (at Riverside Drive and West 122nd Street -- Grant and his wife are there) -- and the reconstructed birthplace of Theodore Roosevelt (28 East 20th Street); Cooper Union (Fourth Avenue near Astor Place), where Lincoln's speech to Republicans early in 1860 propelled him toward the presidency; and the statues of Horace Greeley (Greeley Square at Broadway and West 32nd Street and at City Hall Park), who christened the Republican Party in his New York Tribune in 1854. A gaggle of New York Republicans stand guard in Madison Square Park (named for James Madison, a founder of the Democratic Party), including statues of President Arthur and Senator Roscoe Conkling (near where he was rescued from the Blizzard of 1888; he died five weeks later). Another senator, William H. Seward, may be resting on the shoulders of a giant; his relatively small head sits atop what was supposedly a sculpture of Lincoln, which, legend has it, was drafted into a supporting role when fund-raising for Seward's monument fell short.\nThe old Fifth Avenue Hotel appreciated the patronage of Senator Thomas C. Platt, who convened his weekly ''Sunday school class'' there for political brethren in the early 1900's. When Platt would announce the unanimous results of the meetings, politicians and reporters at the end of the corridor would respond with ''amen,'' giving rise to the term Amen Corner.\nAn unconventional tour might include the home of Samuel J. Tilden on Gramercy Park. Tilden, the Al Gore of his day, won a majority in the 1876 presidential election but lost the electoral vote. Downtown, at 55 Liberty Street, the oil magnate Harry Sinclair hatched the Teapot Dome deals that scarred the Harding administration. The Waldorf Towers was home to former President Herbert Hoover.\nThere's Central Park (a bogus story about an escape from the zoo there inspired the G.O.P.'s elephant symbol).

Rumsfeld met with top officials of Bangladesh, which currently has more peacekeepers around the world than any other nation, but he reported no progress in finding new troops for Iraq or Afghanistan. 14\nFramework for Iraq\nPresident Bush and President Jacques Chirac of France said they had narrowed their differences over a United Nations resolution establishing a framework for returning self-government to Iraq. 20\nArab Allies Skipping Meeting\nA Bush administration plan for the world's wealthiest nations to declare their support for democracy in the Middle East has strained relations with several important allies in the Arab world. 14\nFirst Gay Wedding in France\nFrance witnessed its first gay wedding, despite warnings from the central government that the ceremony was illegal and the mayor who officiated could be punished. 20\nDiplomacy Between the Koreas\nNorth and South Korea agreed to open their first cross-border road and rail links by October, as South Korea announced that it would extend a 400,000- ton rice ''loan'' to North Korea. 6\nIndia's Farmers Dying of Despair\nThousands of farmers have committed suicide in India, with the most recent deaths occurring since a new state government took office promising farmers relief. The suicides reflect a rural culture in which excess debt is a mark of shame, but are also an indicator of the dire straits of the agricultural economy. 6\nNATIONAL 22-34\nKerry's Vice President Slot\nThe campaign for the vice presidential spot on the Democratic ticket is on, and John Kerry is reaping the benefits every day, as several men widely mentioned as possible running mates crisscross the country and appear widely on the cable networks on his behalf. 1\nThe Democratic Party took the first, tentative step toward writing a platform plank on the war in Iraq that it hopes will distinguish Democrats from the Bush administration without creating the divisions that afflicted the party during and after the Vietnam War. 24\nSupermarkets Catering to Poor\nFederal and state officials are alarmed about the proliferation of food stores that cater to low-income people but charge more than other grocery stores, thus driving up the cost of a federal nutrition program. 34\nDiscord Among Bishops\nSix months after Archbishop Raymond Burke announced that he would deny communion to Roman Catholic politicians who support abortion rights, only a handful of bishops have said they agree and many more have made it clear that they think he went too far. 22\nSCIENCE/HEALTH\n'Targeted' Cancer Treatment\nA pill known as BAY 43-9006 is one of a new generation of ''targeted'' therapies that are transforming cancer treatment by attacking the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease. 1\nLung cancer patients whose tumors are removed by surgery can improve their long-term odds of survival if they have chemotherapy after their operation, according to conclusions from two clinical trials. 26\nOBITUARIES 44-48\nRonald Wilson Reagan\nAmerica's 40th president was 93.

Its fuse has by no means been plucked. But over the last three decades, much of its Malthusian detonation power has leaked out.\nBirthrates in developed countries from Italy to Korea have sunk below the levels needed for their populations to replace themselves; the typical age of marriage and pregnancy has risen, and the use of birth control has soared beyond the dreams of Margaret Sanger and the nightmares of the Vatican.\nThe threat is now more regional than global, explosive only in places like India and Pakistan. Ever since 1968, when the United Nations Population Division predicted that the world population, now 6.3 billion, would grow to at least 12 billion by 2050, the agency has regularly revised its estimates downward. Now it expects population to plateau at nine billion.\nWhere did those billions go? Millions of babies have died, a fraction of them from AIDS, far more from malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, even measles. More millions have been aborted, either to avoid birth or, as in China and India, to avoid giving birth to a girl. (Cheap ultrasound technology has in the last decade made it easy to determine a child's sex.)\nBut even AIDS and abortion are drops in the demographic bucket. The real missing billions are the babies who were simply never conceived. They weren't conceived because their would-be elder brothers and sisters survived, or because women's lives improved. In the rich West, Mom went to college and decided that putting three children through graduate school would be unaffordable. In the poor Eastern or Southern parts of the globe, Mom found a sweatshop job and didn't need a fourth or fifth child to fetch firewood.\n''On a farm, children help with the pigs or chickens,'' explained Joseph Chamie, director of the United Nations population division. Nearly half the world's people live in cities now, he said, ''and when you move to a city, children are not as helpful.''\nBeyond that, simple public health measures like dams for clean water, vitamins for pregnant women, hand-washing for midwives, oral rehydration salts for babies, vaccines for youngsters and antibiotics for all helped double world life expectancy in the 20th century, to 60 years from 30.\nMore surviving children means less incentive to give birth as often. As late as 1970, the world's median fertility level was 5.4 births per woman; in 2000, it was 2.9. Barring war, famine, epidemic or disaster, a country needs a birthrate of 2.1 children per woman to hold steady.\nThe best-known example of shrinkage is Italy, whose women were once symbols of fecundity partly because of the country's peasant traditions and partly because of its Roman Catholicism, which rejects birth control. By 2000, Italy's fertility rate was Western Europe's lowest, at 1.2 births per woman. Its population is expected to drop 20 percent by midcentury.\nItaly plummeted right past wealthy, liberal, Protestant Denmark, where women got birth control early. Denmark was below population replacement level in 1970, at 2.0 births per woman, and slid to 1.7 by 2001. In Europe's poorest country, Albania, where rural people still live in armed clan compounds, the 1970 rate of 5.1 births per woman fell to 2.1 in 1999.\nEven in North Africa, regarded as the great exception to the shrinking population trend, birthrates have dropped somewhat. Egypt's, for example, went from 5.4 births per woman in 1970 to 3.6 in 1999. Mr. Chamie, of the United Nations, says the numbers refute what he calls the ''myth of Muslim fertility,'' an unfair characterization, he says, that will disappear as the lives of Muslim women ease. Jordanians, for example, he said, had eight children per woman in the 1960's; now the rate is 3.5. (Across the river, Israel's numbers went from four in the 1950's to 2.7 today.) In Tunisia and Iran, the number may be close to two children, he said.\nOld notions of Asian fertility are similarly false. China has pushed its fertility rate below that of France; Japan's population is withering with age; and after five decades of industrialization, South Korea, a mostly rural country with six births per woman during its civil war in the 1950's, now has 1.17 births per woman.\nAlarmed by the trends, many countries are paying citizens to get pregnant. Estonia pays for a year's maternity leave. The treasurer of Australia, Peter Costello, introduced $2,000-per-baby subsidies in that country's 2004 budget. He told his fellow citizens to ''go home and do your patriotic duty tonight.''\nJapanese prefectures, tackling the problem at an earlier stage, arrange singles' cruises. Unique among developed countries, the United States has little need to finance romance because its birthrate has held steady at 2.13 per woman. Its growth, about three million people a year, is mostly fueled by immigration, as it has been since the Mayflower.\nHalf the world's population growth is in six countries: India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh and China (despite its slowed birthrate). That makes doom-saying trickier than it was in 1968, when Paul R. Ehrlich frightened everyone with his book ''The Population Bomb.'' Fertility shifts in individual countries are notoriously unpredictable, said Nicholas Eberstadt, a population expert at the American Enterprise Institute, so one might just as well use a Ouija board to predict the fallout.\nLocal changes can be even harder to anticipate. Calcutta, for example, once the epitome of overcrowding, is starting to shrink, Mr. Eberstadt said.\nThe father of the population bomb, Dr. Ehrlich, a professor of population studies and biology at Stanford, says he was ''pleasantly surprised'' by global changes that have undermined the book's gloomiest projections. They include China's one-child policy and the rapid adoption of better seeds and fertilizers by Third World farmers, meaning that more mouths can be fed, even if just with corn porridge and rice. (He notes, however, quoting United Nations figures, that about 600 million people go to bed hungry each night.) But Dr. Ehrlich still argues that the earth's ''optimal population size'' is two billion. That's different from the maximum supportable size, which depends on the consumption of resources.\n''I have severe doubts that we can support even two billion if they all live like citizens of the U.S.,'' he said. ''The world can support a lot more vegetarian saints than Hummer-driving idiots.''"}, {"text": "Metro Briefing\n2004-02-26T05:00:00.000Z\n NEW YORK \n QUEENS: FERRY SERVICE SEEN FOR LA GUARDIA The operators of La Guardia Airport said yesterday that they had begun soliciting bids from companies to provide ferry service to the airport from downtown Manhattan. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that operates the airport, will select a ferry operator later this year, a spokesman said. New York Waterway ran a ferry service to La Guardia's Marine Air Terminal, but discontinued it. The company recently submitted a proposal for the planned service, a company spokesman said last night.

I can't remember what led me to present her with a long white-and-gold feather boa in front of 35 fourth-graders, seeing as she was neither a stripper nor Phyllis Diller, but I do remember her puzzled response: \"Why did you get me this?\"\nMy crime isn't that I'm a thoughtless gift-giver, but rather the opposite. I can't breeze in to the Body Shop, mentally divide my friends into lavenders and jasmines and waltz out a few minutes later with 15 cellophane-wrapped baskets. Instead I see every gift as an opportunity to prove to my recipients how incredibly well I know them. Unfortunately, it seems that I am a terrible interpreter of personality.\nLast year, a few weeks before his birthday, my alpha male boyfriend mentioned that he was considering giving up coffee. To me it seemed so simple: what would make him happier than an herbal tea diffuser? It turned out to be about as welcome as a floral-scented copy of Barbra Streisand's \"Greatest Hits.\" We almost broke up.\nMy anxiety over buying gifts, combined with the way that New York after Thanksgiving takes on the oppressive bustle of a Bangladesh market, leads me to procrastinate longer every year. As of mid-December I had made exactly one reluctant shopping trip, which resulted in one purchase: a gift for myself, which I already hate. Who knew the \"Ally McBeal\" soundtrack would not hold up? I had hit a new shopping low.\nIt was in this state that I had volunteered so willingly to try the services of Kim Akhtar, the founder of Garde Robe, a wardrobe storage company that also provides personal shopping (www.garderobeonline .com). Her Oxford University accent assured me that I was in the hands of someone far more capable than myself. For $125 an hour she would do all my shopping (a fee that was coming out of someone else's wallet, not mine). I asked her what information she needed for each person on my list. \"If you like, you can just write 'Lou -- Boss' or 'Phyllis -- Mother,' and I can go off of that,\" she said. \"Other people prefer to give me a little more.\"\nI decided on more, and immediately set to writing up complete dossiers on each of the 20 people on my list, including what I thought were helpful observations about their most distinctive traits. My insights, however, seemed to confuse Ms. Akhtar. \"Your work friend Jasper,\" she said when she called the next day to clarify a few things. \"You wrote here that he's 'a silly pervert' who's into 'weird stuff.' \" She paused. \"Did you have a specific item in mind for him?\"\nMy tips about Jasper didn't sound as helpful once I heard a reasonable adult say them aloud. We agreed that perhaps he wouldn't mind taking a break from being silly in order to enjoy a nice tie. A similar discussion ensued about my friend Jana, whom I had described in my note as a huge dog lover. I was urging a gift for the dog. Ms. Akhtar gently lobbied for a gift for Jana herself.\nAfter a few more clarifications Ms. Akhtar hustled off, promising to be back in a few hours. She said she has a hit rate of about seven gifts an hour, which is more gifts than I have purchased in all of 2004. So there I was on the next-to-last shopping weekend before Christmas with nothing to do but lie on my couch all day and watch the \"America's Next Top Model\" marathon on VH1. It was as relaxed as I've been in months.\nAfter about two hours of shopping Ms. Akhtar put her dance training to use by carrying 12 shopping bags to my sixth-floor walk-up. When the gifts were laid out, I was amazed. Somehow she had channeled my vaguely absurd directions into tangible, pleasing gifts -- and most were less than $100 each.\nMy parents were the first beneficiaries. I presented them with their Hanukkah presents with one night of the holiday left to spare. My father, who is writing a book on Herman Melville, received a rare first edition of Melville's \"Journal Up the Straits,\" which literally caused his jaw to drop. I doubt that the whale poster I had had in mind would have had quite the same impact. And my mother, whom I had described as someone who never indulges in any kind of luxury for herself, received a fantastically mushy cashmere shawl that put a huge smile on her face and into which she immediately swaddled herself for the evening.\nThe not necessarily heartwarming, but very practical, lesson learned: sometimes it takes a total stranger to know what those closest to you really want."}, {"text": "World Briefings\n2004-05-22T05:00:00.000Z\n AMERICAS \n CUBA: CITIZENSHIP FOR BAY OF PIGS EXILES Cuba restored citizenship to seven veterans of the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion in a gesture of reconciliation toward Cuban exiles living in the United States.

Finally, it was decided to skip a mourning ceremony for dignitaries altogether, and Mr. Arafat was quickly lowered into the ground.\n These passionate scenes were a remarkable contrast to the official and sterile dignity of Mr. Arafat's Cairo funeral service, earlier in the day, which was restricted to officials . But the Cairo service was a chance for Arab leaders in particular, who did not want to travel into Israeli-occupied territory, to pay homage to a man whom many had disliked over his 40-year-career and whose goal of an independent Palestinian state they were slow to embrace. And it was also where Mr. Arafat's wife, Suha, paid her tearful respects, along with their daughter, Zahwa, aged 9.\n The scenes here were a vivid reflection of the grief of a people, many of them young and angry, who had lost the only leader most of them could remember. There were tough young men with black clothes, masks and guns, thin young men with gelled hair and blue jeans and a number of young women, too, in tightly wrapped headscarves.\n One of them, Nisrin Dabaka, 25, said, \"I loved the rais,\" using the Arabic word for president. \"He is like a father to me, and to me he did not die. He is in my heart, and I will never forget this day in all of my life.\"\n But there were also people like Mazen E. Qupty, a Palestinian Israeli who lives in Jerusalem, who drives a Volvo at home but who walked most of the way here with his son, through Israeli checkpoints that stopped most car traffic. Mr. Qupty, like nearly everyone here, wanted to attend a historic moment in the life of the Palestinian people and to pay his respects, and he wanted this memory especially for his son.\n \"This is a sad day, it's sad to lose him, whether you agreed with him or not,\" Mr. Qupty said of Mr. Arafat. \"But it's also a day to show all the world that Palestinians care for peace, and that it is Sharon, not Arafat, who is the real obstacle to peace.\" He was referring to the Ariel Sharon, prime minister of Israel.\n Asked about the legacy of Mr. Arafat, Muhammad Halayka stopped and said: \"Imagine if he didn't exist. We Palestinians would be a displaced people, dispersed among the Lebanese and the Egyptians and the Syrians. We would have been spread out among the Arabs and be part of a Palestinian minority here and there and everywhere. It was Arafat who grasped the idea of a unified identity and worked to create for us a homeland.\"\n Daoud Kuttab of Al Quds University in Jerusalem also wanted to be at the funeral even though Mr. Arafat jailed him for a week in 1997, simply for broadcasting a legislative session about corruption. \"I wouldn't have missed this,\" Mr. Kuttab said. \"His charisma and what he's done for the Palestinian people allow us to forgive him his mistakes. I have no bitterness at all.\"\n Palestinians would remember Mr. Arafat fondly as a man who refused to yield on certain key principles, Mr. Kuttab said. \"He refused to give up on Jerusalem, on a recognition of the 1967 borders and a fair resolution of the refugee issue,\" Mr. Kuttab said. \"No Palestinian now will accept a Palestinian state without a part of Jerusalem or one divided into cantons or an unfair resolution of the refugee question.\"\n Mr. Arafat's most prominent successor, Mahmoud Abbas, may have different tactics, Palestinians here agreed, especially with his condemnation of terrorism and suicide bombings, but his fundamental political goals are little different. \n Palestinians here were also proud of the respect shown to Mr. Arafat by the French president, Jacques Chirac, and by the Arab and western leaders in Egypt. \"Who else had three funerals like this?\" asked Hisham Abdallah. \"First France, then Cairo, then here.\" It showed that Mr. Arafat was not irrelevant, as Israel and the United States insisted, but a global figure, Mr. Abdallah said. \n The chaos and frenzy of the event itself made it a people's funeral, suggested Nabil Aburudeineh, the aide who was always at Mr. Arafat's side. \"It wasn't as planned,\" he conceded, \"but I'm happy that the people here have the full right to come and say goodbye to their leader.\" Palestinians were grateful to the Egyptians, he said, for the dignity of the ceremony there.\n \"But all who came here will keep the principles of Arafat, to fight for independence and liberty,\" Mr. Shaath said. \"They will continue carrying the flag he raised 30 years ago, and it will be a continuing present.\"\n Palestinians in Gaza were prevented by Israeli travel restrictions from coming to Ramallah, so held a service of their own, marching in a symbolic funeral synchronized with the actual one in Ramallah. It began at Mr. Arafat's other battle-scarred compound on the Mediterranean coast, where members of his security service put a poster of him in the front passenger seat of his black Mercedes, with his famous checkered keffiyeh on the headrest.\n His guards surrounded the car as it pulled out of the compound, to be joined by a small number of women. They chanted together, \"We are going to Jerusalem, a million martyrs,\" and \"Abu Ammar, you are our beloved, give us a Kalashnikov.\"\n Some of the security guards fired intermittently into the air.\n The car traveled to the Omari mosque, in the old center of the city, where thousands packed the narrow streets, including members of militant factions like Hamas. Two coffins, one draped with the Palestinian flag and the other covered with pictures of Mr. Arafat, were then carried by the crowd from the mosque to his compound.\n The ceremony in Egypt that began the day was at a military mosque at Cairo's airport and restricted to kings, potentates, foreign officials and diplomats. The public was not allowed anywhere near, with traffic halted and armed security forces stationed on all rooftops and even in mosque minarets along the brief, 150-yard route of \nthe funeral march on Cairo's main airport road. Homeowners in apartments lining the road were evidently told not to even open their windows.\n It was a state funeral service for a man without a state.\n Speaking at the mosque prayers, Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, the grand sheikh of Al-Azhar and Egypt's highest religious figure, said brief prayers over \nthe coffin resting on the patterned black and white marble floor. \"He has served his people all his life, until he faced his God, with courage and honesty,\" the sheikh said. \"Let us pray for his soul.\" \n Most of the pantheon of Arab leaders flew in for the occasion, some landing at the very last minute and chosing to overlook often bitter differences with the Palestinian leader. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and King Abdullah II of Jordan, both of whose fathers had long sparred with Mr. Arafat, attended, as did Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. The presidents of Algeria, Tunisia, Yemen, Sudan and Lebanon were there, along with a host of princes from the royal houses of the Persian Gulf.\n From farther afield, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa came as did the presidents of Indonesia, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. There was a sprinkling of prime ministers, although European Union nations were represented by their foreign ministers. The United States sent Assistant Secretary of State William Burns.\nNeil MacFarquhar contributed to this report from Cairo and Greg Myre from Gaza City."}, {"text": "NBC Sports Considering a Return to the N.F.L.\n2004-10-15T05:00:00.000Z\nDoes NBC have a yen to carry the National Football League again?\nIn 1998, it got out of televising N.F.L. games, having refused to outbid CBS for the American Football Conference package and ABC for \"Monday Night Football.\" Ever since, NBC has carried the XFL and the Arena Football League.\nPat Bowlen, the Denver Broncos' owner and the chairman of the N.F.L.'s broadcasting committee, said NBC was considering a return.\nHas he talked to NBC?\n\"Yes,\" said Bowlen, who said he had talked to Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Universal Sports.\nIs NBC interested?\n\"Yes,\" Bowlen said.\nBut how would he and the league coax NBC to enter what could be the type of money-losing deal it had vowed never to revisit? The price of entry for each network -- now $550 million annually -- will not tumble in the next deal, which will start after next season.\n\"I don't have to convince them,\" Bowlen said Wednesday from Denver. \"Either they get in the game or not.\"\nKevin Sullivan, a spokesman for NBC Universal Sports, said, \"If there's a good deal to be made, we're always interested.\"\nBowlen said that the urgency to make a new deal in the coming months had lessened, which dovetailed with ABC and ESPN's desire not to negotiate until after this season (which may give them time to study whether ABC will keep money-losing \"Monday Night\" or let ESPN take it).\nCBS and Fox would not mind renewing their deals sooner, at modest annual price increases. So far this season, only Fox's ratings are up, by 3 percent. The others have fallen: CBS's by 8 percent, ABC's by 3 percent and ESPN's by 5 percent.\nAssuming that NBC carries Nascar past 2006, it would not chase Sunday afternoon games, but could pursue the Sunday or Monday night packages. But for its USA network corporate sibling, NBC could seek a package of eight prime-time Thursday and Saturday night games that would start on Thanksgiving. Other cable networks like TNT could also covet that deal.\n\"There's going to be money in that package,\" Bowlen said, \"and there seems to be interest.\"\nIf the N.F.L. can sell a cable network on a Thursday-Saturday deal, it would be found money, perhaps $200 million or $300 million annually.\nBut Bowlen said the league would have to surmount a major obstacle to play on six Thursday nights, which would create a short week for players. \"Thursday games are hard to play, especially if you're a visiting team,\" he said.\nOne option to carry the six Thursday games and two Saturday games would be the NFL Network. \"Judging by how well it's done in 11 months, we have to look at it as a viable medium that we could put games on,\" Bowlen said.\nBut he did not say what would have to occur to put games on the N.F.L.'s in-house channel in the next contract.\n\"We don't have to be on a fast track to put games on our network,\" Bowlen said. \"But that would make it more successful. We're patient. We're delighted with where it is.\"\nCleaning Up Halftime\nThe N.F.L. vowed earlier this year never to let another wardrobe malfunction, or anything dirty, befoul the Super Bowl halftime. Yesterday it chose Don Mischer, who produced the Michael Jackson halftime show in 1993 (when the singer grabbed his crotch numerous times), to keep February's show safe for families and from fines by the Federal Communications Commission.\nMischer said that he and the league would be close collaborators on every aspect of the halftime and pregame shows -- far different from his experience 11 years go.\n\"We had one meeting, where we sketched out the show,\" Mischer said, \"but we got no notes comments back, and no one attended the rehearsals. There was more trust back then.\"\nMischer said that Janet Jackson's breast-baring in February would not send the league back to Up With People-type entertainment.\n\"The league said it's important not to overreact,\" he said. \"We want the show to be meaningful, to make people feel something.\"\nMischer recently made news when, as the executive producer of the Democratic National Convention, he was accidentally heard on CNN shouting a swearword when balloons failed to descend on time.\n'Real Sports' on Camel Jockeys\nHBO's \"Real Sports\" (Tuesday, 10 p.m. Eastern) delivers its best, most provocative work ever: Bernard Goldberg's devastating 20-minute report on boys, some as young as 3, who have been sold or smuggled from Bangladesh and Pakistan to be camel jockeys in the United Arab Emirates.\nGoldberg and the producer Joe Perskie show the camels living in luxury, while the boys are denied sleep and food; some are put in chains for misbehaving, others are raped. The United Arab Emirates had promised twice to bar the use of under-age jockeys, but hidden camera footage depicts the miserable conditions the boys live under and the rescue operations undertaken by a Pakistani human rights activist to return them to their homes."}, {"text": "Environmental refugees : When the soil dies and the well dries\n2004-02-14T05:00:00.000Z\nIn mid-October 2003, Italian authorities discovered a boat carrying refugees from Africa bound for Italy. Adrift for more than two weeks and without fuel, food and water, many of the passengers had died. At first the dead were tossed overboard. But after a point, the remaining survivors lacked the strength to hoist the bodies over the side.\nThe refugees were believed to be Somalis. We do not know whether they were political, economic or environmental refugees.\nFailed states like Somalia produce all three. Somalia is an ecological basket case, with overpopulation, overgrazing and desertification destroying its pastoral economy.\nAlthough the modern world has extensive experience with people migrating for political and economic reasons, we are now seeing a swelling flow of refugees driven from their homes by environmental pressures.\nModern experience with this phenomenon in the United States began when nearly three million \"Okies\" from the southern Great Plains left during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, many of them moving to California.\nToday, bodies wash ashore daily in Italy, France and Spain, the result of desperate acts by desperate people in Africa. And each day hundreds of Mexicans risk their lives trying to cross the U.S. border, many after abandoning plots of land too small or too eroded to make a living. Another flow of environmental refugees comes from Haiti, where the land is denuded of vegetation and the soil is washing into the sea.\nAmerica's Dust Bowl refugees were early examples of environmental migration, but their numbers will pale compared with what lies ahead if we continue with business as usual. Among the new refugees are people being forced to move because of wells running dry.\nThus far the evacuations have been of villages, but eventually whole cities might have to be relocated, such as Sana, the capital of Yemen, or Quetta, the capital of Pakistan's Baluchistan Province.\nThe World Bank expects Sana, where the water table is falling by six meters (20 feet) a year, to have exhausted its remaining water supply by 2010. Quetta, originally designed for 50,000 people, now has 1 million inhabitants, all of whom depend on 2,000 wells pumping water deep from underground, depleting what is believed to be a fossil or nonreplenishable aquifer. Like Sana, Quetta may have enough water for the rest of this decade, but then its future is in doubt.\nMost of the nearly three billion people to be added to the world's population by 2050 will live in countries where water tables are already falling and where population growth swells the ranks of those sinking into hydrological poverty. Water refugees are likely to become commonplace.\nVillages in northwestern India have been abandoned because overpumping had depleted the local aquifers and villagers could no longer reach water. Millions of villagers in northern and western China and in parts of Mexico may have to move because of a lack of water.\nSpreading deserts are also displacing people. In China, where the Gobi Desert is growing by 10,400 square kilometers (4,000 square miles) a year, the refugee stream is swelling. A photograph in Desert Witness, a book on desertification by the Chinese photographer Lu Tongjing, shows what looks like a perfectly normal village in the western reaches of Inner Mongolia \u2014 except for one thing. There are no people. Its 4,000 residents were forced to leave because the aquifer was depleted, leaving them with no water.\nIn Iran, villages abandoned because of spreading deserts already number in the thousands. In the vicinity of Damavand, a small town within an hour's drive of Tehran, 88 villages have been abandoned.\nIn Nigeria, 3,500 square kilometers of land become desert each year, making desertification the country's leading environmental problem.\nAnother source of refugees, potentially a huge one, is rising seas. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in a study in early 2001, reported that the sea level could rise by nearly one meter (3 feet) this century. But research completed since then indicates that ice is melting much faster than earlier reported, suggesting that the rise may be much higher.\nEven a one-meter rise in sea level would inundate half of Bangladesh's rice-growing land, forcing the relocation of 40 million people. Other Asian countries with rice-growing river floodplains, including China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, could bolster the mass exodus from rising seas to the hundreds of millions.\nThe rising flow of environmental refugees is yet another indicator that modern civilization is out of sync with the earth's natural support systems.\nAmong other things, it tells us that we need a worldwide effort to fill the family planning gap and to create the social conditions that will accelerate the shift to smaller families, a global campaign to raise water productivity, and an energy strategy that will cut carbon dioxide emissions and stabilize the earth's climate.\n*\nThe writer is president of the Earth Policy Institute.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, {"text": "Myanmar\n2004-07-15T05:00:00.000Z\n GEOGRAPHY Location: NW region of Southeast Asia.

(Until the summer of 1989 this country was known as Burma.) Burma, an independent Buddhist monarchy from the 11th century, fell to the Mongol empire in the 13th century, and after the 14th century was a satellite state of China. Anglo-French rivalry over trade left Burma under French influence in the early 19th century, but in a series of three wars (1824&#x2013;26, 1852, 1885), Great Britain succeeded in bringing all of Burma into the British raj of India. The country became self-governing under a British protectorate in 1937. Japanese occupation of Burma in early 1942 made the country a major theater of fighting during World War II. The Burma Road, built by the Allies to connect northeastern India with southwestern China, was a key link in bringing supplies to the Chinese Nationalist army during the war. Burma achieved independence as the Union of Burma on Jan. 4, 1948. Promises of autonomy for ethnic minority regions such as the Shan and Karen States have not been fulfilled, leading to armed separatist movements in those areas ever since. In 1962 a coup led by Gen. Ne Win overthrew the democratic government and established a one-party state under the Burmese Socialist Program party. The party's &#x201C;Burmese Path to Socialism&#x201D; resulted in self-imposed international isolation and economic stagnation at home despite the country's potential wealth in agriculture, timber, minerals, and gems. In July 1988 Ne Win resigned from office in the face of mounting popular demonstrations. A series of short-lived successor governments were unable to restore public order and normal governmental functions; direct military rule was announced in September 1988 as demonstrations continued. In the general election held on May 27, 1990 (the first multiparty free elections in three decades), the opposition National League for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won a decisive victory, but the results of the election were nullified by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), and leaders of the elected government were placed under house arrest. In 1991 the continued political repression in Myanmar was brought to international attention when Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This helped usher in a period of diminishing repression. A new leader of the ruling military junta, Gen. Than Shwe, began peace talks with the Karen rebels in early 1994, and released Aung San Suu Kyi in July 1995. In 1998, renewed pressure by NLD upon the junta (since Nov. 1997 renamed the State Peace and Development Council) to convene the 1990 parliament brought renewed repression and mass arrests; a committee of NLD delcared itself to be the legal parliament of Myanmar in September, asserting that all the junta legislation since 1990 was null and void. After releasing Aung from her 14-month arrest in May 2002, the junta &#x201C;detained&#x201D; Aung and 19 other NLD members in May 2003. In Sept. 2002 three grandsons of Ne Win and a son-in-law were sentenced to death for treason (an alleged coup attempt); Ne Win himself died suddenly shortly after. "}, {"text": "Medical tourism : Border hopping for cheaper and faster care gains converts\n2004-04-24T05:00:00.000Z\nPARIS\u2014  Last year, Anne and John DesJardins faced the prospect of a large, unwelcome expense. Over the previous two years, Anne had broken two of her teeth. As they looked into treatment, they found that in both France and the United States \u2014 the two countries where the couple spends most of their time \u2014 the cost of two bridges runs to $5,200. \n The DesJardins decided to take a wider perspective. When the first tooth broke during a trip to Thailand, they had had it extracted there by a dentist who had been trained in the United States. He charged only $30. By contrast, the second extraction in Miami cost $350. \n \"That opened our eyes that you could get good medical attention in other places,\" said John DesJardins. \n The DesJardins carry an international executive insurance policy. But health insurance \u2014 whether provided privately or by governments \u2014 has notoriously low coverage for dentistry and optometry. In the DesJardins's case, their policy provided only \u20ac715 per year, or about $845, for dental work. That meant an out-of-pocket expense of more than \u20ac3,500, even if Anne drew the procedures out over two policy years. \n Although they considered Thailand, which has been gaining a reputation as an inexpensive alternative for medical care, they were not up to the trek. Friends in Paris had heard that dentistry was very good and inexpensive in Hungary. Some checking on the Internet indicated that the Hungarian town of Sopron was a mecca for those suffering from sticker shock on dental work. \n Sopron is a 50-minute drive from Vienna, attracting many Austrian patients. The small town economy thrives on it. While a typical town of 20,000 might have about 20 dentists and 20 optometrists, noted DesJardins, Sopron has more than 200 of each. \n The couple found a dentist via the Internet who spoke English. The cost for Anne's two bridges: \u20ac990, or about 20 percent of the cost in France. Add the cost of two \u20ac159 round-trip air fares from France to Vienna, plus local transportation, a hotel room in Sopron for \u20ac34 a night (the dentist was located in the inn where they lodged), and the couple saved about \u20ac2,500. The insurer is reimbursing \u20ac346.50. \n During the eight days of treatment, they also took advantage of their proximity to Vienna to tour sites and to try the cuisine. Anne is a chef, and John markets gourmet foods. \n Sopron is not the only destination in what is becoming a global market for health care services, often described as \"medical tourism.\" Germans travel the 140 kilometers from Berlin to Szczecin in northeast Poland to save money on dental care. And in southern California, both the insured and the uninsured drive to Tijuana, Mexico, to take advantage of dentists who frequently do not require co-payments and whose prices are a fraction of that of their peers across the border. \n Such cross-border arbitrage of medical costs is not new. Although he has a group health insurance plan through his wife's job, Ron Carlton, an independent software systems engineer, has been making the 45-minute drive from San Diego to Tijuana to visit Gerardo Vargas, a dentist, for the past 15 years. He said he had saved up to $1,000 on a special zirconium oxide crown. \n But if the phenomenon is not altogether new, circumstances have improved. Carlton said that 15 years ago, his dentist did not have all the modern technology. \"But now they are up-to-date,\" he said. \n He has brought an uninsured friend to Tijuana for dental care. \"I think he ended up spending $200 or $300 for 10 fillings,\" said Carlton, who added that most of the medical tourism to Tijuana was generated by word of mouth. \"It is not easy to find out about it,\" he said. \n Of course, dentistry is generally considered minor surgery, but increasingly people are willing to go abroad for everything from reconstructive and plastic surgery to orthopedic surgery like hip and knee replacement and even coronary bypass and liver transplants. And they are willing to travel further. \n Motivation varies. Some patients do it to save money; others because a procedure they require in home countries like Britain and Canada is rationed and requires a long wait. \n Lastly, there are patients who believe the quality of medical care is better elsewhere, or there is a more advanced procedure available in a foreign country that is not available at home. \n For an example which encompasses all three, take the case of Aafke Gerrits, a Dutch widow in her 60s. After successful treatment for breast cancer that required the removal of one breast, she asked her Dutch physician for reconstructive breast surgery. He claimed it was unnecessary at her age. Gerrits argued that in her home she had many antiques, \"and when the upholstery frays, I get them reupholstered.\" The physician relented. \n Gerrits waited a year until she was sufficiently recovered to have the operation. Then an implant was placed where her breast had been. She had to visit the hospital in Amsterdam every two weeks while they molded the breast to match the other. However, after some time, she complained, the implant grew hard. The procedure was never completed, as her plastic surgeon left the government hospital where she had had the surgery to go into private practice. \n While the Netherlands provides universal health insurance, people whose income exceeds \u20ac35,000, must also have private insurance, which Gerrits has. The correcting operation, she said, was quoted at \u20ac29,000 in the Netherlands, and was supposed to be covered by her insurer. But she was told she would have to wait two years or more. \n Instead, Gerrits decided to have her surgery done in Venezuela, where her son and daughter-in-law work as executives. \"In Venezuela they are much better at plastic surgery because everyone is walking around nearly completely nude, and everyone has their boobs and butts reshaped,\" said Gerrits. \n Gerrits's daughter-in-law found a surgeon who was qualified as an oncologist, a plastic surgeon and a reconstructive surgeon. He had been educated in the United States and spoke English. \n Before the surgery, she had to arrange for extensive paperwork from her Dutch physicians to be translated into English, describing her blood pressure, diabetes problems and other conditions. After a series of blood tests, X-rays and other examinations, she was admitted to the hospital. \n \"It was very nice and even cleaner than in Holland,\" she said. She had a private room, whereas in the Netherlands she would have had to share a ward with four others. The procedure cost $10,000. Including air fare, it was $12,500. Gerrits said her private insurer refused to reimburse her, citing neglect to obtain prior approval. \n Gerrits, who remained in Caracas for weeks after the operation and is now healthily and happily home, said it was worth the cost since she did not have to wait two more years. \n That is the same attitude of some British patients. Rather than face delays that could stretch into several years with the National Health Service, they are willing to pay privately for procedures in Belgium or France. \n Two years ago, Charles Seadon, a refugee from the dot-com bust, founded European Medical Care, a service that arranges for foreigners to have operations at Belgian hospitals. Most of his clients, he said, are British, who most often request orthopedic surgery: hip replacement, knee replacement or hip resurfacing. Seadon noted that in Wales there is as much as a five- or six-year wait for orthopedic surgery. \n He said people can choose to have surgery done in Belgium with a lead time of about two weeks. The cost is about half of what private medicine costs in Britain. He cited the case of a soccer player from Northern Ireland who needed a simple knee arthroscopy \u2014 a keyhole surgery that takes 20 minutes. Seadon claimed it cost \u00a31,400, or about $2,380, in Belgium, far below the \u00a33,000 it might cost in Britain. And most nurses in the Flemish section of Brussels speak English, he added. \n Seadon said his clients also come from Pakistan and the Gulf region with a trickle from the United States. Those from the Gulf, he said, usually come for heart surgery, like heart valve reconstruction, and stem cell work, where a damaged heart wall can be rejuvenated through stem cell implants. Such an operation might cost \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000, he said, and patients from the Gulf are willing to pay out of pocket for it. \n Meanwhile, countries like Thailand and India are marketing themselves as the ultimate low-cost destinations for medical tourism. Bangkok Hospital has an International Medical Centre which features translators in 26 languages, capacity to handle religious dietary restrictions, as well as a wing devoted to Japanese patients. \n Jane Bailey, international marketing executive at the International Medical Centre, said that the largest contingent of international patients at the hospital were from Bangladesh, followed by the United States, the Middle East, the Netherlands and Britain. A large percentage of the U.S. and British patients were expats living in Asia and were covered by some sort of worldwide medical insurance. Bailey said they must first contact their insurer and have a guaranty sent to the hospital. Other patients are tourists. But a growing percentage are enticed by the low cost and short wait for treatment. \n Statistics from the Tourism Authority of Thailand show that in 2002, the latest data available, foreign patients seeking treatment in Thailand grew by 13 percent over the previous year, with 632,000 foreigners visiting 33 private hospitals. Some 10 percent traveled to Thailand specifically for medical treatment. \n * \n If Thailand has made significant inroads, India also regards itself as a candidate for medical tourism. A full hip replacement that costs as much as $39,000 in New York is advertised at $3,000 in India. \n Not surprisingly, surgeons in highly developed countries with expensive health systems are quick to point out the risks. Dr. Vijay Rasquina, an orthopedic surgeon trained in India who has practiced in India, Britain and is now at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said that patients who travel half way around the world to have an operation and immediately fly back are getting poor medical advice. Post-operative air travelers and those who have had orthopedic procedures are at much higher risk of developing blood clots, or deep vein thrombosis, than ordinary passengers. \n Another problem, said Rasquina, is a lack of follow-up care. \"If you do an operation in India, who is going to do the follow-up and the long-term care?\" he asked. \"And if there are post-surgery complications, you are going to have the ethical problem of dealing with it.\" \n He added, \"Frequently dealing with complications is much more expensive than dealing correctly with the problem in the first place.\" He estimated that complications could run from three times to five times the cost of the original operation. \"So there is a question of who pays for that, and in the United States, the surgeon may not want to deal with it, because it was not his mistake,\" he said. \n However, Rasquina admitted that the level of medical care was advancing significantly in countries like India and medical tourism is growing. When he finished medical school there 20 years ago, he said, India was 50 years behind the times in orthopedic surgery. Now, he estimates, it is three years behind the most advanced countries. \n * \n Sharon Reier is a freelance journalist based in Paris. \n [Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.] "}, {"text": "Old Is Everywhere, So a Charity Tries On the New\n2004-11-09T05:00:00.000Z\nThe day Grace Jones's hooded leather Azzedine Ala\u00efa dress comes through the door at a Housing Works Thrift store, both the dress and Eduardo Bennett, the charity's women's wear expert, are going to walk. That, anyway, is what Mr. Bennett said with a laugh last week, as he threaded his way through a maze of garments hung from overhead racks in a Queens warehouse down the block from a depot for the online food market Fresh Direct.\nFresh is about the last thing anyone might call the stuff sold at the four Housing Works shops in Manhattan, and that is precisely the point. There was a time when used clothes were termed castoffs and not fancied up as \"vintage,\" when thrift stores were still Aladdin's caves for bargain hunters with fashion sense and a sharp eye.\nThose days, it would appear, are over. Blame a culture of recycling, or Miuccia Prada or the general failure of designers even to attempt innovation anymore. Whatever the reason, old is the new new. And it is a truth people in the secondhand clothes business know only too well.\n\"The competition is wising up,\" Matthew Bernardo, the president of Housing Works Thrift stores said last week, referring to both the supply side and the demand. Where charities once relied on clueless but genteel blue-haired volunteers to stand sentinel over other people's castoffs, now a solid knowledge of eBay comparables is required, as well as laser instincts for the fugitive unlabeled treasure from Stephen Sprouse.\nThe hunt for old clothes, Mr. Bernardo said, becomes more cutthroat daily, as vintage aficionados vie with museum curators, collectors and platoons of fanatical pickers, who swoop through the city's thrift stores looking for stock to keep the vintage maw fed. It is not rare, Mr. Bernardo said, to see the same faces making a circuit of Housing Works' stores three times a day.\nThey have to. These days, vintage is not just the province of resale stores. Even high-end retailers have entered the global trade. The Polo Sport store in SoHo and the DKNY on Madison Avenue have both sold vintage pieces alongside new clothes, and Bon March\u00e9 in Paris this fall transformed a large area on its second floor into a boutique selling old clothes next to new ones deliberately designed to look as though they had been around the block.\nIt is a struggle to keep pace. And so places like Housing Works -- long a favorite charity among New York's fashion elite -- are improvising new strategies, like a four-day benefit called Fashion4Action, which opens tomorrow with a benefit cocktail party given by the actress Natasha Richardson. It will then morph into a sample sale offering over $1 million worth of new salesroom samples donated by 80 designers, like Prada, Armani, Narciso Rodriguez and the tiny independent Palmer Jones. \"You have to come up with something to keep people coming in,\" Mr. Bernardo said.\nStill, the core of a nonprofit that will generate $9 million this year to support AIDS and homeless programs is not samples, but the mysterious matter that gets hauled from collection points around New York to the Housing Works depot.\nThere, in two daily shifts, 15 salaried sorters mine a mountain of donations, whose Sisyphean dimensions never seem to diminish. Roughly 10,000 garbage bags of clothes come into the warehouse every month, an increase of 30 percent from five years ago. \"Sometimes,\" said Ira Botor, the warehouse manager, \"it does feel like you're being closed in.\"\nThat observation seemed like an understatement last week, as Mr. Botor paused before an Everest of black plastic blobs, which so dwarfed his slight frame that any person of lesser fortitude might see it and run screaming into the street.\n\"People all decide to donate at the same time because they want the deduction,\" Mr. Botor explained, referring to the end-of-year Internal Revenue Service deadline. \"You get through it,\" he added flatly, as a platoon of workers loaded trolleys and wheeled the bags to sorting tables, tore them open and got to work.\nHands gloved against rash and the occasional outbreak of scabies, the sorters sifted the contents, dividing them into men's and women's wear categories, culling out the goods with soiled collars, frayed cuffs, woebegone crotches and mold (yes, mold.)\nThey tossed undergarments, elbowless sweaters and pilled flannel pajamas into bins to be sent to a rag jobber, who will repeat this sorting process with a liberal eye and send goods too damaged for resale in the United States to vendors in Guinea or Bangladesh.\n\"Things that are really, really unusable, they rag,\" Mr. Botor explained, referring to garments beyond any sartorial redemption. Even those will find use, however, he said, as stuffing for airplane seats.\nBut naturally, it is the high-end apparel that triggers the flow of adrenaline. \"Everyone here is trained to spot couture,\" Mr. Botor said. \"I test them to keep their knowledge of designers upgraded and to know the trends.\" This season, for instance, \"Tweeds are what people are buying, thrift-wise. It's like a department store where you have to keep up with what people want.\"\nJust as important is seducing consumers with what they do not know they want until it floats across their field of vision, direct from the closet of the model Iman, who recently donated a cache of dresses from Mr. Ala\u00efa and Thierry Mugler, or from the wardrobe of the soprano Roberta Peters, who recently gave away three decades of dresses and costumes, or from an anonymous Samaritan who not long ago dropped off a $10,000 Fendi fur dress from 1992 stuffed into a Conway bag.\nIt is true that there are times when the pickings get slim and the Hefty bags produce more St. John knits than 1960's suits from Pauline Trig\u00e8re. But then suddenly a donation arrives, as occurred during this reporter's visit, that has the distinct look of a lottery winning.\n\"I don't know who these people are that they can give these things away,\" said Mr. Bennett, stagily stroking his mane of luxuriant hair. He was referring to a donation of furs that included a nearly new man's trench coat lined with sheared mink and a woman's calf-length golden sable bearing a label from the uptown furrier Dennis Basso.\n\"Even I'm surprised she would give that away,\" Mr. Basso said last week, when notified of this anonymous act of largess. \"That's a $75,000 coat.\"\nThe sable will be sold at one of the charity's monthly silent auctions -- held at each of the stores -- for which, Mr. Bernardo said, the charity reserves its choicest finds. The practice has led some donors to gripe that their best donations never seem to make it to the stores, whose racks occasionally look crammed not with rarities but with designer licensee junk.\n\"People don't realize that if you live in Chelsea, you can't expect to see your stuff in Chelsea,\" Mr. Bernardo said, referring to the charity's two downtown stores, one on West 17th Street and the other on East 23rd. \"People also give us spring goods in fall, and obviously we can't sell it then,\" Mr. Bernardo explained.\nAnd sometimes goods float over the transom that would tax the abilities of the most creative merchant. \"We get some strange things,\" Mr. Bennett said, as he moved aside a rack containing clothes from Chanel, Ala\u00efa, Mr. Sprouse and Mr. Mugler to disclose a stupefying sight. \"It's Koos,\" he said, referring to the designer Koos van den Akker, who may prefer to forget that he once designed a patchwork adult onesie of metallic cloth and velvet, with a clownish collar and a pair of booties attached.\n\"This one I just can't see myself sending out there,\" Mr. Bennett said, and indeed the garment in question resembled a hazmat suit designed for Liberace. \"It's just too ugly to sell.\""}, {"text": "After Chaotic Procession, Arafat Is Laid to Rest in West Bank\n2004-11-12T05:00:00.000Z\nRAMALLAH, West Bank, Nov. 11 - Yasir Arafat was buried here today in an extraordinary scene of grief and chaos, with thousands of Palestinians climbing the walls of his compound, surging around his coffin and trying to bear it aloft.\n Despite firing volleys of gunfire into the sky, Palestinian security guards were unable to hold back a frenzied flow of mourners who poured over the internal courtyard, trampling the red carpet, trying to touch the coffin and engulfing the two Egyptian helicopters that brought Mr. Arafat and his entourage back home. \n Wails and chants of \"We will sacrifice our blood and souls to redeem you,\"\nand \"Yasir, Yasir,\" competed with gunfire from scores of young militants in Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement.\n For well over an hour, Palestinian security forces and political leaders struggled to bring some 20,000 mourners under control and move Mr. Arafat's coffin to a prepared burial spot of Jerusalem stone and black-and-green marble in the Ramallah compound, under five conifers. Finally, it was decided to skip a mourning ceremony for dignitaries altogether, and Mr. Arafat was quickly lowered into the ground.\n These passionate scenes were a remarkable contrast to the official and sterile dignity of Mr. Arafat's Cairo funeral service, earlier in the day, which was restricted to officials . But the Cairo service was a chance for Arab leaders in particular, who did not want to travel into Israeli-occupied territory, to pay homage to a man whom many had disliked over his 40-year-career and whose goal of an independent Palestinian state they were slow to embrace. And it was also where Mr. Arafat's wife, Suha, paid her tearful respects, along with their daughter, Zahwa, aged 9.\n The scenes here were a vivid reflection of the grief of a people, many of them young and angry, who had lost the only leader most of them could remember. There were tough young men with black clothes, masks and guns, thin young men with gelled hair and blue jeans and a number of young women, too, in tightly wrapped headscarves.\n One of them, Nisrin Dabaka, 25, said, \"I loved the rais,\" using the Arabic word for president. \"He is like a father to me, and to me he did not die. He is in my heart, and I will never forget this day in all of my life.\"\n But there were also people like Mazen E. Qupty, a Palestinian Israeli who lives in Jerusalem, who drives a Volvo at home but who walked most of the way here with his son, through Israeli checkpoints that stopped most car traffic. Mr. Qupty, like nearly everyone here, wanted to attend a historic moment in the life of the Palestinian people and to pay his respects, and he wanted this memory especially for his son.\n \"This is a sad day, it's sad to lose him, whether you agreed with him or not,\" Mr. Qupty said of Mr. Arafat. \"But it's also a day to show all the world that Palestinians care for peace, and that it is Sharon, not Arafat, who is the real obstacle to peace.\" He was referring to the Ariel Sharon, prime minister of Israel.\n Asked about the legacy of Mr. Arafat, Muhammad Halayka stopped and said: \"Imagine if he didn't exist. We Palestinians would be a displaced people, dispersed among the Lebanese and the Egyptians and the Syrians. We would have been spread out among the Arabs and be part of a Palestinian minority here and there and everywhere. It was Arafat who grasped the idea of a unified identity and worked to create for us a homeland.\"\n Daoud Kuttab of Al Quds University in Jerusalem also wanted to be at the funeral even though Mr. Arafat jailed him for a week in 1997, simply for broadcasting a legislative session about corruption. \"I wouldn't have missed this,\" Mr. Kuttab said. \"His charisma and what he's done for the Palestinian people allow us to forgive him his mistakes. I have no bitterness at all.\"\n Palestinians would remember Mr. Arafat fondly as a man who refused to yield on certain key principles, Mr. Kuttab said. \"He refused to give up on Jerusalem, on a recognition of the 1967 borders and a fair resolution of the refugee issue,\" Mr. Kuttab said. \"No Palestinian now will accept a Palestinian state without a part of Jerusalem or one divided into cantons or an unfair resolution of the refugee question.\"\n Mr. Arafat's most prominent successor, Mahmoud Abbas, may have different tactics, Palestinians here agreed, especially with his condemnation of terrorism and suicide bombings, but his fundamental political goals are little different. \n Palestinians here were also proud of the respect shown to Mr. Arafat by the French president, Jacques Chirac, and by the Arab and western leaders in Egypt. \"Who else had three funerals like this?\" asked Hisham Abdallah. \"First France, then Cairo, then here.\" It showed that Mr. Arafat was not irrelevant, as Israel and the United States insisted, but a global figure, Mr. Abdallah said. \n The chaos and frenzy of the event itself made it a people's funeral, suggested Nabil Aburudeineh, the aide who was always at Mr. Arafat's side. \"It wasn't as planned,\" he conceded, \"but I'm happy that the people here have the full right to come and say goodbye to their leader.\" Palestinians were grateful to the Egyptians, he said, for the dignity of the ceremony there.\n \"But all who came here will keep the principles of Arafat, to fight for independence and liberty,\" Mr. Shaath said. \"They will continue carrying the flag he raised 30 years ago, and it will be a continuing present.\"\n Palestinians in Gaza were prevented by Israeli travel restrictions from coming to Ramallah, so held a service of their own, marching in a symbolic funeral synchronized with the actual one in Ramallah. It began at Mr. Arafat's other battle-scarred compound on the Mediterranean coast, where members of his security service put a poster of him in the front passenger seat of his black Mercedes, with his famous checkered keffiyeh on the headrest.\n His guards surrounded the car as it pulled out of the compound, to be joined by a small number of women. They chanted together, \"We are going to Jerusalem, a million martyrs,\" and \"Abu Ammar, you are our beloved, give us a Kalashnikov.\"\n Some of the security guards fired intermittently into the air.\n The car traveled to the Omari mosque, in the old center of the city, where thousands packed the narrow streets, including members of militant factions like Hamas. Two coffins, one draped with the Palestinian flag and the other covered with pictures of Mr. Arafat, were then carried by the crowd from the mosque to his compound.\n The ceremony in Egypt that began the day was at a military mosque at Cairo's airport and restricted to kings, potentates, foreign officials and diplomats. The public was not allowed anywhere near, with traffic halted and armed security forces stationed on all rooftops and even in mosque minarets along the brief, 150-yard route of \nthe funeral march on Cairo's main airport road. Homeowners in apartments lining the road were evidently told not to even open their windows.\n It was a state funeral service for a man without a state.\n Speaking at the mosque prayers, Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, the grand sheikh of Al-Azhar and Egypt's highest religious figure, said brief prayers over \nthe coffin resting on the patterned black and white marble floor. \"He has served his people all his life, until he faced his God, with courage and honesty,\" the sheikh said. \"Let us pray for his soul.\" \n Most of the pantheon of Arab leaders flew in for the occasion, some landing at the very last minute and chosing to overlook often bitter differences with the Palestinian leader. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and King Abdullah II of Jordan, both of whose fathers had long sparred with Mr. Arafat, attended, as did Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. The presidents of Algeria, Tunisia, Yemen, Sudan and Lebanon were there, along with a host of princes from the royal houses of the Persian Gulf.\n From farther afield, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa came as did the presidents of Indonesia, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. There was a sprinkling of prime ministers, although European Union nations were represented by their foreign ministers. The United States sent Assistant Secretary of State William Burns.\nTerence Neilan reported from New York for this article and Neil MacFarquhar from Cairo."}, {"text": "'McFashion' puts squeeze on middle market\n2004-03-10T05:00:00.000Z\nLONDON\u2014  Fashion used to be simple for Britain's middle classes: there wasn't much of it around. So for most middle-class shopper-mothers, this meant Marks & Spencer, Britain's biggest clothing retailer, which has a store on every decent high street in Britain, selling M&S label merchandise from suits to swimwear. \n All this remains the same, except that M&S has been found exposed on two key points: price and fashionability. \n In the last few years, middle-ground operators from Germany to the United States have faced the same problem, and they have started to react. In Britain, the department store chain Debenhams introduced Designers at Debenhams, working with the likes of Jasper Conran and John Richmond to produce fashion-led lines at accessible prices. Target, the American chain, is working with the designer Isaac Mizrahi. And the British-based chain Bhs is pursuing older consumers, a huge growth area that nobody has tapped. \n For its part, M&S introduced Autograph, which worked with names like Timothy Everest and Burro. It also has Per Una, a successful boutique range that has cannibalized sales from other parts of the store. \n What is hard to understand is that 10 years ago, the two-season model held true \u2014 here are the clothes for winter and here are the clothes for summer \u2014 and fashion was some far-off land inhabited by people with funny accents and funnier clothes. \n But fashion is now desirable and demanded. It is no longer just the 15-to-24-year-olds who want a bit of fashion in their wardrobes: it's the whole market. \n Nick Gladding, an analyst with Verdict Research, reckons that in the last 18 months, fashion (as opposed to just clothes) now preoccupies every level of the market: even the over-50s are into it. \n \"People are less concerned by quality and like to buy more often,\" he said. \"Throwaway items are more popular.\" \n So a faster, cheaper operator has arrived, exemplified by the Spanish retailer Zara or the London success stories Top Shop and George. Fashion changes in these stores by the week or the month, and the clothes sell for next to nothing because it costs next to nothing to make them in Vietnam or Bangladesh. \n George was launched a decade ago as an in-house clothing label for the British supermarket chain Asda, now owned by the U.S. retailer Wal-Mart. George is now Britain's fourth-largest clothing line, and it also available in Germany, the United States and South Korea. Last summer, George opened its first two freestanding stores, and last week it announced that it would open two others. \n \"George has exposed the higher pricing of M&S,\" Gladding said. \"It has encouraged the mentality of low prices: maybe customers don't buy it, but they see how cheap it is. People are looking for much better value for money. They are questioning how much they should pay.\" \n Of course, George is not alone in challenging the middle market; just look at the Swedish group H&M, which has more than 200 stores in Germany alone, or Mango, Pilot, Primark, Select, New Look, Mark One, Matalan, Peacocks and Jane Norman. \n Several of these stores began their existence selling canceled orders from other retail chains with the labels cut out, and then moved into own-brand merchandise made cheaply in Asia. They have become better at fashion and better at creating store environments. \n While their wares are still cheap, they are appealing to a better customer, said Richard Fitzpatrick, an analyst with Retail Map. \n \"They are now on a par with the mainstream high street retailer,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"And this makes the quality/value/price equation seem not enough for most people at M&S.\" \n With the cheap end now appealing to the fashion-hungry middle classes, designer labels and branded goods have also moved in on their territory. Luxury goods companies have successfully wooed a broader base of customer, while branded clothing has soared, creating a larger top end. Anyone seeking quality, the forgotten factor in the price-versus-fashionability debate, will put on branded clothing, getting a logo to show they spent the money. \n According to Kim Winser, chief executive of Pringle of Scotland, it was an easy choice for her to pull Pringle out of its middle market doldrums and return it to its heritage as a supplier of luxury cashmere goods. \n \"People have gained in confidence when it comes to fashion,\" Winser said. \"They used to just buy from the midmarket, but now they're prepared to mix and match, to buy something luxe and mix it with Top Shop. And they feel quite proud of that. \n \"McFashion came along and they do versions of the top end and deliver it into stores very, very quickly. Quality adds lots of time, and this is what's missing. So if customers really want to invest in something, they look to luxury goods for craft and expertise, something they can't get from chain stores.\" \n Last week, Vittorio Radice, a former chief executive of Selfridges, was made executive director of Marks & Spencer for clothing, home and store development. Radice was already at M&S, charged with revitalizing the company's homewares offer, for which he created a modern concept called Lifestore. So Radice, the man who made Selfridges a desirable environment for modern, quality brands, is now trying to turn around Marks & Spencer's image. \n Moving the business downmarket seems unlikely. And going niche \u2014 older or fatter \u2014 is somehow a betrayal of its brand values. It is interesting that the 40-strong department store group Allders, another bastion of the middle classes, has recently opted to move upmarket and leave the middle market to the price-squabblers. Will this be the route for Radice? \n \"There's definitely a cascade effect,\" says Fitzpatrick, suggesting that everyone is trading up. \"You see it all the way through to the Rem Koolhaas-designed Prada store in Manhattan. The midmarket is now doing all these nice-looking stores. We've seen a rash of new store formats, and there's a knock-on effect on the premium market that usually does these sort of interesting stores. \n \"Now they've got a big problem, because they really can't justify the price of their T-shirts. So the really top brands are doing strange things, like in this Prada store in New York. There's hardly any product on the ground floor, and that's a very bold statement: In this most expensive piece of retail, we are so luxe that we can waste space.\" \n * \n Oliver Horton is a freelance journalist based in London. \n [Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.] "}, {"text": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 5-30-04: ON LANGUAGE; The New Black\n2004-05-30T05:00:00.000Z\n' Brown is the new black,'' Meera Syal said at the ImagineAsia film festival in London a couple of years ago. She is the original librettist for the musical ''Bombay Dreams,'' now playing on Broadway.\nThe Indian writer was not making a fashion statement; she was speaking of the popularity in the Western world of South Asian culture, including food, drink, dance, drama and films from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other portions of what used to be called the Subcontinent. The booming Hindi movie industry is called Bollywood, a 1976 coinage of the crime-fiction writer H.R.F. Keating, that combined Bombay with Hollywood. All this, wrote Richard Corliss in Time magazine this month, has the glamour ''to curry favor with more than those who favor curry.''\n(Tangent: The spice known as curry, based on the aromatic leaves of the curry-leaf tree and often mixed with turmeric and other strong spices, drew its name from the Tamil kari, a sauce or relish to give a fresh zip to rice. Corliss's pun plays that against a quite different phrase, to curry favor, based on curry, ''to comb, dress, rub down,'' and favel or fallow, a pale brown color of a horse. Most brown horses, including those preening for the Belmont Stakes, enjoy this grooming by comb, and the phrase has come to mean ''to ingratiate.'' Curry favor/favor curry is a nice extended pun. End tangent.)\nThus, ''brown is the new black,'' as used above, meant the culture of people with the brown skin color of South Asians is now as popular, or even ''hotter,'' than that of the culture of black-skinned people -- in the estimation of with-it whites, especially in Britain.\nNow to the fashion origin of the new black. Start with the universally accepted notion that black is basic. Hems may rise and fall (or do both asymmetrically), and feather boas may come into vogue or go out, but black -- optically destitute of any color -- just keeps rolling along. When its fashion dominance lasts too long, however, and the whole couture world looks as if it is on its way to a funeral, something new is desired. In 1983, Suzy Menkes, then of The Times of London, wrote, ''Charcoal gray is used everywhere as the new black with occasional splashes of red and green.'' A year later, Nina Hyde of The Washington Post quoted the textile and color specialist Elaine Flowers: ''There is a tremendous range to the color brown. It is the new black.''\nReached in Paris, where she now holds sway as a columnist for The International Herald Tribune, Menkes says: ''I didn't realize that I set off this neophiliac fashion trend! I think of the seminal moment as Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, known, like all Japanese designers, for her black shrouds, announcing, 'Red is the new black,' probably in the mid-1990's. Since then, it has become a fashion clich\u00e9.'' (I cannot let neophiliac go by: it is a useful word coined in 1942 for ''one who believes that every change is an improvement.'')\nSo what is today's new black, Suzy? ''For the first time I can remember, the front row at last season's fashion shows was not just a sea of black, but one with lots of pattern and print. Perhaps florals are the new black.''\nFashion authorities less influential than my columnist colleague in Paris suggest that pink has become temporarily dominant. But coming to the field of lexicography, it appears that the meaning of the phrase has gone beyond the confines of fashion and morphed to ''whatever is avant-garde; the latest innovation to attract a following.'' The Menkes formulation, like Coco Chanel's ''little black dress'' of the late 1920's, has achieved the status of a classic even as the popularity of colors rise and fall. The word from California is that ''orange is the new pink.''\nTHE NEXT BIG THING\n''No Longer the Next Big Thing'' went the front-page headline in The New York Times two weeks ago, ''Hummer Offers First Rebates.'' That phrase was originally clasped to the bosom of the music industry. John Baker of the American Dialect Society found a 1951 use by the Washington radio personality Eddie Gallaher: ''Guy Mitchell looks like the next big thing among the male vocalists.'' It was popularized in Britain by Paul McCartney of the Beatles in 1968, when, after hearing a new album, he reportedly said that a group named the Fugs ''are the next big thing!''\nAn early use of this as a self-conscious expression -- that is, placed in quotes by the speaker to show it is a clich\u00e9 -- was in 1977, when Steve Ditlea wrote in The Times that ''others waited for the 'next big thing' to replace rock 'n' roll as the dominant popular music style.'' Fred Shapiro, editor of the Yale Dictionary of Quotations, found that for me, along with an earlier Times use, not self-conscious, by the president of the Aero Club of Illinois in 1910: ''New York to Chicago is certainly the next big thing in aeronautics.''\nHere's a secret to etymological sourcing: access www.americandialect .org, and its membership will go to work. Sam Clements came up with an 1892 use in The Times: ''The next big thing to be done in the market,'' wrote a financial reporter, ''is the floating of the new Richmond Terminal securities.'' (I don't know if it was such a hot stock; next big things often turn out to be smaller than anticipated.)\nBut in this world of fascination with predictions of big things to come, what neologism will replace this redoubtable phrase? Erin McKean, editor of Verbatim and a real comer in the language dodge, has spotted next-gen and notes that early adopter is the phrase for people who buy electronic gizmos when they are introduced and are at their most expensive. With-it teenagers are using off the chain to describe the latest of the latest fads.\nBut if we can find the next big thing for the next big thing -- on the bleeding, leading, cutting edge -- we will have discovered the new black."}, {"text": "Arafat Is Buried in Chaotic Scene in the West Bank\n2004-11-13T05:00:00.000Z\nRAMALLAH, West Bank, Nov. 12 - Yasir Arafat was buried here on Friday in an extraordinary scene of grief and chaos, with thousands of Palestinians climbing the walls of his compound, surging around his coffin and trying to bear it aloft.\nDespite firing volleys of gunfire into the sky, Palestinian security guards were unable to hold back a frenzied flow of mourners who poured over the internal courtyard, trampling the red carpet, trying to touch the coffin and engulfing the two Egyptian helicopters that brought Mr. Arafat and his entourage back home.\nWails and chants of \"We will sacrifice our blood and souls to redeem you\" and \"Yasir, Yasir\" competed with gunfire from scores of young militants in Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement.\nFor well over an hour, Palestinian security forces and political leaders struggled to bring some 20,000 mourners under control and move Mr. Arafat's coffin to a prepared burial spot of Jerusalem stone and black-and-green marble in the compound, under five conifers.

There were a few prime ministers, though European Union nations sent their foreign ministers. The United States sent Assistant Secretary of State William J. Burns.\nYossi Beilin, a dovish Israeli politician and former peace negotiator, said of Mr. Arafat: \"It's very rare, when a leader dies, that an era actually does die with him. But in this case, today, it would appear actually to be true. And the new era depends to a great extent on us, on us and on the Palestinians, and we have a great responsibility.\"\nShlomo Avineri, a philosopher and former Israeli Foreign Ministry official, said Mr. Arafat had failed, unlike Anwar Sadat, to \"reach out to Israelis and address their fears and hopes.\" Mr. Arafat was more like Fidel Castro, Mr. Avineri said. \"He gave his people a symbol, but he failed them in real life.\""}, {"text": "In Roaring China, Sweaters Are West of Socks City\n2004-12-24T05:00:00.000Z\nDATANG, China - You probably have never heard of this factory town in coastal China, and there is no reason why you should have. But it fills your sock drawer.\nDatang produces an astounding nine billion pairs of socks each year -- more than one set for every person on the planet. People here fondly call it Socks City, and its annual socks festival attracts 100,000 buyers from around the world.\nSoutheast from here is Shenzhou, which is the world's necktie capital. To the west is Sweater City and Kid's Clothing City. To the south, in the low-rent district, is Underwear City.\nThis remarkable specialization, one city for each drawer in your bureau, reflects the economies of scale and intense concentration that have helped turn China into a garment behemoth. On Jan. 1, a new trade regime will end the decades-old system of country-by-country quotas that divide the world's exports among roughly 150 countries. Now, China is banking on its immense size and efficient operators to grab an even larger share of the world's clothing orders.\nNeither Adam Smith nor Karl Marx could possibly have imagined that this kind of capitalism would evolve from a communist system in quite this way, with an obscure town in the middle of nowhere becoming the world's socks capital. But these days, buyers from New York to Tokyo want to be able to buy 500,000 pairs of socks all at once, or 300,000 neckties, 100,000 children's jackets, or 50,000 size 36B bras. And increasingly, the places that best accommodate those kinds of orders are China's giant new specialty cities.\nThe abolition of quotas is expected to accelerate this trend over the next decade or so, particularly under the guidance of China's visible hand. The niche cities reflect China's ability to form \"lump\" economies, where clusters or networks of businesses feed off each other, building technologies and enjoying the benefits of concentrated support centers -- like the button capital nearby, which furnishes most of the buttons on the world's shirts, pants and jackets.\nThe new era, thus, offers a glimpse into how China's fast-paced economy is developing into more than just a beehive of individual private enterprises. Beyond the entrepreneurial vigor so palpable here, the textile business is a prime example of how the Chinese government's attempt to guide development more indirectly through local planning instead of outright state ownership is starting to pay off in a big way.\nChina is not just becoming the leader of the pack. In many ways, it hopes to run away with as much of the market as possible.\nNew import limits by the United States, along with other external and internal forces, are expected to hamper China's progress in apparel and textiles for several years, if not longer. That should allow several other countries to maintain vigorous garment industries as well. But there is little question that China will ultimately be the dominant force in the business, and the growth of its industrial enclaves here highlights just how powerful a force China's industries are becoming in almost every sector they have entered.\nIn the late 1970's, Datang was little more than a rice farming village with 1,000 people, who gathered in small groups and stitched socks together at home, and then sold them in baskets along the highway.\nBack then, government officials branded Datang's sock makers as capitalists and ordered them to stop selling socks. Now, they produce over a third of the world's output, and the government has nothing but praise for such entrepreneurs and their domination of the sock business.\n\"If the restrictions are dropped, there'll be even more production here,\" says one government official, Weiming Feng, the town's deputy party secretary and an official at the city's sock market.\nSigns of Datang's rise as a socks capital are everywhere. The center of town is filled with a huge government-financed marketplace for socks. The rice paddies have given way to rows of paved streets lined with cookie-cutter factories. Banners promoting socks are draped across buildings. And each year, Datang is decorated with balloons and flags for the annual sock fair.\nAnd rags-to-riches tales abound in Datang. Just ask Dong Ying Hong, who in the 1970's gave up a $9-a-month job as an elementary-school teacher to make socks at home. Now, she is the owner of Zhejiang Socks -- and a sock millionaire.\nHai Yun Shi, the 41-year-old founder of Hongyun Socks, has a similar tale.\n\"I started out making socks by hand when I was 18,\" he said at the company's headquarters. \"In '96 we founded this company. Now, we have a contract with Wal-Mart.\"\nThese kinds of gains have sharply eroded America's old sock-making might. American textile companies filed a petition earlier this year asking Washington to place limits on Chinese sock imports. Hoping to ease trade tensions, the Chinese government said in early December that it would voluntarily add tariffs on some of its own textile and apparel exports to reduce their competitive thrust.\nThat is one reason, among others, why many specialists believe that China's wallop will not come all at once.\n\"It won't happen overnight,\" said Bruce Rockowitz, president of Li & Fung, a Hong Kong company that is one of the world's largest apparel distributors. \"It's not a big movement to China right now for retailers. There's too much uncertainty.\"\nSmaller countries, like Bangladesh and Cambodia -- which feared they could not keep up with China -- are breathing easier. At least for now.\nStill, China already accounts for about 16 percent of all apparel imports into the United States. And several studies project that in the next few years, once all the limits are lifted, that figure could soar to 50 percent to 70 percent.\n\"There's no question, at the end of the day, China ends up a much bigger player in the global apparel business,\" said David Weil, an associate professor of economics at Boston University.\nTextile and apparel makers in China have long been preparing for the coming boom. In recent years, they have invested billions of dollars in new factories along the country's eastern seaboard, particularly here in the Yangtze River Delta.\nMany of the old government-owned operations are gone. Private enterprises are importing high-end machinery and luring millions of peasants from the countryside.\nSince the early 1980's, when China began moving to a market economy, much of its competitive advantage was built on low-cost labor. Companies spend about 92 cents an hour for each worker in China, versus $1.20 in Thailand, $1.70 in Mexico and about $21.80 in the United States, according to a study by Goldman Sachs. Among big exporters, only India, at about 70 cents an hour, is cheaper.\nInvestors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea were among the first to come. But in recent years, Chinese entrepreneurs set up their own shops, starting out with small stitching operations and quickly expanding into gigantic factories.\nFor instance, Shengzhou, now popularly known in Chinese as International Necktie City, developed after a Hong Kong investor moved his necktie operations there in 1985 and brought modern tie-making techniques to the city. That was only a few years after China opened itself to capitalism when Deng Xiaoping in 1978 declared, \"To get rich is glorious.\"\nLater, some of the company's managers broke away to start their own tie companies. And within a decade, Shengzhou was awash in tie makers and suppliers.\nSimilar stories can be heard throughout the province of Zhejiang, which is considered one of this country's most enterprising regions.\nBut textile specialists say China's boom is not simply the product of the newfound entrepreneurialism that is sweeping this country; it is also the nation's ability to form what are called lump economies, focused on one product.\nSavvy entrepreneurs started out by luring suppliers, like fabric, dye or tool makers, to their cities, and as these clusters grew, they attracted more local investors who competed by trying to further specialize in socks or jeans production.\n\"The clusters are getting more and more specialized,\" says Qingliang Gu, a professor of textile economics at Donghua University in Shanghai. \"It's a little like Italy, where you have the city of Como making silk fabric, Vicenza with fine wool and Veneto for knitting.\"\nThe Chinese government has also played a crucial role, opening huge swaths of land for development, forming giant industrial parks, doling out tax benefits and developing the infrastructure and transportation networks needed to move products quickly to market.\n\"The textile cities started initially from the spontaneous development of private companies,\" said Chunyi Xie, an economist at the Shanghai Garment Trade Association. \"But when it reached certain dimensions it drew attention from the government.\"\nPrivate companies, with the support of the government, now build huge textile factory complexes, complete with dormitories, hospitals and even curfews to replace the state role in providing food, shelter and health care, along with close supervision. Many textile companies in the province of Jiangsu house and feed thousands of migrant workers who are bused in from the countryside, often for three- or four-year factory stints.\nThe campus of the Huafang Group, one of China's largest textile companies, has over 100 factory buildings, 30,000 employees and round-the-clock operations.\nOn any day, it teems with more than 20,000 workers, who live free of charge in Huafang's dormitories. Conditions are hardly heavenly, but they are often a step up for these workers, who are mostly young women from poorer inland provinces like Anhui or Henan. Many of them come here after high school, intending to stay for a few years before returning home to be married.\nThen, after those women return home, another 10,000 or so are bused in from the countryside, beginning yet another cycle in the pool of migrant labor that perpetually feeds China's bustling mills.\n\"When we need new workers,\" said Wei Xin Shi, a Huafang Group executive, \"we just announce it and people here call home and tell their friends to come to work at our factories.\"\nYun Liu, 23, is one of those workers. She left a small town in northern Jiangsu four years ago. Now, she makes $130 a month in Huafang's cotton spinning mill, where she spins raw cotton into fine threads eight hours a day.\n\"I really like being here,\" she said one afternoon outside the factory. \"It's a stable job, and I like the environment.\"\nFew places on earth can match the sheer scale and variety of textile and apparel companies clustering in this region.\n\"In terms of vertical supply chain, China has no competition,\" says Ruizhe Sun, president of the China Textile Information Center, a government-sponsored agency in Beijing. \"We have button makers, fabric makers, thread makers, zipper makers, you name it.\"\nThat situation is luring investors and competitors from other parts of the world.\n\"A few years ago, when I came here there were no Italians,\" said Ellen Zhou, a Chinese citizen now working for a textile company based in Thiene, Italy. \"Now they're everywhere, in the hotels, at the cafes.\"\nChinese textile executives, however, are well aware of the risks of overexpansion. And there are other problems looming as well. The market for labor has tightened in the past year, pushing up wages.\nCompanies and even government officials have long ferried migrant workers into Zhangjiagang from the nearby province of Anhui, many of whom were willing to work for $4 a day. But recently some factories have been struggling to find workers, and many executives say they expect wages to rise.\n\"We feel labor costs are going up,\" Jianhong Gu, vice general manager of Pukun Textile, a Zhangjiagang suit maker whose factories operate 24 hours a day. \"There's tremendous competition.\"\nMoreover, foreign designers and retailers are keen to keep a network of business ties with other countries with relatively modern factories, like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\nFred Abernathy, a researcher at the Center for Textile and Apparel Research at Harvard, says retailers in the United States will continue to buy quantities of textiles and apparel close to home, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, because of the need for \"just in time\" delivery for some items.\nHe also expects specialty clothing and textiles operations to continue to survive in New York, North Carolina, France and Italy. But, he concedes, \"China will gain over the long run.\"\nJinfei Wang, the chairman of the Jiangsu Diao Garment factory in Tongzhou, just outside Nantong, says there's no doubt about that.\n\"I've been to factories all over the world,\" he said in a recent interview while walking his own bustling factory floor, observing women's suits destined for J.C. Penney stores. \"And we can compete with any of them. Without restrictions, certainly China is going to be No.1.\"\nMade Elsewhere\nArticles in this series are periodically examining changes in the global clothing business.

Dr. Ed Kanalosh, who trained to be a doctor in Ukraine, paced the room, keeping a tight grip on his Diet Coke as he practiced his pitch. He was explaining -- to an imaginary audience of judges -- how to fix his country's medical morass.\n\"When you walk into the examining room, you see a doctor and nurse together,\" he said. \"They're doing weird stuff, writing on papers and barely paying attention to you. After a while, the doctor starts doing what nurses should do, like measuring weight and blood pressure.\" In clinics left over from the Soviet era, he said, doctors expect bribes from patients, walls crumble, floors may be filthy. People survive, on average, into their 60's. He hoped to improve the dismal system by introducing a new model of care. Affordable private clinics with short waiting times, polite staff, gleaming equipment and an efficient division of labor among doctors and nurses, he argues, will attract patients.\nDr. Kanalosh flipped through PowerPoint screens full of graphs, describing how he and his partners would begin with three health care centers designed with the help of experts from the Mayo Clinic. Eventually, they would expand to 150 centers. Other entrepreneurs, inspired by their success, would jump into the market.\nAcross the room, Shuhrat Kuziev, from Uzbekistan, swiveled back and forth in his chair as he called out suggestions. \"Dude,\" he said, pointing up at the chart glowing on the wall, \"I think you should narrow down that number.\"\nIn a few days, the two would present their proposal to a panel of judges. Like other students who compete in Harvard's annual business-plan competition, they would try to prove that their idea could turn a profit. But because they were billing themselves as social entrepreneurs -- visionaries who mix business acumen with a desire to distribute vaccines, educate low-income children or fight racism -- they would also be judged according to another set of criteria. They would have to prove that their plan could save the world, or one small part of it.\n\"As people who come from developing countries, we feel we are lucky to be here,\" Mr. Kuziev explains later. \"We need to give back.\"\nHarvard Business School has just celebrated the 10th anniversary of its Initiative on Social Enterprise, a program that aims to prepare M.B.A.'s like Mr. Kuziev and Mr. Kanalosh to manage nonprofit enterprises, oversee philanthropic activities or start scrappy companies that attack social ills. The effort unofficially began in 1989, when an assistant professor, J. Gregory Dees, proposed a new class that would teach students to blend the best of the nonprofit and commercial sectors, using their business skills to solve problems like hunger and illiteracy. \"Many folks advised me not to do the class because it would be detrimental to my academic career -- it would put me on the margins of business-school faculty,\" says Professor Dees, now teaching at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke. Indeed, Harvard at first turned down his proposal.\nAs it is defined today, social enterprise can mean just about anything. \"At one end of the spectrum, you could have a soup kitchen in the basement of a church, where all the labor is volunteer and all the materials are donated -- pure charity,\" says James E. Austin, faculty chairman of the program. \"At the other end of the spectrum, you have a for-profit company that is engaged in an undertaking that has some embedded social purpose\" -- for instance, a Body Shop or a Starbucks, with their stated mission of helping disadvantaged communities or preserving the environment.\nTen years ago, few business schools offered formal education in social entrepreneurship; now just about every first-rate business school does. Stanford, Columbia and Duke have embraced the idea. Oxford University in England opened the Skoll Center for Social Entrepreneurship last year with a grant from Jeffrey S. Skoll, eBay's first president.\nProfessor Dees sees this trend as a response to 90's exuberance. \"We had the fall of the Soviet Union, a sense of triumph for capitalist democracies, a lot of respect for what businesses had been able to accomplish,\" he says. \"The 90's were a heyday for entrepreneurs.\" So why couldn't that spirit of innovation help fix the public schools, provide Haitians with clean water or bring phones to rural villages in India?\nSome business leaders had already attacked these questions with stunning success. \"The Grameen Bank, in particular, created a very interesting model that caught the imagination of lots of business folks, who saw it as a market-based solution to poverty,\" Professor Dees says. In the 80's, Grameen began extending loans to poor women in Bangladesh, allowing them to buy sewing machines or cows to start their own businesses.\nStudents continue to be enthused about such market solutions, Professor Dees says, despite the dot-com bust and scandals that have gripped corporate America. \"The students are pulling the faculty along in the direction of social entrepreneurship,\" he says. \"There may be something about this generation; they're trying to figure out a way to make their mark.\"\nAlso, students are frustrated with the traditional methods of doing good. \"The old expectation that government or charities can take care of social problems is not being met,\" Professor Austin says. Several Harvard students who have worked for nonprofits came away from those jobs convinced that some good-hearted organizations suffer from terrible management.\nBefore enrolling at Harvard Business School, Misha Simmonds taught seventh and eighth graders at a small private school in Newark that offered scholarships to needy residents. \"The school I was working in was well run, but it was an island in a vast abyss of failure,\" he says. Mr. Simmonds says he decided to join those who are tweaking the business model in the hope of transforming education. \"It's not enough just to try to do good,\" he says. \"You have to succeed at doing good.\" With a fellowship from Harvard Business School, he is working at the NewSchools Venture Fund, an organization that \"invests\" in promising teachers and nonprofit groups by handing out grants. The organization is modeled on a venture capital fund.\nIn fact, the old designations -- nonprofit, for-profit, private, public -- often no longer apply. \"Sector bending\" is what Professor Dees calls the tendency for organizations to step out of their usual roles. Private companies run charter schools. Nonprofits start businesses. Activist groups become corporate shareholders.\nIn his new book, \"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas,\" David Bornstein calls this mishmash of well-meaning institutions the \"citizen sector.\" He says that the citizen sector is the fastest-growing part of the economy, but the trend is so amorphous as to defy measurement. \"We are still in a transition period,\" Professor Dees says. \"This is just starting.\"\nAnd as corporations and nonprofits begin to adapt to the citizen sector, so too are M.B.A.'s. In an auditorium at Harvard Business School last March, Thomas J. Tierney paced the stage, his hands shoved into the pockets of his khakis, talking about his own identity change. Mr. Tierney left his job as chief executive at Bain & Company, an international consulting group, and founded a nonprofit. While it's common for executives to devote themselves to public service when they retire, Mr. Tierney followed a different script. He made the switch in his 40's.\nOn this day, he was speaking to a packed house -- the Social Enterprise Conference had drawn about 1,000 people, twice the number as the year before. The men and women spilling out into the aisles made a good advertisement for enlightened business. They were ethnically diverse, fresh-faced, name-tagged and dressed in sober suits and navy pumps.\nMr. Simmonds, former head of the Social Enterprise Club, the sponsor of the conference, says he knows many young executives who expect to follow Mr. Tierney's example, moving back and forth from the profit-seeking and nonprofit sectors in their lifetimes. \"People used to say that you spend the first third of your life learning, and then you spend the next third earning and then in retirement you serve the community,\" Mr. Simmonds says. \"But there's a problem with that: by the time you get around to serving, you're not as effective as you could have been if you'd learned all along about nonprofits.\"\nHow many of these M.B.A.'s will still be willing to save the world when they find out just how little it pays? M.B.A.'s can earn hundreds of dollars an hour consulting at private-sector companies, but those expectations are not realistic when they're working for nonprofits, says Jonathan Harrison, business development director of the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development, a group that tries to help local businesses and entrepreneurs in eastern Kentucky and central Appalachia. Recently, Mr. Harrison ran a nonprofit with the mission of pairing new business-school graduates with small businesses in the Delta region.\n\"I found it very difficult to attract M.B.A. students from the top 50 business schools\" with a nonprofit salary, he says. \"In my recruiting experience, M.B.A. graduates with a social conscience not only want to do good, but also to do well, too. Generally, they price themselves out of the nonprofit market.\"\nAt Harvard, the number of students who directly enter the public sector remains small -- 4 percent in 2003.\nThis year, one of the few is Martin Curiel, a 2004 graduate who founded a nonprofit group called the Migrant M.B.A. Project. He grew up hauling bags of peaches through the orchards of California; his mother still works at a peach cannery. His nonprofit will help migrant workers find their way to business school or to become entrepreneurs.\nAs for Mr. Kuziev and Dr. Kanalosh, both are working in the investment community -- Mr. Kuziev with the public-sector International Finance Corporation. In their spare time, they are trying to advance their health care proposal, which took second place in Harvard's competition (first prize went to a solar-power start-up). But it goes slowly, they say.\nProfessor Dees acknowledges that the kinder, gentler M.B.A.'s aren't yet a force in the market, although he says that business students keep pushing for classes that address social issues. \"What excites them is the potential for bringing together two worlds,\" he says. \"How do you incorporate social values as well as economic values into decision-making? That's absolutely a question that's in the air right now. I hope whatever's in the air stays in the air.\"\nCareers Pagan Kennedy is the author, most recently, of \"Black Livingstone: A True Tale of Adventure in the 19th-Century Congo (Viking)."}, {"text": "SPARE TIMES\n2004-06-11T05:00:00.000Z\nATTRACTIONS\nMuseums and Sites\nMERCHANT'S HOUSE MUSEUM, 29 East Fourth Street, East Village.

Atlantic Avenue finds itself the spine between several of the city's most provocative development schemes, including a 19,000-seat basketball arena for the New York Nets designed by the architect Frank Gehry, a pier for behemoth cruise ships, like the Queen Mary II, the southern extension of the new 67-acre Brooklyn Bridge Park, the rebuilding of downtown Brooklyn, and the shuttering of Brooklyn's jail.\nThese prospects, whose realization is by no means certain, have jangled nerves on the avenue, with residents and merchants anxious about coagulating traffic, the thunder of more trucks, a dearth of parking places, and a potential upheaval in the avenue's character from one-of-a-kind stores to chain emporiums and souvenir shops. But the possible changes have also whetted entrepreneurial appetites among those very same worriers.\nMany people like Charlie Sahadi are of two minds. Mr. Sahadi's Lebanese immigrant family has owned Sahadi's, a Middle Eastern Zabar's, since 1948. Customers drive from Connecticut and Pennsylvania for its 28 varieties of olives as well as dried apricots in glass jars, home-roasted pistachio nuts and 200 European and American varieties of cheeses aimed at the neighborhood's new homesteaders.\nMr. Sahadi, 60 years old and American born, welcomes the idea of foot traffic stirred by the thousands of basketball fans and debarking passengers -- ''Anything that brings people to my street, I'm happy,'' he says. But he worries that customers enchanted by his cornucopia of foods will grow dyspeptic at the lack of parking by his store, near Clinton Street. ''You come here, buy a bag of pistachios for $15 and you get a $35 ticket,'' he said. ''You spent $50 on a bag of pistachios! The next time you say, 'Why do I have to come to Atlantic Avenue?'''\nHe understands some of the changes are organic. The largely Christian Arab quarter between Court and Clinton Streets has shrunk -- there are three groceries, one bakery and a half-dozen Middle Eastern restaurants left -- not because of rising rents but because the shopkeepers' sons and daughters are spurning the long hours of a grocery for the longer hours of corporate law. (His son and daughter, though, stayed in the business.)\nStill, he worries about national chains pouncing on an increasingly bustling avenue, with an Eckerd pharmacy and a Radio Shack already gaining footholds and talk of a Pottery Barn coming.\n''Atlantic Avenue has always been a mom-and-pop street,'' he said.\nAs a native and current Brooklynite, Joshua Sirefman, the chief operating officer of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which is shepherding several of the projects, has thought about Atlantic Avenue as a ''quintessential Brooklyn street'' and sees nothing but good coming from the changes.\nA cruise ship pier and a park will bring the bustle of Atlantic Avenue down to the waterfront. An arena will start pumping new life into the remainder of the avenue, which stretches beyond Flatbush Avenue for another largely homely nine miles of gas stations and industrial buildings into Queens.\nAnd Candace P. Damon, president of the Atlantic Avenue Local Development Corporation, noted that Atlantic Avenue has safeguards against too radical a transformation. The low-rise buildings along Cobble Hill and Boerum Hill are protected in scale either as landmarks or as a special city district and have storefronts too narrow to appeal to larger merchandisers. Many of the 200 businesses own their buildings and do not have to fear soaring rents.\nMs. Damon's group drew up a master plan last September that focused on small details -- more trees, better lighting, safer crosswalks around the ramps of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.\n''I have neighbors that are concerned we are being Manhattanized,'' she said. ''My feeling is that there certainly will be changes but that the Brooklyn feeling will be maintained.''\nResidents and merchants are already pleased at the doubling in property values in a decade -- brownstones sell between $1 million and $2 million -- and an arena and pier may make the neighborhood even pricier. Still, Heloise Gruneberg, a resident of Boerum Hill and a leader of arena opposition, fears the arena in particular will be too much for the street to handle, turning Atlantic Avenue ''into a parking lot'' and attracting bars and prostitutes.\nSam I. Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner and a consultant for the master plan, said he thought avenue traffic -- now at 35,000 vehicles a day -- could be rerouted along Schermerhorn Street should more traffic prove intolerable. ''I'm old enough to be hurting from the loss of the Brooklyn Dodgers,'' he said, ''so I'm happy a team is coming to Brooklyn, and I believe the traffic problems are solvable.''\nWhatever life there has been on the street, one of the most dismal stretches has always been two blocks between Court and Smith Streets. It has two gas stations, the Brooklyn House of Detention, and until recently a five-story municipal garage. In a way, they are remnants of the industrial Atlantic Avenue that in the 19th century included the predecessors of Benjamin Moore paints and Corning Glass Works.\n''Historically this street has always been a working man's street, and that's changing,'' said Dennis Holt, a columnist for The Brooklyn Eagle.\nThe most prominent example of change arriving even there is a 12-story apartment house rising at the corner of Court Street that will include 321 apartments, a YMCA athletic club, 700 parking spaces, and 20,000 square feet of space for two large retailers. Two smaller apartment houses are going up toward the east, and Brooklyn Law School is building a 360-student dormitory just to the north.\nStill, Atlantic Avenue's prosperous makeover does not bode well for one of its longtime fixtures -- its bail-bond industry. The five remaining bail offices settled there to be near the Brooklyn courts and the 600-inmate jail. With crime plummeting, the jail was temporarily closed last year and prisoners transferred to Rikers Island.\n''They'll push us out, and there aren't many places where we can put our office,'' said Jack Robbins, who has been lending accused criminals bail for 46 years.\nNear Flatbush Avenue, there is a second cluster of Middle Eastern merchants, 25 of them, most of whom are Muslim. Ahsan Habib and Hamed Nabawy can not wait for an arena to be built around the corner and are already thinking of keeping later hours and broadening the variety of their products. Mr. Habib, a Bangladeshi immigrant, runs Madina Industrial Corp. which ships body oils and incense across the country.\nMr. Nabawy, an Egyptian immigrant, is the owner of the Fertile Crescent grocery, a teeming banquet of a store that sells Islamic books, halal meats, dresses, as well as shea butter skin treatment by the cake. He opened the shop 24 years ago, when drug dealers prowled the avenue, but business thrived until the 9/11 attacks caused some New Yorkers to become wary of Muslims. The shops flank the Masjid Al-Farooq, the mosque used by the Egyptian sheik convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.\nNow that business has revived, Mr. Nabawy is not worried that he is an ideal candidate for a souvenir shop. He has a 12-year lease and, in resilient Atlantic Avenue fashion, he may also transform his store.\n''I'll make it a more American look,'' he said.\nCorrection: April 3, 2004, Saturday A map on Tuesday with an article about redevelopment plans for Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn referred imprecisely to a proposed arena for the New York Nets. It would indeed be built over train yards, but also on land now occupied by residences and businesses."}, {"text": "Still a Beacon, Parkchester Climbs Back\n2004-03-14T05:00:00.000Z\nFOR a generation after it opened in 1940, and before it stumbled into a period of decline, the Parkchester apartment complex in the Bronx was a symbol of the American Dream, a meticulously planned community for 42,000 with open space and crisp well-maintained buildings. Last month, that dream came alive once more for Dulal Nandi, an immigrant from Bangladesh and an assistant manager at a Duane Reade drugstore in Manhattan.\nJust a few weeks ago, Mr. Nandi and wife, Supria, bought their first home, a one-bedroom condominium on the 10th floor of a red brick building at 1919 McGraw Avenue, just around the corner from a playground. They moved just in time: they are expecting their first child next month.\nMr. Nandi's purchase, for $58,000, is a symbol of a turnaround under way at Parkchester, one of the first large-scale private housing developments in the country. Not long ago apartment prices had collapsed and most were scooped up by investors looking for rental income.\nNow, a transformation has brought new hope to a project in decline -- and produced many millions of dollars in potential profits, at least on paper, to the team that was brought in to save it, including a not-for-profit housing group.\nOnly a decade ago, Parkchester, which has 12,271 apartments, was in the midst of a downward spiral, wounded by a faltering housing market; ill-timed decisions by the sponsor of its condominium conversion, who still owned much of the complex; and a crumbling and outdated infrastructure. Prices of condominiums plummeted; banks foreclosed on hundreds of apartments; and complaints were on the rise about problem tenants, noise, drug dealing, prostitution and garbage. There were fears that the lingering problems of the South Bronx -- crime and poverty -- were moving eastward to Parkchester.\nThe situation was so bad that the sponsor of the condo conversion at Parkchester, Harry B. Helmsley and partners, struggling with more than 700 vacant apartments that they had kept off the market, sold the 6,362 money-losing apartments they still owned and the rest of their interests in Parkchester -- a shopping center covering nearly 500,000 square feet of space, including a Macy's department store, and five parking garages -- for $4.5 million in 1998.\nBut now there is new wiring, windows and plumbing in Mr. Nandi's apartment. Condo prices have risen and are at or above the peak levels of the 1980's. Most sales are now to homeowners like Mr. Nandi. Rents on apartments still held by the sponsor or by investors are rising, and there is a waiting list for some rental apartments.\nTenant screening is being strengthened, and a new charter school is scheduled to open nearby in the fall. Yet many residents say it may take years to restore the social fabric of the community.\nThe purchasers of the Helmsley interests in Parkchester included the Community Preservation Corporation, a not-for-profit group founded to channel financing from banks into struggling neighborhoods. The Parkchester purchase was made through a partnership that included a for-profit subsidiary that invests directly in troubled properties.\nThe community preservation group played a critical role in building political and civic support for a $220 million renovation of the apartments at Parkchester. It is now a beneficiary of the turnaround, with the value of its holdings rising along with those of other owners.\nThe group and its partners have promised the financial institutions underwriting the improvements not to begin selling apartments until the renovations are complete in the next year or two, and perhaps far later. But in the meantime, with rents up sharply in Parkchester, the development will generate significant income over the next few years, C.P.C. officials said.\n''There is a lot of equity; maybe we will have a bit of money,'' said Michael D. Lappin, president and chief executive of the Community Preservation Corporation. ''If we have more money, we will spend more money to do what we always do: restore more communities and help restore more problem properties.''\nMuch of the rebound of Parkchester has been attributed to a complex plan that allowed the two condominium boards in the complex to finance the renovations and solve problems -- leaky pipes; drafty, warping windows; obsolete wiring -- that had scared off many potential purchasers.\nBut, brokers say, demand for Parkchester apartments has also been driven by the rising housing prices across the metropolitan area, which pushed up prices across the Bronx, long a laggard, by more than 15 percent a year for several years running.\nFirst-time buyers, who were enticed by low interest rates but priced out of homes in New Jersey and then in other sections of the Bronx, found they could afford to buy condominiums in Parkchester, brokers say.\nAnd other forces were at work as well. The new investment partnership reversed some of the mistakes made by the prior management, fixing up and renting out long-vacant apartments that had deteriorated. The partners also renovated commercial areas, added some national retailers to the mix and negotiated a new 15-year lease with Macy's, which built its first branch store there in the 1940's.\n''Prices went up because a lot of people can't afford to buy one- or two-family houses any more,'' said Anthony Jaundoo, a broker. ''You can own here for a little as $7,000 out of pocket.''\nBut Mr. Nandi's broker, Zakir Kahn of Parkchester Real Estate, said, ''The main reason the price is going up is the renovations.'' He said that after years of sales from speculators to speculators, new buyers were coming in, reflecting a mix of racial and ethnic groups and jobs. There are city employees, taxi drivers, restaurant workers and workers in retail like Mr. Nandi.\nA Phenomenon\n42,000 People On a 129-Acre Site\nParkchester, although largely forgotten today in the ever-changing whirl of New York real estate, was something of a planning phenomenon when the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company put it up in 1938 to 1942 on the 129-acre site of a Catholic home for wayward boys in the east Bronx. A six-by-seven-foot architectural model was on display at the company's exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair.\nIt provided rental housing for a community of 42,000 working people in 171 buildings arranged around a central oval and two broad avenues. It had playgrounds and landscaped pathways, its own shopping complex and movie theater. The sameness of the red brick buildings was broken up by 500 terra-cotta statues built into the corners of buildings and small decorative plaques with nature scenes above many building entrances.\nParkchester was an early model for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, which were built in Manhattan after the war by Metropolitan Life. But by the late 1960's, the project was suffering.\nRents and profits were limited by the city's rent control laws, and in 1968, with Metropolitan Life facing accusations of racial discrimination at its developments, it sold Parkchester to Mr. Helmsley and his partners. In the 1970 census, Parkchester's tracts were still 98.8 percent white; by 2000, that was down to 20 percent.\nThe Helmsley group converted Parkchester to condominiums in two stages: the Parkchester North Condominium in 1974 and the South 12 years later. It carried out the conversions in the face of opposition by tenant groups and local elected officials.\nKen Patton, dean of real estate at New York University and a former chief operating officer for the Helmsley organization, said the Helmsley family made a critical mistake in keeping a large number of apartments vacant in preparation for sale.\nWhen the real estate market faltered, the owners were left with vacant apartments, and with condo charges to pay. Instead of investing in the property, the sponsor looked to cut expenses further to reduce losses. Prices remained high, Mr. Patton said, through the 50th anniversary of Parkchester in 1990 and then began a rapid descent.\nThe Community Preservation Corporation purchased the Helmsley property through its for-profit subsidiary, CPC Resources, with two experienced real estate investors, Morton K. Olshan and Jeremiah W. O'Connor, and set up the Parkchester Preservation Corporation to run it. They developed a plan to finance the renovations: the sponsors' units would be used as collateral for a loan to the entire condominium and would be paid back through higher condominium charges over 30 years.\nThese in turn would be offset in part through abatements of real estate taxes that were enhanced through legislation adopted by the State Legislature; state mortgage insurance to lower interest costs, and the introduction of electric meters, which shifted the cost of electricity, previously covered by condo charges, to owners and renters.\nMr. Lappin said getting approval of the condominium unit owners was extremely difficult. He reached out to local church leaders and political leaders to build support for what he was doing. Before winning their first agreement in the Parkchester South Condominium, the investors agreed to turn over a parking garage for a community center and to provide an annual contribution of $100,000 a year for 10 years. They agreed to a fixed price contract for the work in the south section, which eventually cost them $8 million in cost overruns.\nThere were angry meetings and lawsuits, but by January 1999, the renovation of the South Condominium, where the sponsor held a majority of the units, was approved and the work was completed in March 2003. In the North Condominium, the first phase of work was not approved until August 2002, and work is not scheduled to be completed until July 2005.\nThe Renovation\nRising Charges, Rising Values\nThe average apartment owner will see the condo charges rise by $92 more a month in the south, and $145 in the north, according to the Community Preservation Corporation. But these will be partly offset by $63 a month in property tax abatements in both developments. The current average charges are about $430 a month in the north and about $340 in the south. To blunt the impact, the sponsors are offering subsidies to low-income elderly tenants and subsidizing part of the increases in the north for four years so they can be gradually phased in.\nJoseph Houlihan, an appraiser with Houlihan & O'Malley Real Estate Services, has plotted the changing values of apartments in Parkchester. He said there were several dozen investors owning 5 to 150 apartments, some purchased in bulk from banks for as little as $10,000 a unit.\nIn 1996, before the renovations began, he said, the value of a typical one-bedroom apartment was $22,000 and rose only modestly over the next three years. But beginning in 1999, the value of a one-bedroom apartment began to soar, more than doubling in value to $60,000 in the South Condo and $52,000 in the North Condominium by the end of 2003.\nLarger apartments also more than doubled in price, with two-bedrooms worth $80,000 in the South and $72,000 in the North, and three-bedroom units an average of $110,000 in the South and $105,000 in the North. Brokers say some large apartments have sold for as much as $125,000.\nRents have been rising too, with rentals of one-bedrooms by the sponsor going for $810 to $890 a month, depending on size and location, and two-bedrooms for $1,000 to $1,100 a month, Parkchester officials say.\nYet while much of the physical deterioration at Parkchester appears to have been reversed, repairing the social fabric of the community may take longer. Many residents complain that in the lean years, many investors rented apartments to anyone with a guaranteed government rent subsidy without adequate screening, bringing in noisy troublesome neighbors, including drug dealers.\nAmar Taborn has fond memories of Parkchester when he moved there with his family in 1979 as a child. But two years ago, when he moved back to live in the apartment, which his mother had been renting out, he found the development changed. ''In the 90's a lot of people just fled,'' he said. ''The grounds weren't kept up. Different types of people came in. They left garbage in the playgrounds.''\nHarry L. Brown, the president of the North Condominium and a retired postmaster in Hartsdale in Westchester, said he is working closely with the South Condominium to develop tougher screening criteria for tenants seeking to rent from individual owners. They would include criminal background checks, credit checks and a requirement that renters show evidence they have the income to pay their rent.\n''You've got to have a job or you've got to have the income,'' he said. ''It is important because it gives you a stable community.''\nEven many of the private investors who own blocks of apartments say they support stringent screening, at least until they find tenants rejected for what they view as technicalities. Alex Harrison, an investor in Parkchester who owns dozens of apartments, said he ''took the roller coaster ride down and the roller coaster ride up'' as unit prices fell and came back in the 1990's and he approves the work done by the new sponsors. ''I don't want to call them saviors, but they did clean the place up,'' he said.\nMargaret Walsh, the president of South Condominium, who has lived in Parkchester since 1943, said the condominium staff was also trying to make sure new tenants had a better understanding of the rules and regulations and were prepared to abide by them. ''There are people coming in who don't how to live in close proximity to one another,'' she said.\nAmid this concern about rebuilding a community, there are some residents in Parkchester who already feel comfortable and have no plans to leave anytime soon.\nBen Gonzales, a sculptor and a retired art school teacher, spends his days in what is called a ''terrace apartment'' in a Parkchester building on McGraw Avenue. It is a ground-floor unit with 10-foot-high ceilings, a private entrance and a yard. His living room is crammed with his artwork, including a Plexiglas case of paper sculptures cut from single sheets of paper.\nA native of the Philippines who came to the United States for treatment for a war injury during World War II, he moved into Parkchester in 1979 and bought at the inside price of $15,000. He then watched in distress as the staffing and maintenance declined. ''We used to have two supers for one building; now we have one super for two buildings,'' he said.\nOn paper, the sponsor's investment is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, based on the values that apartments at Parkchester are fetching today, and the total of $40 million it has invested to date in the project.\nBut Community Preservation Corporation officials say the story is more complex, since they agreed to use all of their apartments as collateral for the loans the condominiums drew on to pay for the renovations.\nAs a result, they say, any time the sponsor sells an apartment -- once the moratorium on sales has passed -- it will have to pay off the portion of the condominium's debt secured by that apartment and take over that part of the loan. So, after taxes, they say, the sale will produce little or no cash.\nMr. Lappin said the sponsors had promised Freddie Mac, which provided almost $130 million in financing, not to sell units until September 2005 and have told residents that they will not sell units until the last of the renovations have been completed around 2006. He said the partners have had only limited discussions on what to do afterward. ''It is easy to lose money,'' Mr. Lappin said. ''It has not been our objective to do that. We have been able to fulfill our mission and do it in a businesslike way.''\nUnlike traditional charities, the C.P.C. depends on investments by banks and insurance companies, not private donations. It reported $679 million in assets and a net worth of $54 million in its most recent annual report. In 2002, Mr. Lappin received a salary of $717,000, according to a C.P.C. filing. He said his salary was based on a study by his board's compensation committee and has not come out of any revenues from Parkchester to date.\nParkchester is so large that even a small change in market values and rents can have a large impact on the sponsors. And in developing the workout at Parkchester, size was part of the problem: it was just too large and complicated to attract the interest of private developers, Mr. Lappin said.\nPhilip Grossman, an executive vice president for community real estate at Fleet Bank, which participated in construction loans for the renovation, noted: ''It was an achievement to have the backbone to go in and take on a project of this size. Nothing like this had been done on this scale before.''\nMeanwhile, Mr. Nandi is enjoying his new apartment, though he has not yet been able to buy anything to put in it.\nTwo years ago, he went back to Bangladesh and returned to New York with a bride. They worked at the same Duane Reade, but when his wife stopped working during her pregnancy, the $430 a month common charges and $450 mortgage became a struggle. ''She has to go work,'' he said. ''I can't even afford any furniture.''"}, {"text": "A Brilliant Sky, and Muted Security; Fun, Solemn, Safety-Conscious: A Hundred Americas\n2004-07-05T05:00:00.000Z\nThey paraded up Main Street in the old patriot towns, drumming the cadence and flying the colors.

They barbecued in backyards, strolled down country lanes and gathered on village greens to hear the Declaration of Independence read once more.\nAmerica -- a hundred Americas -- found expression yesterday across the New York metropolitan area on a soft and sunny Fourth of July filled with ceremony, celebration, security and old-fashioned fun. Bikers, joggers, picnickers and sunbathers were out in force, and there were concerts, music festivals, walking tours and countless gatherings of families and friends.\nAnd in the evening, as the last light retreated in a rust-gold atomic sunset and darkness spread over the glittering amethyst city, tens of thousands lined New York Harbor and the East River for the finale of the day's salute to the nation's 228th birthday, Macy's annual fireworks extravaganza, a thundering cannonading that painted the galactic night with dazzling chrysanthemums of color.\nSecurity across the region was tight but relatively unobtrusive. There were no specific threats, but federal and local officials had cited intelligence reports suggesting that terrorists were determined to strike targets in America this summer or fall, and they cautioned vigilance during the Independence Day weekend, which extends officially through today.\nBut it was hard to conjure up dangers amid the gentle holiday mood yesterday. The afternoon was as comfortable as an old sneaker. A golden sun that weaved in and out of patchy clouds kept temperatures in the low 80's, and rapturous breezes caught the flags and pennants, cooled the city greenswards and sent sailboats and whitecaps rolling over the purple canvas of New York Harbor.\nAmerican flags were everywhere: on lawns, seafronts, T-shirts, hats, even fingernails. And American diversity was equally visible. Spread over the green fields of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens were families native to India, Bangladesh, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and other lands. There were Hasidic Jews, Sikhs and families of other religious and ethnic backgrounds. Nearly all had set up barbecues and picnics in the American tradition.\nHaiden Victor, 47, of Brooklyn, was there with his large family, including a 3-year-old daughter, Julia, her hair done up in red, white and blue accessories, and a niece visiting from Puerto Rico. ''We are enjoying what most people cannot enjoy,'' Mr. Victor said. ''We can celebrate, and most people can't do that. They're being bombed or bombing someone.''\nIn Lower Manhattan, the cornerstone of the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower was laid and the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site officially begun with speeches honoring those who died in the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and hailing the resiliency of the American spirit.\nOn Liberty Island out in the harbor, Brittany Mascolo, 15, an R.O.T.C. cadet at her high school in San Antonio, gazed with obvious reverence at the Statue of Liberty, which opened Saturday for the first time since the terrorist attacks. ''It is so cool to be here and see the symbol of freedom,'' she gushed. She said she hoped to become a fighter pilot one day, and noted that several relatives and friends were serving with American forces in Iraq.\nHuge crowds flocked to the beaches of Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut, lugging the props of summer: beach chairs, straw hats, sun umbrellas, blankets, sunblock lotions and baskets of food.\nAt Belmar, on the Jersey Shore, Amy Campbell, of Palmyra, N.J., was sunbathing with five family members when she received word by cellphone that a nephew serving with the Air National Guard in Qatar had just returned home safely. The family broke into cheers. ''There is no way to describe how happy we are right now,'' Ms. Campbell said.\nDown the beach, on a blanket, Gina Vetrano, of Brick Township, N.J., was tanning and catching up on her fashion and cooking magazines. ''This is the only place you sit and do nothing and not feel guilty about it,'' she said.\nAt Coney Island, Takeru Kobayashi, 25, a rail-thin 132-pounder from Nagano, Japan, won the coveted Mustard Yellow Belt at Nathan's Famous hot-dog-eating contest for the fourth consecutive year, by wolfing down 53 1/2 wieners in 12 minutes, shattering his own record by 3 hot dogs. As 3,000 fans wavering between nausea and fascination watched, Mr. Kobayashi -- averaging a hot dog every 13 seconds -- destroyed his closest competitor, Nobuyuki Shirota, of Tokyo, who managed only 38 dogs.\nIn Riverside Park near 98th Street, Marie McFadden, 35, had set up an elaborate picnic regalia by noon -- three blankets, two barbecue grills, a huge umbrella and three shopping carts to carry supplies -- and was cooking hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken and spareribs for a dozen friends and relatives while eight children raced about, shooting water pistols.\n''We're using my secret sauce -- ketchup, mustard, brown sugar and love,'' said Barbara Gager, a cousin of Ms. McFadden. ''We're having fun,'' Ms. Gager added. But she offered a more serious point about life in America almost three years after the 9/11 attacks. ''We're moving on,'' she said. ''We won't be stopped. We take our freedom with pride. It's such a gift.''\nLong before dark, tens of thousands of spectators began to assemble along the East River and around the harbor's rim, for the fireworks show.\nSoaring aloft on rockets with spider trails from a half-dozen barges in the river and harbor, some 36,000 pyrotechnic shells erupted in a deafening barrage and riots of color against the night sky: whorls, swizzles, peonies and cascades of dazzling reds, glittering whites, sparkling blues and blazes of silver and gold that burst and flashed and built into a continuous din that echoed off skyscraper facades and rumbled out over the city like the roar of battle.\nIn East River Park on the Lower East Side, children screamed with delight at the loudest concussions, and a man in the crowd kept shouting ''Superb! Superb!''\nAndy Dahr had a camera on a tripod, but his view was obscured by trees. At last, shells burst high overhead and he began snapping his shutter. ''I'm going to send them to my family in East India,'' he said.\nAs the fireworks ended, an armada of watercraft ranging from cabin cruisers to Coast Guard vessels sounded their horns in a blaring, hooting, textured salute.\nSpectators, many holding American flags, watched the half-hour display with unabashed awe, while entertainers on a nationally televised show sang ''God Bless America'' and rendered John Philip Sousa marches. And there were accompanying voices: President John F. Kennedy exhorting the nation at his Inauguration, the astronaut Neil Armstrong as he stepped onto the moon, and Donald Trump's version of the Founding Fathers' declaration to King George of England: ''You're fired!''"}, {"text": "India\n2004-07-15T05:00:00.000Z\n GEOGRAPHY Location: Asian subcontinent, with Himalayan mountain range to N.

Neolithic agricultural communities had appeared in the Indus River valley by 3000 B.C. and cities at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were founded around 2500 B.C. Around 1500 B.C. Indo-Europeans (Aryans) from Central Asia imposed their religion and political system on the indigenous population and generated population movements toward southern India. Indo-European civilization was characterized by caste; everyone was a member of one of four fundamental divisions of society: Brahmins, hereditary priests responsible for higher learning and rituals; Ksatrias, warriors and administrators; Vaisas, merchants; and Sudras, farmers and subjugated peoples. At the bottom were casteless people, known later as untouchables. By the mid-first millennium B.C., Brahminism had declined into a state of religious formalism. That situation prompted two reformations around 600 B.C. the first of which produced the Jain religion; the second, Buddhism. Jainism remained confined largely to India, while Buddhism eventually influenced most of the cultures of Asia, though it died out in India itself. Buddhism was adopted as a state religion by Asoka, third and greatest emperor of the Mauryan empire (325&#x2013;184 b.c) under which much of India was united for the first time. Following the collapse of the Mauryan empire, Hinduism evolved out of Buddhism, Brahminism, and other local cults and became the dominant religion of India. South India in the post-Mauryan period was divided into numerous states, the most prominent of which was Chola, a Tamil kingdom in the southeast that had extensive trade connections throughout the Indian Ocean. The Gupta dynasty (c. A.D. 320&#x2013;544), based in the Ganges River valley, established its rule over most of northern India and created what is generally regarded as a golden age of north Indian culture, with flourishing cities and significant achievements in art, literature, and science. In the seventh century, King Sri Harsha created a short-lived feudal empire that united most of the petty states in the upper Ganges valley, while the Chalyuka dynasty dominated southern India. In the early eighth century, the Indus River valley was invaded by Arabs who introduced Islam to the region. The empire of Sri Harsha fell apart, replaced by the petty kingdoms of the Rajputs. The 11th century saw the ascendency of Islam throughout northern India, which came under the shadow of the empire of Mamud of Ghazni, based in Afghanistan. In 1192 the Ghaznavid general Kutb ud-din Aibak defeated a coalition of Rajput states; in 1206 he founded the Sultanate of Delhi, which in the 13th century held off Mongol invasions in northwestern India and brought all of the subcontinent, except for the southernmost states, under its control. While the rulers of the sultanate were Muslims, most of their subjects remained Hindu. Internal rebellions combined with the sacking of Delhi by Timur Leng (Tamerlane) in 1398 weakened the Sultanate of Delhi. In 1526 Babur, a descendant of Timur Leng, conquered all of northern India and established the Moghul empire. Under Akbar the Great, the empire flourished; Moghul culture gave rise to new styles of architecture, painting, and music. In the 17th century, the Moghul emperors were threatened by the Hindu Marathas, whose kingdom on the west-central coast rapidly encompassed most of south India. By the late 18th century, Maratha power had spread to the north, and most of the petty kingdoms of the Moghul empire became part of a Maratha confederacy, owing only nominal allegiance to Delhi. By that time all of India was threatened by the expansion of the European powers. Vasco da Gama had landed at Calicut in 1498, and in 1510 the Portuguese founded a colony at Goa. Dutch traders competed with the Portuguese during the 16th century, and British and French merchants followed in the 17th century. British trading stations were established at Surat (1612), Bombay (1661), and Calcutta (1690). In the mid-18th century, war broke out between British and French forces in India, and the French were confined to a few small enclaves. The growing instability of the Moghul empire in the face of Marathan and Rajput revolts and the expansion of the southern kingdom of Mysore encouraged the British to seek further control of Indian territory. Robert Clive's victory at Plassey in 1757 brought Orissa, Bihar, and Bengal under British control; British rule was extended to the upper Ganges in 1775. Victory over the maharaja of Mysore in 1792 paved the way for British control over the south. British parliamentary acts of 1773 and 1784 placed these acquisitions firmly under government control, and in 1803 the Moghul emperor accepted the offer of a protectorate, and British suzerainty in India was assured. After a protracted war, 1812&#x2013;23, Marathan resistance to British control was broken. The first Anglo-Afghan War, 1838&#x2013;42, was inconclusive in Afghanistan but led to consolidation of British control of the Punjab. In 1833 Parliament assumed political control of British interests in South Asia, while private merchants had unrestricted access to the economy. Plantation crops, such as opium and cotton, began to displace agriculture, which made India more dependent on imported goods. In 1857 Indian troops in the British colonial forces staged a mutiny in north-central India that lasted 14 months. In 1858 the Moghul empire was dissolved, as was the East India Company. The government of India was made directly subject to the British Crown, which exercised control through a viceroy and through the British Colonial Office. Queen Victoria was crowned empress of India in 1877. British sovereignty in India&#x2014;the raj&#x2014;was a patchwork of direct and indirect rule. In general, coastal areas, river valleys, and strategic frontier regions were ruled by British authorities, while interior states continued as British protectorates controlled by British advisers to native princes. In 1861 Indians were appointed to advisory councils of the viceroy and provincial governors. The Indian National Congress was organized in 1885. In the wake of popular demonstrations in 1905, elections were instituted to choose Indian members of the viceroy's legislative council. Separate electorates were created for the Muslim and Hindu communities, formalizing a divisive force in Indian politics and weakening opposition to British rule. In 1914, with Chinese loss of control in Tibet, India's northern boundary was pushed forward to the McMahon Line, following the highest peaks in the Himalayas. This set the stage for numerous later boundary disputes between China and India, Pakistan, and Burma. The Government of India Act of 1919 transferred some political power to elected provincial officials but left the appointed British governors firmly in control. In that year Mohandas K. Gandhi organized the first passive-resistance campaigns and was imprisoned. In 1935 the Government of India Act created elected provincial legislatures. In the first elections (1937) the Congress party under Jawaharlal Nehru won control of seven of the 11 provinces. Nehru's goal of a united Indian opposition to British rule was thwarted by Mohammed Ali Jinnah's Muslim League, which demanded the creation of a separate Muslim state. During World War II, the British military position in South Asia was complicated by calls for Indian independence. An offer of local autonomy, with independence to follow, was spurned by Nehru, and an Indian National army under Subhas Bose fought with the Japanese. Jinnah's call for an independent Pakistan was greatly enhanced by his support of the British. In 1947, the British raj became two independent nations, predominantly Hindu India and predominantly Muslim Pakistan. Despite its considerable stature in the international community at large, India has been troubled by a number of disputes with its neighbors and separatist movements within its own borders. Following independence hundreds of semiautonomous princely states were brought under control of the central government. The French ceded their remaining trading colonies in the 1950's, and Portugal gave up Goa in 1961. In 1962, India warred with China in a still unresolved dispute over their border along Kashmir and Assam. The state of Bhutan was granted independence in 1971, and in 1974 Sikkim was annexed and its monarchy abolished. India's most intractable disputes have been with Pakistan. Immediately after independence, Hindus in Pakistan and Muslims in India were set upon by the majority populations; hundreds of thousands were killed, and at least 12 million refugees fled over the border in both directions. On Jan. 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu extremist who blamed him for partition. In granting independence, Britain had divided states of Bengal and Punjab between the two countries, but fighting erupted over the status of Jammu and Kashmir, and a cease-fire line negotiated by the U.N. in 1949 has never been ratified as a formal national boundary. In 1989, separatists in the Indian part of Kashmir began calling for an end to Indian rule, and relations with Pakistan have worsened as India accused its neighbor of providing support for the guerrillas. In 1971, after 10 million refugees poured across its border, India intervened in the Pakistani civil war in an action that prompted an almost immediate cease-fire and the creation of an independent Bangladesh. India's main separatist movement involves Sikh separatists in the Punjab who seek the formation of an independent state of Khalistan, but who are thought to be supported by Pakistan. The government is also contending with separatist movements in the northeastern states of Assam and its neighbor Nagaland. The British legacy in India included a sizable national elite, well educated and committed to principles of parliamentary democracy. The English language linked the elites of India's linguistically diverse regions, easing minorities' fears of domination by a Hindi-speaking majority. India's economy had seen some industrial development under the British, but its infrastructure was geared to integration in a colonial empire rather than to independence. Port cities, heavy industry, and plantation agriculture coexisted with widespread rural poverty and the years following independence saw a massive migration of the rural poor into overburdened cities. Under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, India assumed a leadership role in the world movement of nonaligned nations and followed a policy of neutrality in international affairs. The development of good relations between the United States and Pakistan led to correspondingly difficult U.S.-India relations. In August 1971 India signed a 20-year friendship treaty with the Soviet Union. Nehru died on May 27, 1964, and was succeeded by Lal Bahadur Shastri. Nehru's daughter, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, was named prime minister on Jan. 19, 1966. In 1967 the dominant Congress party faced electoral setbacks; in 1969 it split into &#x201C;Old&#x201D; and &#x201C;New&#x201D; wings. Mrs. Gandhi's New Congress party won control of the legislature. Faced with protests and strikes after the New Congress party was convicted of voting irregularities in 1975, Mrs. Gandhi declared a state of emergency in June; censorship was imposed, thousands were arrested for political offenses, and various economic-control measures were adopted. An opposition coalition led by the Janata Dal party won a massive victory in parliamentary elections in 1977. Mrs. Gandhi was driven from office, and the state of emergency was annulled. Mrs. Gandhi's party was returned to power in 1980, and she resumed the prime ministership. After an army attack on the Sikhs' Golden Temple in Amritsar, Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards in October 1984. She was succeeded in office by her son, Rajiv, who placed the Punjab under direct control of the federal government. On Dec. 3, 1984, methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, killing over 2,500 people. The accident prompted a broad inquiry into industrial safety standards in India. In November 1989, Rajiv Gandhi's Congress party was voted out of office in general elections after people close to the government were accused of taking kickbacks in a government arms purchase scandal. Gandhi was succeeded by V.P. Singh of the Janata Dal party, whose government collapsed after 11 months over a dispute involving Hindu plans to build a temple on the site of a mosque in Ayodhya. (Hindus contend the mosque was built on the site of Rama's birthplace.) Middle-class Hindus also protested an affirmative action policy to set aside federal government jobs for members of lower castes. Singh was followed by Chandra Shekhar, whose minority government served only with the backing of the Congress party. After a parliamentary boycott by the Congress party instigated by Rajiv Gandhi, Shekhar quit the government in March 1991, agreeing to stay on as a caretaker until the May election. The election, postponed two weeks following the assassination of Gandhi, was won by the Congress party, and P.V. Narasimha Rao became prime minister. The Rao government attempted to foster economic growth by relaxing the centralized planning and controls on international trade and investment. This policy produced impressive economic gains despite a concurrent rise in corruption-related scandals. A rise in Hindu extremist feeling, however, strengthened the hand of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party. On Dec. 6, 1992, a Hindu mob demolished a mosque built several hundred years earlier on a Hindu sacred site in the city of Ayodhya; in the ensuing turmoil, riots broke out in dozens of cities, most notably Bombay, leading to the deaths of hundreds of Muslims at the hands of Hindu attackers. A series of bomb explosions killed hundreds in Bombay on Mar. 12, 1993, while dozens more were killed by an explosion in Calcutta four days later. Further riots followed, amid unsubstantiated accusations that Muslims, aided by Pakistan, were responsible for the explosions. In 1993 separatist movements in Punjab and Assam waned, but violence in Kashmir and Jammu increased dramatically; despite several attempts by India and Pakistan to institute effective talks on the issue, violence continued unabated with loss of life in the hundreds if not thousands. The Rao government's economic policies produced good results, but as India's economy strengthened its political stability weakened. The Congress Party continued to lose power to the Hindu Baratiya Janata Party. Congress was defeated in parliamentary elections in May 1996, ushering in an era of short-lived, weak coalition governments under Pres. K. R. Narayanan. Inder Kumer Gurjal formed a government in April, 1997 that fell in November. The BJP won a plurality of seats in March 1998 elections, but, to govern (under Prime Minister Vajapyee) required a 19-party coalition. Fragile authority need not exclude vigorous policy: it was the BJP coalition that carried out underground tests of five nuclear devices in May, vigorously asserted India's claims in Kashmir, and cut food subsidies as a means of reducing the deficit. It was the latter that dislodged the coalition and in April 1999, Pres. Narayanan dissolved the Lok Sabha, preparatory to India's third election campaign in three years. Perhaps sensing weakness, Muslim insurgents launched attacks against Indian forces in Kashmir. But India retaliated forcefully and peace was restored in July, although India continued to blame Pakistan for the violence. In the election results, the National Democratic Alliance, a 24-party coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, won an absolute majority; so, for the first time in 27 years, an incumbent prime minister won re-election. Despite this recent instability, India has enjoyed significant domestic and international achievements in the first 50 years after independence. The nation's territory was consolidated, and separatist movements in various provinces successfully resisted. The federal parliamentary system has proved workable, and the federal government has established its constitutional right to intervene in state affairs under some conditions. India's armed forces are large, well trained, and well equipped, with some nuclear capability. India has maintained watchful, but generally peaceful, relations with two unfriendly neighbors, Pakistan and China. The Green Revolution of the 1970's made the country self-sufficient in food for the first time since the 19th century. India has a large, well-educated middle class and a growing industrial economy. The Dec. 13, 2001 attack on the Parliament in New Delhi by five Pakistan-based terrorists greatly heightened existing tensions between the two countries. While Hindu mobs killed Muslims in Gujarat, Muslim attacks continued, though at a diminished rate in 2002, in Jammu-Kashmir. Upwards of a million troops stood poised on the border with almost daily artillery exchanges. Several terrorist attacks in Kashmir led to U.S. and British diplomatic intervention that eased tensions considerably during 2003. "}, {"text": "Winning, Losing and Breaking Even as the President Offers His New Budget Priorities\n2004-02-03T05:00:00.000Z\n Correction Appended \n WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 \u2014 The budget submitted on Monday by President Bush was good news for some departments and agencies and not-so-good news for others. \n State Department: Fighting Terrorism and Global AIDS \n In international affairs, President Bush's $31.5 billion budget gives a strong push to counterterrorism spending, international AIDS programs, foreign military assistance and embassy staffing and construction. \n It cuts aid in some traditional areas, especially bilateral or regional support administered by the Agency for International Development, by 13 percent. For example, child survival programs in Africa as well as development aid to Latin America and Eastern Europe would decline, though overall foreign assistance would rise by 9 percent. \n The budget gives a considerable increase to the Millennium Challenge Account, a new development program that offers financial incentives to countries that adopt political, economic and social policies considered to be sound. The program was devised to appeal to results-oriented critics of foreign aid. \n The president asked for $2.5 billion for the millennium account, up from $1 billion in the current year. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was host of the board's first meeting yesterday. Among those nations mentioned as likely beneficiaries are Uganda, Mongolia and Bangladesh. \n On Capitol Hill, some officials expressed concern that the administration was financing the millennium account faster than the money could be absorbed. \n \"The organization is not going to be in a position to spend money for several months, and it's already got another billion in the bank,\" said Timothy S. Rieser, a top aide to Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who sits on the Appropriations Committee. \n Mr. Rieser called the overall budget for foreign aid inadequate. \n Christopher B. Burnham, the State Department's chief financial officer, said fighting terrorism topped the list of presidential priorities in the budget, with more than $5.7 billion in programs to nations aiding the United States in that fight. The budget seeks $1.2 billion for the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan and foresees beginning construction on 13 diplomatic facilities next year. \n In addition, Mr. Bush asked for $2.8 billion in global AIDS financing, which includes $1.45 billion for the office of the new AIDS coordinator, Randall L. Tobias. He sought $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, including $463 million for Colombia, and nearly $5 billion in military aid to foreign governments, both modest increases over last year. \n CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS \n Environment: Research Budget Is Lowered Again \n The Bush administration has repeatedly emphasized the importance of \"sound science\" in developing environmental regulations, but this year's federal budget makes significant cuts in research at the Environmental Protection Agency. \n Most notably, the agency has cut its competitive grants program by about a third from the $100 million level it has maintained for the past several years. The program, which pays for studies by scientists outside the agency, has traditionally accounted for 15 percent to 20 percent of the research budget in the agency's office of research and development. \n Over all, the administration's budget for science and technology at the agency is $689 million, 12 percent less than the $782 million authorized in 2004. The total request for the agency is $7.8 billion, 7.2 percent less than last year's budget of $8.3 billion. \n On a conference call yesterday, Steve Johnson, the acting deputy E.P.A. administrator, said the competitive-grants program, known as Science to Achieve Results or STAR, was cut back because it did not do well in its review by the White House's Office of Management and Budget. \n Paul Gilman, the agency's associate administrator for research and development, defended the grants program, noting that last year the National Research Council, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, reviewed it positively. The review concluded that \"the program has established and maintains a high degree of scientific excellence\" and that \"it should continue to be an important part of E.P.A.'s research program.\" \n Dr. Gilman said STAR was pushed aside by other agency initiatives, like a $65 million plan to reduce diesel emissions from school buses. \"You have to set your priorities,\" he said. \"Where do you make cuts for things like clean school buses and things like that?\" \n JENNIFER 8. LEE \n Transportation: Promoting a Budget as a Job Creator \n The Bush administration's budget for transportation is $58.7 billion, up $4.4 billion from its request for the current fiscal year. Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta called the proposal an employment bill, with each $1 billion spent on highways generating 47,500 jobs. Mr. Minetta also said the request would enhance safety, although the administration has shied from a federal law on failing to use seat belts, which Mr. Mineta identified as the single largest transportation problem. \n The bill provides $14 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration. That includes a $393 million reduction in the budget for facilities and equipment. The aviation agency said it would defer several programs, including one to improve the accuracy of the Global Positioning System so it can be used to land planes in low visibility and another to let controllers and pilots communicate via e-mail instead of voice, which was supposed to improve the capacity of the air traffic system. \n Mr. Mineta said last week that the F.A.A. should triple the capacity of the nation's air traffic system in the next few years, and he said yesterday that that should still happen, despite the cuts. \n The administrator of the agency, Marion C. Blakey, said the F.A.A. was studying whether to change the rule that requires air traffic controllers to retire at 56 and how much money would be saved through such a change. Many controllers were hired in 1981 as replacements for strikers and are now nearing the mandatory-retirement age. \n The budget request for Amtrak is for $900 million. For the current year, the administration also sought $900 million, but Congress approved $1.2 billion. \n Mr. Mineta said the administration would be willing to support $1.4 billion for Amtrak but only if some of it went to new entities, partly financed by the states, that took over some Amtrak functions. \n MATTHEW L. WALD \n Justice: F.B.I. Gains Most, With Terror the Key \n The Federal Bureau of Investigation is the big winner in the Justice Department's $18.7 billion budget, as department officials emphasize the need for more investigators, better technology and more innovative programs to fight terrorism. \n That push will come at the expense of traditional law enforcement programs like grants to local police departments. \n The department budget includes an increase of $371 million for antiterrorism programs like a new center run by the Central Intelligence Agency to analyze terrorist intelligence and another center to coordinate watch lists. \n The F.B.I. would receive an increase of 11.4 percent, which would take its budget to $5.1 billion. Among the big-ticket items are tens of millions of dollars to improve intelligence analysis, investigate terrorism and fight cybercrime. The budget would allow the bureau to add 159 field agents to investigate terrorism and 86 positions to help translate foreign intelligence. It would add $9 million to counterterrorism research on biochemical weapons. \n In all, the budget would increase the number of agents working on counterterrorism, to 5,115 next year, from 4,590 now. \n With overall budget authority at the Justice Department rising 2 percent, officials expect potentially major cuts in other areas, and that is likely to set off debate in Congress. \n The F.B.I. plans, for instance, to eliminate all 95 positions in the section that investigates government fraud, reassigning those employees to counterterrorism and other \"higher priority items,\" the department said. \n ERIC LICHTBLAU \n NASA: Money for Mars, but From Elsewhere \n President Bush's new vision for the space program, which looks to send astronauts to the Moon and, eventually, Mars, begins with a proposed 5.6 percent increase in National Aeronautics and Space Administration's budget for the 2005 fiscal year to $16.2 billion. \n But most of the $12 billion the administration wants to spend on this goal over the next five years would come from redirecting $11 billion from other NASA programs. \n Under the Bush plan, money for the exploration initiative would come from ending space shuttle operations by 2010 and ending use of the International Space Station in 2016. \n The $800 million increase that NASA would receive over its current $15.4 billion would include $300 million for extra expenses in returning the space shuttle fleet to flight after the Columbia disaster last year; other new money would go toward developing alternatives to the shuttles. \n The 2005 figures call for a modest increase in NASA's space science budget, to $4.1 billion from $3.9 billion, while spending on earth science would drop to $1.48 billion from $1.52 billion. \n WARREN E. LEARY \n Health: Focusing on Insurance and Food Safety \n The Bush administration is again proposing new tax credits to help the uninsured buy health coverage, with a $70 billion plan over 10 years that would cover an estimated 4.5 million Americans. \n The budget would also give a significant increase to the Food and Drug Administration to secure the safety of the food supply, part of what Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, described as an effort to strengthen the public health system. \n \"These investments not only will better prepare our nation for and protect us from a bioterror attack, they will also better prepare us for any public health emergency,\" Mr. Thompson said. \n He said the budget presented an \"aggressive agenda\" while \"remaining fiscally responsible to the American taxpayer.\" \n Not counting the entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, Mr. Thompson said, the spending authority for his department would rise by 1.2 percent. Budget analysts say that is not enough to take into account inflation and the increase in population. \n In general, President Bush's budget underscored his administration's reliance on tax breaks to encourage the private sector to expand health insurance coverage to the 43 million uninsured Americans. Mr. Bush would also provide more incentives for people to use tax-free health savings accounts, in conjunction with high-deductible insurance plans, and make it easier for small businesses to band together to buy coverage. \n The cost of health insurance is a hot issue in this election year, and Mr. Bush's plan was quickly denounced by Democrats and liberal advocates. \n At the budget briefing yesterday, Mr. Thompson also addressed the dispute over the cost of the new Medicare law: the Congressional Budget Office put it at $395 billion over 10 years, the administration at $534 billion. \n \"It's an impossibility to say at this point in time which one is correct,\" Mr. Thompson said. \n Much of the discrepancy, he added, stemmed from different assumptions on how many of the elderly would sign up for the new voluntary prescription drug benefit. \n ROBIN TONER \n Agriculture: Less for Wetlands and Rural Aid \n President Bush's budget of more than $81 billion for the Department of Agriculture includes more money for the division responsible for research into mad cow disease. But there are significant reductions in financing of conservation and rural development. \n For example, the administration suggested that it would ask Congress to reduce the number of acres eligible for a program that pays farmers to retire land from cultivation and convert it into wetlands. \n Scott Faber, a water resources specialist for Environmental Defense, a organization based in New York, said that in seeking to reduce this program, the annual wetlands reserve program, to 200,000 acres from 250,000, administration officials were \"missing a huge opportunity to help farmers who want to reduce pollution.\" \n The budget maintains, for the most part, the subsidies that generally benefit large agribusinesses. \n The budget for food and marketing, which covers research into mad cow disease, would rise by nearly $200 million. Tom Buis, the chief economist of the National Farmers Union, said that while that was helpful, the overall budget severely cut back programs that supported agricultural life in rural communities. \"We're really concerned that rural development and conservation programs are being cut in the president's budget,\" Mr. Buis said. \n NEIL A. LEWIS \n Energy: Offering Less for Tax Breaks \n The Bush administration's budget for energy programs offers almost $7.2 billion in tax breaks over 10 years to promote energy production and conservation, far less than the $25 billion sought by Congress in the energy legislation now stalled on Capitol Hill. \n In apparent recognition that the broad bill might not succeed, the budget also emphasizes money for individual energy projects favored by the administration, including $228 million in 2005 for research into a hydrogen fuel cell, an increase of 42 percent over 2004. \n There is also $275 million for work on a coal-burning power plant that would capture its emissions of carbon dioxide, a global warming gas, for long-term storage, as well as its other pollutants. \n The spending plan assumes the administration will win approval to begin oil and gas production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, estimating royalty payments of $2.4 billion in 2006 with about half that amount to be spent on alternative energy programs. But the Senate has repeatedly blocked opening the refuge to drilling, a position it does not seem likely to change this year. \n While proposals to upgrade the nation's power grid remain bogged down in the energy measure, the administration proposes to spend $91 million on efforts to modernize the power transmission infrastructure. \n The budget calls for spending $7.4 billion to clean up sites contaminated with radioactivity from nuclear weapons production and research and provides a $303 million increase, to $880 million, to continue development of a nuclear waste depository in Nevada. \n CARL HULSE \n Correction: Feb. 19, 2004, Thursday \n An article on Feb. 2 about the 2005 budget for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department misstated the increase in the number of F.B.I. agents who will be working on counterterrorism next year. It is to increase to 2,633 from 2,422, not to 5,115 from 4,590. "}, {"text": "The Killer Gown Is Essential, But the Prom Date? Not So Much\n2004-06-15T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen it came to the Christopher Columbus High School prom, Amanda Palma, a petite, clear-skinned prom princess nominee, overlooked nothing.\nAmanda, 17, paid $120 for her spot in a white stretch Ford Excursion limousine, spent an hour and a half at a salon having her hair swept into a glamorous up-do and had her fingernails painted to match her lavender strapless gown.\n''For me it's like, it's my prom, I'm going all out,'' Amanda said as the limo made its way through the Bronx toward a country club in Westchester County. ''The hair, the limo, the works.''\nEverything, that is, but a date.\nInstead, Amanda chose to spend the evening late last month with 16 friends, half of them in couples and the other half dateless, like herself. That was how she wanted it.\n''I think it's better that way,'' said Amanda, who turned down offers from two young men. ''You don't feel obligated to be with someone the whole night. You just enjoy yourself.''\nNot too long ago, going to prom without a date would have been an act of bravado, if not something unthinkable. Going solo was a prom night horror story, the protagonist's evening spent sulking by the buffet while happy couples swayed to slow songs. The equation was simple: Find a date, any date, or skip the prom.\nBut seasoned chaperones at New York City high schools, and other teenage trend watchers across the nation, say that in recent years they have noticed a curious phenomenon. Increasingly, they say, the prom date is losing its paramount status. Students are more comfortable buying their tickets, ordering their corsages and spending their evenings in groups, flitting from one dance partner to another.\n''You see that more and more,'' said Bert Blanco, the coordinator of student affairs at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, who has helped organize proms for two decades. ''The older staff members from the old generation, they're all a little taken aback by it. It's surprising. When you think prom, you think a date.''\nAmong students and those who scrutinize their ways, theories abound, from the sobering to the uplifting.\nSome teenagers say dating is no longer a relevant institution and that the prom is simply adapting to the times.\n''The couple thing is overrated,'' Sierra Moona, 17, said earlier this month after posing for pictures with her nondates for the DeWitt Clinton prom: a group of girls, including one whose traditional Bangladeshi parents thought she was at an alumni dinner. ''It gets too clingy.''\nFor some boys the decision is financial. Going with a date doubles ticket and transportation costs.\nBut in general, students simply say that on prom night, it is best to be unattached. Particularly in a city where only half of students graduate from high school in four years, if at all, the senior prom is too precious and hard-earned a milestone to risk on an albatross, let alone bypass if one's crush asks another.\n''I spent four years in high school,'' said Melissa Pujols, 18, who goes to Columbus High School in the Bronx and spent her prom with friends after the boy she was interested in asked someone else. ''I deserve my prom.''\nAtoosa Rubenstein, the editor in chief of Seventeen magazine, said things have changed since she started monitoring proms six years ago. Ten percent of Seventeen readers surveyed this year said they planned to go to the prom in groups, up from 7 percent last year.\n''Nowadays the emphasis is less on who are you going with, and more on, 'When are we going?''' said Ms. Rubenstein, who skipped her own senior prom on Long Island in 1989 because no one asked her. She spent the evening serving ice cream at a nearby Carvel.\nThe phenomenon seems to be more popular in urban areas and their nearby suburbs. Ms. Rubenstein and others said it was not unique to New York City, although even in New York, most teenagers still go to the prom with dates, and some who go without dates say they wish things were otherwise.\nJolene Santana, 18, organized a party bus, with leather seats, flashing lights, a fog machine and a flat-screen television, to ferry herself and 20 friends, most but not all of them paired up, to the Clinton High School prom. She chose not to invite her older boyfriend, which freed her up to help the bus driver get from stop to stop.\nJolene, in an apple-red gown with matching gloves, stayed calm as she waited for the bus to arrive, but her mother, Arlene Fernandez, had been tingling with excitement all day. Ms. Fernandez, 40, did not attend her own senior prom because she had dropped out of high school after becoming pregnant with Jolene's older brother.\n''These kids are actually graduating, moving on with their lives,'' she marveled, her eyes glistening, as Jolene and her friends posed for pictures against a brick apartment building.\nMelissa Medina, 17, said she turned down four offers for dates. Instead she went to the Columbus High prom in a limousine with a couple, seven other single girls and one boy. After making it this far, not to mention spending more than $700 on a black satin dress, an emerald-cut cubic zirconium ring and other various prom necessities, a lot was riding on the night's perfection.\n''This is a very big thing,'' Melissa explained, reapplying her lipstick in the ladies' room lounge. ''To be tied down by some guy?''\nIt is not just girls who go dateless. ''If we would have chosen to bring dates, there are certain complications,'' Dusean Brown, 17, explained over a plate of steak as his Columbus High School classmates, including one who continued to wear sunglasses in the dimly lit Lake Isle Country Club ballroom, nodded in agreement.\n''We got here on time, we mingled,'' Dusean said. ''If we had brought dates, I doubt it would have gone as smoothly.''\nThe music makes it easier. Group dances like the Cha Cha Slide do not require partners, and throbbing Jay-Z songs make for all sorts of interesting combinations.\nFor the Columbus High School prom, Deniele Shillingford, 17, bought her own corsage, with pink and white roses that matched her floor-length gown.\nRosa Martinez, 18, who arrived with one date and four male friends, ended up with two corsages. The group posed together for the professional photographer, with Rosa in the middle in a classic diva pose, a corsage on each wrist.\nThe second corsage was from Daniel Flores, 18, who graduated from another Bronx high school last year and had attended his senior prom with a date. Only half the night was fun.\n''I think it's a bit better with the friends,'' said Daniel, who was one of the four single males accompanying Rosa and her date. ''I'll just leave it at that.''\nTeachers, glowing at the sight of so many graduating seniors in glamorous attire, are admiring, even envious.\n''We were stressing from junior year until senior year -- you had to have a date,'' said Maryanne Mola, an assistant principal at Clinton who went to the 1968 Columbus prom with ''a kid in my art class.''\n''I only wanted to go to the prom, and you couldn't go alone,'' she said. ''This way you're really your own person. It's a better step to adulthood.''\nIn the early evening, as parents, neighbors and extended family members gathered on sidewalks to await the arrival of limousines, party buses and town cars, some were nostalgic for the prom dates of yore.\nWhile waiting for a limo to pick up her brother-in-law, Joseph Thomas, 18, Amanda Thomas, 26, said she wished Joseph, looking dapper in a rented tuxedo and champagne-colored vest, would have gone with a date. Ms. Thomas said she cherished the memories of her own prom in Puerto Rico. She said she wore a lacy beige dress with spaghetti straps and was accompanied by Peter Thomas, Joseph's brother and now her husband.\nSome parents were relieved, given certain myths surrounding prom night, and others were skeptical.\n''I was like, 'My friends are my date,''' said Joanni Rivera, who wore a rhinestone-studded gown with a plunging neckline. ''My mom was asking me, 'Are you lying to me?'''"}, {"text": "MEDIA; Made for TV, but Shown First in a Theater\n2004-05-10T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nOver the last 25 years, few people have done more to propel documentaries to popularity than Sheila Nevins, executive vice president of HBO and Cinemax for original programming, documentaries and family. But in nurturing and releasing films ranging from ''Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt,'' to the 2004 Oscar nominees ''My Architect,'' ''Balseros'' and ''Capturing the Friedmans,'' Ms. Nevins has unwittingly made her job a much more difficult one.\nHBO and Ms. Nevins no longer have the field pretty much to themselves, as movie studios and rival cable outlets rush to feed the audience's craving.\nTo adapt, Ms. Nevins has had to overhaul the way she does business. When buying a documentary, HBO, a unit of Time Warner, no longer insists that it be shown on HBO first before a lengthy release in theaters. Ms. Nevins has to spend more to acquire projects, and more to finance them. And she finds herself collaborating with theater exhibitors, a group she could once ignore.\nMark Urman, distribution president at ThinkFilm, a distributor of independent films, has witnessed the shift first-hand. Four years ago, when he worked at Lions Gate Entertainment, he called Ms. Nevins about release plans for ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye,'' a documentary detailing the life of Tammy Faye Bakker. She did not want to talk to him. ''She said, 'You open the movie, get all the attention, and when it's time for the movie to air, there's nothing left to say,''' he said.\nMs. Nevins's new thinking is on display with ''The Agronomist,'' Jonathan Demme's portrait of a murdered Haiti activist. After ThinkFilm acquired the film, which is currently in theaters, Ms. Nevins bought the broadcast rights. This time, Mr. Urman recalled, ''She said, 'We love you, you'll make noise with the movie, it has to be on HBO.'''\nLast year's sleeper hit ''Spellbound'' is the new documentary model, a movie about real people that borrows cinematic fiction techniques. The movie about a national spelling bee took in $5.7 million in theaters before showing on HBO. ''We embarked on 'Spellbound' jointly,'' Mr. Urman said. ''We split rights, working together so that everybody got what they needed. We opened in May 2003, HBO aired in November and the video went out in January.''\nTraditionally, in exchange for financing a documentary feature, cable channels like HBO claimed full credit in an on-air premiere. ''It used to be a hard and fast rule that you had to be on HBO first, then DVD or video,'' Ms. Nevins said. ''The concept of going theatrical, we'd never think of. That world has changed. Now HBO is very theatrical-release friendly. Thanks to new technology there's now so much product to buy and make.'' But Ms. Nevins said that 50 percent of HBO's films still air there first.\nWhile HBO is still the first financing stop for most nonfiction filmmakers, the new documentary heat wave brings with it a host of hungry competitors. More and more specialized distributors and cable channels, like Arts & Entertainment, Lifetime, Sundance and the Independent Film Channel, are jumping into the documentary fray. The reason, not surprisingly, is financial. In 1998, documentaries brought in $7.6 million at the box office, according to Nielsen EDI. Last year, the total was $49.2 million.\n''I want to be in that business,'' said Nancy Utley, marketing president of Fox Searchlight Pictures, a top-ranked art film distributor. ''The popularity of reality TV reminds us that there's nothing more fascinating than real human beings. So many movies are mining the same territory that has been mined before. Docs are fresh and give you something different.''\nMs. Nevins praises Robert Redford's Sundance Film Festival for helping to raise the profile of the documentary. This past January at Sundance, distributors jostled over a spate of shock documentaries: the McDonald's fast-food expos\u00e9 ''Super-Size Me'' was snapped up by Roadside Attractions and Showtime (not a traditional haven for documentaries); Lions Gate gave $2.5 million for worldwide rights to ''Open Water,'' a docudrama about two scuba divers left behind in the shark-infested Caribbean; and Sony Pictures Classics paid $2 million for American rights to the surfing documentary ''Riding Giants,'' to be released by this summer.\nSeveral film distributors cite Michael Moore for changing the tone of what is considered acceptable by pumping his documentaries, like the Oscar-winning ''Bowling for Columbine,'' full of entertaining, sassy attitude. Mr. Moore is seeking a new distributor for his ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' after the Walt Disney Company refused to allow its subsidiary, Miramax, to release the movie, which is critical of President Bush. ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' will make its debut this month in competition at the Cannes Film Festival. ''The new documentary is populist, the story of an interesting subject, has auteur style, and doesn't follow the rules of the 60's and 70's strict documentary authority,'' says Tom Bernard of Sony Pictures Classics, which released ''Winged Migration,'' an $11 million French import, last year, and financed Erroll Morris's 2004 Oscar winner, ''The Fog of War.''\n''Sheila Nevins is the world of the past, of the Maysles brothers, Barbara Kopple and D.A. Pennebaker,'' he said. ''Thanks to reality television, the American public is comfortable with documentary style now, and will easily travel from the TV screen to the theater.''\nTo stay competitive, Ms. Nevins has adapted. After Andrew Jarecki's home-movie expos\u00e9 ''Capturing the Friedmans'' made its debut at Sundance in January 2003, HBO snapped it up. Magnolia Films released the film in theaters last May. After it took in $50,000 in one week at Angelika Theater in New York, the Landmark theater chain booked it nationally on its 185 screens. (To date it has made $3 million.) The movie was released on DVD in January 2004, with the addition of a short film about one of its subjects, but will not be shown on HBO until this July. ''HBO Video is part of the action,'' said Ms. Nevins. ''We invented a piece for TV to make it viable, to give TV viewers a new element, a way to catapult them to take a new look at the film.''\nMs. Nevins had always used small-scale theater releases to qualify a worthy standout, like the Spanish TV film ''Balseros,'' for an Oscar nomination. ''HBO knows how to play the Oscar release game,'' said Alex Gibney, a documentary producer whose films include ''The Blues.''\n''Sheila Nevins is aware of both delivering raw meat to hungry dogs, and at the same time, knowing when a film comes along that will be an award winner,'' he said. ''Filmmakers are interested in having their films shown theatrically. She has to decide whether that undermines what pay-channel subscribers get at HBO.''\nMs. Nevins said: ''Until four years ago, I wasn't in acquisitions. ThinkFilm gave me a tape of a Mongolian docudrama that looks like it was made on Mars about a camel who cries. I said to Mark, 'What, are you crazy?' It was so sweet, I wept.'' Ms. Nevins acquired ''Story of a Weeping Camel'' for HBO.\n''I know how to make and market documentaries. I don't understand the business of film distribution,'' she said. ''Now we have to make a quick decision whether it's TV or theatrical. Will it be so noisy that it will be good for HBO even after it shows in theaters, like 'Spellbound' or 'My Architect'? It's an exciting new market to be in.''\nCorrection: May 13, 2004, Thursday A picture caption in Business Day on Monday about a documentary on the architect Louis I.

To that end, they say, a homegrown breed of imams must be created.\n\"We are here to create modern imams who will respond to the needs of our Muslims in France and in Europe,\" said Zuhair Mahmood, the Iraqi-born director of the school who trained as a nuclear scientist and helped found it 12 years ago. \"We need more mosques for the faithful and that means more imams.\"\nThe perceived threat is so great that a number of European governments closely monitor the activities and sermons of their Muslim clerics.\nFrance has expelled more than dozen Muslim clerics for violations of human rights or public order since 2001, most recently Abdelkader Bouziane, an Algerian-born imam and father of 16 who asserts that the Koran permits men to beat unfaithful wives.\nIn Italy last November, the Interior Ministry expelled a Senegalese-born imam after he called for suicide bombings and declared a \"blood pact\" with Osama bin Laden.\nOn Friday, Britain decided to charge a militant Muslim cleric, Abu Hamza al-Masri, a former nightclub bouncer who has supported Osama bin Laden, with terrorism offenses, stalling an American effort to extradite him to the United States.\nBut creating an army of learned, law-abiding, Europeanized imams is not easy. State involvement in religion in the Arab world is commonplace, but in Europe a government role can be seen as a violation of privacy and human rights.\nSpain's interior minister, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alonso, set off a firestorm of criticism in May when he proposed the creation of a mandatory registry of clerics and places of worship and the monitoring of sermons.\nThe Netherlands is experimenting tentatively with required government-financed programs to teach imams \"courses of integration\" about newer Dutch values, including a greater acceptance of euthanasia and drug use.\nUnder new regulations in Britain, Muslim imams and other \"ministers of religion\" wishing to enter Britain to work must show a basic command of English.\nIslam does not require its prayer leaders to have a formal degree of learning in religion. An imam does not have to be an Islamic scholar but can be anyone that a community of believers appoints.\n\"In Italy,\" said Omar Danilo Speranza, president of the Association of Italian Muslims, an umbrella group, \"even a butcher can call himself an imam.\"\nMr. Speranza said his organization will begin certifying imams it believes are competent, that is, those \"who have a reading of the Koran that is more peaceful, more oriented towards love.\"\nBut for many Muslim communities in Europe, personal and ethnic ties with their imam are often more important than an outside seal of approval.\n\"The idea of producing imams is still controversial,\" said James P. Piscatori, an American who is a professor of Islamic politics at Oxford University. \"On the one hand, you want your own imams because the imported ones are seen as conveyor belts for bad ideas. On the other hand, the communities say, 'Who are you to tell us who our imam should be or how he should be trained?\"'\nPerhaps the biggest obstacle to creating the profession here in Europe is money: it is hard to make a living as an imam.\n\"An imam is not an official position; it's poorly paid and there's no security,\" said Olivier Roy, the French scholar on Islam. \"Why should a bright young French or British boy spend five years studying Islam only to find that there's no real job, that the community just wants someone to lead the prayers and conduct weddings and funerals?\"\nIndeed, among the graduates of the institute in Burgundy are would-be teachers and counselors, but very few imams. Many students come only for the two-year Arabic-language program. Last year, only one graduate became a bona fide imam with a job in a mosque.\n\"I did business-marketing at home and that's all about how you sell your product and my product is Islam,\" said Fahimul Anam, a 31-year-old Briton born in Bangladesh who dreams of work in education management. \"I don't necessarily feel I have to become an imam to do that.\"\nComplicating matters is that the French government regards the Union of Islamic Organizations, the movement that runs the Burgundy school, as well as branches in Wales and in a suburb of Paris, as potentially dangerous.\nThe organization derives its inspiration from the banned Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, emphasizes personal purification and grass-roots proselytizing and aims to influence all aspects of a Muslim's life. Mr. Mahmood, the director, made headlines eight years ago when he won a lawsuit requiring the local high school in the nearby town of Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon to allow his two daughters to cover their hair in class.\nLast March, 100 followers of the far right-wing National Front party staged a demonstration in the town demanding that the Burgundy school be closed, calling it a hotbed of extremism that was producing Europe's \"future political-religious agitators.\"\nIn west London, the Muslim College, financed by a Libyan foundation connected to the government, similarly turns out students who have studied Arabic and Islamic studies but few imams.\n\"If the authorities would pay them, they'd all become imams,\" said Zaki Badawi, its Egyptian director. \"They find temptation elsewhere.\"\nRivalries within Muslim communities have made it more difficult to forge a common approach to imams.\nSince its founding in 1998, the Islamic University of Rotterdam claims to have trained about 20 practicing imams, according to Gokcekus Ertogrul, the university's secretary general.\nBut in recent years, according to some scholars, the university has increasingly been financed and come under the influence of an Islamic movement in Turkey, and has been criticized for losing its Dutch character.\n\"Much of what they say about their students is not true,\" said Johan Hendrik Meuleman, a fellow at Oxford University's Center for Islamic Studies who was once a volunteer lecturer at the university. \"Volunteers like me didn't accept the takeover from Turkey.\"\nMr. Ertogrul fiercely denies the charges.\nIn 2001, Mr. Meuleman helped create the Islamic University of Europe outside of Rotterdam, intended to train Muslim chaplains for hospitals, prisons and the military and perhaps a small number of imams.\nUsing municipal financing, Mr. Meuleman already has given Dutch language training and a course in Dutch culture to a group of imams living and working in The Hague.\nAnother problem in training imams inside Europe is deciding who is qualified to do it. Dalil Boubakeur, the director of the main mosque of Paris, and president of a French nationwide Islamic council sanctioned by the state, is proud of his fledgling imam-training school.\n\"We are forming a cadre of imams who speak French and can relate to the young Muslims of France,\" Mr. Boubakeur said.\nBut both the mosque and the school are financed by the Algerian government, and that makes them suspect in the minds of some experts.\n\"It is not a real school,\" said Mr. Roy, perhaps France's most respected scholar of Islam. \"It is just a tool of Boubakeur's power.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr. Boubakeur criticized the school in Burgundy because it teaches all its courses in Arabic, not French, and he has branded its parent organization \"fundamentalist.\"\nAmong the imams who have done their studies in Europe, there are different assessments about how the programs have worked.\nVicente Motta al-Faro, 29, a Spanish convert to Islam and the sole graduate of the Burgundy school last year, could not find a job as an imam and is about to start a job teaching Islamic culture at a center in Valencia. Becoming an imam, he said, \"depends on which Muslim community has money, which few have.\"\nChedli Meskini, by contrast, a 38-year-old Tunisian-born French citizen who completed a four-year course at the school in 1997, was luckier. He landed a full-time job at a mosque in Le Havre, where he preaches in both French and Arabic.\n\"These days, imams are in hot demand,\" he said. \"And to find an Arabic and French-speaking imam, well, I don't want to say it like this, but they need people like me.\"\nMr. Meskini's salary: $8.90 an hour, less than France's minimum wage."}, {"text": "You Paid How Much for That Haircut?\n2004-11-21T05:00:00.000Z\nON a recent weekday afternoon, Orlando Pita, hairdresser to celebrities like Jennifer Connelly, Naomi Campbell and Kirsten Dunst, received a client in his new salon, Orlo, on the third floor of a nondescript walkup on Gansevoort Street.\nMr. Pita, 42, stood mesmerized behind the woman's brunet head, puzzling in a way that suggested he was examining a compelling piece of abstract art. He worked in monastic silence, his scissors venturing only the most tentative stabs. With each move, he stepped back, occasionally blowing the hair with a drier, watching the way it waved under the heat, his brow pressed in concentration.\nThe entire process lasted about 80 minutes. And each minute cost about $10: Mr. Pita charges $800 for a haircut.\nIf that seems like an extraordinary sum to charge, consider that New York has always been the hub of the outrageously expensive coiffure. But what's different now is that there seems to be a race for the stratosphere, as if a haircut were the new It luxury item, as fetishized as a Kelly bag or a pair of Jimmy Choos.\nAs big-ticket hairdressers sprout all over Manhattan -- with an especially dense concentration in the district formerly known for meatpacking -- stylists, salon owners and customers are loudly debating exactly how much is too much.\nMr. Pita defended his $800 price tag, a new high for the city, and a fee that is the equivalent of twice the annual income of the average citizen of Bangladesh.\n\"Your hair is one of the first things people notice about you,\" he said. \"You can spend a lot on clothes, but you wear your hair every day. The luxury market is not about needs, or 'Is it worth it?' It's about 'What can I spend?' \"\nMichael Gordon, the founder and president of Bumble and Bumble, which opened a salon on West 13th Street in May that is a curling iron's throw from Orlo, said he didn't buy that. At 40,000 square feet, with the most expensive haircut going for $250 but most much less, the Bumble and Bumble salon is pure populism next to Orlo's exclusivity.\n\"On the one hand, there is probably nothing you're going to buy that you're going to wear every day for six weeks,\" Mr. Gordon said. \"On the other, it concerns me that some of the stuff is ego driven, bravado, a competition to see who can be more expensive. It's the hair version of who can get an appointment with Pat Wexler.\" (He was referring to Dr. Patricia Wexler, a New York dermatologist.)\nFor years New York stylists have been commanding prices many times higher than those in, say, Nebraska. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fekkai raised eyebrows when he first started charging $300 a cut in the late 1990's. (Mr. Fekkai has been cutting hair less frequently in recent years. He entered into a joint venture with Chanel in 1996 and is now chief executive of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fekkai & Company, which generated approximately $36 million in 2003, according to a report earlier this year in Women's Wear Daily. When he does cut hair, he charges $400 but is planning to raise prices next year, he wrote in an e-mail message.)\nRobbin McClain, the editor in chief of American Salon, a trade magazine, said her antennae first perked up several years ago upon hearing that John Sahag, the onetime tonsorial minister to clients like Jennifer Lopez, was charging $400 for a cut.\n\"At that time that seemed really outrageous,\" Ms. McClain said.\nIn the last year several high-profile hairdressers have opened salons with big ambitions or big price tags. Leading the fray was Sally Hershberger, whose eponymous salon opened on West 14th Street last fall. Ms. Hershberger, who became famous for the shaggily demure style worn by Meg Ryan, charges $600.\nAccording to a report by American Salon, the average women's haircut in the United States costs about $21 for a cut in a salon with fewer than 6 chairs, up to $44 for a salon with more than 13 chairs. So what makes a haircut that costs 14 to 18 times the average high-priced salon haircut in the rest of the country worth it in New York?\n\"Look, even $250 is expensive,\" Ms. Hershberger said over a high-protein breakfast at Pastis on Thursday, her hair scrunched in a style college students typically refer to as \"bed head.\" \"But you have to remember, hair is the first thing people notice. When you get a facelift, people say, 'Hey, you look great, did you change your hair?' \"\nAt Orlo, Mr. Pita said, he had at first had misgivings about charging such a high price. \"I toyed with it at first,\" he said, a spectral black-and-white portrait of Kate Moss in platinum-blond hair staring down from the freshly painted white wall behind him. \"Eight hundred dollars is a lot of money, but so is five, six, seven hundred dollars.\" But he said his price was a practical one, in line with the fees he charges for his work in the fashion industry doing runway shows and magazine shoots for photographers like Steven Meisel and companies like Gucci.\nHis explanation didn't wash with Ms. McClain of American Salon. \"To me that honestly doesn't make that much sense,\" she said. A stylist on a shoot or a fashion show is paid by a corporate source, typically willing to spend the kind of money necessary to achieve perfection in an image that might reach millions of people.\n\"When you're on a shoot, someone else is paying for it, but when someone is in the salon, they're paying for it themselves,\" Ms. McClain said. \"I don't get it.\"\nMr. Pita stood by his number.\n\"I decided not to offend my friends in the fashion industry,\" he said.\nKenneth Battelle, who runs the Kenneth salon in the Waldorf-Astoria and whose clients have included Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Gloria Vanderbilt, Brooke Astor, Lauren Bacall and Marilyn Monroe, said that charging $800 for a haircut was \"an ego trip.\"\n\"And anyone who pays that much money to go to the meatpacking district to have their hair done is a meathead,\" he added. (Mr. Battelle charges $155, and does not accept tips.)\nCertainly, having one's hair cut by one of the high-priced brigade means careful scheduling, and earns the kind of bragging rights New Yorkers love, like securing a table at Per Se or a private viewing of the Modern's galleries before the official reopening. In the case of Serge Normant, the new stylist at John Frieda on Madison Avenue, he is required by the terms of his contract to be in the salon just four days a month. His price: $500. (He said he tried to avoid tips.)\nMr. Normant said that because he, like Mr. Pita, has spent the bulk of his career working on runway shows and shoots and is not yet well known to the civilian salon-going public, anything higher than $500 would be \"pretentious.\"\n\"But I'm not saying that next year I won't raise the price,\" he added with a wink.\nClients are quick to defend the pricey hairdressers. Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a former model and the author of \"American Style\" (Assouline, 2004), has had her hair styled by both Mr. Normant and Mr. Pita and said that women should consider the expense worth it.\n\"I know women who spend $400 on a pair of shoes they wear once,\" Ms. Bensimon said. \"Why not spend $600 on a haircut that lasts for six months and turns a nobody into a somebody?\"\nThe notion that a nobody will become a celebrated somebody by virtue of a haircut bothers Dr. Dawn Esposito, the chairwoman of the sociology department and a professor of popular culture at St. John's University in Queens.\n\"That sounds like it's about the cult of celebrity and living vicariously,\" Dr. Esposito said. \" 'Wow, if this person has done Naomi Campbell's hair or Sarah Jessica Parker's hair or Jennifer Aniston's hair, then maybe I can be more like that celebrity. Imagine whose hair they have touched.' \" While the price undoubtedly lures a clientele that is mostly wealthy, \"you're probably also seeing a fair number of middle-class women who are putting the charge on their credit cards,\" she said. \"And that's just sad. It's obscene the things we do with our disposable income. And the disposable income we imagine we have.\"\nPenny Howell Jolly, a professor of art history at Skidmore College and the principal author of \"Hair: Untangling a Social History\" (Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum, 2004), said that hair has been known throughout history to function as a billboard, advertising one's status, class and political or religious beliefs.\n\"But I'm not sure an $800 haircut would be evident walking down the street in the way that an 18th-century French aristocrat would be noticeable with a powdered wig,\" she said. \"So what is it for? Your own satisfaction knowing that you can spend $800 on a haircut and almost no one else in the world can? Or maybe it's something you talk about at cocktail parties, and everyone in your social circle knows that this person charges $800, and it becomes a social marker that way.\"\nAt Bumble and Bumble, Mr. Gordon (who cuts hair very rarely) said that high prices often make for an eventually boring clientele.\n\"When I started out, training in these blue-blood salons in London in the 70's, we got a very specific type of person,\" he said. \"These were women who visited the salon once, twice, five times a week. They didn't even touch their own hair with a hairbrush. And that's not the kind of client we want here. I knew we didn't want that Park Avenue, Madison Avenue, just-wealthy types. They don't want change. We want the cool people to come. And they do.\"\nBut the cool celebrities flock to the high-end stylists. Ms. Hershberger often styles Sarah Jessica Parker's hair, she said. But Mr. Normant also mentioned last week that he had an appointment with Ms. Parker. John Barrett, whose salon is in Bergdorf Goodman, has also done Ms. Parker. And so has Mr. Pita.\nCelebrities, by the very nature of the work they do, tend to flit from one hairdresser to the next, who tout their celebrity-friend affiliations like 8-year-olds with cool baseball cards.\nThe reality is, Mr. Barrett said, that \"if you're the right person, you won't be paying anyway.\" The famous actress or singer won't pay; the public relations firm or the production company or the magazine will.\n\"The reality is Sarah Jessica Parker and Julia Roberts get their hair done on a daily basis,\" Mr. Barrett said. \"And the person who will do their hair is determined by the photographer or the art director of the shoot. I hate claiming actors as my own because actors tend to be fickle, and they go, as they should, from one person to another because they don't want to look the same all the time. I've done everybody, but do I claim they are my loyal clients and best friends? No.\"\nHe added: \"Actors struggle and struggle and are penniless, until one day they become famous and rich and no one allows them to pay for a thing. It's kind of hilarious and sad at the same time. When you are making $104 million a film, no one will let you pay for a haircut or a dress.\"\nMr. Barrett charges $400 for a haircut, a price he calls \"bargain basement.\"\nWhenever a stylist is written up prominently in a fashion magazine, he or she will start to see a group of clients Mr. Barrett refers to as \"the searchers,\" a group probably eagerly dialing Mr. Normant (the subject of a glowing profile in November Vogue) and Mr. Pita (scheduled for January Vogue) right about now.\n\"This is the troupe of people who read every beauty story, and they come in and get a haircut, and then they read someone else's name in a magazine and move on,\" Mr. Barrett said. \"They'll go from stylist to stylist, constantly looking for the magic thing. I don't know quite what they are looking for. Because I don't think they ever find the magic. And I don't think what they are looking for can be found in a pair of scissors.\""}, {"text": "THEATER; The Extreme Makeover Of 'Bombay Dreams'\n2004-04-18T05:00:00.000Z\nWHEN ''Bombay Dreams'' opened on the West End in June 2002, The Times of London criticized the musical for its ''trite lyrics,'' ''cardboard characters,'' ''dialogue that would test the patience of Mother Teresa'' and ''the lamest ending in West End history.'' The Guardian called the show's book ''clumsy'' and ''overplotted.'' The Independent said the production was ''crippled by formula and mediocrity.''\nDespite the criticisms -- the reviews, over all, were mixed -- the show has become a popular hit, recouping its costs in 14 months. But when the principal American producers Anita Waxman and Elizabeth Williams signed on to take it to Broadway, where it opens on April 29 at the Broadway Theater, they knew it needed a major overhaul.\nThough it is typical to tweak London imports like ''Mamma Mia!'' for Broadway, the ''Bombay Dreams'' revision is one of the most drastic in recent memory, along with the Broadway flop ''Taboo'' this season. Andrew Lloyd Webber, who produced the London production, has announced that the Broadway version is such an improvement that he will close the London version on June 13 and reopen it next year, in a different London theater, with the Broadway revisions in place.\nIn a series of recent interviews, the creative team discussed the changes they are making for Broadway.\nThe Narrative\nThe Broadway producers hired the book writer Thomas Meehan (who won Tony Awards for ''The Producers,'' ''Hairspray'' and ''Annie'') to help retool the story and to remove a number of Indian cultural references that would be more familiar to British than American audiences. Meera Syal, a well-known British Indian comedian who had no previous experience with musicals, wrote the book for the London production. ''Bombay Dreams'' tells the story of Akaash, an untouchable -- the lowest level of India's caste system -- who rises from the Bombay slums to become a star in Bollywood, the name for India's film industry in Bombay. He falls in love with Priya, an aspiring film director from a higher caste.\nThe creative team agreed that the London production had too many ''side shows,'' as the director, Steven Pimlott, called them. ''It was a bit of a potpourri,'' he said. ''We threw a lot into the melting pot.''\nOne tangent involved a Bollywood impresario operating from jail with the help of an organized crime boss. The script also had a smattering of quirky jokes, like one about ''a woman getting curry stains off her cat.''\nAt certain times during the London production, Mr. Meehan said, ''people around me were laughing and I wasn't.'' Mr. Meehan streamlined the story to focus on the principal characters, especially the hero, Akaash. To bolster Akaash's back-story, his grandmother, Shanti, is now a full-fledged character. The writers thought audiences would identify with Priya and the celebrity actress Rani, a temptress who encourages Akaash to forget his past -- so they beefed up those roles and sharpened Akaash's choice between the two women.\nMr. Meehan also brought out the show's universal themes, like India's stark class distinctions. They provide the same moral force as did the racial divide in ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Meehan said, which made that show ''more than just a lollipop musical.''\nThe Score\n''It's been a long time since there has been a score as good as this,'' said Lord Lloyd-Webber about the work of A. R. Rahman, 38, a leading Bollywood composer who wrote the music. To bring Mr. Rahman's work to the West, Lord Lloyd-Webber commissioned him to write the score for ''Bombay Dreams,'' hiring his own frequent collaborator Don Black (''Sunset Boulevard'') to write the lyrics. For the American version, the producers hired the songwriter David Yazbek (''The Full Monty'') to help rewrite some of the lyrics. As the book changed, several songs were omitted and new ones added. Mr. Yazbek wrote a song in the style of bhangra, a hybrid of Indian folk and pop dance music, which Akaash sings on television, propelling him to fame.\nMr. Black tightened the lyrics in existing songs. ''Songs in Bollywood movies don't really further the plot,'' Mr. Black said. ''I have re-jigged a lot of the lyrics so that they do carry the weight of the story.''\nThe London production uses only 10 musicians, backed by recorded samples. The Broadway version has 19 musicians -- the minimum for the theater, as prescribed by the musicians' union's agreement with the producers. In London, the cast lip-syncs to three of the songs because, Mr. Pimlott said, they did not have time to learn the specialized form of Indian singing required. The Broadway version uses taped singers on only one of the songs -- ''Shakalaka Baby,'' the show's signature tune -- in which the cast is portraying Bollywood actors, who often do not sing their own songs.\nThe Director\nIn London, Mr. Pimlott said, ''there was more satire, more pastiche of a Bollywood movie.'' At times, he noted, the audience didn't know whether to laugh at the characters or to feel for them. Now, he added: ''The tone is clearer. We do, I think, engage and sympathize with and go on a journey with the characters.'' According to Lord Lloyd-Webber: ''We were going through an area that was probably less sensitive than I thought it was going to be. We thought we needed to spend a little more time tipping our hat to certain Bollywood traditions.'' He added, ''We probably tipped our hat too much.''\nWhile British actors tend to be more ironic and reserved, Mr. Pimlott said, American actors are more ''visceral'' and ''passionate.'' The new Broadway cast is no exception. ''That serves us very well,'' he said, ''because I don't think an ironic standing back is terribly useful if you're engaged in the full-blooded, rather gorgeous over-the-topness that Bollywood is.''\nThe Design\nThe show's London home, the Apollo Victoria, had very little fly space or room in the wings for storage, said the show's scenery and costume designer, Mark Thompson. That meant the sets had to be small and horizontal. The Independent criticized the stage's ''meager, empty look.''\nIn New York, the Broadway Theater had enough room to store a helicopter for ''Miss Saigon.'' The main set piece for the slum in which the hero grows up is a tall, anthill-like colony that comes down from the fly space.\nTo bolster the book's new focus on Akaash, Mr. Thompson designed a new series of sets -- Akaash's cramped slum hovel, Rani's apartment (where Akaash lives as her lover) and his palatial mansion -- to reinforce his journey from rags to riches. ''It was the notion of home to home to home,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''It's my way of subliminally controlling the visual thought process.''\nMr. Thompson recently visited Las Vegas, where the fountains outside the Bellagio Hotel, he said, ''made me cry -- they were so fantastic.'' The fountain that splashes the actors during ''Shakalaka Baby'' now has 32 nozzles, as opposed to 13 in London -- to keep up with Broadway's glitz factor.\nThe lighting designer Hugh Vanstone tailored his cues for this production's more direct approach, dimming the lights, for example, during a sorrowful ballad sung by Priya.\nThe Money\nAs far as finances are concerned, the Broadway producers have reason to worry. The London version recouped its capitalization of 4.2 million pounds ($7.6 million), two-thirds of which Lord Lloyd-Webber financed, but the Broadway version costs $14 million. The show has a modest advance of more than $5 million, with group sales adding another $1 or $2 million.\nEarly on, Lord Lloyd-Webber said, a vast majority of the London audience was South Asian. ''Without the Asian community in London, it would have closed within three weeks,'' he said. But the crossover factor kicked in and now, Lord Lloyd-Webber estimated, the audience ''is probably 95 percent white on most evenings.''\nThe Broadway version, however, cannot fall back on a South Asian audience. According to the United States Census Bureau's Web site, New York City has 241,000 residents of Indian descent, while Britain's equivalent site says London has 437,000, plus a larger Bangladeshi and Pakistani presence.\nMs. Williams's main goal, therefore, is to bring in non-South Asian audiences early. She wants them to view the show as a descendant of ''Fiddler on the Roof'' or ''The King and I'' -- musicals with an ethnic milieu that have universal appeal.\nFor example, while posters in London used Bollywood icons -- a villain surrounded by snakes -- in New York they depict more universal scenes, like a smiling Indian couple. They also point to India's exoticism, with the tagline, ''Somewhere you've never been before.''\nBroadway preview audiences have been only 15 percent to 20 percent South Asian, Ms. Williams estimated. On Broadway, Lord Lloyd-Webber observed, the reception has been good so far. One reason is that in New York the ''white audience,'' he said, has been ''wanting it to work, embracing the thought that it is musically from a different culture.''\nOr perhaps, as he has already recognized, it's that the show is better."}, {"text": "Pakistan\n2004-07-15T05:00:00.000Z\n GEOGRAPHY Location: southern Asia.

Agricultural settlements in that area arose by 3000 B.C., and the great cities at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were founded some 500 years later. Indo-European (Aryan) invaders from Central Asia overthrew the ancient civilization around 1500 B.C. and established a new culture that spread throughout Pakistan and northern India. Brahmanism, the religious culture of the early Indo-European invaders, gave rise to Buddhism and Jainism around the sixth century B.C., and evolved into Hinduism in the early centuries A.D. The Indus valley was incorporated into the empire of Alexander the Great, C. 350 B.C., and then into the Mauryan empire of Asoka, which by the third century B.C. controlled all of South Asia except for the southernmost portion of India. Under various rulers the Indus Valley and the areas to its northwest were a great center of Buddhist culture until the beginning of the eighth century, when the area fell to Muslim Arab invaders. Thereafter, Islam was firmly established throughout the region. But Baluchistan and the Northwest Frontier region became culturally allied to the Persian civilization of Iran and Afghanistan, while Sind and the Punjab were more closely akin to the culture of northern India. Northern Pakistan was incorporated into the empire of Mahmud of Gazni in the 11th century, and fell to the Mongols in the 13th century. The Indus River became the boundary between the Mongol Inkhanate of Persia and the sultanate of Delhi. The region was conquered by Timur Leng at the end of the 14th century, and after the fall of the Timurid empire was divided between the kingdoms of Sind and Multan, in southern and central Pakistan, and the sultanate of Delhi, in the Punjab. All of Pakistan and northern India was reunited after 1526, when the conquests of Babur established the Mogul empire. The expansion of British power in India during the 18th century left Pakistan largely untouched; the area was divided among various states, including Sind, the Punjab, Kashmir, and the western reaches of Rajputana. In the first half of the 19th century, British rule extended to the northwest; after the defeat of the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the entire Indus valley came under British rule. Sind and the Punjab were ruled directly by the British, while the native states were ruled as British protectorates. From the beginning of the 20th century, various nationalist movements arose throughout British India. The Muslim League, under the leadership of Mohammad Ali Jinnah after 1916, advocated greater popular political participation, dominion status for India, and a strong Muslim voice in Indian administration. Muslims and Hindus were allied in the Non-Cooperation movement of the 1920's, but the alliance soon broke down and degenerated into communal frictions. With growing power of the Congress party in Hindu areas and Gandhi's civil disobedience movement in the 1930's, Jinnah's Muslim League charted an increasingly separate course and called for the creation of a separate Muslim state in 1940. With the British withdrawal from India in 1947, Hindus in the Muslim majority areas of the Indus valley and in East Bengal fled to Hindu northern India, while Muslims in Hindu areas fled in the opposite direction. These massive population movements were accompanied by widespread violence leading to the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives. Jinnah, the father of modern Pakistan, died in 1948. Pakistan, encompassing Sind, the Punjab, Baluchistan, the Northwest Frontier Territories, part of Jammu and Kashmir, and adjacent areas in the west and East Bengal in the east, was granted dominion status within the British Commonwealth in 1947, becoming an independent republic in 1956. Pakistan joined the Central Treaty Organization and became allied with the West, in contrast to the Soviet-leaning nonalignment of India. In 1958 Gen. Mohammad Ayub Khan seized power in a coup; he was elected president in 1960 and reelected in 1965. Following border clashes with India in 1962, Pakistan entered into friendly relations with China, which also had engaged in border warfare with India. Ayub Khan resigned as president in early 1969 after failing to put down widespread demonstrations in East Pakistan. A new government was formed under Gen. Yahya Khan, and martial law was declared. A parliamentary victory by the East Pakistani Awami League in December 1970 led to civil war and the secession of East Pakistan in 1971 (see &#x201C;Bangladesh&#x201D;). India's intervention on behalf of East Bengal had led to war on a western front with Pakistan. On July 3, 1972, India and Pakistan agreed to a mutual withdrawal of troops and entered into negotiations designed to settle border disputes and other problems. Diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan were resumed in 1976. The elections of 1970 that had precipitated the civil war also brought Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to the presidency. He remained in office until July 1977, when he was overthrown in a military coup led by Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. He was convicted of complicity in a 1974 political murder and hanged in April 1979. Under Pres. Zia, Pakistan moved toward the implementation of Islamic law in parallel with the constitutional law of Pakistan's parliamentary system. In 1986 Bhutto's daughter, Benazir Bhutto, returned to Pakistan from exile in Europe to organize opposition parties against Pres. Zia, leading to widespread rioting. On Aug. 17, 1988, Pres. Zia was killed in an airplane crash. From 1988 to 1999 the position of prime minister alternated between Benazir Bhutto as head of the Pakistan People's Party and Nawaz Sharif as leader of the Muslim League, each accusing the other in turn of tyranny and corruption, amidst endless tension with India over Jammu-Kashmir. The latter struggle lay at the root of the nuclear-test rivalry in May 1998, after which the prime ministers, Vajpayee and Sharif, attempted to lower the political temperature while not appearing to &#x201C;cave in&#x201D; to the other. Sharif's July 1999 agreement in Washington D.C. to withdraw support for Muslims in Kashmir made it appear that he was the one to blink first. Sharif's dismissal of Gen. Musharraf over the army's support of Kashmir rebels led to a military coup and Sharif's trial on corruption charges which ended April 6, 2000 with a guilty verdict and a sentence of life imprisonment. Musharraf pledged a return to civilian rule within three years, but in June 2001 appointed himself president. Musharraf has had to walk a delicate line after the Sept. 11th attacks on the U.S. Backing the U.S. in Afghanistan, he fired his three top generals (and closest advisers) for their ties to the Taliban and arrested leaders of demonstrations against the war in Afghanistan. In Dec. he denounced a murderous Pakistani Muslim attack on the Indian Parliament, even as he continued to deploy troops along the Indian border. By June 2002 India was admitting a sharp drop in the number of incursions and war seemed somewhat less likely. In Oct. Pakistan held its first elections since 1997, with Musharraf's party gaining a plurality and enough other support to elect Mir jamali as prime minister. In the same month both India and pakistan announced troop withdrawals from their borders (though not the Kasmir border). And in May 2003 Musharrif reciprocated India's dicision to restore diplomatic and rail links between the two countries. "}, {"text": "Deserted by Doctors, India's Poor Turn to Quacks\n2004-03-25T05:00:00.000Z\nThe sturdy little public clinic in this poor, sickly village was locked up one recent afternoon, but that is nothing remarkable. Rampant absenteeism among government doctors and nurses is an open secret across India and much of the developing world, and they virtually never get in trouble for not showing up.\n''Sometimes the nurse is here, sometime she's not,'' said Nagji Lal Pandore, a skinny old man in a saffron turban. ''Sometimes she has medicines, sometimes she doesn't. Why take a chance?''\nSo, like many people here, his family has turned to amateur private ''doctors'' who have regular hours and plentiful medications to sell.\nHis daughter-in-law Shanti Bai, 30, went to such a doctor for a fever six months ago. He gave her an injection. The next day, she was dead and her children motherless.\nVillagers blamed the doctor and he fled, but the heartache remains. Mr. Pandore and his wife have broken the news to their 5-year-old grandson, but they are still telling their 3-year-old granddaughter that her mother is away on a trip. ''She cries and cries and asks, 'Where is my mother?' '' he said.\nIndia has a vast primary health care system to serve its billion people, with clinics for every 3,000 to 5,000. But the system is often just a skeleton. New studies have documented the startling, damaging dimensions of chronic absenteeism -- and not just in India.\nResearchers for the World Bank discovered through large national surveys that medical personnel were absent from their public posts 35 to 40 percent of the time in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Uganda, and about a quarter of the time in Peru.\nResearchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Princeton, in a detailed survey of 100 villages here in Rajasthan, in north India, found a no-show rate of 44 percent. When combined with absences for meetings and other work-related reasons, these vital clinics were closed more than half the time.\nAs the United Nations leads a global effort to prevent millions of deaths from AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and a range of childhood illnesses, the fissures in public health systems are emerging as a main obstacle.\nThere is an increasingly heated debate among experts about whether multibillion-dollar infusions of foreign aid or politically sensitive domestic reforms are more central to repairing public health systems.\nWhat is starkly clear in India, home to more poor people than any other country, is that the health system is both starved for resources and desperately in need of reform.\nHere in the villages outside Udaipur, one of India's loveliest tourist destinations, rough-hewn clinics for the rural poor generally have no phones, no vehicles, no running water. Most have no electricity. On a recent day, they lacked syrup-based medicines to treat young children for fevers, vomiting, coughs and respiratory infections. Some nurses said they had run out of the basic pills provided by the government.\nIndia's public health spending is among the lowest in the world -- $4 a person per year, less than 1 percent of its gross domestic product, the United Nations Development Program says. The United States spends about $2,000 a person, or almost 6 percent of gross domestic product.\nBut India's experience also shows that more money alone is not the answer. India sharply increased its health spending in the 1990's, but most went for new hiring and for pay raises to those doctors and nurses who are not showing up for work, according to a World Bank analysis.\nThe dramatic progress in reducing infant mortality in the 1980's slowed in the 1990's, while mortality for children under 5 did not improve at all.\nThe economists coordinating the research here -- Professors Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, co-founders of the Poverty Action Lab at M.I.T., and Angus Deaton at Princeton -- will work with 120 villages and 100 clinics.\nThey will add a nurse to each clinic and monitor attendance through a punch clock or dated digital photographs. They also will try chlorinating contaminated well water, fortifying flour with iron to fight anemia and paying parents to have their children immunized.\nThey will try each strategy in half the villages or clinics, then compare the health of people in villages that got the help with those that did not.\nWhat is here now is not working very well. The survey and accompanying blood tests of villagers found that most people were scrawny and weakened by anemia. Three out of 10 said they had trouble mustering the strength to walk a couple of miles or draw water from a well.\nBut when asked to rate their health on a scale of 1 to 10, most placed themselves in the middle.\n''Their health is awful and their health care even worse,'' said Professor Deaton, an expert on Indian poverty. ''They know they're really poor, but they don't know they're really sick. One of the things that drives some of us to despair is that this isn't a political issue among them.''\nIn Bhomatawara, where the young mother, Shanti Bai, died, villagers say the government nurse is often not at the clinic. On three visits to the village, she was never there.\nSo when Ms. Bai developed a fever, her family turned to the amateur doctor. He gave her a shot and used the same syringe to give her brother-in-law an injection, her husband said. She developed an infection at the site of the injection.\nThe next day she died. The doctor paid the family $930 before he left town. A post-mortem found the underlying cause of her death was severe anemia.\nThe government nurse, Tulsi Meghwal, was located at her home in a town about 12 miles away. She said she had given Ms. Bai iron pills a couple of times, but declined to go to the clinic and show the notations in the register.\nThe only medical training the amateur doctor had was what he had picked up doing menial work for a real doctor, Ms. Meghwal said.\nBecause the public service is so undependable, the survey found, even the poorest turn to private doctors or traditional healers 79 percent of the time, spending 7 percent of their monthly budget on medical care. Four out of 10 private doctors surveyed had no medical degree.\nChronic absenteeism among government doctors and nurses is a hard thing to stop in widely scattered villages. The clinics have no phones, so it is impossible to check on the staff's presence with a simple call. The local village councils are supposed to ensure attendance, but they have no authority over the medical staff, whose salaries, transfers and promotions are controlled at the district and state levels.\nNo one around here could remember any doctor or nurse ever being disciplined for failing to go to work.\nAt the same time, there are powerful forces pulling the medical staff away from the small, backward villages where they are assigned to work. Their desire to see their own children well educated is the strongest. Doctors and nurses interviewed in half a dozen villages sent their children to the city for school. Some commuted from the city; others sent their families to live there.\n''When government doctors are posted here, they want out as quickly as possible,'' said Dr. Mahindra Parmar, who serves in Chhani village and has two sons, 3 and 4. ''Everyone wants to live in the city. I'd like a transfer to Udaipur. If not, I'll have to move my children there. I'm an educated person. What opportunity is there for my children here? If you allow them to mix with local children, they begin to use the local bad words.''\nThe failings of both public and private health care were on display in Dabaycha. The clinic's metal doors were bolted and padlocked one recent afternoon. Some villagers said they did not even know a government nurse was assigned to the village.\n''Sometimes she's here, sometimes she's not,'' said Jivi Mohan, a mother of four who was smoothing a mixture of dung and mud on the walls of her home. ''Laxman is always there.''\nLaxman Damor, 49, is the most popular ''doctor'' in the village, though he never got past the seventh grade. The way to his house lies through wheat and lentil fields and past grazing cows.\n''By and large, whoever comes to me, I give them an injection,'' he said. ''Often, tablets are better, but they want injections. If I don't give them one, they'll go to someone else. I'll lose my customer.''\nHe is also liberal with the intravenous glucose drip, which gives a person sapped by anemia a temporary sugar surge. He charges more than $2 for a drip, in an area where people spend on average $10 a month per person for total household expenses.\nA young laborer, Babu Lal, walked into Mr. Damor's courtyard, complaining of a chest cold. He had hiked several miles. Mr. Damor immediately put him on the examining table. In no time, the needle was out and Mr. Damor stuck him in the hip with an antibiotic.\nThat same afternoon, the public health nurse, Kesara Ahari, returned to the village, saying she had been working in the fields. But she did not unlock the clinic. She said she always works out of her home.\nShe acknowledged she has trouble competing with Mr. Damor. He has medicines that she does not. She does not give the injections and intravenous drips that people want.\nShe brought out the empty tins that should have held her stock of medicines. She was even out of oral rehydration salts, which can cheaply prevent dehydration from diarrhea, a leading killer of children in developing countries. Many of those who come to her for care wind up going to Mr. Damor to buy the pills they need.\nHer register showed entries only intermittently, sometimes with gaps of almost a week.\n''I don't have medicines, so what do I give them?'' she asked, shrugging. ''What is the point of filling the register?''"}, {"text": "Program's Value in Dispute as a Tool to Fight Terrorism\n2004-12-21T05:00:00.000Z\nThe anxious man with silvering hair joined the sea of immigrants pouring into the steel and glass building in Manhattan that houses one of the nation's busiest immigration courts. When a judge called his name on one recent morning, the man, Rafiqul Islam of Bangladesh, steeled himself to hear that his life in America was finally over.\nLast year, Mr. Islam and thousands of other Arab and Muslim men came forward to be fingerprinted, photographed and interviewed by immigration officials hunting for terrorists. Officials ultimately determined that almost none of them had links to terrorism. But Mr. Islam was in this country illegally, and the judge said he had no choice but to deport him.\n\"You must leave the United States no later than Feb. 25,\" the judge, Gabriel Videla, told Mr. Islam, 63. \"Good luck, sir.\"\nMr. Islam is one of nearly 13,000 illegal immigrants from Arab and Muslim countries who were placed in deportation proceedings after voluntarily participating last year in the nation's largest effort to register immigrants in decades. The counterterrorism program, created after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was hailed as a success by Justice Department officials, who said they had arrested suspected terrorists and gathered vital information about more than 83,000 immigrants from countries considered breeding grounds for terrorism.\nBut though the program made the government aware of thousands of illegal immigrants like Mr. Islam, officials now say there is little evidence to suggest that it succeeded in capturing suspected terrorists. Homeland Security officials, who said that six men linked to terrorism were arrested as a result of the call-in program, have been challenged by the Sept. 11 commission, which reported this year that it had found little evidence to support that claim.\nThe commission said two of the six men were captured through other means. It could not determine how the remaining suspects were arrested and concluded that the counterterrorism benefits of the program were \"unclear.\"\nThe call-in program required male noncitizens from 25 mostly Arab and Muslim countries to register with immigration authorities between November 2002 and April 2003. None of the Arab and Muslim men who came forward has been charged with crimes related to terrorism.\nHomeland Security officials, who inherited the program from the Justice Department, suspended it 12 months ago, saying resources could be better used on other counterterrorism initiatives. They declined to comment on the commission's findings. But the impact of the program continues to be felt across the country as some illegal immigrants who registered with the authorities receive deportation orders, while others wage legal battles to remain in the United States.\nIn the Midwood section of Brooklyn, the Muslim owners of more than 30 businesses have already shuttered their stores and left the country, community advocates say. In Columbia, Md., Nasir Qureshi, a Pakistani jeweler, is scrambling to legalize his status by Dec. 31, the deadline set by a local immigration judge, so that he does not have to uproot his wife and three young children. In Ann Arbor, Mich., two taxi drivers from Morocco who had dreamed of finding wives and well-paying jobs have been ordered to return home by Feb. 14.\nAnd in Elmhurst, Queens, Mr. Islam, an engineer and artisan, is preparing to pack his bags after eight years in the United States.\nFor his 22-year-old daughter, Nishat, who plans to stay behind, the news of his coming departure was a second blow. Last year, her husband was deported after participating in the program.\nSome officials say this sweeping roundup of illegal immigrants diverted resources from more pressing counterterrorism needs, strained relations with some Arab and Muslim nations and alienated immigrants who might otherwise have been willing to help the government hunt for terror cells in this country. Because the immigration service has long lacked adequate resources to crack down on the millions of illegal immigrants living here, some advocacy groups have accused officials of practicing selective enforcement by focusing on those from Arab and Muslim nations.\nJames W. Ziglar, who was commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service before it was subsumed into the Department of Homeland Security, said he and members of his staff had raised doubts about the benefits of the special registration program when Justice Department officials first proposed it. He said he had questioned devoting significant resources to the initiative because he believed it unlikely that terrorists would voluntarily submit to intensive scrutiny.\n\"The question was, 'What were we going to get for all of this?\"' said Mr. Ziglar, whose employees at the I.N.S. were responsible for registering the Arab and Muslim immigrants. \"The people who could be identified as terrorists weren't going to show up. This project was a huge exercise and caused us to use resources in the field that could have been much better deployed.\"\n\"As expected, we got nothing out of it,\" said Mr. Ziglar, who had a cool relationship with his boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft, before leaving government service in 2002. \"To my knowledge, not one actual terrorist was identified. But what we did get was a lot of bad publicity, litigation and disruption in our relationships with immigrant communities and countries that we needed help from in the war on terror.\"\nKris Kobach, the architect of the program at the Justice Department, disputes that assessment, saying the program was invaluable. He said it had provided the government with fingerprints, photographs, banking and credit card records about Arab and Muslim immigrants that were previously unavailable.\nThe mass registrations were necessary, Mr. Kobach said, because there was no systematic way to track immigrants once they entered the country, a fault that became evident when it was found that some Sept. 11 hijackers had overstayed their visas. And he dismissed concerns about the impact of the program on immigrants, noting that only those living here illegally were subject to deportation.\nIn the 1940's and 1950's, with mounting fears of war and Soviet infiltration, the government also conducted mass registrations of immigrants, eventually involving more than two million. Mr. Kobach said officials tried to walk a fine line with the special registration program, striving to protect national security while maintaining the nation's commitment to immigrants.\n\"No one was charged with terrorism crimes, but that argument completely misses the point,\" said Mr. Kobach, who was an adviser to Mr. Ashcroft and is now a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.\n\"We gained a lot of information and we have to remember the disruptive value: this forced terror cells in the United States to modify their behavior,\" said Mr. Kobach, who disputes the Sept. 11 commission's conclusions. \"We were able to identify terrorists who came in to register. And for those terrorists who didn't come in, we now have a legal basis for arrest if we encounter them.\"\nThe program, which made failure to register a misdemeanor and grounds for deportation, has given the authorities the legal basis to arrest and deport suspected terrorists, even those who are in the United States legally.\nIn its report, the Sept. 11 commission noted that one detainee from Al Qaeda reported that government efforts to review immigration files and deport Muslim immigrants had made Qaeda operations more difficult. The commission said that if the detainee was credible, the program might have had a deterrent effect, but that it was difficult to measure the success of operations that include deterrence as a goal.\nThe commission also made it clear that concerns about the program extended beyond the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Some State Department officials feared that the program would offend Arab and Muslim nations that were cooperating with the United States in the global campaign against terrorism. Robert S. Mueller III, director of the F.B.I., echoed those concerns in testimony before the commission, saying the program came at a cost to American relations with important allies.\nIn a notice published in the Federal Register last year, Department of Homeland Security officials said the initiative was not cost-effective. But they say it did provide some important benefits.\nThey say they still use information collected from the registrants to track immigrants who raise security concerns. They have initiated deportation proceedings against 192 immigrants who failed to register and charged a handful of them with misdemeanor crimes.\n\"It was the right tool back then,\" said Victor X. Cerda, the acting director of detention and deportation operations at the Department of Homeland Security. \"But we've moved forward to start looking in a more targeted manner now. It's potentially more efficient and more effective using our resources in a more targeted manner.\"\nSome aspects of the original registration program remain. Immigrants from the 25 countries are still required to register with immigration officials when they enter and leave the country. Officials had said this practice would be eliminated when fingerprinting and photographing of foreign visitors at airports became routine, but now say they have kept the process because the interviews required of registrants are more extensive than those required of most foreign visitors.\nBut it is the call-in program that has many immigrant neighborhoods churning. After the program was announced in 2002, hundreds of illegal immigrants from Arab and Muslim nations fled to Canada. Others burrowed more deeply underground.\nOf the 192 men placed in deportation proceedings for failing to register, 35 have already left the country. Officials say they do not know how many of the roughly 13,000 illegal immigrants who registered have been deported so far. But in many cities, Arab and Muslim immigrants are quietly vanishing one by one.\nIn Pittsburgh, Abdel Qader Abu-Snaineh, a 22-year-old student from Jordan who lived in the United States legally and graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science from La Roche College in Pittsburgh, was sent home in October because he forgot to register. In Brooklyn, Moustafa Fahmy, 52, who washed cars for a living, went back to Egypt in October after acknowledging that he was living illegally in the United States when he registered last year.\nIn Queens, Mr. Islam spends sleepless nights, wondering how his daughter and two grandchildren will cope without him. He and his daughter traveled to this country on tourist visas in 1996 and stayed on after they expired, hoping to build lives here. Ever since his son-in-law, who managed a perfume store, was deported in October 2003, Mr. Islam has tried to support his family by selling ornate handmade placards and wooden figurines.\nImmigration officials have not tried to systematically deport the relatives of the Arab and Muslim men who registered with the government. So for now, Mr. Islam's daughter plans to remain here. But since her husband was deported, she has struggled to find work and often cannot afford food or medicine for her young children.\n\"In our country, we think America is the dream country,\" she said bitterly. \"But our dreams are broken. There are no dreams come true here.\"\nMr. Islam acknowledges that he was living in the United States illegally and does not have grounds to legalize his status. He will not hide, he says, or try to evade the deportation order. But he still cannot understand why the government would force him to leave when he willingly responded to its call for help in the hunt for terrorists.\n\"We know that if we stay in this country we should obey the rules,\" Mr. Islam said. \"That's why we went to register. I wasn't worried. I knew I hadn't done anything bad. We came here just to work and to prosper.\""}, {"text": "CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE\n2004-02-06T05:00:00.000Z\nA selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.\nOpera\n''LES ARTS FLORISSANTS,'' ''LA DESCENTE D'ORPH\u00c9E AUX ENFERS.'' The superb French period ensemble Les Arts Florissants, always a welcome guest, is celebrating its 25th anniversary. Here it also commemorates the 300th anniversary of the death of Marc-Antoine Charpentier with semistaged performances of two of his operas, including the group's namesake. William Christie conducts, and Vincent Boussard directs the staging. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets, $45 (James R. Oestreich).\n''BORIS GODUNOV.'' August Everding's grandly realistic 1974 production of Mussorgsky's masterpiece has returned to the Met after a six-year absence. On opening night most attention was focused on the acclaimed Russian-born conductor Semyon Bychkov, making his Met debut, and the veteran bass James Morris, singing his first Met performances of the title role. The overall performance seemed about one rehearsal shy of being confident. Though Mr. Bychkov conducted with sure dramatic pacing and a keen ear for color, there were coordination problems between the choristers, who sounded tired, and the orchestra musicians, who were prone to slip-ups. Mr. Morris's voice sometimes seemed leathery, but he still brought vocal power, tragic grandeur and dramatic charisma to his portrayal of the guilt-ridden czar. Among the several excellent Russian singers in the cast the bass Vladimir Matorin had a standout Met debut as the wizened monk Pimen. Expect the performance to gain its footing as the run continues. Tonight at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $33 to $195 (Anthony Tommasini).\n''THE QUEEN OF SPADES.'' Based on a Pushkin story, written in less than two months, Tchaikovsky's penultimate opera is viewed as overly melodramatic by some, while others agree with the composer's own assessment, ''Either I am horribly mistaken or the opera is a masterpiece.'' The Met's production returns this weekend with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo reprising his success as Ghermann, the star-crossed lover pining after a woman above him in station (Lisa, sung by Katarina Dalayman), and Felicity Palmer as the aged Countess, who holds an infallible secret to winning at cards and whom Ghermann frightens to death trying to extract it. Vladimir Jurowksi, the music director at Glyndebourne, conducts. Tomorrow night at 8:15, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $50 to $250 (Anne Midgette).\n''RIGOLETTO.'' In very familiar music, it can be hard for singers to let themselves go, and when they don't, the result is the kind of prosaic, indifferent evening offered by this elderly Metropolitan Opera production of ''Rigoletto.'' Andrea Rost, as a petite Gilda, has an attractive lower voice but a fluttery vibrato that sometimes carries her right off the pitch; Juan Pons, an elephantine Rigoletto, blustered with a leathery voice; and even the commendable Frank Lopardo was audibly, if musically, marshaling his resources to get through the role of the Duke. Julian Konstantinov sings Sparafucile, and Marina Domashenko is a bombshell Maddalena. Marco Armiliato conducts. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Sold out, but returns may be available at the box office (Midgette).\n''DIE SCHWARZE SPINNE.'' A Gothic tale originally composed as a radio opera, ''The Black Widow,'' as its American premiere is billed, was the first opera by the Swiss composer Heinrich Sutermeister, a student of Carl Orff and proponent of a tonality that ensured that the bulk of his work would fall into oblivion in the later years of the 20th century. This weekend the Gotham Chamber Opera (formerly the Henry Street Chamber Opera) is giving the work its American premiere, led by its founder and conductor, Neal Goren. In what sounds like a good casting move, the fine mezzo-soprano Beth Clayton will sing the title figure, a woman who kisses the devil to help save her village from the plague, is condemned by her fellow citizens when they find out what she's done and turns into a spider before resuming her normal shape and dying -- nice operatic stuff. Tonight at 8, Harry de Jur Playhouse, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200. Tickets: $30 to $50; gala tickets (including a post-performance party), $100 (Midgette).\nClassical Music\nAMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. There have been plenty of Vienna-themed programs recently, but none with the historical perspective promised by Leon Botstein and his orchestra. Titled ''Jews and Vienna, City of Music,'' this concert is linked to the opening of an exhibition at the Yeshiva University Museum. Both seek to place the Jewish contributions to Vienna's famed musical life in the context of the broader political and cultural history. In keeping with the orchestra's mission, Mr. Botstein will avoid big hits, offering instead works by Salomon Sulzer, Anton Rubinstein, Karl Goldmark, Franz Schreker and Alexander Zemlinsky. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $35 and $50 (Jeremy Eichler).\nBARGEMUSIC. With its view of the Manhattan skyline and its live, intimate acoustics, this barge floating gently on the East River is one of the finest places in the city to hear chamber music. This weekend Mark Kaplan, a violinist, plays Bach's solo works for his instrument. He began last night with the Sonatas Nos. 1 and 3 and the Partita No. 1, which he repeats tomorrow. Tonight and Sunday, he plays the Partitas Nos. 2 and 3 and the Sonata No. 2. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, and Sunday afternoon at 4. Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $20 (Oestreich).\nCHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER. Fine classical music played by fine classical artists is exactly what the Chamber Music Society's audience likes best. So when Mendelssohn is the focus, and the likable star violinist Gil Shaham is on the program, it's no surprise that tickets are scarce. This program ranges from juvenilia -- the F minor Piano Quartet -- through to the Op. 66 piano trio written near the end of the composer's brief life, but the highlight for many will be another early(ish) work, the wonderful Octet. The pianist Andr\u00e9-Michel Schub, the violist Paul Neubauer and the cellist Fred Sherry are among the other participants. Sunday afternoon at 5, Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875-5788. Sold out; returns may be available at the box office (Midgette).\nCORIGLIANO STRING QUARTET. In one of Lincoln Center's Sunday morning concerts, this vibrant young ensemble performs Mendelssohn's Quartet in D (Op. 44, No. 1) as well as a work by its namesake, John Corigliano, ''A Black November Turkey,'' and a quartet by one of Mr. Corigliano's students, Jefferson Friedman. Sunday at 11 a.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $18 (Allan Kozinn).\nPASCAL GALLOIS. For a number of years this brilliant French bassoonist has been a core member of France's Ensemble Intercontemporain, the internationally acclaimed contemporary music group. He is considered a leading exponent of advanced techniques on the bassoon, including circular breathing, in which a wind player inhales while continuing to blow through the bassoon and keep the sound sustained. Luciano Berio's Sequenza XII, written for Mr. Gallois, involves 15 minutes of circular breathing. He will play this work along with works by Elliott Carter, Gyorgy Kurtag, Philippe Schoeller and Philippe F\u00e9nelon. Tomorrow night at 8, Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $20 (Tommasini).\nMUSIC FROM JAPAN FESTIVAL. Contemporary Japanese music is seldom heard in New York, so this two-concert festival will no doubt offer something fresh. Tomorrow night's concert features the music of the prominent Japanese composer Ichiro Nodaira, including three American premieres as well as the world premiere of Mr. Nodaira's Piano Quartet, with the composer at the piano. On Sunday afternoon the vocal ensemble Ma Rewrew will be joined by the performer Oki, who plays a guitarlike instrument called the tonkori, for a program devoted to the music of the Ainu, an indigenous ethnic group in the north of Japan. Tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 2 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330. Mr. Nodaira will lecture on his music tomorrow night at 7, and Sunday's performance will be followed by a symposium at 4. Tickets: $30 for all events; $18 one concert; $5 for symposium only (Eichler).\nOLGA NEUWIRTH. This installment of the Miller Theater's important Composer Portraits series looks at the work of Olga Neuwirth, an Austrian composer who was born in 1968. She is a prolific composer whose music is influenced by contemporary art and film, and often includes montages, electronic components and startling contrasts. The program, to be played by the Ensemble Sospeso with Rand Steiger conducting and Pascal Gallois as the bassoon soloist, includes the American premieres of ''Torsion: Transparent Variation,'' which was composed for Mr. Gallois, and ''Verfremdung/Entfremdung,'' as well as ''Quasare/Pulsar'' and ''. . . ad auras . . . in memoriam H.'' Tonight at 8, Miller Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $20 (Kozinn).\nNEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. Haydn's wonderful oratorio ''The Creation'' -- with its famous progression from chaos, in C minor, to light, in C major -- is something you might have expected more from the orchestra's last music director, Kurt Masur, than from its present one, Lorin Maazel. But here Mr. Maazel presents the work in all its glory (and in German, as ''Die Sch\u00f6pfung''), with the New York Choral Artists and with Barbara Bonney, Bruce Ford and Thomas Quasthoff as vocal soloists. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $27 to $94 (Oestreich).\nNEW YORK COLLEGIUM. The work has been slow, but an interesting byproduct of the early music world's research has been the discovery of female composers going back to Baroque times (and, in the case of Hildegard of Bingen, much earlier than that). Cynthia Roberts, a violinist, is directing this fine period instrument ensemble in a concert of works by Elisabeth-Claude Jacquet de la Guerre, a French composer and harpsichordist who lived from 1665 to 1729. Ms. Roberts will perform some of Jacquet de la Guerre's violin works, which the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians describes as innovative, as well as excerpts from an opera, ''Cephale et Procris,'' and a cantata, ''Samson.'' The vocal soloists are Melissa Fogarty, soprano, and Marc Molomot, tenor. Tonight at 8, New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, (212) 717-9246. Tickets: $27 to $47; $15 for students (Kozinn).\nORPHEUS. The violinist Sarah Chang is the soloist with this conductorless chamber orchestra in Bruch's Violin Concerto in G minor. The program also includes several works that draw on folk influences of various kinds, including Kodaly's ''Dances of Galanta,'' Dvorak's ''Czech Suite'' and the world premiere of Paul Chihara's ''Afternoon on the Perfume River.'' Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $25 to $84 (Kozinn).\nSHANGHAI QUARTET. This fine and usually adventuresome group reverts to standard practice this season, playing what, it seems, every quartet must play periodically nowadays: all 16 string quartets of Beethoven. The twist is that the Shanghai is performing a similar series not only in Japan but also in China, where, it says, no complete survey of the quartets has ever been presented. The journey continues here with the Quartets Nos. 5, 8 and 10. Tomorrow night at 7:30, City University of New York Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, (212) 817-8215. Free; a $10 reservation guarantees a seat (Oestreich).\nFREDERICA VON STADE. This beloved mezzo-soprano gives her only New York recital this season tonight at, of all places, the cavernous Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in the second of the museum's ''Great Voices in Dendur'' series. A song recital is the most intimate of art forms, and it's hard to imagine hearing Copland's rueful setting of Emily Dickinson's poem ''Why do they shut me out of Heaven?'' in such a highly reverberant space. Still, audiences can sit close to the artist in the temple, and Ms. von Stade knows how to draw listeners in. The program includes songs by Strauss, Honegger, Bernstein, Ives, Hundley, Heggie and others. The veteran pianist Martin Katz will accompany Ms. von Stade. Tonight at 8, Temple of Dendur, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $55 (Tommasini).\nYSAYE QUARTET. This Paris-based string quartet has built a solid reputation in Europe but is still little known in the United States. Its program includes Beethoven's ''Serioso'' Quartet (Op. 95) and two French works, the well-loved Ravel quartet and a seldom-heard work by the post-Wagnerian composer Alb\u00e9ric Magnard. Tonight at 7:30, Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $40 (Eichler).\nPINCHAS ZUKERMAN. The veteran violinist, known for his big-toned expressive playing, offers a well-balanced program for his Carnegie recital. Familiar sonatas by Mozart, Franck and Schumann will be complemented with two rarities by Fuchs, a more recent work by Takemitsu and a New York premiere by Marc Neikrug, ''Petrus.'' Mr. Neikrug accompanies at the piano. Tonight at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $25 to $84 (Eichler).\nDance\nBLACK DANCE: TRADITION AND TRANSFORMATION. This dance component of the ''Salon 651'' festival of dance, music and film features performances by three companies, from three African countries, in celebration of the 15th anniversary of the Brooklyn-based 651 ARTS producing organization, which focuses on work by black artists. The dance companies -- Sello Pesa from South Africa, Compagnie Rary from Madagascar and Compagnie Kongo Ba T\u00e8ria from Burkina Faso -- merge traditional and contemporary dance. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Brooklyn (718) 636-4181, extension 2229. Tickets: $20 to $40 (Jennifer Dunning).\nBROOKLYN ARTS EXCHANGE: FIRST WEEKEND. Modern dance by Rachel Thorne Germond, Jesse Phillips Fein and Rebecca Lazier will explore themes including partnerships, the confines of flesh and jargon, respectively, in this monthly program of dance and discussion.
